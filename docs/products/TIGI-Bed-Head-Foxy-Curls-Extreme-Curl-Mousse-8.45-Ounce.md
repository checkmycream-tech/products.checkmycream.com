      <li>and it gave her more curls</li>
      <li>I love this hair product.</li>
      <li>I got it cause hair stylist said would be great for my natural curly hair...</li>
      <li>Any residual crunchiness is easily smoothed away without ruining the curl or creating frizziness.  </li>
      <li>This may be for curly hair but not for fine curly hair.  </li>
      <li>and I can make it look super cute.</li>
      <li>My sister will be happy to get an extra bottle!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST mousse for adding volume and body to my hair without making it feel stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Fortunately enough, I&#x27;ve been able to find it on Amizon for the lowest price!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this mousse after my sister raved about it.  </li>
      <li>I was excited after reading some of the reviews that this may work for my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It is the first product that I can truly depend on to make the curl more uniform.</li>
      <li>I just got a perm and love to wear my hair really curly.  </li>
      <li>When I ask for a good curl shaping mousse, yes I do want something that defines them properly but not at the expense of feeling like there is mush in my hair.     </li>
      <li>this mouse doesn&#x27;t great extreme curls with my curls.</li>
      <li>First of all the smell was horrid!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I prefer when the mousse makes my hair defined but more natural...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be able to get my natural hair to curl with this mousse too.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fun to work with.  </li>
      <li>am out of it right now, waiting for it to come to my door.</li>
      <li>Just push the button until the product starts coming out, and release the button right away.</li>
      <li>Right now my hair is going through a transition.</li>
      <li>I combine this with the Pantene BB Creme for hair and the TIGI Bed Head Foxy Curls Contour Cream and my hair has barely any frizz and is more uniform than ever.</li>
      <li>I used about a small walnut size on shoulder length and got great</li>
      <li>Prior to reading that, I bought this product hoping it would magically revive my curls to no avail.</li>
      <li>She said it helped enhance her curls and actually give her more spiral curls instead of waves</li>
      <li>I have very curly(ringlet)hair and this product keeps the frizz away and my girl defined!I am definetly recommending it!</li>
      <li>I guess the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because sure, it CURLS the hair -</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not exactly enchanted with the smell</li>
      <li>It was sticky  when I first put 1 golf ball size amount on my hair</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>$4.00 Fructis Curl Mousse Extra Strong does an amazing job (got it out of desperation) - curls are not frizzy, yet soft to touch and defined - looks so natural, as opposed to $20+ professional product.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t notice it at all really.</li>
      <li>The mouse is very \\&quot;weighty\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I read that means my hair has gotten too much heat.</li>
      <li>The perfect mousse for my crazy curly hair.</li>
      <li>You will have to take a shower if you want to change your style, but it really holds the curls all day  *</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that can go straight or curly.</li>
      <li>It really does keep your ends from splitting while keeping your curls.</li>
      <li>I have straight, layered hair</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair very crunchy</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to hold a curl.</li>
      <li>I did some research online because I have spaghetti straight hair with NO body, NO curl, no nothing.  </li>
      <li>I have very course hair and this product still works on it.</li>
      <li>I bought this whole line for my wife.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t keep it straight on humid summer days, so I choose to go curly.</li>
      <li>I have not gotten enough uses of this particular product (Curl Mousse) to rate it accurately.</li>
      <li>Other than the tracking and the broken top its a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I used Foxy Curls today and found it fantastic - a huge load of curly hair which was soft and shiny which got quite a few compliments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess the clearence they were having must have been because they weren&#x27;t carrying that particular type of Bed Head product any longer...figures.</li>
      <li>But in this case she should have chosen either/or, not both, of these particular products.  </li>
      <li>It very clearly is for one type of hair, which I believe is really wavy/curly hair.  </li>
      <li>First product I&#x27;ve used that tames my curls so that I enjoy wearing my hair down.</li>
      <li>I finally found it at a reasonable price!!</li>
      <li>This mousse has an amazing smell but it makes my hair hard.</li>
      <li>It smells bad, all the tigi products smell wonderful.  </li>
      <li>no hard.</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t be ringlets any more, but they won&#x27;t be stiff.</li>
      <li>I usually love Bed Head products but this leaves my hair stiff and brittle.  </li>
      <li>Not fluffy, or soft defined curls, but more like a mess of wires.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and with a slight kink.  </li>
      <li>only need a small amount and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>It was very sticky and made my hair crunchy and gross.  </li>
      <li>but then it was relatively soft.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I have found so far that really works well with my naturally curly</li>
      <li>This mousse is nice because it didn&#x27;t give me the wet look after I dried my hair with a diffuser.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The perfect mousse for my crazy curly hair. It Leaves my hairs shiny with great curls. It Smells delicious too.</li>
    <li> This stuff drys your hair out to the point of breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product.I have very curly(ringlet)hair and this product keeps the frizz away and my girl defined!I am definetly recommending it!</li>
    <li> I have freezy, curly hair &amp; I keep trying out different products because I keep thinking, maybe this is the one for my type of hair. I don&#x27;t think I will ever find \\&quot;the one\\&quot;. This product gives my curl an enhancement to my frizziness. The only thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, crunchy, wet looking but it won&#x27;t hold my curl. I have to use a flexible hold hair spray but I am still not satisfied w/the type of curl it gives me, it just looks so freezy &amp; dry. Disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> The whole line of Foxy Curls products is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I bought some last year at the local Wal*Mart to try it out. All the Foxy Curls products were on clearence. I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it made my hair look and feel!!! Plus, it smells wonderful! Then, as luck would have it, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it at any store since!! I guess the clearence they were having must have been because they weren&#x27;t carrying that particular type of Bed Head product any longer...figures. Fortunately enough, I&#x27;ve been able to find it on Amizon for the lowest price!! Thanks!! Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I can&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that can go straight or curly. But I can&#x27;t keep it straight on humid summer days, so I choose to go curly. This is the only product that makes uniform ringlet curls all over my head. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried every other product under the sun. Everything else leaves me with flat hair at the crown or an all-over frizzy mess. True, it can get a little crunchy and wet-looking. Key is to use the smallest about possible.  Just push the button until the product starts coming out, and release the button right away. It will continue to foam and expand in your hand. You can eliminate any crunchiness once it dries by running your fingers through your hair. It will loosen the curls without frizzing it up. They won&#x27;t be ringlets any more, but they won&#x27;t be stiff. The odor is a little strong, but I didn&#x27;t smell it throughout the day until my hair got wet again.</li>
    <li> Having tried countless gels, creams, and mousses for my curly hair, this is THE product I swear by.  My curls are soft, thick, and shiny, not stringy, flat, or wet-looking.  Any residual crunchiness is easily smoothed away without ruining the curl or creating frizziness.  My hair tends to lie flat at the crown.  With this product I&#x27;m able to create perfect lift at the crown when I style it, and it doesn&#x27;t flatten out over the course of the day.    No surprise another reviewer had matted, crunchy hair when she combined this product with Foxy Curls Contour Cream.  Overkill!  I am a big fan of combining hair products - for example, a leave-in conditioner and a curl cream.  But in this case she should have chosen either/or, not both, of these particular products.  A combination of foundation, bronzer and blush creates a beautiful complexion.  Applying foundation over foundation over foundation does not.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I did some research online because I have spaghetti straight hair with NO body, NO curl, no nothing.  This mousse along with blow drying and curling iron puts just enough curl in my hair so it doesn&#x27;t look so limp and it also puts volume and body in my hair.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Looks like they finally posted the correct picture for this item. Before it showed a picture of their shampoo. Love this mousse &amp; I just ordered two bottles now that I know what I&#x27;m ordering will be correct :) Highly recommend for thick, curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love the way my hair curls after using this product!</li>
    <li> This mousse has an amazing smell but it makes my hair hard. I prefer when the mousse makes my hair defined but more natural... no hard.</li>
    <li> I bought this whole line for my wife. She said the tracking information never showed up so she had no idea where the product was. Plus when it came in the lid had popped off since it wasn&#x27;t taped down and the nozzle had broken off. She said its still usable just a bit disappointing to buy something then have it broken before it gets to you. She said it helped enhance her curls and actually give her more spiral curls instead of waves but it made her curls a little on the crunchy side. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like skittles like the rest of the products in this line do. It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell, just not overly pleasant. She also said the texture of the mousse is different from the ones she has used before, it felt softer and less foamy. It didn&#x27;t make her curls as crunchy as her other mousse and it gave her more curls and the smell is masked by all the other products so you don&#x27;t notice it at all really. Other than the tracking and the broken top its a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found so far that really works well with my naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that crunchy dry look.&lt;br /&gt;I seem to find it cheaper online verses buying it in a store.&lt;br /&gt;I am out of it right now, waiting for it to come to my door. Should arrive today. YAAA!!!!!</li>
    <li> I also have naturally curly but extremely frizzy hair. I got this product thinking that other TIGI stuff seems pretty decent. But ...    1. First of all the smell was horrid! It was like having cherry flavored cough medicine in my hair. Could they not have just left it neutral.    2. The mouse is very \\&quot;weighty\\&quot;. When I ask for a good curl shaping mousse, yes I do want something that defines them properly but not at the expense of feeling like there is mush in my hair.     3. Leaves a very artificial, brittle texture in your hair - makes department store brands like Pantene and Garnier look good in comparison. Some of the other brans out there at least give your hair a softer feel even after having applied the mousse.     4. I completely agree with the other reviewer when she said she had difficulty cleaning her hair the next day because it just sticks too the hair and makes them really hard to detangle.     I am thoroughly disappointed. I guess the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because sure, it CURLS the hair - but at too great an expense in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and with a slight kink.  I used Foxy Curls today and found it fantastic - a huge load of curly hair which was soft and shiny which got quite a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read a few unfavourable reviews citing stiff or crunchy finish and wonder just how much of this stuff people are using.  I used about a small walnut size on shoulder length and got great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly enchanted with the smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t take much to hold a curl.</li>
    <li> Hair curls and stays that way. only need a small amount and it smells nice. I have very course hair and this product still works on it.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. My curly hair looks great now that I&#x27;m using it. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mousse for adding volume and body to my hair without making it feel stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it and found that her hair looked amazingly thicker and was more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased w/ my purchase!</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely great, holds my hair really nicely, i recommend that people use a leave in conditioner with it, if not you&#x27;re hair will frizz; thanks!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s expensive for a basic mousse.  It smells bad, all the tigi products smell wonderful.  This doesn&#x27;t not.  I thought I got a bad bottle and actually went to an Ulta store to compare the smell.  Salesperson said they all smell like that.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this mousse after my sister raved about it.  I didn&#x27;t even read the reviews, and I wish I would have.  It very clearly is for one type of hair, which I believe is really wavy/curly hair.  I have mildly wavy hair which I usually straighten but have been trying to do that less.  This product though was literally like putting foamy glue in my hair.  It was very sticky and made my hair crunchy and gross.  I thought I used too much the first time and tried again with less but had the same result.  My sister will be happy to get an extra bottle!</li>
    <li> This may be for curly hair but not for fine curly hair.  It was to heavy and sticky for me.  I also have bleached highlights and it really seemed to dry them out.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, but after using it four times in varying amounts from a bit to a bunch I must say it is very disappointing.  I usually love Bed Head products but this leaves my hair stiff and brittle.  The product does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> I was excited after reading some of the reviews that this may work for my curly hair.  It leaves my hair very crunchy and after I wash it out my hair is dry.  I do not like this product at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair. Smells good.Most of their products work great this mouse doesn&#x27;t great extreme curls with my curls.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I have frizzy, thick, unruly hair and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to tame it.</li>
    <li> I have short spikey hair style and this product helps hold the sytle I like. It does dry quite firm.</li>
    <li> Works! First product I&#x27;ve used that tames my curls so that I enjoy wearing my hair down.</li>
    <li> * The Foxy Curls worked well for my hair  * It was sticky  when I first put 1 golf ball size amount on my hair but then it was relatively soft.  * You will have to take a shower if you want to change your style, but it really holds the curls all day  * If you want to try something less costly, try Garnier Fructis Style Curl Construct Mousse, 6.80-Ounce</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all! I got it cause hair stylist said would be great for my natural curly hair...she was wrong!! Left my hair frizzy brittle and just felt it drug down my curls not enhance them!! I&#x27;m going back to the cheaper stuff does better on,my thick curly hair then this did! Total waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair.  This is the only product that works for me!</li>
    <li> This works okay. Right now my hair is going through a transition. I get my hair blow dried professionally at the dominican hair salons. Now portions of my hair will not hold a curl. My hair looks as if I have a relaxer in it, when it is totally virgin hair. I read that means my hair has gotten too much heat. Prior to reading that, I bought this product hoping it would magically revive my curls to no avail. I guess if my hair were curly it would work great with managing the curls. I recommend the Ego Boost Leave In Conditioner to maintain curls, because you are conditioning while maintaining tamed looking curls. When my hair was curly I used it religiously.  It really does keep your ends from splitting while keeping your curls. I have not gotten enough uses of this particular product (Curl Mousse) to rate it accurately.</li>
    <li> This mousse works insanely good for my hair that is wavy/curly  but mostly curly. It is the first product that I can truly depend on to make the curl more uniform. I combine this with the Pantene BB Creme for hair and the TIGI Bed Head Foxy Curls Contour Cream and my hair has barely any frizz and is more uniform than ever. This is my second time buying this product and I will definitely continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Not fluffy, or soft defined curls, but more like a mess of wires.  Gross!  My boyfriend even asked me what happened to my hair, where&#x27;d it go?!  A $4.00 Fructis Curl Mousse Extra Strong does an amazing job (got it out of desperation) - curls are not frizzy, yet soft to touch and defined - looks so natural, as opposed to $20+ professional product.  Will not ever buy anything like this again.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected for this curly girl! Rock the curls</li>
    <li> This smells like wonderful sweet lemon candy so it&#x27;s fun to work with.  I have straight, layered hair and I can make it look super cute.</li>
    <li> I have never had curls like this before. exactly what I was looking for. I will be ordering this for life</li>
    <li> I expect this to do more give the great reviews but I was not happy with the results at all....stringy yucky waves.</li>
    <li> awesome product!! I will continue to buy this online! I have gone so many places looking for this! I finally found it at a reasonable price!! thank u!!</li>
    <li> I just got a perm and love to wear my hair really curly.  This mousse is nice because it didn&#x27;t give me the wet look after I dried my hair with a diffuser.  It gave me great curls and I know it&#x27;s going to work great too as my perm grows out. I&#x27;ll be able to get my natural hair to curl with this mousse too.</li>
