### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and it is the best.  </li>
      <li>Herbatint is odorless and gives me a beautiful hair color.  </li>
      <li>Happy coloring</li>
      <li>and the color looked great.  </li>
      <li>I do like the results, and I&#x27;m happy,</li>
      <li>it comes out a beautiful honey color which is nice for summer.  </li>
      <li>Again, I got great gray coverage and beautiful color, but still more breakage than I get at the salon.  </li>
      <li>There was a great deal more breakage than I had ever experienced with my colorist at the salon.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy to have found Herbatint, and am so glad there are products like this available.</li>
      <li>I would guess that this product performs the best if you have strong, non-porous hair, and are primarily using it for roots (i.e. fairly closely matching your existing haircolor and using the product to cover gray).         </li>
      <li>I had to go to a salon to have them use some kind of \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; shampoo to get rid of the problem.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if the company would just put a &#x27;teaspoon&#x27; more into each product.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure</li>
      <li>After spending a fortune at the salon, and watching my hair get more and more damaged from the coloring products they used, I decided to go it alone and try to find a product that was kinder to my hair.</li>
      <li>I love for what&#x27;s not in it.  </li>
      <li>I tried this haircolor hoping it would be gentler and more convenient than the salon coloring which I have been having done for years.  </li>
      <li>my first attempt at using this product had good results.      </li>
      <li>For my first day, the coverage, after 40 minutes, was really good for grays.</li>
      <li>Anyway, there are so many good reviews about this haircolor, that I just really want to put my experience out there as a caution...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended product :o)</li>
      <li>It comes out light, soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>it is best to go light rather than too dark.  </li>
      <li>and it still looks like damaged hair that will probably take a year to get back into great condition again.  </li>
      <li>my scalp is tender, my eyes  &amp; face are swollen &amp; in the light of day</li>
      <li>There was NOTHING light about it.</li>
      <li>I should have done a strand test first, so make sure you do that.  </li>
      <li>According to the Cosmetics Database (easily accessible via Google), a non profit organization that disseminates information about the toxicity of cosmetic products, Herbatint has a hazard/toxicity score of 7 out of 10, just 1 point lower than Clairol&#x27;s 8 out of 10.</li>
      <li>After I put the Herbatini conditioner on my hair is nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>I did find the colors not so true to the chart/box</li>
      <li>I can go for about six months coloring it myself using out of the box, light blonde in a warm hue.  </li>
      <li>At age 34 my hair turned gray and luckily I saved clippings from a haircut I had at age 29 which matched the sepia crayon in the Crayola Crayon box.</li>
      <li>(Though not as much as my first use!)         </li>
      <li>First of all, it is true - this haircolor has NO chemical smell at all.</li>
      <li>I wish there was some kind of money back guarantee - or reimbursement for money</li>
      <li>And, the results continued to show more breakage than I would accept as normal for a color product that is described as gentle and non-damaging.</li>
      <li>This color turned out very dark, glossy and absolutely gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Since I had so much hair, it took longer to apply, but I wasn&#x27;t worried about leaving it in the full 40 minutes after application because it was supposed to be so gentle.  </li>
      <li>Three days and more than 5 washes later, it was still bleeding out onto my towels and my pillow cases at night- permanently staining them.</li>
      <li>the hair color will wash out REALLY fast!</li>
      <li>I was recommended Herbatint by a health food store more than 10 years ago and have never looked back.</li>
      <li>I color my light golden blonde  hair at home, and usually with great results.</li>
      <li>My hair never looked healthier for the first couple of days.  </li>
      <li>It works great and last just as long as anything else</li>
      <li>I have used MANY different haircoloring products in the past and decided to try Herbatint because of all the good things I have read about this product.</li>
      <li>When it grows out, it actually looks kind of naturally streaked.  </li>
      <li>I have tried this product two more times now (primarily on my roots) because I had initially purchased extra product in order to save shipping, and because I hoped that by carefully restricting the amount of time I left it on, I could still get the great color without the damage.  </li>
      <li>but maybe if you have grey hair it would change the hair color more.  </li>
      <li>I have long brown hair that has always been shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I used 4M, hoping for a nice reddish-brown color on my naturally dark brown hair.  </li>
      <li>I was so loyal that i fought the reaction for nearly a year.</li>
      <li>I actually use dark blonde on my medium brown hair, which gives me the perfect match.</li>
      <li>I chose the &#x27;light blonde,&#x27; and followed the instructions even using a timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but much healthier to use.    </li>
      <li>It was really shiny, but also freakishly purple.  </li>
      <li>very helpful</li>
      <li>I really like the exrta shine that this product imparts on the hair, but the colors are soooo whacky.  </li>
      <li>You might want to buy a cheap pair of rubber kitchen gloves, or multiple packs of disposable gloves.</li>
      <li>Recently I decided to try Herbatint because I thought it would be better for my hair, as it makes natural claims.</li>
      <li>The only advise I can give is make sure you pick a shade 3 shades lighter than your NATURAL HAIR COLOR.</li>
      <li>That isn&#x27;t entirely true from my experience, and from what I know about any haircolor that is strong enough to actually color hair permanently.       </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Herbatint today, because I wanted a natural no-ammonia hair dye and natural color results, so I picked Light Golden Blonde</li>
      <li>With Herbatini you must choose a hair color much lighter than your natural hair color - 7N Blonde gives me a light brown color which matches the sepia crayon.  </li>
      <li>Have tried this product 7 times and found that there is not enough product in the bottles for full coverage.</li>
      <li>Apparently shades that have warmer undertone like golden turn out darker with this brand.</li>
      <li>:)  For now, be careful with the dye!!         </li>
      <li>The only thing it costs more on Amazon and at a local organic health store it sells for 15.95.</li>
      <li>Check out Naturcolor as it is a much gentler product and the colors are more predictable.</li>
      <li>Also note inorder to keep the hair color fresh and lasting use a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair or else</li>
      <li>I would like to try going back to the chestnut color since my eyes are blue and my cheeks are pink and it would look nice, but I don&#x27;t know exactly which shade to try - copper or mahogany?  </li>
      <li>- they call you back right away and give tips on how to use the product.  </li>
      <li>So, I tried Herbatint back in 2009 right before I was supposed to go to court.  </li>
      <li>- the hair was very soft and shiney after the process.  </li>
      <li>I am gutted as I really wanted a nice subtle vibrant red for the weekend,not brown.</li>
      <li>I plan to use this once more then switch to no Chem color due to what&#x27;s left and my allergies.</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t washed my hair since I&#x27;ve dyed it, so I might have to come back and amend this review if my color fades after the first wash, or thereafter.  </li>
      <li>My first experience with herbatint is that immediately after rinsing it out and putting my face cream on,  my face burned red.</li>
      <li>I blended 3 parts light to 2 parts dark.</li>
      <li>My mistake was picking too dark of a brown color - I chose light chestnut and used two boxes since I have a lot of hair.  </li>
      <li>so I tend to use the colours dark chestnut 3N and 4N which I think is light chestnet.</li>
      <li>I have natural dark brown hair, but I&#x27;ve been lightening it to a light to medium brown color.  </li>
      <li>This kit lightened up my black color with nice highlights and it worked good enough to tone down the solid black look.  </li>
      <li>I have super fine thin hair and my natural hair color</li>
      <li>What it did do is deposit more dark dye onto my dark hair which made it look even more black ...</li>
      <li>It was great not smelling any ammonia or artificial fragrance.</li>
      <li>The rinse water would run clear, but somehow it was still rubbing off onto everything.</li>
      <li>Wish I did,as I mixed it and thought that looks very dark,and put it on my hair for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>The highlights are soft and natural - I did not want anything that looked like I colored my hair</li>
      <li>I bought hebatint because i developed an allergy to loreal, color i had been using for about 30 years.  </li>
      <li>If you have gray hair and can&#x27;t remember your natural color</li>
      <li>Wow .</li>
      <li>And, all the grays were completely covered.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin and found there to be no issue with the product</li>
      <li>My scalp, so far, feels &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>, I combined a protein treatment called \\&quot;Allerga Natural Keratine\\&quot; with the haircolor application because this product is supposed to significantly increase the protection to your hair while you are doing something harsh to it (whether it be color, bleach or perm).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not gray, it&#x27;s not black, it&#x27;s not brown</li>
      <li>I used the included conditioner sample but also added my infusium23 intense conditioner because on long, color treated hair</li>
      <li>To solve that I bought a home hair streaking kit for dark hair, that is made to be used right after coloring hair.  </li>
      <li>I should of just bleached it and then used a red on it,would of been much brighter and the same condition.</li>
      <li>I have used light ash brown to ash blonde colors in conventional hair colors, so I decided to use a blonde color in Herbaltint.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp. I was recommended Herbatint by a health food store more than 10 years ago and have never looked back. I have dark hair so I tend to use the colours dark chestnut 3N and 4N which I think is light chestnet. It covers my grey hair well. I colour my hair every month. Leave the colour no longer than 40 minutes. Highly recommended product :o)</li>
    <li> I have been using Herbatint for about 8 years and I like it. I tried Revlon and Clairol, but my scalp itched for three weeks afterward. Herbatint is odorless and gives me a beautiful hair color.  After I put the Herbatini conditioner on my hair is nice and soft.  At age 34 my hair turned gray and luckily I saved clippings from a haircut I had at age 29 which matched the sepia crayon in the Crayola Crayon box. In my early 20&#x27;s my hair color was chestnut (about 80% brown and 20% red).  With Herbatini you must choose a hair color much lighter than your natural hair color - 7N Blonde gives me a light brown color which matches the sepia crayon.  If I use 7C Ash Blonde it comes out a beautiful honey color which is nice for summer.  I would like to try going back to the chestnut color since my eyes are blue and my cheeks are pink and it would look nice, but I don&#x27;t know exactly which shade to try - copper or mahogany?  The copper seems too orange and the mahogany too dark. If you have gray hair and can&#x27;t remember your natural color it is best to go light rather than too dark.  You&#x27;ll be disappointed if it&#x27;s too dark.</li>
    <li> According to the Cosmetics Database (easily accessible via Google), a non profit organization that disseminates information about the toxicity of cosmetic products, Herbatint has a hazard/toxicity score of 7 out of 10, just 1 point lower than Clairol&#x27;s 8 out of 10. Although it&#x27;s sold at Whole Foods and cleverly packaged in a green box, it contains the following ingredients: WATER, NONOXYNOL-6, NONOXYNOL-4, ETHANOLAMINE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, EDTA, SODIUM METABISULFITE, WALNUT EXTRACT, RHUBARB EXTRACT, CINCHONA EXTRACT, P-PHENYLENEDIAMINE, RESORCINOL, O-AMINOPHENOL, M-AMINOPHENOL. GLYCOL DEVELOPER: WATER, GLYCOL, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, ETIDRONIC ACID, EDTA. One of the ingredients, P-PHENYLENEDIAMINE, is a known carcinogen and has been rated 10 out of 10 on the toxicity to humans scale.   PLEASE NOTE: above ingredients are part of the product&#x27;s formulation as of date of this review. They may have changed since. I also want to add that the Cosmetics Database is extremely conservative and denote as toxic some ingredients whose toxicity is questionable.</li>
    <li> I was using another low chemical haircoloring brand and decided to try Herbatint.  My mistake was picking too dark of a brown color - I chose light chestnut and used two boxes since I have a lot of hair.  My hair came out very black instead of the lighter brown I was hoping for, although it was very shiny.   To solve that I bought a home hair streaking kit for dark hair, that is made to be used right after coloring hair.  This kit lightened up my black color with nice highlights and it worked good enough to tone down the solid black look.  I should have done a strand test first, so make sure you do that.  But overall the Herbatint did help to condition my hair and I would recommend it.  It was great not smelling any ammonia or artificial fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have long brown hair that has always been shiny and healthy. When I started getting grey hairs, I dreaded the prospect of the quality of my hair deteriorating over the years with the use of permanent hair colouring. The discovery of Herbatint has avoided all of that and my hair looks as it always has  but with no greys! I actually use dark blonde on my medium brown hair, which gives me the perfect match.</li>
    <li> So, I tried Herbatint back in 2009 right before I was supposed to go to court.  I used 4M, hoping for a nice reddish-brown color on my naturally dark brown hair.  Well, I had eggplant purple hair! It was really shiny, but also freakishly purple.  Not wanting to totally write the product off, I tried it again a few months ago as I normally use Naturcolor and could not find 3N Burdock, my normal color.  I tried 2N Brown in Herbatint and had Elvira black hair.  Additionally, it dried out my ends something terrible.  I really like the exrta shine that this product imparts on the hair, but the colors are soooo whacky.  Check out Naturcolor as it is a much gentler product and the colors are more predictable.</li>
    <li> I have curly (with some frizziness) hair that can be very beautiful with the right treatments, and entirely awful with the wrong ones.  I tried this haircolor hoping it would be gentler and more convenient than the salon coloring which I have been having done for years.  My hair was long enough to reach the top of my butt and is quite thick, so I used 3 boxes.  Since I had so much hair, it took longer to apply, but I wasn&#x27;t worried about leaving it in the full 40 minutes after application because it was supposed to be so gentle.  Keep in mind that my roots were \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair and about 3 inches in length.  The rest of the length of my hair had been colored several (about 6) months previously.  This color turned out very dark, glossy and absolutely gorgeous.  My hair never looked healthier for the first couple of days.  And, all the grays were completely covered.  (One month later, they still are.)  Then, the breakage started.  About 3 days after my new color, I noticed a lot of breakage which continued for about a week and a half or longer.  There was a great deal more breakage than I had ever experienced with my colorist at the salon.  I had 7 inches cut off my hair and it still looks like damaged hair that will probably take a year to get back into great condition again.  It looks like one of those bad \\&quot;thinning\\&quot; procedures from the 80&#x27;s was done to it.       I talked to a colorist and explained what had happened, and told her about the ingredients of Herbatint, and she said that it shouldn&#x27;t have happened even though I had left it on longer than the instructions said.  She said that this type of colorant is designed to basically shut itself off as it sets, and she was skeptical about the actual \\&quot;gentleness\\&quot; of the product.         Anyway, there are so many good reviews about this haircolor, that I just really want to put my experience out there as a caution...do not leave this product on too long assuming that it isn&#x27;t going to do some really bad things to your pretty hair just because it is supposed to have gentler ingredients!!  Even if you are only coloring the roots, you need a product to be reasonably gentle because you are inevitably going to get some of the product on the next section of hair that has been previously colored.  The product&#x27;s description does say that it doesn&#x27;t damage hair at all.  That isn&#x27;t entirely true from my experience, and from what I know about any haircolor that is strong enough to actually color hair permanently.       Someday, I hope we can just take a vitamin and change haircolor truly without damaging anything.  :)  For now, be careful with the dye!!         6-9 months later...I have tried this product two more times now (primarily on my roots) because I had initially purchased extra product in order to save shipping, and because I hoped that by carefully restricting the amount of time I left it on, I could still get the great color without the damage.  Again, I got great gray coverage and beautiful color, but still more breakage than I get at the salon.  (Though not as much as my first use!)         I do notice that the color seems to be longer lasting than the salon coloring treatments.         I would guess that this product performs the best if you have strong, non-porous hair, and are primarily using it for roots (i.e. fairly closely matching your existing haircolor and using the product to cover gray).         One final note, I combined a protein treatment called \\&quot;Allerga Natural Keratine\\&quot; with the haircolor application because this product is supposed to significantly increase the protection to your hair while you are doing something harsh to it (whether it be color, bleach or perm).  And, the results continued to show more breakage than I would accept as normal for a color product that is described as gentle and non-damaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and it is the best.  I love for what&#x27;s not in it.  It works great and last just as long as anything else but much healthier to use.    The only thing it costs more on Amazon and at a local organic health store it sells for 15.95.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY different haircoloring products in the past and decided to try Herbatint because of all the good things I have read about this product. I used Herbatint Dark brown 3N (which is my natural haircolor) on my hair. After applying it I noticed a change in my hair. My hair was softer and shinier. The only bad thing was the dark brown color looked more like black on my hair. The Herbatint covered all my gray hair and the haircolor lasted 6 weeks before the grays stared showing. I did use a shampoo and condition for color treated hair maybe that is why the color lasted as long as it did. I wanted to go lighter and I made the mistake and ordered Chestnut 4N thinking it would make my already dark hair lighter....it did not. What it did do is deposit more dark dye onto my dark hair which made it look even more black ...if that is possible. All in all I would recommend this product. The only advise I can give is make sure you pick a shade 3 shades lighter than your NATURAL HAIR COLOR. I guess I should have Herbatint colored my hair the first time with Dark Blonde 6N. I am now trying to get the dark shade out which is a very slow process. Perhaps when the very dark shade is finally out of my hair I will try the 6N shade to see if I can achieve a medium brown color. Also note inorder to keep the hair color fresh and lasting use a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair or else the hair color will wash out REALLY fast!</li>
    <li> Not really a totally satisfied customer. Have tried this product 7 times and found that there is not enough product in the bottles for full coverage. After trying 6 times and scraping the bottom of the bowl each time I took it to my hairdresser; of course she found the same problem. My hair is not long, just a little below my ears and my hair is not thick.  It would be nice if the company would just put a &#x27;teaspoon&#x27; more into each product. The gray coverage is &amp;#34;not great&amp;#34; when I called the customer service line they said to buy two boxes - at 65 years of age living on a pension I can&#x27;t afford $19.99 Canadian  x 2 every 4 weeks. Only good comment, I do like the color 8N - the product though is &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; until I can find something else, I will struggle with scraping the bottom of the bowl - so unfortunate!  It is also unfortunate that the reviews are &amp;#34;so old&amp;#34; this needs to be addressed by the manufacturer. They have updated the packaging however, have not increased the amount of product in the bottles.</li>
    <li> I have lots of gray towards the front of my hair and dark brown in the back. For the past few years I&#x27;ve been dying my hair blonde, sometimes with highlights. When it grows out, it actually looks kind of naturally streaked.  I can go for about six months coloring it myself using out of the box, light blonde in a warm hue.  But I was getting concerned about the ingredients being bad for my hair and skin so I decided to try Herbatint because it claims to have less toxic ingredients.  I chose the &#x27;light blonde,&#x27; and followed the instructions even using a timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out a color I have never even seen on man or beast - I don&#x27;t even know what color it is. It&#x27;s not gray, it&#x27;s not black, it&#x27;s not brown and it is definitely not blonde! Though my friends were generous when they said things like, &#x27;It looks soft,&#x27; or, &#x27;It&#x27;s not bad,&#x27; I feel so annoyed because now I have to spend a bunch of money to get this corrected. I wish there was some kind of money back guarantee - or reimbursement for money I have to spend taking out the color and doing the job right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend Herbatint to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned gray maroon!</li>
    <li> I color my light golden blonde  hair at home, and usually with great results. I&#x27;ve tried Herbatint today, because I wanted a natural no-ammonia hair dye and natural color results, so I picked Light Golden Blonde 8G. First of all, it is true - this haircolor has NO chemical smell at all. I had to use 2 packs, since my hair is very long and I have a lot of it. When I mixed it in the bowl, it became suspiciously dark and on my previously light blonde hair it turned into almost black during the application! Well, I thought it was just the way it works, but after 35 min. I had VERY DARK blonde with just a hint of golden undertone. There was NOTHING light about it. I must say, the condition of the hair came out fabulous, very full and shiny, but the color itself was a total disappointment! Be careful when you choose the color, it will probably always be about 3-4 tones darker than you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2012: I tried it couple of more times over the past few years, and it still DOES make my hair much darker no matter what. But I figured that neutral shades, like Honey Blonde would not! It comes out light, soft and beautiful. Apparently shades that have warmer undertone like golden turn out darker with this brand.</li>
    <li> I have natural dark brown hair, but I&#x27;ve been lightening it to a light to medium brown color.  When I choose a hair color, I always go lighter.  I have used light ash brown to ash blonde colors in conventional hair colors, so I decided to use a blonde color in Herbaltint.  I bought the 8N light blonde shade, but the hair swatch is closer to a dark blonde color.      A few things about the kit:  It contains the same 2 oz bottle of colorant and the same 2 oz bottle of developer that you usually get with a home hair coloring kit, but it does not include the applicator bottle.  Usually the applicator bottle has the developer in it, and you just add the colorant, shake it, and apply it to your hair.  Not so with this product.  You have to find a container to mix the hair color.  I used a glass measuring cup.  I could have used half the product, by pouring just 1 oz of colorant and 1 oz of developer in the cup, but I decided I would use the whole box of product because my hair is thick and almost to my shoulders.  If you have short hair, you could get away with using 1/2 now and 1/2 later.  I wanted to make sure my first attempt at using this product had good results.      I still haven&#x27;t washed my hair since I&#x27;ve dyed it, so I might have to come back and amend this review if my color fades after the first wash, or thereafter.  I do like the results, and I&#x27;m happy, though the product did seem to darken my lighter highlights, I think they will shine through again after a few shampoos.    The other complaint I have, besides not having an applicator bottle, is the gloves are really short and cheap.  I have other gloves that I use for dying my hair, though.  You might want to buy a cheap pair of rubber kitchen gloves, or multiple packs of disposable gloves.</li>
    <li> I have never used a home coloring kit - so I was alittle scared.  I have super fine thin hair and my natural hair color is a dirty blonde will a few highlights from being in the sun so I tried 9N first to a few pieces of hair, and I did get a few lighter highlights,  Next I tried 10N to a few pieces and that color worked too.  I did find the colors not so true to the chart/box but maybe if you have grey hair it would change the hair color more.  I found Marie &amp; Barbara at the 800 number very helpful - they call you back right away and give tips on how to use the product.  I do have sensitive skin and found there to be no issue with the product - the hair was very soft and shiney after the process.  My next attempt was to mix in the Sweedish blonde into the 10N proceesed for 35 min and the color looked great.  The highlights are soft and natural - I did not want anything that looked like I colored my hair just a natural look with a few differant shades / highlights.  I have a few pieces of grey at the temple and this color blended with thoses grey pieces.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wanted to try a home coloring kit for highlights - I can&#x27;t say what an all over application would work.  Happy coloring</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair for years, and tried a variety of products. Recently I decided to try Herbatint because I thought it would be better for my hair, as it makes natural claims. Three days and more than 5 washes later, it was still bleeding out onto my towels and my pillow cases at night- permanently staining them. The rinse water would run clear, but somehow it was still rubbing off onto everything. I had to go to a salon to have them use some kind of \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; shampoo to get rid of the problem. Worst of all, I contacted the company to offer them the opportunity to respond to my compaint, and heard nothing. Terrible product, terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> I used the Crimson one.My hair was red but fading and I had a few inches of root growth. I decided to use this dye as my hair is in poor condition and I did not want to re bleach. Wish I did,as I mixed it and thought that looks very dark,and put it on my hair for 30 minutes.It looked more or less black.Just washed it and I now have brown hair which I am not best pleased with at all.Plus my hair feels awfull. I should of just bleached it and then used a red on it,would of been much brighter and the same condition. I will now have to wait a while and find something else to use. I am gutted as I really wanted a nice subtle vibrant red for the weekend,not brown.</li>
    <li> I accidentally got some in my eyes . Wow . It is dangerous stuff . My eyes got flushed immediately but in general  my body didn&#x27;t like this product . I was physically ill for a few days after using this  . I tried calling the company and got a \\&quot; its not our problem attitude \\&quot;  from the  customer service  rep .  I have ten boxes and I am giving it away . This stuff is bad news</li>
    <li> I bought hebatint because i developed an allergy to loreal, color i had been using for about 30 years.  I was so loyal that i fought the reaction for nearly a year. My first experience with herbatint is that immediately after rinsing it out and putting my face cream on,  my face burned red. My scalp, so far, feels &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  That said, i bought dark blonde &amp; light blonde because i read that the colors run dark.  I blended 3 parts light to 2 parts dark. It&#x27;s still too dark. I used the included conditioner sample but also added my infusium23 intense conditioner because on long, color treated hair the included conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough. For my first day, the coverage, after 40 minutes, was really good for grays. I do feel that the ppd content is causing my scalp to feel &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;. I plan to use this once more then switch to no Chem color due to what&#x27;s left and my allergies. I do not know how long the color will last on my grays. Day 2 update: The tool following morning my scalp is tender, my eyes  &amp; face are swollen &amp; in the light of day the dark blonde is actually a medium-dark brown. I woke with a headache and an overall &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34; feeling in general. My face still feels raw and tender. I will probably discard the remaining dye based on my symptoms. I actually feel as though I&#x27;m hung over and it&#x27;s concerning because I&#x27;ve read that these chemicals can cause brain swelling. The reaction I&#x27;m having to this color is far worse than the rashes i get from the Loreal.  I gave 2 stars only because of the ease of use, the lack of offensive odor and the gray coverage. I would have given 5 stars if this was actually an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product even though the color is several shades darker than stated. If it had been all natural i doubt i would be having such a bad reaction.  I&#x27;m female,  caucasian, 44 with some gray and naturally dark blonde hair. My hair is thick and straight and about 5&amp;#34; past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> After spending a fortune at the salon, and watching my hair get more and more damaged from the coloring products they used, I decided to go it alone and try to find a product that was kinder to my hair. Herbatint is that product! I have fine, thin hair, and after using herbatint every 5 weeks for the past 6 months, the top half of my hair is now healthy, with no split ends, where the bottom half (which was subject to the &#x27;professionals in the salon&#x27;) is broken and damaged. I am getting regular hair trims and slowly bringing my hair back to the healthy state it was once in. I am very happy to have found Herbatint, and am so glad there are products like this available.</li>
    <li> God only knows what this stuff is. I did a tester on my inner arm last night and now it&#x27;s red, itchy,  swollen and weeping, and getting worse! Thank god I didn&#x27;t put it all over my head.</li>
