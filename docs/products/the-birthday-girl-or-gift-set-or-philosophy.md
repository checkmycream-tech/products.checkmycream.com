    <li> This is a great assortment of products. LOVE the lip gloss especially - it smells exactly like a vanilla cupcake, or at least cupcake batter. The only issue I had was the sizes of the products - they seem to be smaller than I&#x27;d expect, so the little bag was less than 1/2 full, except for a massive wad of shredded paper.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend who just starting using these products.  She loved it.  The sizes are small, but the products are worth it.  (Or so I have heard)</li>
    <li> iTS OK JUST A BIT SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Great selection of Philosophy products but sizes are sooo small this kit is poor value, for the money.   Consider buying larger, individual products and passing up the bag. Much better value that way.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend of mine on her 35th birthday. She loved it. ;-) The package is really cute and the products are great. I now buy and send it to all my friends on their birthday, I know it makes them feel special on their birthday.</li>
    <li> Love this kit!  Really cute idea for a birthday gift even if you give one to yourself.  Which I did!  I can&#x27;t live without the \\&quot;Kiss Me Red\\&quot; lip balm. It&#x27;s staying power is the best I&#x27;ve ever found. The other products in the kit are also favorites and now I have them in perfect travel sizes.    RA - So. California</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a whole \\&quot;spa spoiler\\&quot; birthday basket for my Mom.  She loved the fragrance of these products the best, and just raved about them!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great products for a great girl.  awsome birthday gift for the girl who loves philosophy.</li>
    <li> I had got one of the philosophy gift sets as a gift and wanted to give this set to a friend for her birthday thinking that the size of the bottles would be the same. But it was not! These bottles were smaller which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. If the bottle size would&#x27;ve been the same as the one I got I would&#x27;ve given this a 4 star.    The product itself was great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to surprise my sister with this gift set for her birthday so I shipped it to her as an amazon gift. She was very happy with the gift set however, she only received four items in the set instead of five. It was missing the foot scrub. I&#x27;m disappointed and returning is such a hassle...</li>
    <li> I love this set from Philosphy.  It&#x27;s my new go-to gift for birthdays because it&#x27;s packaged so cute and has a great variety of items to sample.  Highly recommended, especially with prime shipping.</li>
    <li> as always, philosophy is a fabulous brand - i bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she adored it. she had never used this product before and so it was an ideal gift that allowed her to sample several products. she loved the bag in which it came and has said that she will use it for cosmetics after she has finished with the philosophy products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the transaction was smooth and speedily delivered - would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this gift to my daughter&#x27;s friend who is in her twenties, and I also gave it to a woman who just turned 50 - both of them loved getting it!</li>
    <li> This was for my daughters birthday, l have used it before and liked it my daughter loved it, l would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a gift for my daughter. I love the idea of it, but the items are way TOO SMALL for the price. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Her birthday is in March, but this will hold until then. I send her little items throughout the year, just to remind her how much she is loved and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for as a birthday gift and had it shipped to Hawaii. She loved it. It was a great idea.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister, and had it shipped to her house.  She tells me that everything in it is really nice, and she particularly liked the &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; face wash.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mom and her best friend to their birthdays! They both loved them and the message on the bag!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set in July 2012 for $26.00. It is a set of five, sample/small sized products in a cute vinyl case. At $26.00 it was a little expensive but I thought it was cute as a gift.  The product themselves are decent, the cost is just ridiculous. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this gift set, not in good conscience anyway.</li>
    <li> i love philosophy products and this stuff is great! this was a present for a friend for the holiday and it worked out great!</li>
