      <li>It penetrates and keeps my skin smooth and soft and my husband compliments me on how my skin looks great after using it.</li>
      <li>What I love about this serum is that it absorbs right in, I feel so nourished and mostly...</li>
      <li>She was using a popular brand of serum with a much higher price tag.  </li>
      <li>The serum is very smooth on my skin, has a great consistency and goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>The product seems fine</li>

      <li>I love how quickly it absorbs and the feel of it on my skin (not greasy at all).</li>
      <li>The product packaging is great and the Anti-Aging Facial Serum is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Just started using this product a few weeks ago and am already very impressed.</li>
      <li>I’ll be ordering this product again because it’s not only  a great value</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nicole is extremely picky about her products and I would feel safe and happy buying anything in her line.</li>
      <li>My skin feels better and people have complimented me on my skin for the first time in years.</li>
      <li>something that I talked to Love Radiance SkinCare about when I received my first bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super excited...</li>
      <li>My skin felt so good after just a short time.</li>
      <li>I have been using Love Radiance for about a month now, and I really notice that my skin is softer and firmer than it was a month ago.</li>
      <li>So far really loving this product.</li>
      <li>I have used different anti-aging serums that have also helped my skin, but I love Radiance because it&#x27;s fragrance free and its’ texture is light and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had anything arrive that quickly.  </li>
      <li>My makeup goes on without the streaks because the serum is absorbed so quickly without making my skin feel like it’s being pulled.  </li>
      <li>Any products made by Nicole Jolie are ones I would trust and be willing to try!</li>
      <li>It goes on light, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>It’s also fragrance free which I really appreciate.  </li>
      <li>That alone is worth a million dollars.</li>
      <li>I loved that there was really no problem in getting the serum out of the packaging, and it was ;packaged well.</li>
      <li>It makes me look and feel years younger, and it is so nice and soft… and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes..  </li>
      <li>So when I learned about Radiance I thought it was worth trying.</li>
      <li>And, I was right.</li>
      <li>Plus, it’s made right here in the USA</li>
      <li>In such a short time, my skin feels amazing and is notably improved.  </li>
      <li>I am super picky about skin care because my skin is so sensitive and most products cause my face to swell and turn red.</li>
      <li>but it runs out far too quickly.</li>
      <li>and I can certainly tell a difference.</li>
      <li>After three weeks the appearance of fine facial lines had improved.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, it really works!  </li>
      <li>I tried it twice thinking that maybe I had used too much at a time.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>NEXT when is your product going to be available in Canada so that I can buy it myself instead of going through my friend??</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old, and although I&#x27;ve always looked pretty young for my age, I&#x27;m starting to realize that I need to take better care of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m careful about what skin care products I use since I will break out fairly easily.</li>
      <li>Was gone in a quick second with no visible changes.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue using this product and say goodbye to the high priced stuff!!!</li>
      <li>and honestly I can’t justify spending money on imports when our country is working so hard to keep our jobs here in the USA.</li>
      <li>Just got my order a few days ago and love it so far!  </li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviewers too how light the cream is and that there is no scent and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I workout.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems smoother and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>silky.&lt;br /&gt;Great product thus far!</li>
      <li>I will keep using this--it is the first anti-aging product that I have used that I actually saw the results!!  </li>
      <li>It is certainly a cut above the rest, most especially some of those more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this product again because I like the feel, the look of my skin after a long day at work and the fact that it’s clean and has no fragrance.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no scent, it is not too heavy and feels fabulous on my skin.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I am finding that it has completely calmed the flare ups and my skin feels radiant.</li>
      <li>I had been using Estee Lauder&#x27;s serum which is almost three times the cost of this and didn&#x27;t see near the results.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, mothers and grandmothers are so busy taking care of everyone else, they forget about themselves.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and I endorse clean products without harsh chemicals and my skin loves this Anti-Aging Serum.</li>
      <li>I can wear it under my sunscreen and my moisturizer too and my skin feels clean, soft and definitely shows a glow I haven’t had with other serums.</li>
      <li>I have tried similar sorts of products in the past and paid a lot more for them - and then had the dispenser pump fail!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have only used about a fourth of my first bottle</li>
      <li>and I quickly received the product a day earlier than expected.  </li>
      <li>Having used lots of different products over the years, I was very surprised at</li>
      <li>Product came in the mail quickly and because you use just a few drops each day, it lasts a whole lot longer than any other serum I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>After only a week, with just a few drops daily (with a toner), my skin is visibly smoother and looking fabulous.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product with the anti aging Solution has been amazing for my sikn</li>
    <li> The product seems fine but it runs out far too quickly. I tried it twice thinking that maybe I had used too much at a time. That was not the problem.I have used other products with the same volume and they definitely lasted  longer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I have waited for several weeks to write a review as I wanted to see how it felt over time.  I am finding it feels better, firmer, as time goes by. At 77 I still want to look and feel my best.  This is helping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had friends who have been using Botox for years. I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to go that route. So when I learned about Radiance I thought it was worth trying. And, I was right. It&#x27;s wonderful. After only a week, with just a few drops daily (with a toner), my skin is visibly smoother and looking fabulous. Who needs Botox?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I received my order promptly, in excellent condition and the packaging was easy to open. Radiance is the best!</li>
    <li> I am super picky about skin care because my skin is so sensitive and most products cause my face to swell and turn red. What I love about this serum is that it absorbs right in, I feel so nourished and mostly... no reaction. In fact, I am finding that it has completely calmed the flare ups and my skin feels radiant.</li>
    <li> I love the serum. I have used different anti-aging serums that have also helped my skin, but I love Radiance because it&#x27;s fragrance free and its’ texture is light and easy to apply.  I can wear it under my sunscreen and my moisturizer too and my skin feels clean, soft and definitely shows a glow I haven’t had with other serums. It penetrates and keeps my skin smooth and soft and my husband compliments me on how my skin looks great after using it. It’s also priced in my budget.  Definitely going to keep using Radiance.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money , i got mine back</li>
    <li> WOW!  When I heard about this, I jumped on the chance to try it.  I ordered on Friday, and it arrived TODAY - Monday!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had anything arrive that quickly.  I&#x27;m 63 years old, and although I&#x27;ve always looked pretty young for my age, I&#x27;m starting to realize that I need to take better care of my skin.  After all the great reviews, I believe this skin care product will be one I&#x27;ll want to keep on using.  Can&#x27;t wait to start using it and see some results.  I&#x27;m super excited...because I&#x27;m doing something for myself!  Sometimes, mothers and grandmothers are so busy taking care of everyone else, they forget about themselves.  ~~ A Grandmother in SC.</li>
    <li> I heard about Radiance through my friend and I decided to use one of the coupons they gave to purchase at a discount.  I’m really glad I did because I love it.  I’ve used it for a couple of days now and quite honestly, it’s so light and feels so good going on my skin I haven’t been putting on my moisturizer.  My makeup goes on without the streaks because the serum is absorbed so quickly without making my skin feel like it’s being pulled.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again because I like the feel, the look of my skin after a long day at work and the fact that it’s clean and has no fragrance.  Plus, it’s made right here in the USA and honestly I can’t justify spending money on imports when our country is working so hard to keep our jobs here in the USA.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product! It absorbs immediately and my skin feels supple and well hydrated. Really good stuff. Glad I&#x27;ve got it!</li>
    <li> I have been so impressed with this product for the 6 weeks I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems smoother and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I agree with the other reviewers too how light the cream is and that there is no scent and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I workout. I will definitely buy this product!</li>
    <li> You need this product! I can see an instant difference. My skin feels better and people have complimented me on my skin for the first time in years. That alone is worth a million dollars. Buy this you will never go back!!</li>
    <li> I have received my Radiance Anti-Aging Serum and are just loving using it.  In such a short time, my skin feels amazing and is notably improved.  I will definitely be buying this again and recommending it to my friends.  The serum is very smooth on my skin, has a great consistency and goes a long way.  Having used lots of different products over the years, I was very surprised at just how well it works.  It is certainly a cut above the rest, most especially some of those more expensive brands.  Do yourself a favor and try this for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and will be quickly reaching out for more.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Radiance Anti-Aging Facial Serum to me when we discussed skin care solutions.  I purchased it and I quickly received the product a day earlier than expected.  The product packaging is great and the Anti-Aging Facial Serum is fantastic.  After using the product for just one week, I noticed an improvement in my skins texture, tone and appearance!  After three weeks the appearance of fine facial lines had improved.  My skin is sensitive and I endorse clean products without harsh chemicals and my skin loves this Anti-Aging Serum. It&#x27;s an awesome product and I look forward to purchasing other products from the Radiance Anti-Aging skin product line.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a few weeks ago and am already very impressed. Love the feel of it on my skin and how it makes my skin feel smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Great product thus far!</li>
    <li> Just got my order a few days ago and love it so far!  There&#x27;s no scent, it is not too heavy and feels fabulous on my skin.  I get a very slight tingling when I apply it so can tell it&#x27;s working its magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a really good value for the money.  I have tried similar sorts of products in the past and paid a lot more for them - and then had the dispenser pump fail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole is extremely picky about her products and I would feel safe and happy buying anything in her line.</li>
    <li> So far really loving this product. It goes on light, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination, but spots seem to be lightening up as well.  Product came in the mail quickly and because you use just a few drops each day, it lasts a whole lot longer than any other serum I&#x27;ve ever tried. Would highly recommend this one. Definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> I am a competitive person and have always been proud of how well I looked after my skin.  My sisters and I are about the same age and they have almost given up trying to catch me. :-)  Then my friend in FLA told me about this product and sent me one because she knows about the competition with my sisters.  OMG it has put me way ahead of my sisters in the &amp;#34;no wrinkle&amp;#34; department!  Because I take very good care of my skin I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much of a difference.  I was wrong, it took 11 days, yes I was watching, and I noticed a definite difference.  I applied the serum twice per day, and even missed a couple but still noticed that difference.  Thank You!  NEXT when is your product going to be available in Canada so that I can buy it myself instead of going through my friend???  I&#x27;ll have to get some for my sisters when you do, then we can all look younger together.</li>
    <li> I have only used about a fourth of my first bottle and I can already see improvements with firmness, fine lines and wrinkles.  I had been using Estee Lauder&#x27;s serum which is almost three times the cost of this and didn&#x27;t see near the results.  I highly recommend this product, it really works!  I will definitely continue using this product and say goodbye to the high priced stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product…  It makes me look and feel years younger, and it is so nice and soft… and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes..  I&#x27;d give it 100 stars!!</li>
    <li> Was gone in a quick second with no visible changes.</li>
    <li> I am a prime member on Amazon, and I received my Love Radiance in 2 days. I loved that there was really no problem in getting the serum out of the packaging, and it was ;packaged well. I have been using Love Radiance for about a month now, and I really notice that my skin is softer and firmer than it was a month ago. I use it twice a day--morning and night, and I am loving the results!! I will keep using this--it is the first anti-aging product that I have used that I actually saw the results!!  Thank You for creating this serum!!</li>
    <li> Any products made by Nicole Jolie are ones I would trust and be willing to try! She has formulated her product with great care, excellent eco aware packaging, made in the USA and fragrance free! Everyone using Radiance talks about what an exceptional product it is and how they see results within 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m careful about what skin care products I use since I will break out fairly easily. I&#x27;m happy to say that this did not break out my skin. I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and I can certainly tell a difference. I love how quickly it absorbs and the feel of it on my skin (not greasy at all). My skin is starting to look firmer and those annoying crow&#x27;s feet are less noticeable.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to look younger.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic! My skin elasticity has improved and wrinkles diminished.</li>
    <li> Very good serum. Feels wonderful on my skin. Good combination of ingredients.</li>
    <li> The result I got from this product was surprising. My skin felt so good after just a short time. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I’ve got to say, I’m very happy to purchase an anti-aging facial serum that’s made in the USA and has exceptional ingredients, not to mention, it’s fragrance free!  I’ve only been using Radiance for a couple of weeks, but already I can feel the difference.  I sometimes use SPF over Radiance if I’m going to be outside, but usually just wear the serum and nothing else.  It’s hypoallergenic so it doesn’t make my eyes tear when I sweat, something that I talked to Love Radiance SkinCare about when I received my first bottle.  It’s also fragrance free which I really appreciate.  I’ll be ordering this product again because it’s not only  a great value, it’s also an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She was using a popular brand of serum with a much higher price tag.  She has been using this for a little over a week and is pleasantly surprised with the results of this product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
