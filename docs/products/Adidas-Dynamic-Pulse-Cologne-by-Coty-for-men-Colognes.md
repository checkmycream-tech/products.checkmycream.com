      <li>ITS COOL FOR HOODIE AND SNEAKERS.</li>
      <li>I live in Venezuela and I am getting is just the products, everything went well, delivery times were respected and everything is in good condition, greetings, blessings and successes, recommended 100%, thanks.</li>
      <li>Stay fresh all day!!&lt;br /&gt;Great Light fresh smelling Spray on.</li>
      <li>A light, citrus scent perfect for daytime use since it&#x27;s a toilet spray (not strong like cologne).</li>
      <li>It is the first time for me to try it, before that, I used the &amp;#34;After Shave&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>I own several high end fragrances that I like to wear for different occasions.</li>
      <li>, 5 different body sprays and 4 different Eau De Toilette Spray&#x27;s and this 1 is of my most favourite and also I just ordered 1 more today along with 3 other one&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t linger for too long, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>

    <li> I see the box have a little scratch but very good</li>
    <li> This was bought for my teenaged son who often needs something to mask his terrible odor after gym.  This cologne does that.</li>
    <li> Great product. I always get to seem compliments on this cologne. The price is amazing. Much cheaper than the department stores I would find it at before.</li>
    <li> IT DIDNT SMELL LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD. I BROUGHT IT BLIND (TOOK A CHANCE). ITS COOL FOR HOODIE AND SNEAKERS.</li>
    <li> I bought from Amazon LLC, and I like the smell. The smell lasts the whole day for me.</li>
    <li> This cologne is best for someone coming straight out of the shower after working out.  I dont know if this makes sense but it has a soapy, sporty smell to it.  Any athlete looking for something stronger than a body spray, this is it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It smells phenomenal and the price is good, too! The smell doesn&#x27;t linger for too long, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>

    <li> the smell of this cologne is great I just wish it lasted longer then 5 minutes</li>

    <li> It smell pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> A light, citrus scent perfect for daytime use since it&#x27;s a toilet spray (not strong like cologne). Great for after-shower application. Would buy again....</li>

    <li> I have been using this same aftershave for several years now. I own several high end fragrances that I like to wear for different occasions. But in all honesty I have gotten more compliments when wearing Adidas Pulse than all of my top shelf colognes. Highly recommended!</li>
