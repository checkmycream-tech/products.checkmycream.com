<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice.  I need larger size.</li>
    <li> I am using this in my line of skin care products, and it is amazing! Top quality, as far as I can tell. Smells wonderful and I love the healing properties that it has. I will definitely order this again. I&#x27;m a big fan of NOW Foods!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful essential oil and at a really reasonable piece.  I mix a few drops of this into my rosehip seed oil to use as a my daily natural moisturizer and it works out great. I also add a new jobs to my baths in the evening, to body scrubs I make.......its an awesome essential oil to have around.</li>
    <li> Good product low price....perfect</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of Aromas, presently I am collecting essential oils to study the power of smell in evoking and intensifying experiences snd memories of them. Recently I did side by side experiments (controlled, multiple blind testings) with Ylang Ylang oils from &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; and Piping Rock. What I experienced was : The NOW oil had the expected smell, but the aroma emenating from Piping Rock oil was more intense and nuanced with layers of natural sweetness and had &amp;#34;depth&amp;#34;. Because Piping Rock oil is little more expensive, an equivalent &amp;#34;dollar&amp;#34; amount of samples were tested. Piping Rock was the clear winner. Confession: I am a research scientist and have absolutely no connection with Piping Rock or NOW.</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT!!!  I like to use this in my bath rather than mixing with face or body oils.</li>
    <li> I buy NOW essential oils all the time. Their prices are very reasonable. I am a chemically sensitive individual &amp; have had to resort to using natural substance&#x27;s to clean &amp; deodorize my home with. I also use this along with other fragrances to make my own dab on perfume. I absolutely love to smell of Ylang Ylang.(.now if I could only find Frangipani an Hawaiian white ginger).Their oils came carefully wrapped &amp; I have never received a broken bottle yet.</li>
    <li> Not as fresh as others</li>
    <li> Use for mood enhancement and end up getting asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing, which in itself is a mood enhancement - have given as a gift - like the quali t you and price of this product</li>
    <li> This oil is incredible...a beautiful scent, relaxing and vivid.  This tends to be a bit more expensive than most other oils I buy, but this is well worth any extra price.  It is strong, long lasting and very high quality.</li>
    <li> Great for aromatherapy, yet it&#x27;s not therapeutic grade.</li>
    <li> Really improves my mood.</li>
    <li> Very original scent. Can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else. Probably a love it or hate it type of smell.</li>
    <li> I use this Ylang Ylang oil strictly in my home diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dozens &amp; dozens of various essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Some pure &amp; some blends from a few different suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;my all-time-fav combo is Lavender mixed with Ylang Ylang.&lt;br /&gt;About 75% Lav &amp; 25% Ylang.&lt;br /&gt;Smells incredible</li>
    <li> I am never disappointed by NOW Essential oils, and their Ylang Ylang lives up to my expectations. It smells wonderful and is 100% pure. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> A great essential oil from a reputable company/brand.  It was a great price for a pure oil, not a blend. I have applied this oil neat (straight out of the bottle) on sore muscles. The aroma soothes and the oil calms.  I only wish I had purchased a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> fantastic aroma and I highly recommend it to those who love a great and wonderful healing aroma</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very relaxing essential oil. It is also a very good oil to mix with others, such as wild orange.</li>
    <li> most NOW essential oils are good, but as an Aromatherapist, the Ylang Ylang falls way short.  it smells like it&#x27;s been cut with some sort of alcohol base.  very disappointed!</li>
    <li> good smell. nice to use and dont have to use much at all. would buy again although a little procey</li>
    <li> I have avoided buying Ylang Ylang in the past because of the cost. I was very happy with the reduced price of this product on Amazon. Also, when I received the product, I realized that the quality was amazing.</li>
    <li> I was afraid this was going to be another waste of money but it turned out great!  Decent quality and a great price.  Good deal:)</li>
    <li> I love NOW Foods essential oils.  That being said, this is Ylang Ylang Extra, which is from the first extraction.  Higher priced oils are from the fourth extraction because they contain less of a compound that may produce skin sensitivity to those with extremely sensitive skin.  I have slightly sensitive skin and have not had any issues.  Ylang Ylang has a very &#x27;unique&#x27; smell.  It reminds me slightly of black licorice mixed with a very sweet note.</li>
    <li> I like to keep this oil on hand and the NOW brand is the only Ylang Ylang Extra I&#x27;ve ever tried. I do believe it&#x27;s strong so it doesn&#x27;t require much at one time, but for me it is calming. I like the smell of it as long as I&#x27;m careful not to use too much. I&#x27;ve used many of the NOW brand essential oils through the years and have liked most all of them. Essential oils have so many great benefits and can be used in so many different ways to be of help from an alternative health standpoint.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I open this bottle but it smelled amazing even in the bottle. I know the oil is going to smell even better once I defuse it in either water or bath. The smell is fresh flowery and so pleasant I can&#x27;t wait to use it. Definitely would recommend and would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a high quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a ylang ylang (pronounced LANG LANG, I was told by a docent) tree at Marie Selby Botanical Garden in Sarasota. A few years ago I smelled this scent from the blossoms on that tree. I was smitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells exactly like those ylang ylang blossoms. Beware though -- a drop or two will do you, it&#x27;s very strong and could easily be cloying or overpowering.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received the new white labeled bottle instead of the old design. Definitely NOT disappointed about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is not just ylang ylang oil, but ylang ylang extra. I wasn&#x27;t aware of that when ordering, but was very pleased upon its arrival! Ylang ylang extra specifically is from the FIRST collection of the essential oil during distillation, making it of the highest quality. Each respective extraction of the oil (there are four total) lessens in quality/scent, so the first has the strongest scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use less than you think you&#x27;ll need, no matter what the application. This is strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for use in my homemade cosmetics and perfume, as well as aromatherapy. Fantastic oil, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am perplexed at how Now is selling 100% pure Ylang Ylang extra at this price. I can barely even get blended oils for this price. Glad, but perplexed. This is my second bottle. I put it in perfume blends and it makes a lovely, long-lasing note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wear it by itself because it reminds my husband of urinal cakes. More&#x27;s the pity. They ought to scent urinal cakes with something less delightful than Ylang Ylang.</li>
    <li> I know my essential oils including ylang ylang, but took a chance on Now brand because this was a generous amount at a good price. I now know why the price was good. This does not smell like ylang ylang but reeks of chemicals. The listing may say steam-distilled, but this product smells as if a toxic, chemical extraction process was used. I question if there can be any therapeutic uses for this (it&#x27;s certainly not aromatherapeutic as ylang ylang should be), and I&#x27;m also concerned about the source of the chemical odor and toxicity. Ylang ylang is generally used diluted or blended, but shouldn&#x27;t burn skin even undiluted; this oil burns the skin even when diluted. I wonder if this batch was compromised - something is certainly not right here. I&#x27;ve had other decent Now brand oils, but I think I&#x27;ll avoid them from now on. I&#x27;m sad to say this has been my first non-five-star review of my many Amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use in my first batch of soap...well, let me tell you, it sure did work! First, it is SUPER strong and it ate my Vanilla EO alive. A little will go a long way with this. I used 1oz of this with 1oz of vanilla EO and I had to leave it outside while mixing my oils b/c the smell was so potent. Soaps have cured now and still smell just like the Ylang Ylang (too bad I made myself sick of it while making the soap..lol) My point is that this is some quality stuff...so use in moderation :) At first when wafted out of the bottle the smell reminded me of shampoo but at it&#x27;s full potential and in the cured soap it smells more like black liquorish. Still gets 5 stars in my book for sheer quality.  It&#x27;s my own fault I didn&#x27;t use the proper amounts ;) I&#x27;d definitely give this a try again but using MUCH less in my recipe next time.  Makes me want to try other NOW oils.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT BUT SCENT IS STRONG</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this essential oil because of it&#x27;s smell or with any plans to use it in my oil diffuser, I purchased it for it&#x27;s amazing healing and conditioning properties! It arrived amazingly fast and having only used it once last night, I am hooked! When I woke up this morning my pores looked smaller, the overall tone/texture of my face was soft and dewy. I use all of Now Food&#x27;s essential oils and Ylang Ylang oil is known to help dry/mature skin or dry hair; I live in Oregon where the cold/altitude can be a little rough on my sensitive skin so this one is a keeper &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to add when making flax seed hair gel. It provides a wonderful sent and helps preserve the gel. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> You can also check this out in person at stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods w/ their samples. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better Ylang-Ylangs I&#x27;ve ever purchased, with clear floral scent.  A lot of companies are selling ylang-ylang that smells like petroleum, so I&#x27;m assuming it is coming from overseas in plastic barrels.  NOW is on of the brands I can always count on for purity.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful resource that I use for dandruff control. I place a drop or two in my shampoo once a week, and my dandruff is almost completely nonexistent. NOW Foods has always been my go-to for natural products!</li>
    <li> This is probably my favourite oil so far!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Seems to be pure. Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes as of yet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this does what people claim. My wife recently got into oils and has been mixing potions into little bottles. This stuff smells pretty gross, but it&#x27;s ok when blended with various nicer smelling oils. The best part is trying to say Ylang Ylang without reading a proper pronunciation. NOW is a very high quality brand and we always buy their vitamins and supplements. These oil bottles are very attractive. The labels are nicely designed and the oil inside seems to be high quality.</li>
    <li> I use this oil constantly to help relax and relieve stress. It smells great and really works. I trust NOW&#x27;s brand of oils, and have never had a bad product.</li>
    <li> I am always amazed at how much more reasonable it is to purchase things on Amazon. NOW brand products at my local health food store are so much more expensive. NOW is a quality brand and their essential oils are wonderful to blend in oils or use in diffusers.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be surprised to smell the strength in this, if you believe me!&lt;br /&gt;I looked at another review and seen that someone thinks it has a smell of alcohol, but I just had a baby and my sense of smell is WAY strong before hand, I don&#x27;t smoke neither and I do not detect any alcohol smell at all. It&#x27;s just a really strong smell from the oil, I think.</li>
    <li> This Ylang Ylang is very concentrated and has a great smell but does not overpower since you don&#x27;t need much. I added this to my homemade leave in treatment for my natural 4a hair and it helps keep it soft.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma of this oil</li>
    <li> Ylang ylang has such a fabulously entrancing scent, and supposedly has therapeutic values too. Now Foods products are always great, in my experience. I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.  The dropper is a built-in one, not a squeeze top, as can be seen in the photo, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I have an Ylang Ylang tree at less than one block from home, they are very common all around the city where I live. So I am very certain of how the flowers smell. And this oil is so close, my nose couldn&#x27;t tell any difference. Heaven&#x27;s sent. Delightful. I use it as the main ingredient to my &#x27;signature&#x27; perfume. BTW… Chanel # 5 is ANYTHING but Ylang Ylang.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t accidentally spill your bottle on the counter and forever have the smell of ylang ylang in your kitchen its a bit overbearing.  The size is enough to last me the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> i can only compare this to the much more expensive ylang ylang oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden, also sold here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick oil, which represents a thorough extraction process.  It&#x27;s also labelled as being \\&quot;extra\\&quot; which denotes the first (of four) extractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself was disappointing.  I use a number of different types of oil diffusers, and I found this one to be inferior to the scent from Eden&#x27;s Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase from this vendor again.  Bargains usually mean lesser quality.  So sure, i don&#x27;t doubt this is a first extraction, but I do wonder about the quality of the flowers used in the first place.</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell better, maybe as good as bergamon but it doesn&#x27;t. I think this Ylang Ylang kind of has a stinky smell.</li>
    <li> My neighbor loved the smell of this so much she swiped this. lol. I do need to replace it but haven&#x27;t as yet. Only got a quick whiff before it disappeared. I&#x27;ll hide the next bottle lol.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to help with his anxiety and other PTSD symptoms, but I think I&#x27;ve been using it more for me lately. It smells great. And I love to mix it with lavender and put a few drops in my bath</li>
    <li> Quite a strong yet pleasant e/oil to use in summer scents. Lotions, tinctures etc. hope your pkg arrives undamaged. Oil leaked out of the bottle damaging entire contents of shipment. as usual, amazon handled the situation admirably.</li>
    <li> Sweet smell and great product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I was very surprise of how few drops are required to achieve the aroma I was smelling for I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> Very nice and affordable. Not the purest Ylang Ylang out there but nice enough and soooooooo much more affordable than most.</li>
    <li> My significant other had extremely high blood pressure and was having trouble sleeping. To be fair, he is taking blood pressure meds, we have just about eliminated salt and have eliminated caffeine, and he has been going to a acupuncturist, in addition to using the ylang ylang, and his blood pressure is way, way down. But every night I have been putting 12 drops of ylang ylang and 8 drops of lavender into a misting machine, and we are both sleeping much, much better. He is snoring with 3 minutes of his head hitting the pillow.  We will soon be out of this, and I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This oil is fine and was cheaper than other brands. I did not notice a difference between this oil and another brand that supposed to be more pure.</li>
    <li> This has a very strong fragrance, one that I don&#x27;t particularly care for. And I included it in a hand lotion. Big mistake. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to still use it so it won&#x27;t be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works well in my lotions</li>
    <li> Love the slight floral scent.  I hate really strong, perfumy floral....but this was a very nice, calm, relaxing balance.  Not overwhelmingly strong, but will scent a room lightly pretty easily.</li>
    <li> I feel the quality of NOW Foods Essential Oils are equal to both DoTerra and YL at a fraction of the cost.  Very happy I found this brand.</li>
    <li> Ok, I can&#x27;t complain because the company send it as ordered.  They were very quick to send it as promised.  What I didn&#x27;t like was the odor but a lot of other people really like the smell.  So, maybe this is just me.  It&#x27;s a light floral smell, but I just can&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Ylang Ylang. Use it in my hair&amp;body oil, oil diffuser, perfume, deep conditioners, and homemade cleansers for a soft floral scent. I used to buy my oil from a different supplier, but NOw sold me on its first distillation oil. I use Ylang Ylang virtually every day since I use it in so many applications; and you cant beat NOWs prices for the quanitity &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, bought to add to my body butter.</li>
    <li> We had an ylang ylang tree growing up and the product smells just as fragrant as our ylang ylang flowers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try this to it&#x27;s fullest, but am hoping it helps my daughter with her high blood pressure! Thanks Amazon again for having Now products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the larger versions of this oil, but I&#x27;ve succeeded with Amazon.  This is by far my favorite odor and brand, as Now creates a more distinct and lasting oil.  I call it my &#x27;happy&#x27; oil as it creates such a wonderful ambiance with its smooth and pleasing scent.  Yes, I definitely recommend others buy this version as it was a very good price for the quantity received.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in combo with black coconut oil by Kuumba Made! Mmmm such a good combo ;)</li>
    <li> Oh! This smelled soooo delightful as I removed it from the package. Fast shipping A+++++</li>
    <li> Of the NOW oils I have in my collection, this is the least favorite.  It smells off from some reason, maybe I got this off a bad batch.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the smell of this oil. It does the job well. I love NOW products so I am sure I&#x27;ll be buying something else in the future.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
    <li> Smells like licorice jelly beans.</li>
    <li> NOW products are great.  They are always high quality.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the quality and price of NOW foods essential oils.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, huge size and great quality!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and it definitely is an aphrodisiac for me. Relaxing, yet arousing. My girlfriend likes it because it remindes her of the smell of a great flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than other oils, unfortunately ... but it is worth it, I think.</li>
    <li> good price for amount of ylang ylang oil . love the odour of it. emitting from our diffuser around the room.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is amazing.  Powerful and pure aroma - no trace of processing elements or fluids.  This oil is perfect as a deodorant straight out of the bottle (careful not to use too much - this is concentrated beauty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blends well with other organic products for hand lotion, hair shampoo or rinse - anywhere you need a good aroma.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I&#x27;m excited to use it in my handmade lotions and soaps. And it was a good price too. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for it as much as i thought i would...smell is too strong and soapy smelling, leaves me feeling nauseous. am afraid to try it on my skin or diffuser. Will stick with my other brand of oils for now. Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> Kind of smells like diapers to me.</li>
    <li> Loved this Ylang Ylang, was what I had hoped it would be and more. Will purchase this again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> very nice.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> NOW is a great product with good prices</li>
    <li> The scent is sweet and it lasts long when I put it on my candle melts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Most people love the scent, too. Mostly I use in diffuser.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing</li>
    <li> Used to cover up  the smell of my home remedy hair conditioners( eggs, olive oil, mayo). Also mix it with my unscented lotion when I want to smell pretty.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of the NOW Foods from this seller.  Most importantly, I love the scent.  It has a light, heavenly, floral scent, doesn&#x27;t have a heavy rose smell.  It has a plastic eye drop cap so you don&#x27;t accidentally pour too much out, and a screw on cover like the picture shows.  I wanted a larger bottle, and my previous purchases from Edens Gardens only offered .33 oz I used them all up too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add a few drops into my humidifier during winter and it brings a light, lovely scent in my home that&#x27;s not overpowering.  When I practice yoga or meditation, I&#x27;ll use my oil warmers to send a stronger fragrance in the room.  I&#x27;ve also purchased the Lavender and Clary Sage, and just a few drops goes a long way.  I also like to add essential oils to my massage oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived fast, 3-days free shipping.  Each bottle well wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged in a box, so nothing came cracked and nothing leaked.  I will add more of these essential oils to my collection as their selections grow.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact I know this is a strong and pure aromatherapy and it is a top notch oil all around, the scent is definitely not what Ylang Ylang is known to be.  It is not sweet or floral at all.  You just have to get used to it or maybe buy a more floral scent to mix into it in order to tolerate this one if it is too strong for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always happy with my Now stuff, at least so far. This Ylang Ylang is very potent, we use just a tiny bit for our mixes. May be too strong, but then again, it is &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am getting into the essential oils but don&#x27;t want to get sucked in to one of those Multi Level Marketing scams where they over charge for everything in order to fund the pyramid.  This is great quality without the annoying MLM pitches</li>
    <li> The smell is spot on, sweet and floral.. I get a whiff of banana from this too. Very nice. Superb value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils. This ylang ylang EO is no exception. I use these oils in natural soaps I make.</li>
    <li> I mix this with myrrh oil and apply it daily, the fragrance is calming and pleasant. I was buying Peace and Calming from Young Living but the prices are ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Growing up I remember Ylang Ylang, smells so pretty . I love mixing this with lavender essential oil in my oil diffuser! So relaxing and helps me sleep very well!will definitely order this again !</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived fast!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils to blend!</li>
    <li> Good for soapmaking...</li>
    <li> Nice product. As advertised.</li>
    <li> This ylang ylang oil smells wonderful, and I&#x27;ve used it for many purposes so far!  I put a few drops in my home made body wash, my essential oils face serum, and aromatherapy just to name a few uses.  After adding a few drops to my face serum, which has grape seed oil, lavendar, rose hip seed oil, frankincense, and lemon oil, I noticed a difference to my skin.  It feels tighter, and it adds a wonderful complementing scent to my serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live by a Whole Foods and constantly go and smell their essential oils often just for kicks when I&#x27;m shopping.  I smelled the aura cacia brand ylang ylang and went online to buy it through NOW because of the lower price.  The smells are comparable but the price is perfect!  I highly recommend this oil as well as NOW products!</li>
    <li> I used this to lightly scent hair and body products I gave at Christmas. It mixed exactly the way I wanted it to, and the smell is lovely. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Very strong flower smell. I get headaches if I use this</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. No damage to package or product. I LOVE THE SMELL. It&#x27;s my first time using this oil. I don&#x27;t know if I see any results as of yet but I sure do love it.</li>
    <li> Ylang Ylang! Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Concentrated, very powerful scent. Great for infusers and aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> Am a fan of oils and this oil I had a different reason for purchasing it... Had read about its afrodisiac quality and got it for my husband as we have date nights I introduced massages... Not sure if it worked according to my intention since even before we got 10 min into the massage we....;-)&lt;br /&gt;But I will say he has been using the oil before bed after showering and he has way smooth skin and sleeps well... I think it&#x27;s calming him in someway...  P.s I had used sweet almond oil as the base oil for the mix.</li>
    <li> I was suspicious of this ad to say the LEAST! But thought, even IF it&#x27;s a 3rd or 4th extraction formula,  it&#x27;s still a fair deal. BUT, this is NOT a 3rd or 4th extraction... THIS is Ylang-ylang Ylang-ylang EXTRA, the very FIRST extraction from the 4 phase process! Meaning, it&#x27;s the MOST potent, highest quality EO! So, it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;fair\\&quot; deal, it&#x27;s a SCREAMIN deal!!!</li>
    <li> good quality and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34; comes from the first distillation of the fragrant flowers, and thus most of this oil is composed of very volatile compounds. Be mindful that there is no clear definition of the time frame of &amp;#34;First&amp;#34; distillation (or Second and Third for that matter); it depends on the experience of the distillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I believe this oil is quite exquisite for the price. when you first apply, the aroma can be a bit sharp and overpowering, almost chemical like nail polish. This is due to its high concentration and volatility. Once you pass the first minute or so, the aroma mellows a bit, and the bouquet of sweetness and intoxication appears. I didn&#x27;t experience any allergy reaction applying a small amount directly on skin, though generally not recommended. The scent lingers quite a bit, easily for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my nose, there is a scent of spiciness and heaviness later on. I suspect that the oil may be distilled a bit longer that usual for &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34;. For perfume purpose, it may not be desirable to work with the &amp;#34;extra compounds&amp;#34; that may complicate the blending work. For aromatherapy purpose, this is not a problem at all. On contraire, it can be beneficial with the extra elements for the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For general use, this oil is more than adequate for most needs. However, if you require more specific distillation period of I, II, or III, this oil may not be the one for you.</li>
    <li> Better that most!!  So glad I bought this!!!!!!!  No regrets here!!!!  I may have to by some more...it&#x27;s superior!! Thanks  Oh and the packing was great and everything came as promised!</li>
    <li> Item as described, received on time.</li>
    <li> After having a really bad tension-inducing month I decided to experiment with some Ylang Ylang to try to knock my blood pressure down to manageable level.  So I applied a small drop of this to each pulse point on the wrists and into the crook of the elbows. That was about mid-afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wandered around for the rest of the day, yawning every five minutes until bedtime, then fell asleep with a violent hypnic jerk that threw one arm towards the ceiling with so much force that it actually flipped me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learned three things from this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is really good pure (and strong) Ylang Ylang oil that does exactly what is claimed for an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;2. NEVER use essential oils uncut.  Next time I need to lower my blood pressure, I&#x27;ll be cutting this with some grapeseed oil or something. My poor body thought it was dying when I finally lay down to sleep. I can live without that experience again.&lt;br /&gt;3. Four drops is too much. Twenty minutes later you will resemble the lead carcass from &amp;#34;Day of the Dead&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly.  So relaxing I love diffusing it all day long - takes me to a happy place :)</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!  Love it.  Good quality.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> I used this essential oil in a hair and body oil I created and I am ready to buy more! Just a few drops in my home made oil made the difference and it smell amazing to me , too! I read up on the uses fo this oil and the research held true. The thing I enjoy the most is that it only takes a few drops to get the results I want!</li>
    <li> This oil has a very nice smell. I place a few drops of it in addition to my lavender oil on my pillow. Although the smell does help relax me before sleeping, keep in mind that it is not a cure all. I purchased it while searching for a more holistic approach to combating my anxiety, in the hopes that it would significantly help to reduce my anxiety. Most likely naive thinking, future customers please keep in mind that if you suffer from anxiety/depression, this product is not a cure all when it comes to managing stress. Regardless, I love the smell and have incorporated it into my lotions. Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the Now Foods oils and I&#x27;m glad she told me about this one. The benefits are great.</li>
    <li> Not a pleasant scent, even though I normally enjoy this essential oil. I am now reluctant to order any others online.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  The smell is lovely.  I don&#x27;t get the licorice smell, but it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> This oil immediately became my #1 favorite essential oil in my kit. The smell is absolutely heavenly and addicting;  a smooth, lightly floral scent with a hint of spiciness and vanilla nuances. It is my go-to for perfume use, as well as for its therapeutic benefits. I place a few drops onto a small wooden bead and place into a small silver cage-style diffuser pendant and wear daily. It has very calming, comforting, uplifting effects and seems to aid in relieving symptoms of the blues. I will definitely be buying this oil again and again.</li>
    <li> a bit over powering stron not sweet like it shoud be,I certainly was very disapointed with this product,considering the quality of all the other essences</li>
    <li> I actually put a few drops in my cool mist humidifier and turn it on when i leave the house and come home to a wonderful scented home the natural way! A few drops goes a long long way!</li>
    <li> For the money, this stuff is amazing. Like the lavender NOW, this one gives you a bang for your buck. It&#x27;s strong in a good way and smells powdery and light at the same time.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I read some of the reviews about the smell of Ylang Ylang, but this one has a pleasant smell.</li>
</ol>
