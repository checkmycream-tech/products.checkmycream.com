<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is not as greasy as some products I have experienced before.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect and when I use it, I feel satisfied, and I feel confident when I use this product, I like this product</li>
    <li> Skingenixx is literally a drink of water to the skin. In the winter my under eye looks way more attractive because it literally hydrates away any lines. Makes me feel younger.. I can&#x27;t speak for dark circles and puffiness because that&#x27;s not my issue. But really takes away winter wrinkles that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I have a deep wrinkle on my forehead that developed with my last pregnancy. Skingenixx instant wrinkle repair worked OVERNIGHT. They hydrated my skin and my wrinkle was almost completely diminished the first use by the morning. I was amazed.</li>
    <li> This product actually works! Combined with their day cream , I have seen improvement in a short period of time. Better than any other wrinkle product out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now and I apply it before my moisturizer to give an extra glow to my skin. It also helps my foundation go on more smoothly. It is non-irritating to my sensitive skin, which is another reason I love it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because I was surprised to get instant results on my wrinkles and fine lines. I applied this product before going to bed and the next day, I couldnt believe what I was seeing. It&#x27;s incredible and really works. I think all of Skingenixx&#x27;s products are superior, but this is my favorite. It works immediately to hydrate my skin and creates a smooth, flawless complexion. It works.</li>
    <li> This product worked EXTREMELY well on those 11&#x27;s and forehead lines, as well as fine lines around the mouth. This product really does work instantly and my skin looks positively different.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re not looking older - you&#x27;re looking better! I am becoming a bonafide Skingenixx fan! I love the way this serum instantly minimizes my wrinkles and crow feet. A friend of mine came up to me and asked whether I had gone for some surgery or botox injection. I was so thrilled that she noticed how great my skin looks. I would recommend this product to both men and women</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month.  I believe I am starting to see results in my skin. I&#x27;ve faithfully used it each night and my skin is very soft and I am starting to see an overall improvement. My skin is hydrated, lines are softened and my skin glows.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum at a great price. Serum usually runs high in price. This not only helps keep your skin soft and firm but it&#x27;s a decent price. My husband even likes it! Definitely worth trying along with Skingenixx facial toner!</li>
    <li> I saw my fine lines disappear almost literally before my eyes )no pun intended! My crows feet are gone the skin around my eyes are firmer! Since purchasing the cream, I&#x27;ve been using it all over my face. I absolutely love this product. Wish I had found it sooner!</li>
    <li> I use this every night. It goes on thick and creamy, but it&#x27;s not greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and I have noticed my dark circles and puffiness decrease a little. More than anything, I&#x27;ve noticed the skin around my eyes looks very smooth and healthy and absolutely no dryness or cracked appearance.</li>
    <li> Super! Why get botox when you can buy this age defying product. My skin feels firmer and smoother in texture. I like it.</li>
    <li> While this is not a long term “fix” for wrinkles, what it does in just a couple of minutes is unreal. I honestly cant believe it..probably took 10 years of lines off my face instantly. If only it would stay that way forever!</li>
    <li> Have tried other \\&quot;top line\\&quot; serums and had allergic reactions and not liked sticky feeling. Age Defying Instant Lift Serum by Skingenixx not sticky, lasting feeling all day and received many comments wanting to know what I was using. My face has a nice healthy glow, improved pores and just feels so good. Do not wear foundation so this is perfect for bare skin. No more serum hunting. This is THE one! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the top line serums, but this is by far my favorite. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly. This softens my fine lines and smooths my pores. I am 43 with combination skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> This serum has truly turned out to be the &amp;#34;workhorse&amp;#34; of all of Skingenixx&#x27;s products! I&#x27;ve been using this since it was first presented, and the difference in my skin is remarkable! I love it! The serum soaks right in, has no scent and leaves no filmy/greasy residue on top of the skin. Actually feels so silky soft while it diminishes my &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines by making those areas of the skin even with the rest so that it&#x27;s very smooth, and what it does for my neck lines is just incredible! A major improvement! This is one serum I&#x27;ll never be without! Thanks Skingenixx</li>
    <li> Tried the sample that came in the mail got about 3 days out of it and saw a difference right away. I purchased the serum and have been using it for less than a week. I noticed the bumpy odd texture on my forehead has totally gone away. My foundation glides on over the product- Overall this is a great product! I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> Skingenixx has really worked on my wrinkles. I keep buying it because it really hydrates my eye area, I have really dry eyes &amp; skin. It gets the job done for me and a little goes a long way. This size lasts me about 6 months. I&#x27;m  really sure it does minimize the look of dark circles, shadows, and puffiness !!</li>
    <li> I  love this product. it smells amazing, like fresh lavender. I have some fine laugh lines that it has already reduced the appearance of with just one weeks use x2 per day. Skingenixx is worth every penny. and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now. After about a month of use I saw a definite difference in the lines around my mouth and between my eyes. There was a definite softening and tightening of texture. The real testament is that I lost my job in March so decided I could not afford this any longer as it was a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;. Well...after going a month without , I discovered this is no luxury..it is an essential! I asked for donations for my birthday so that I could buy a new one. I have had the new purchase and I am still using it...it has not run out!</li>
    <li> I use all of the Skingenixx products and love them.  Finally healthy products that really work at a reasonable price.  I love the Age Defying Instant Lift Serum.  A little bit goes a long way and you can feel it working (in a good way) as it seems to fill and lift (I am 59 years old, I need the lift).  What really impressed me also was how my large pores seem to disappear and my make up goes on very smooth.  This company really knows what they are doing and I can&#x27;t wait for it to go public so that I can buy stock in it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and really does work. Only use one pump--that is plenty for the face. I have used for a couple of days now and it is really working on the wrinkles and lines around the mouth area. I&#x27;m going to reorder now . Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Happy with the free sample!</li>
    <li> Very glad I&#x27;ve bought this.</li>
    <li> For the last few months, I&#x27;ve used this product in the daytime and I absolutely love it! It is very effective on my wrinkles and laugh lines and keeps my skin hydrated. I think it also helps my skin to better absorb my moisturizer. I think this is a great quality serum for those who are looking for a bit more moisture at a more reasonable price. I&#x27;m quite pleased with its performance and that results are instant!</li>
    <li> I love this! I first used it as a sample, dabbing just a little on the lines above my lips....it really made a difference. At 55 those pesky lines will never disappear but at least they are not nearly as visible. It is my magic potion now.</li>
    <li> I have mega sensitive skin and just simplified my skincare routine but decided to take a chance and try this Skingenixx product for new forehead wrinkles that started to bother me.  I have been using this product every morning for a week now, applying on clean face, waiting 10 - 15 minutes before putting on sunscreen, sometimes with and sometimes without make-up.  The pump dispenses just the right amount each pump and I have not experienced any irritation or redness or tightness.  As the day progresses, the area where I applied this serum still looks relaxed, natural looking and smoother.  I&#x27;m amazed -- Thank you Skingenixx!</li>
    <li> This really does lift and add volume to my skin. My wrinkles might be small but they are smoothed and taken care of with this. With daily use they are barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> I am 48 age..I felt guilty to join with young people because ma skin became rough and cracked..but after using skingenixx I felt happy..I am enjoying each moment in my life.</li>
    <li> Good for all skin types</li>
    <li> A treat for your skin</li>
    <li> daily routine every morning</li>
    <li> This is really the first wrinkle serum I&#x27;ve used where i can tell a difference instantly. Although in my early 30&#x27;s , I have started getting wrinkles from sun and wind damage being from the south and living in the mountains. I used chanel for a year or so and it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me the way this does. My skin looks great after using this for about a week and some days don&#x27;t wear foundation because I have really noticed a change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle last year when I notice i was starting to get a wrinkle line that was forming from the corner of my mouth…..starting to form what&#x27;s know as a marionette line. I applied the Skingenixx  wrinkle repair  religiously and the line has diminished!! I definitely would highly recommend this product and will never stop using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had some puffiness around my eyes regardless of how much sleep I&#x27;ve had so this product seemed to be just what I was looking for/needed. I have been VERY PLEASED with the results!! Only have used it for a couple days and I&#x27;ve noticed such a change with not only a reduction in puffiness but the look of undereye circle as well!! FANTASTIC product</li>
    <li> Read reviews and was hopeful. The bottle wasn&#x27;t full, so I had it for two weeks and was out. For that price, I expected more. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin and I followed the instructions. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I received a generous size sample of this product and loved it! I am now repurchasing the full size. It was not irritating and did not cause redness or dryness. The sample was not large enough to remove wrinkles, but I am giving it a shot. This is the first cream I have been truly impressed with in a long time!</li>
    <li> I have tried many more pricey products than this one and am left wondering why did I spend the money. For much less this product softens your skin, reduces the look of wrinkles and gives your skin a lovely glow without being greasy. I have not tried it in the winter when my skin gets very dry so will have to hold off on that comment but now in the spring, it is perfect for my normal skin.</li>
    <li> I was VERY impressed almost immediately by this product. My skin went from looking tired to younger and refreshed within an hour or so! It also seems to minimize any fine lines as well. Worth the investment! Try it for yourself and see!</li>
    <li> All I can say is if you are looking for results then get you some of this......</li>
    <li> I just received this product to provide my honest opinion and i have to say that his serum is divine and makes a big difference on my skin, i love that is not scented and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and my skin feels smooth and silky and just gorgeous, my skin looks better and it has diminished my acne scars and spots and it makes my skin oh so clean and I just love it so much that i am recommending this to all my friends and i will use this forever. Thank you very much for this perfection of a product.</li>
    <li> Skingenixx instant wrinkle repair works very well and my skin looks better with use. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28, have some smile lines and deep wrinkles in-between eye brows. This product makes them vanish. After a few days of use, my smiles lines went away as well. Unreal! magic potion.</li>
    <li> A very effective serum. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to avoid wrinkles in my eyes, and this is truly the best. It hydrates my skin more and the cracks due to the sun rays and other substances disappeared since I used it. My skin became more radiant and younger looking.</li>
    <li> I love Skingenixx&#x27;s poducts. I had tried this product as a sample in the mail. So far so good. It makes my skin feel wonderful. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so we will see how it helps with my lines and wrinkles, but I bet it will.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice now and I will continue to do so. I am in my mid 40s and have just started exploring &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; products. I have tried a couple of very expensive creams and, although I liked them, I had a hard time justifying the cost versus the results. I feel this product meets all of my demands - a fantastic product without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products and this one beats them all!! After trying this and reading all the reviews on the skingenixx products this will be the only brand I ever use. Results are quick. Give it a try you will love it!! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When the product was dispensed from the tube, it came out clear.  However, when applying to the skin it immediately became solid and you could not do anything with it.  The solidness of the product look like exfoliated, dead skin.  I returned the product.  I don&#x27;t know if the product was defective.</li>
    <li> I love this product especially that it works instantly. I got this product two days ago and half an hour later, I could swear my wrinkles and laugh lines have diminished. I plan on using this product forever because I can tell my skin will never look old again .</li>
    <li> Wow I was going to get some Botox and I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at the results it has changed the way I look of course it&#x27;s temporary but wow.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to get a discount for my honest unbiased opinion and have not been influenced in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I give  5 stars</li>
    <li> I have used them all, affordable to expensive without results...but not this time. SKingenixx&#x27;s products deliver. I use the complete line now. My skin looks smoother, lines less noticeable and glowing. It is worth every penny and them some. I am so glad I had a sample of this product which gave me the opportunity to try it out.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that will give you results instantly. I have been using for 6 days and TRY to be good about it (put it on daily). The other night, as I am applying, I realize I don&#x27;t know where to put it b/c the expression lines around my mouth are gone! I was blown away! I look better at 42 than I did at 35 (had to look at an old pic).</li>
    <li> I use this before going to the gym. (I&#x27;m a fitness instructor). It&#x27;s light weight and gives me a little glow. I give myself a little facial massage every morning with this product. Especially around my eye area. It just glides over my 50 year old skin. I love this product. Third time purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars, because I tried so many other under eye creams (even for men!), with NO difference. This one gave me some noticeable difference in only a minute, so it gets 5 stars just because it works in general!</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams both over the counter and at the cosmetic counter, and this one is by far the best one. I use it both morning and night and notice the difference if I run out and use something else. If you need extra moisturizing eye cream, this is the one to try!</li>
    <li> I do notice when I use this product my overall facial skin looks tighter.</li>
    <li> I receive this as a free sample and it is amazing. I wish I could post a before and after. It fills in ALL the lines on my face in a couple of minutes, and lasts all day.</li>
