      <li>It works extrmely good and its scar free acne treatment.</li>
      <li>Use a good moisturizer that is oil free or says non- comodogenic</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice sized, easy to access tub.</li>
      <li>, he wanted more of it.</li>
      <li>Your better off buying clearsil from Walgreens&lt;br</li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>Most fragrance is BS cover up you don&#x27;t need anyway.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>I have used products with sulphur before, and this is much more soothing on my skin.</li>
      <li>What more do you need i use it in combination with the sulfur cooling mask...</li>
      <li>They love it.</li>
      <li>I really do love this</li>
      <li>I need more time to see results before I can give a better rating.  </li>
      <li>My son thinks he has had better</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>This is totally amazing shipping was extremely fast and it works like magic!</li>
      <li>Take your time to apply by massaging it into CLEAN skin (and on that note, take the time to wash your face - - count to 60!).  </li>
      <li>I ordered because of the great reviews and at the time I was looking for something to clear up my breakout.</li>
      <li>Cheap is not always better.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is paraben free.</li>
      <li>Not so easy for teenagers to understand</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, works well under makeup, and it does not overdry my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely a strong smell</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell, but after 2 uses I can see a huge improvement with my acne.</li>
      <li>I am having the fabulous 30 break outs.</li>
      <li>And it hasn&#x27;t been light acne.  </li>
      <li>worked well, but wasn&#x27;t paraben free</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>What I know for sure is that Ultraclear is for real; it worked wonders for my acne problems!</li>
      <li>Both my teenage son&#x27;s have been using this product with great success.</li>
      <li>This has worked great for me and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some spot treatments.</li>
      <li>I need something with more drying up power, but might be ok for light acne and white heads.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as bad</li>
      <li>and I just generally feel better!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for good result but for adult acne, I guess was worth a shot anyway.</li>
      <li>For the price, it is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>I think Neutrogena Clear Gel or even Clearasil works better.</li>
      <li>far I am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>You will get used to it, but you&#x27;ll smell of sulfur until they finally come out with a kind without it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Shipping was pretty quick</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my skin appears a bit better than normal and someone at work even commented as much to</li>
      <li>and though my hives are gone (courteous of me taking acne hormone pills) the SAME EXACT acne on my chin and forehead is still popping up even when using this product 3x a day.</li>
      <li>good due to the tremendous success of this product I decided esperimentar, said he takes even blemishes and pimples, then I will use to see, thanks.</li>
      <li>I have use this item a hand full of time don&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
      <li>This cream is mild, yet it really seems to work.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizers fine a bit of a greasy feel in the morning,but didn&#x27;t radically clear up my skin like it seems to have done for others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to wear tank tops again!</li>
      <li>so I bought this because of all the stellar reviews and people saying OH EM</li>
      <li>Drink it on an empty stomach and drink warm water throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Many dermatologists later, on and off medications, trying all the products that I could find over the years...  </li>
      <li>In the first week of use I have noticed improvement in my teenagers skin.</li>
      <li>I am still not acne free, but it has made a clear difference.  </li>
      <li>You should ideally do a combination of actions; for instance I changed my nutrition plan and I stopped eating a list of trouble food such as chocolates and oily meals.</li>
      <li>and already she is seeing results, positive that is.  </li>
      <li>Make sure do know it is a cream and not an acne wash as the post does not clearly state.</li>
      <li>This product is just full of parabens, and if you are one of the unlucky with sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll want to try something else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had moisturizers with far less pleasant smells, truth be told.</li>
      <li>I can also smell the tea tree oil in it, and its a strong smelling essential oil</li>
      <li>Smells like pure sulfur.</li>
      <li>and they didn&#x27;t help much,</li>
      <li>My skin is so much clearer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product for right price</li>
    <li> See my other review. This worked great for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Mom thinks money grows out my backside so she is using the $300 Rx cream with no better results and harsh side effects.</li>
    <li> It was alittle drying, but it worked</li>
    <li> This stuff really stinks. Smells like pure sulfur. Did not help with my acne. It seemed like it made it worse. You can&#x27;t put it all over your face because it makes it feel sticky and the smell. But what may not work for one; may work for another.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this  cream.  It does have a strong smell, but after 2 uses I can see a huge improvement with my acne. If you can get passed the smell, it does help!</li>
    <li> Make sure do know it is a cream and not an acne wash as the post does not clearly state.</li>
    <li> burns a little  but works well</li>
    <li> I wanted both my son (13) and I (40s) to use this product for a bit before writing up a review. I need to note that this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son said he did not like the scent and while I found him a bit over-dramatic about it, I will note that there is a bit of an odd smell to the cream. For me, it faded within a few minutes and it certainly isn&#x27;t something that would keep me from using the item. I&#x27;ve had moisturizers with far less pleasant smells, truth be told. My son has been having real issues with breaking out, especially on his forehead and cheeks, which I suppose is typical for many his age. He uses this after washing his face in the shower at night and I do see a genuine difference in recent days. I do not break out nearly as badly as he does, but I have trouble with blackheads and simply less than stellar skin. I have noticed that my skin appears a bit better than normal and someone at work even commented as much to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I am pleased with the results. I often have trouble finding creams that are effective on my oily skin and the fact that it seems to be doing its job not only for me but also for my teen-aged son? I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if this clearing trend continues. I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed because my face became itchy and I had big bumps on my face. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I order this product to test this after reading about all the great feedback this item got.honesty this really works it made my big acne and little bumps disappear</li>
    <li> worked well, but wasn&#x27;t paraben free so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift and so far it is working.</li>
    <li> I have use this item a hand full of time don&#x27;t really care for the smell but it has help with clearing up my acne.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this stuff smells amazing!!!! It doesn&#x27;t burn and it has not bleached any of my clothes or sheets (so far).  It is easy to apply, works well under makeup, and it does not overdry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product, I will continue to buy it!!</li>
    <li> I need more time to see results before I can give a better rating.  I will keep using it hoping to see all the blemishes disappear.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my acne. I need something with more drying up power, but might be ok for light acne and white heads.</li>
    <li> This product is great! My skin is so much clearer and I just generally feel better! Normally I have struggled with using acne treatments because they leave my face either super oily or very dry and this does neither! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teen boy with an acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff for about a week and it only made my acne worse. It also felt sticky on my skin. The active ingredients are tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and sulfur. I had tried all of these before I bought this product and they didn&#x27;t help much, but I thought I&#x27;d try all three together. It didn&#x27;t  help, it hurt. If you are a teen boy looking for something that will help your skin and you&#x27;ve tried this type of stuff before, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my back and shoulders 3 times over the past week. Already the bumps and small cysts are smoothing out. I have used products with sulphur before, and this is much more soothing on my skin. The smell takes time to get used too, but I usually wash it off in the morning. I&#x27;m ready to wear tank tops again!</li>
    <li> I  AM A (64) YEAR OLD WITH ADULT ACNE. HAVE TRIED ALOT OF PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I  HAVE FOUND SO FAR. THIS PRODUCT IS NICELY PACKAGED AND CONVEINIENT TO USE. IT IS VERY CREAMY AND TAKES VERY LITTLE TO DO  THE  JOB.  i  HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> It does help with the acne, but it doesn&#x27;t make acne mark dissapear.</li>
    <li> This stuff is greasy and smells horrible, made me break out even more than before</li>
    <li> product arrived on time. Will not reorder/product did not clear up my acne. I ordered because of the great reviews and at the time I was looking for something to clear up my breakout. This product did nothing that the reviews stated .GOOD  LUCK if you chose to buy. The joke was on me.</li>
    <li> To give you an idea of how much it helped my face, consider that on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is really bad acne and 10 is only &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, I vacillate between 3 and 5, even in my fifties.  Ultraclear Acne Cream took me to a solid 7 within a week, freeing me from enough of my self-consciousness to post a Linked In photo.  Although I continue to be blemished, I am past the threshold of fearing curious children or judgmental strangers.</li>
    <li> My 13yr old daughter has been using it consistently for three weeks and we haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in her skin.</li>
    <li> The cream was a little smelly and unpleasant but that can be masked by other lotions, also I didnt see much of a difference when I was using it. It would clear up some but not all of the acne.</li>
    <li> good due to the tremendous success of this product I decided esperimentar, said he takes even blemishes and pimples, then I will use to see, thanks.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product. As someone who has had persistent acne from ages 13-25 I have tried ever product under the sun including dermatological prescription topical creams. I can see a marked improvement in my skin after a week of use and it is also helping clear some of my scarring. I don&#x27;t love the smell but I love having clearer skin!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works quickly and a little bit goes a long way!!! Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I get hormone acne and it can get horrible. I use this to help keep that at bay and to clear up my current problems. Start using this faithfully and you will see results also. Just be sure to use a good moisturizer. After a few uses I did notice some drying out. Its a small like tub that it comes in, you dont need a whole big gob on your face, I use a small amount and still seeing results.</li>
    <li> Hardly any breakouts since using. We shall see. Have been using twice or day for 2 weeks and any new bumps are gone in 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> HA! Okay so I bought this because of all the stellar reviews and people saying OH EM GEE THIS WAS AMAZEBALLS! It&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a wee lass (I&#x27;m from California, not sure why I wrote that, but I&#x27;m running with it), and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams and contraptions to rid myself of the acne demon. Finally, I got things under control with some Aveeno facewash that cleared everything up! Then I moved to Phoenix where we have air quality warnings every three seconds and I broke out again like a tween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this stuff and it made it worse. I am pretty sure that instead of medicating the problem away, it clogged my pored because it is SO thick.  My skin didn&#x27;t try out, nope. I didn&#x27;t turn red and itch, not once. Instead, my forehead started looking like the Rocky Mountains (and I haven&#x27;t broken out on my forehead in a decade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and bought some Neutrogena Spot stuff that works SO well. I would recommend spending the few extra bucks on that than waste your money on this business.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but have a really bad smell to it</li>
    <li> This product is very good.It will take less time to erase your acne marks and also protect your skin from acne simultaneously.</li>
    <li> My daughter has teenage acne and it hasn&#x27;t worked on her. I occasionally have a pimple or two, and I&#x27;ve tried this it hasn&#x27;t worked to shrink or heal them.  I think Neutrogena Clear Gel or even Clearasil works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and it has worked on a couple pimples</li>
    <li> This product works if you wash your face and apply as directed.  Not so easy for teenagers to understand but with some reminding it cleared up her skin.  Does not smell so great but hey... if it works who cares?  It draws out the acne from under the skin overnight.  We were both shocked to see what was drawn to the surface.  We recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and it seems to have really helped me.  I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for over 30 years - - I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  And it hasn&#x27;t been light acne.  Many dermatologists later, on and off medications, trying all the products that I could find over the years...  This cream is very nice and I use it in conjunction with a moisturizer that is meant for acne-prone skin.  A little goes a very long way.  Take your time to apply by massaging it into CLEAN skin (and on that note, take the time to wash your face - - count to 60!).  I do not smell anything wrong with it as others have written.  For the price, it is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This product actually works, BUT  as soon as I went a couple of days without using it my acne would come back. I just have some hormonal (Adult) acne on both my cheeks, and it did help with only stopping the new ones from coming but not the scars. I think its a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a temporary fix to your acne, but not as a product that legit clears it up.</li>
    <li> My son thinks he has had better</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Very amazing!! I&#x27;m really happy!!</li>
    <li> My son, my daughter and I tried this cream and it did not help our acne.  Too bad, it would have been nice.</li>
    <li> This product is just full of parabens, and if you are one of the unlucky with sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll want to try something else. I learned a long time ago on my own and by researching it on the net, that parabens(even though some are anti-fungal) can actually irritate your skin and make it worse if used over time, and some of these parabens can actually cause cancer in high volumes. Not a comforting thought. But to remain strictly cosmetic here, these parabens can make your skin worse and are unnecessary chemicals. Cheap is not always better. I have been using AcneFree for 3 years(I do not use some of their products which contain parabens). That seems to work more than anything else, and my skin is extremely picky. My point though, steer clear of parabens when buying any skin product, be it shampoo, body wash, face wash, lotion, etc. Parabens are bad, bad, bad!</li>
    <li> Both my teenage son&#x27;s have been using this product with great success. We are very pleased with the results. I would recommend it! After a week my son&#x27;s face was clear!!</li>
    <li> No results been using for a week</li>
    <li> Excellent product, worked as described, didnt stain my pillow which is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have been having extremely bad acne for the past year, family and friends would always ask me what was wrong with my face (It looked like hives.) I&#x27;m guessing its been a reaction to the stress I have been under going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING has been able to help but a old recipe my aunt made up from Jamaica, but its hard to get the ingredients and I&#x27;m running out, so I though I&#x27;d go ahead and give this try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really make a BIG difference its been 2 weeks now and though my hives are gone (courteous of me taking acne hormone pills) the SAME EXACT acne on my chin and forehead is still popping up even when using this product 3x a day. Your better off buying clearsil from Walgreens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Shipping was pretty quick</li>
    <li> In the first week of use I have noticed improvement in my teenagers skin. Definitely helping!</li>
    <li> I have only just received this so i will have to update in a few weeks. I am having the fabulous 30 break outs. I am hoping this helps with that. the smell and cosistancy are goo and I love that it is paraben free. I will update after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I have hormonal blemishes that pop up every month. This treatment has been a miracle for me. It clears the blemish so fast and does not dry my skin out. The only negative is the smell, but any treatment that has sulfur in it can&#x27;t smell good. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has worked great for me and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some spot treatments.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. The smell wasn&#x27;t great. I was really hoping for good result but for adult acne, I guess was worth a shot anyway.</li>
    <li> It helped a little bit.  I liked it because it helps in moisturizing my face.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but my son said it did not work for him.! Not every product works for everyone. Thank you anyway</li>
    <li> Definitely a strong smell but it seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> ordered this for a friend, it works so well, he wanted more of it.</li>
    <li> This product worked almost overnight for my two granddaughters. They love it. They said it is the best product they have tried for acne. We will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It does have a sulphur odor but seems to control or shorten the life of the zit.</li>
    <li> This cream has done nothing for me. I&#x27;m switching back to Proactive.</li>
    <li> This product stands by its statement. Does what it says. Yes it has parabens but if it works i dont care. It works extrmely good and its scar free acne treatment. What more do you need i use it in combination with the sulfur cooling mask...and this as spot treatment and at night. Use a good moisturizer that is oil free or says non- comodogenic and you are good to go. You have really bad acne like me. See it go everyday. Also works great if you take vitamin b supplements. Having cleansing from inside and outside. Try doing a detox once a week to get garbage out of your stomach. I take picture of my face every month. To see progress ...beleive me i am progressing well. I will tell a simple detox....A 1/2 glass orange juice squeezed with hot water 1/2 glass ,1/2 teaspoon red pepper and pinch of salt. Drink it on an empty stomach and drink warm water throughout the day. You will love it. All the best!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Grandson. When I saw him his face was all broke out. The next time I saw him after he used this for 2 weeks his face was clear. I was so happy and so was he!</li>
    <li> This really works. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  I am much too old to be dealing with acne, and harsh products dry and irritate my skin.  This cream is mild, yet it really seems to work.  I am still not acne free, but it has made a clear difference.  I am still not sure what is in this product, or how it works, but it does seem to be working.</li>
    <li> I have old age acne and this cleared it up and reduced pore size. No harsh drying either. Bit of a chemical smell but I can live with that for clear skin. Most fragrance is BS cover up you don&#x27;t need anyway.</li>
    <li> Works, but I hate the smell!</li>
    <li> So, last year I took a lot of gym supplements and I had a reaction to one and my face has not been the same ever since... Last year my face was covered!! and I mean, covered, in acne.... It&#x27;s not nearly as bad but I still had acne that would never go away.. and even down my neck from where I sweat... My face is pretty much COMPLETELY clear. I use this religiously and swear by it. I seriously tried everything.. I use this with about 30 minutes after I do a aztec indian mask (which is also just as equally amazing.) anyway, after using these two miracle products.. my face is COMPLETELY clear after less then a week of use. (saw results after two days.) I am also not one to leave reviews, ever... but I thought this was too amazing not to.</li>
    <li> This seems to actually be doing its job, so far. It comes in a nice sized, easy to access tub. It has a noticeable sulfur smell to it, and that smell can linger a little after it&#x27;s applied to skin, but it goes away soon. I can also smell the tea tree oil in it, and its a strong smelling essential oil but it doesn&#x27;t mask the sulfur smell. This is a pretty thick and heavy cream, and I was worried that it would be too much for my oily skin, but it seemed to slow down the oil production and reduced shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin(mostly oily) that is acne prone.I use this twice a day, and during the first few uses, this made my skin look dry, but that went away quickly. This does a great job at moisturizing my skin and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I have acne marks that look like they may be slowly fading. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts, and sometimes I can fell one coming, but this slows it down and makes it go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this seems to be doing its job. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in months.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as advertised and a bit harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> The product works great. You just need to remember to use it twice a day. The only drawback is the sulfur smell. You will get used to it, but you&#x27;ll smell of sulfur until they finally come out with a kind without it.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that i hate the smell. It only last for a few minutes but it stinks! Oh well at least my skin is all clear now. It has been a month since I&#x27;ve used it and a little goes a long way. I would not buy this again though even if it cleared my skin it irritated a little. Well I like it overall.</li>
    <li> This is totally amazing shipping was extremely fast and it works like magic! I&#x27;m 14 and have used it for about 4 days my skin is almost completely clear I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne and blackheads it wasn&#x27;t terrible but it was irritating for me. The first day I used this it calmed my skin down a lot and made it look better overall. Every time I use it now I am getting better results and you really don&#x27;t need a lot of product the smells kind of bad but it wears off when you rinse and its only like one step you put it on then rinse it off, but your face has to be clean and dry to use it. I really do love this and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great acne cream!  Doesn&#x27;t over dry your face, comparable to Proactive!</li>
    <li> amazing! having &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; this product has helped wonders!</li>
    <li> My teen daughter used as directed, didn&#x27;t work. Tossed it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a family member and she loves it.  It was just rec&#x27;d 7/31/14 and already she is seeing results, positive that is.  I would recommend this product and order again, if necessary.  The shipping was great, too.</li>
    <li> Not much help for me unfortunately. It moisturizers fine a bit of a greasy feel in the morning,but didn&#x27;t radically clear up my skin like it seems to have done for others. I replied to the company e-mails on my results, never heard back. Not sure if I can return it now.</li>
    <li> It broke my daughter out she got ringworm on her face!!!!!! I read the reviews stating how amazing it was........ and it wasn&#x27;t!!!!! I wasted my money and now she is going back on epiduo!!!!!  I do not recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works if you are diligent in washing your face and putting it on EVERY night before bed. One bonus? It doesn&#x27;t bleach the bedding like other acne products.</li>
    <li> IT MAY WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE. DID NOTHING FOR ME!</li>
    <li> Ultraclear is definitely a 5 star cream! Actually its name describes it all. I have been trying to treat acne for quite a long time. Once I discovered &amp; used this product my problem was gone! You should ideally do a combination of actions; for instance I changed my nutrition plan and I stopped eating a list of trouble food such as chocolates and oily meals. Then of course each person is different. What I know for sure is that Ultraclear is for real; it worked wonders for my acne problems!</li>
