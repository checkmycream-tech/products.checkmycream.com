      <li>I believe the pharmaceutical grade salt and the very precise salt/sodium bicarbonate ratio makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>But i found a better option that neti pot which is cumbersome for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to breathe at night like a baby.</li>
      <li>I love the packets.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am breathing better and more fully than ever before.</li>
      <li>Great product and it really works.</li>
      <li>You will get a better product for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Since I am from Texas I can&#x27;t quite force myself to use a neti pot, so I just mix up a batch from the easy packets in a glass of water every morning stick the ole schnoz in and start snorting the saline mixture thru my nasal cavity and spitting it out of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a neti pot before but it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>The Neti Pot directions say to use table salt &amp; that&#x27;s been working just fine.  </li>
      <li>I think when it gains more popularity, it will be more reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>High quality saline, love it!</li>
      <li>I intend to continue to use this product on a weekly basis to keep my sinuses free and clean.</li>
      <li>Having the little premeasured packets, which are so easily stored in the bathroom, is just incredibly convenient.</li>
      <li>But this stuff works like a charm and keeps my nose clean.</li>
      <li>and I really do believe I&#x27;m sleeping better.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>They dissolved quickly and worked just as advertised.</li>
      <li>but I quickly became used to it.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, no problems, wondered why refill is not eligible for free shipping like neti pot is.</li>
      <li>I no longer buy or take allergy remedies except as a rare measure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural, healthy way to fight allergies that I would recommend to anyone.  </li>
      <li>I know it might be fun to suffer day-to-day with the jitters, drowsiness, and cotton mouth</li>
      <li>Anyways does what it advertises which is the point, right?</li>
      <li>It works all right.</li>
      <li>mixed with 8 ounces of distilled water, there was no stinging whatsoever and about 10 minutes afterwards, my sinuses felt as good as new.  </li>
      <li>The salt is easy to mix and keeps my sinuses clear.  </li>
      <li>I have taken over the counter and precription medications, herbal remedies, old and wise home remedies and now after 48 years of age I have discovered what my granfather and father used for their entire lives to cure sinus problems including allergies.  </li>
      <li>It is best to use Morton Coarse Kosher Salt or Springfield plain salt because table salt may have unwanted additives.</li>
      <li>For first time users, the feeling I got during use was like getting water in your nose when you are in the swimming pool.</li>
      <li>This sinus cleansing has been a real life-saver!  </li>
      <li>The instructions are clear and detailed.</li>
      <li>the sinu-cleanse saline refills really work well, the price was well worth it for some relieve of sinus pressure, the service was fast.</li>
      <li>The saline colution allows one to wash out both nasal and sinus cavities without the sting of chlorine of tap water; It also helps to clean mildly clogged Eustation tubes (these ubes are in your inner ear).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go, no more of that mediciney feeling for me.</li>
      <li>Pretty decent and gets the job done, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m getting ripped off for packets of salt.</li>
      <li>A real solution for my sinus problem.</li>
      <li>but when I do get sinus problems I find nasal irrigation really helps.  </li>
      <li>The product is gentle and I get results.</li>
      <li>I used to have very sore nasal canals with scabs from the bleeding etc.  </li>
      <li>This really worked.  </li>
      <li>If you have stuffed sinuses or allergies, using this really relieves all symtoms.</li>
      <li>This salt was way too intense for me.  </li>
      <li>These packets are very convenient and soothing.  </li>
      <li>It really seems to help.</li>
      <li>but when i do use it, it really clears my sinuses.</li>
      <li>I have used every prescription and over the counter meds known to man kind to help me with my year round allergies.  </li>
      <li>I am addicted to the practice since it makes my day so much better, my life better.</li>
      <li>Clean and simple, just the way we like it!  </li>
      <li>Not only are the packets much more convenient and due to pharmaceutical regulations, are very precise in their NaCl and NaHCO3 ratios---the salt granules are much smaller than either Morton&#x27;s or the Himalayan sea salt.  </li>
      <li>Recommend highly if you have sinus problems.</li>
      <li>Reccomend it highly.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.     </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for people with sinus problems or allergies with a nasal component.</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean our your nasal cavity, it can help clear out if you have irritation, allergies and congestion.</li>
      <li>Recently I had a stubborn sinus infection, however, that affected the right side of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a regular netti pot user and I&#x27;ve been using sinucleanse from the time a friend of mine first introduced me to it years ago.</li>
      <li>, this one however is very hard for me to use, not only is it intense, but it leaves a kind of after-burn.</li>
      <li>I bought these refill packs because my SNT doctor recommended I used a natural sinus wash after my sinus infection surgery.</li>
      <li>roughly 12 cents a packet, they are worth it just for the convenience alone.  </li>
      <li>these inevitably cause (NOT!), but I prefer to use a method of relief that leaves me feeling normal.  </li>
      <li>Breathe constantly through your mouth...and turn your head and pour...if you aren&#x27;t breathing constantly through your mouth, you will feel like you are drowning or be too scared to really pour the water through...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and dissolves well.  Definitely recommend for a purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the packets. I used to make my own salt mixture, and it often burned...though it worked. This mixture however does the job without the burn and discomfort. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Great product and it really works. I had been having frequent and painful headaches, but since using this product, my headaches have subsided. What a great relief to be free of pain! I intend to continue to use this product on a weekly basis to keep my sinuses free and clean.</li>
    <li> Neti Pots are a must, they provide instant relieve from cold and flu symptoms, such as sinus pressure, and they also help w/ pet, and other allergy issues.  They provide relieve in about 60 seconds start to finish.   These Sinus Packs were great.  They dissolved quickly and worked just as advertised.</li>
    <li> My husband frequently has sinus trouble and I was directed to SinuCleanse by a friend.  My husband loves it and it helps him greatly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m a chronic allergy sufferer, and nothing, not even prescription Flonaze, works to keep my nose clear, so I can actually breathe. But this stuff works like a charm and keeps my nose clean. Twice a day and I&#x27;m good to go, no more of that mediciney feeling for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the solution to use with my neti pot, but it&#x27;s really not necessary.  The Neti Pot directions say to use table salt &amp; that&#x27;s been working just fine.  I found when I used this solution it made my eyes water &amp; gave my sinuses a tingly sensation.</li>
    <li> I bought the SinuCleanse Saline solution together with a ceramic Netti Pot.  The saline colution allows one to wash out both nasal and sinus cavities without the sting of chlorine of tap water; It also helps to clean mildly clogged Eustation tubes (these ubes are in your inner ear). This imparts great health benefits by keeping your sinus cavities clean.</li>
    <li> I switched to Kosher salt after using this solution for a week.  The stinging sensation was uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The price is a bait and switch hoping you don&#x27;t notice the OUTRAGEOUS price charged for shipping  Don&#x27;t be a sucker; search and get this for about 5 bucks  Shame Jeff!</li>
    <li> That is what SinuCleanse helps you take.  It was a little scary at first but it worked perfect and has helped with my allergies and sinus issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different remedies for the sinus congestion caused by my allergies.  I know it might be fun to suffer day-to-day with the jitters, drowsiness, and cotton mouth these inevitably cause (NOT!), but I prefer to use a method of relief that leaves me feeling normal.  This sinus cleansing has been a real life-saver!  As long as I cleanse once a day with the saline solution, I find the congestion doesn&#x27;t get any worse and actually improves over time.  It&#x27;s a natural, healthy way to fight allergies that I would recommend to anyone.  These saline packets are the reason it is so effective!  I&#x27;ll be using these for the foreseeable future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a neti pot before but it is easy to use. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but when i do use it, it really clears my sinuses. For first time users, the feeling I got during use was like getting water in your nose when you are in the swimming pool. The only down side is that my nose gets really dry afterward.</li>
    <li> I rarely get sick but when I do get sinus problems I find nasal irrigation really helps.  Recently I had a stubborn sinus infection, however, that affected the right side of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I was using Morton iodized salt + baking soda.  This would always sting a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my sinus infection remained after a few days I tried using the other salt I had in my house---pink Himalayan sea salt (non-iodized).  This was even worse than the Morton iodized salt, since the granules were larger and would not dissolve readily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to King Sooper&#x27;s (local grocery store) and bought these pre-mixed packets instead (along with a gallon of distilled water).  What a difference!  Not only are the packets much more convenient and due to pharmaceutical regulations, are very precise in their NaCl and NaHCO3 ratios---the salt granules are much smaller than either Morton&#x27;s or the Himalayan sea salt.  They dissolve instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mixed with 8 ounces of distilled water, there was no stinging whatsoever and about 10 minutes afterwards, my sinuses felt as good as new.  My sinus swelling noticeably had diminished and it didn&#x27;t feel like I had residual salt left in them like I did with my homemade concoctions.  I believe the pharmaceutical grade salt and the very precise salt/sodium bicarbonate ratio makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At roughly 12 cents a packet, they are worth it just for the convenience alone.  But I&#x27;d recommend them just for the superior quality over homemade mixtures.</li>
    <li> These packets are very convenient and soothing.  Easy to travel with.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> From WebMD.    [...]    \\&quot;The irrigating solution can be made by adding two to three heaping teaspoons of non-iodized (does not sting) salt to one pint of room temperature water. It is best to use Morton Coarse Kosher Salt or Springfield plain salt because table salt may have unwanted additives. To this solution, add one teaspoon of baking soda.\\&quot;    Just do it yourself. You will get a better product for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought these refill packs because my SNT doctor recommended I used a natural sinus wash after my sinus infection surgery. Pretty decent and gets the job done, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m getting ripped off for packets of salt. Anyways does what it advertises which is the point, right?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great along with my \\&quot;netty\\&quot; pot.  Works wonderfully on my sinuses.  Recommend highly if you have sinus problems.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Oprah a few years ago and always wanted to try it. I ended up buying it about a month ago and I must say I am very pleased with it. Not only does it clean our your nasal cavity, it can help clear out if you have irritation, allergies and congestion. I would recommend to everyone, especially for those who like a certain extra curricular activity related to the nose!</li>
    <li> I thought it was just a gimmick, but with my sinus being so bad this year, I would try anything. I am shocked that something so simple can make such a difference. I am breathing better and more fully than ever before. Saving \\&quot;OD\\&quot;ing on sinus medication just to get \\&quot;some relief\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This salt was way too intense for me.  I had been using another brand&#x27;s packets and they worked just great, this one however is very hard for me to use, not only is it intense, but it leaves a kind of after-burn.</li>
    <li> I have used every prescription and over the counter meds known to man kind to help me with my year round allergies.  Nothing has helped me the way SinuCleanse and their Neti Pot has.  I cant tell enough people about this.  ITS AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, no problems, wondered why refill is not eligible for free shipping like neti pot is.</li>
    <li> I have been using SinuCleanse for 1 month.  It has reduced my suffering from allergies, a cold, sinus headache and I really do believe I&#x27;m sleeping better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular netti pot user and I&#x27;ve been using sinucleanse from the time a friend of mine first introduced me to it years ago. The product is gentle and I get results.</li>
    <li> if you like premeasured convience buy it, otherwise 1/4 teaspoon of salt in warm water works absolutley as well. Not sure that I will buy this agian unless it is for convienence, since you can keep it in your bathroom and ready to go.</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises. I think when it gains more popularity, it will be more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It works all right. But i found a better option that neti pot which is cumbersome for me. The Simply Saline Nasal Spray and Nasal gel :D</li>
    <li> I thought the idea was weird but it seemed to make sense. Using the first time was odd but I quickly became used to it. The instructions are clear and detailed. It really seems to help. If I stop using it regularly I will develop unpleasant symptoms and when I start the symptoms are relieved. That&#x27;s eveidence enough for me!</li>
    <li> Together with the Neti Pot, haven&#x27;t had a sinus infection or a cold in years!!!</li>
    <li> I have taken over the counter and precription medications, herbal remedies, old and wise home remedies and now after 48 years of age I have discovered what my granfather and father used for their entire lives to cure sinus problems including allergies.  Salt water nose irrigation.  Since I am from Texas I can&#x27;t quite force myself to use a neti pot, so I just mix up a batch from the easy packets in a glass of water every morning stick the ole schnoz in and start snorting the saline mixture thru my nasal cavity and spitting it out of my mouth.  Three to five flushes and I am good for the day.  Of course I then clean my teeth and use a good mouthwash.      I no longer buy or take allergy remedies except as a rare measure.  Snort and spit in the morning and happy all day.  I am addicted to the practice since it makes my day so much better, my life better.</li>
    <li> This really worked.  I used to have very sore nasal canals with scabs from the bleeding etc.  Now it is gone.  I only have to use it occasionally to keep the nasal canal open and clear.  Reccomend it highly.  No more allergy problems here,</li>
    <li> Love SinuCleanse!  USe it almost daily...have had chronic BAD sinus infections for many years and this keeps me clear between antibiotics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and the other brand - with the fancy packets - I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  Except that this brand is about 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best sinus clense.It makes flushing a little less discomforting.</li>
    <li> The saline solution packets are the best investment I made for my husband&#x27;s neti pot usage.  No more measuring.  Just rip open a packet and voila!  Clean and simple, just the way we like it!  High quality saline, love it!</li>
    <li> Until I found about SinuCleanse every cold or allergy problem seemed to evolve into sinusitis.  Now I have a way to fight back.  Believe me this product works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to breathe at night like a baby. I use the product before going to bed and I enjoy a wonderful sleep. A real solution for my sinus problem.</li>
    <li> Our local grocery store ran out of these and did not have them on the shelves for two weeks before I decided to purchase them online. They arrived in good shape. They are a good price.</li>
    <li> My name is Jordan S. Josephson, M.D. F.A.C.S. and I am the author of the book Sinus Relief Now recently published by Penguin Books.  The book is about sinus problems, allergy, asthma, snoring sleep apnea and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD).  I am a total believer in patients irrigating their sinuses on a daily basis. Irrigation removes infection, allergens and irritants.   I personally suffer from sinus problems and irrigate myself.  I recommend irrigation to all of my patients.  Netipots and sinus irrigators are very effective ways to clean out your nose and sinuses.  This is an excellent product to place in a netipot or a sinus irrigator.  I recommend and show you how to use netipots and sinus irrigators in my book Sinus Relief Now.</li>
    <li> I felt like a moron when I bought this--why was I spending all this money for premeasured packets of salt and a little baking soda mixed in?    But frankly, it&#x27;s the difference between using the netti pot and not using it.    Having the little premeasured packets, which are so easily stored in the bathroom, is just incredibly convenient. Are you seriously going to mix up non iodized salt and baking soda every morning and evening??? I had thought I would, but I never did...    I bought the little plastic netti pot made by the Sinucleanse people, and it comes with a tiny plastic spoon for mixing.    Highly recommended.     PS. The trick to using the Netti pot? Breathe constantly through your mouth...and turn your head and pour...if you aren&#x27;t breathing constantly through your mouth, you will feel like you are drowning or be too scared to really pour the water through...it takes a while to get the hang of it. Don&#x27;t give up until you have done it at least a month.</li>
    <li> The salt is easy to mix and keeps my sinuses clear.  Highly recommended for people with sinus problems or allergies with a nasal component.</li>
    <li> UPDATE; Please only use sterile water intended for this nasal flush. Tap water or any other water might not be safe and could cause serious problems. REmember, you are shooting this liquid into your head and back out. Use caution.&lt;br /&gt;I am a nurse, and this is a wonderful solution to clogged sinuses and  pain.  FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, (and online video) to make sure you use correctly.  You should be very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> the sinu-cleanse saline refills really work well, the price was well worth it for some relieve of sinus pressure, the service was fast.</li>
    <li> Great for helping to relieve stuffy noses.  I always use this when I have a sinus infection.  Order arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be more effective than it&#x27;s competitor!  I suffer from chronic, agonizing sinusitis and allergies year round and depend on nasal rinses.  This one has plenty of saline and gives good relief.  I have to use two to three times daily due to the severity of my condition.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to get refills for my Neti pot that is priced so well and convenient to use. If you have stuffed sinuses or allergies, using this really relieves all symtoms.</li>
    <li> Its a great product and it does the job. Also the cost is affordable. I will recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I never thought of using a neti pot before, but I now would never be without it.  Having sinus relief without meds is a miracle.  The saline packets make it even easier, there is no measuring.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a tear-open, dump in water, toss package morning. Same amount every day, no mistakes, and for my NetiPot - a done deal.</li>
