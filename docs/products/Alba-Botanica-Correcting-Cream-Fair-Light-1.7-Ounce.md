### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>Using a powder also greatly helps.</li>
      <li>It helps my face to look great even after it&#x27;s taken off....</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars instead of five because it&#x27;s great for the price</li>
      <li>Great coverage and protection.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s why I was so happy to find this CC cream by Alba Botanica.  </li>
      <li>i was extremely happy to come across this product; even happier with the results.</li>
      <li>is really good.</li>
      <li>It is a good solution for someone wanting to avoid both of those things.</li>
      <li>I always wear fair or ivory colors and this works well,</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this makeup!</li>
      <li>It is a great light makeup, but I do not see any reduction in brown spots and I have used it for over a year now.</li>
      <li>how much better health wise it is compared to mainstream brands</li>
      <li>Nice coverage but OILY.  </li>
      <li>4 out of 5 stars because this is a nice product</li>
      <li>, covers evenly, is light, makes your skin look dewy and also smells good.</li>
      <li>&quot; bandwagon, I can safely and honestly report that this stuff is nothing more than another product gimmick.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and spreads nice and even.</li>
      <li>a huge difference!  </li>
      <li>After wearing this cc alone with some mineral powder, I can safely say it is the cause of my breakouts.</li>
      <li>If this could be reformulated, I&#x27;d love to try it again as I love what Alba Botanica stands for in the beauty market.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cream....</li>
      <li>Save your money on this one, ladies. :)</li>
      <li>I only use cruelty free products, so seeing this was great, also the price made me happy.</li>
      <li>will agree that it goes on oily, so you might want to mix with another BB cream or foundation that&#x27;s a bit more matte or drying.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Setting it with a translucent powder helped though, just have to keep touching up.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a light look,doesn&#x27;t cover anything major</li>
      <li>I think this is best for those with dry skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you only want light coverage with sunscreen, then this is perfect.</li>
      <li>If you try to apply a thicker coat to get more coverage, it will get greasy and settle into your fine lines.</li>
      <li>It is light and refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried rubbing it in better, using a make-up primer, light moisturizer, and no moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a natural CC cream that isn&#x27;t going to bust your budget.</li>
      <li>the only downside is the lack of shades... luckily for me, fair to light is a good match.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, blends easily, evens my skin tone, doesn&#x27;t oxidize orange, smells fresh, and has improved my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I just lightly powder or use blotting papers on my nose and cheeks,</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like this try Tarte&#x27;s BB cream (which is also dye, phthalate,and paraben free, etc.)  </li>
      <li>it goes on smoothly and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup looking dry/old throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It lightly evens out my skin tone and provides moisture with the added benefit of SPF.  </li>
      <li>I love this product it helps even out my skin tone which is (medium tan) and it keeps it hydrated and fresh all day</li>
      <li>Of the BB and CC creams I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far superior.</li>
      <li>my skin is extremely fair, dehydrated &amp; sensitive.</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased with the product. :)</li>
      <li>I love the color it fits my fair skin perfect,the coverage is kinda light like a tinted moisturizer.my routine is thayers rose toner then my alba botanica even advanced cc cream,then at night I use my yes to carrots daily cream facial cleanser</li>
      <li>it is definitely great for dry skin and redness.  </li>
      <li>Love that it has SPF and that contains more natural products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin has been amazing and blemish free since I went natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it after my local Walmart stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Looks great, but stains a little.</li>
      <li>I bought this as soon as I decided to go more natural in my skin care.</li>
      <li>face will feel damp - wet, even!- with oil, and leaves bright orange streaks on clothing, hands, boyfriends, trees, walls, towels, bike handles, pets, and eating utensils.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For reference, my skin type is normal to combination and my complexion light.</li>
      <li>For anyone wanting more coverage, or who think that it is too oily, try mixing it with a little bit of concealer or try putting it on and putting concealer on places that you&#x27;d like more coverage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is pretty comparable with Dermalogica&#x27;s tinted moisturizer which I used before I found this.  </li>
      <li>you can see, I highly recommend this!!</li>
      <li>My first cc cream.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day (I can see it when I wash it off at night), and that&#x27;s even with being in the hot sun.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s like using Mineral Veil by Bare Minerals) as I find a lot of the powders have Talc and other not so great things for your skin, like any powder, this helps make it stay.</li>
      <li>Such an easy morning routine.</li>
      <li>,thayers toner then 5 drops of pure jojoba oil.</li>
      <li>I look like I had oral with a large bowl of buttered popcorn.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the color is an unblendable peach/orange, and it sits wet, sticky, and oily on top of your skin.</li>
      <li>The price for how much you get and</li>
      <li>If it was pink based, I would love it.</li>
      <li>Even without using a moisturizer under this, it still is very oily and forms an oily film on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>(i.e., not makeup) and keeps my skin from drying out (here in Mediterranean environment, the air can get very dry.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this product at Target and really wanted to love it, but it clogged my pores to an extreme extent.</li>
      <li>It is a bit dewey and almost oily looking, so a setting powder is a must, but I&#x27;d be using one anyway to prevent excess oil later, so it&#x27;s actually really nice that this allows for that without the powder making me dry or chalky looking.</li>
      <li>It is sheer and natural looking and evens skin tones with light to no &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>as it has fuller coverage and is more creamy vs. lotion-like but more expensive.</li>
      <li>One other great thing about this is that it&#x27;s light enough for me, which is hard to find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight, moisturizing, but still gives some coverage (not as much as a foundation, but does help soften the look of my dark spots and bags under my eyes).</li>
      <li>This is my second tube of this stuff I love it hopefully its around for a long time.</li>
      <li>but I think it would be ok on skin a little darker than mine as well since the coverage is pretty sheer.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m only 23 and have only some light freckles.</li>
      <li>I recommend a regular transparent facial sunscreen, and natural mineral powder for light to medium coverage</li>
      <li>I have very light skin with olive undertones (I&#x27;m half Greek), and the color suits me well.</li>
      <li>It has helped keep my skin clear and radiant.</li>
      <li>But I prefer to buy natural brands like Alba.</li>
      <li>personally never wear foundation because most foundation is too heavy and ends up cracking, cakes on my face, and doesn&#x27;t match my skin</li>
      <li>It provides LIGHT coverage, meaning it won&#x27;t spackle all your pores shut or cover up acne beyond making it look less red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad, it had a great ingredient list.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, so unless your skin is incredibly dry, no moisturizer is needed prior to using this.</li>
      <li>The product was delivered on time, but it&#x27;s a little bit too much greasy for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to review face products as everyone has different skin types, but this is just right for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>good knowing that it isn&#x27;t bad for my skin.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s reviews say the same thing.</li>
<li> Missing the last star because it&#x27;s yellow toned</li>
<li> /&gt;You are too pretty to be smearing your lovely face with this crap!</li>
<li> In Florida, this product definitely made a mess of my face.</li>
<li> I like the Alba because it&#x27;s affordable and as someone who tries to be mindful about what ingredients are in the cosmetic products I use</li>
<li> and I have pink undertones</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never gotten breakouts like this from only wearing makeup for a few hours.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For the past 2-3 weeks I had been mixing it with another product, thinking the latter was causing the issue...</li>
<li> I would only recommend this product to someone with dry skin and/or very small pores...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks great, but stains a little.</li>
    <li> My first cc cream. I only use cruelty free products, so seeing this was great, also the price made me happy. However, it is so oily. I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s reviews say the same thing. So I know I&#x27;m now t the only one. My skin is oily/combination to begin with but it made it look even worse. Setting it with a translucent powder helped though, just have to keep touching up.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is light and refreshing feeling. I will never use anything else. It has helped keep my skin clear and radiant.</li>
    <li> I love this product it helps even out my skin tone which is (medium tan) and it keeps it hydrated and fresh all day</li>
    <li> 4 out of 5 stars because this is a nice product, covers evenly, is light, makes your skin look dewy and also smells good. Missing the last star because it&#x27;s yellow toned and I have pink undertones so I had to apply it to my neck and I don&#x27;t want to do that. Maybe I can use it when I get a tan. If it was pink based, I would love it.</li>
    <li> Works well as CC cream just has a weird smell I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage but OILY.  I look like I had oral with a large bowl of buttered popcorn.</li>
    <li> Feels slightly heavy.</li>
    <li> I do not use or support product lines that use animal testing or tons of chemicals and that&#x27;s why I was so happy to find this CC cream by Alba Botanica.  Even without using a moisturizer under this, it still is very oily and forms an oily film on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried rubbing it in better, using a make-up primer, light moisturizer, and no moisturizer.  Oily, no matter what.  If this could be reformulated, I&#x27;d love to try it again as I love what Alba Botanica stands for in the beauty market.</li>
    <li> Terrific product. I have had trouble finding in stores. Great coverage and protection. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I like that it goes on smoothly and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup looking dry/old throughout the day. For anyone wanting more coverage, or who think that it is too oily, try mixing it with a little bit of concealer or try putting it on and putting concealer on places that you&#x27;d like more coverage. I always set my makeup with cornstarch (it&#x27;s like using Mineral Veil by Bare Minerals) as I find a lot of the powders have Talc and other not so great things for your skin, like any powder, this helps make it stay. I gave it four stars instead of five because it&#x27;s great for the price but I do find that it takes a little while for it to not look like it is wet/just applied, which is why I recommend using powder. If you don&#x27;t like this try Tarte&#x27;s BB cream (which is also dye, phthalate,and paraben free, etc.)  as it has fuller coverage and is more creamy vs. lotion-like but more expensive. I like the Alba because it&#x27;s affordable and as someone who tries to be mindful about what ingredients are in the cosmetic products I use, it makes me feel good knowing that it isn&#x27;t bad for my skin.</li>
    <li> After getting suckered into a ride on the \\&quot;alphabet cream\\&quot; bandwagon, I can safely and honestly report that this stuff is nothing more than another product gimmick. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the color is an unblendable peach/orange, and it sits wet, sticky, and oily on top of your skin. It gives you a definite makeup mask, and it rubs off on EVERYTHING. I set this goop with a mineral setting powder, with no improvements. It looked ugly and unnatural on my fair skin, and I&#x27;ve never seen oil on my face like this in my 33 years of living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will feel damp - wet, even!- with oil, and leaves bright orange streaks on clothing, hands, boyfriends, trees, walls, towels, bike handles, pets, and eating utensils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are too pretty to be smearing your lovely face with this crap! I recommend a regular transparent facial sunscreen, and natural mineral powder for light to medium coverage (if you are so inclined to cover).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst product so far of 2013. Save your money on this one, ladies. :)</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a natural CC cream that isn&#x27;t going to bust your budget. It goes on thicker for me than previous reviewers have said. It gives enough coverage but needs double layering for something like rosacea. I do have extremely sensitive skin and never once has this CC cream broken me out or upset my skin. It&#x27;s extremely gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree that it goes on oily, so you might want to mix with another BB cream or foundation that&#x27;s a bit more matte or drying. Using a powder also greatly helps. Overall, very pleased with the product. :)</li>
    <li> I love this makeup! I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it after my local Walmart stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;I personally never wear foundation because most foundation is too heavy and ends up cracking, cakes on my face, and doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;After finding this CC cream, I&#x27;m never touching foundation again! It&#x27;s light weight, moisturizing, but still gives some coverage (not as much as a foundation, but does help soften the look of my dark spots and bags under my eyes). I have very light skin with olive undertones (I&#x27;m half Greek), and the color suits me well. Love that it has SPF and that contains more natural products.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> This CC cream is my go-to product. I started using it when I became mindful of harsh ingredients and animal testing. It is a good solution for someone wanting to avoid both of those things. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, so unless your skin is incredibly dry, no moisturizer is needed prior to using this. It is a bit dewey and almost oily looking, so a setting powder is a must, but I&#x27;d be using one anyway to prevent excess oil later, so it&#x27;s actually really nice that this allows for that without the powder making me dry or chalky looking. One other great thing about this is that it&#x27;s light enough for me, which is hard to find. I always wear fair or ivory colors and this works well, but I think it would be ok on skin a little darker than mine as well since the coverage is pretty sheer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m outside all day. Never got a sunburn while wearing this.  It stays on all day (I can see it when I wash it off at night), and that&#x27;s even with being in the hot sun. I am also prone to breakouts and this has never caused a problem. I love it! For those complaining that it is greasy or doesn&#x27;t cover up imperfections. It provides LIGHT coverage, meaning it won&#x27;t spackle all your pores shut or cover up acne beyond making it look less red. If you try to apply a thicker coat to get more coverage, it will get greasy and settle into your fine lines. But if you only want light coverage with sunscreen, then this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream....it is definitely great for dry skin and redness.  It helps my face to look great even after it&#x27;s taken off....a huge difference!  Now I wear it every other day, just because my skin has reached the pinnacle of it&#x27;s greatness (seriously!).  Definitely try it if you are looking to have hydrated, glowing, acne- and dryness-free skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this as soon as I decided to go more natural in my skin care.I love the color it fits my fair skin perfect,the coverage is kinda light like a tinted moisturizer.my routine is thayers rose toner then my alba botanica even advanced cc cream,then at night I use my yes to carrots daily cream facial cleanser,thayers toner then 5 drops of pure jojoba oil.My skin has been amazing and blemish free since I went natural.Before I was using the covergirl bb cream but after reading all the terrible stuff in it I switched to alba botanica cc cream the coverage is close to the covergirl.Perfect for a light look,doesn&#x27;t cover anything major but I&#x27;m only 23 and have only some light freckles.Goes on easy and spreads nice and even. This is my second tube of this stuff I love it hopefully its around for a long time.The price for how much you get and how much better health wise it is compared to mainstream brands is really good.I think this is best for those with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients: Zinc Oxide 4.0% (Sunscreen), Titanium Dioxide 3.5% (Sunscreen) Inactive Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Isoamyl Laurate, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquioleate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Glycerin, Polyglyceryl-3 Ricineoleate, Propanediol, Algae Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Chlorella Pyrenoidosa Extract, Chondrus Cruspus Extract(1), Dictyopteris Membranacea Extract, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Enteromorpha Compressa Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Polygonum Aviculare Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract(1), Ulva Lactuca Extract(1), Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Alumina, Calcium Ascorbate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Lactic Acid, Magnesium Stearate, Magnesium Sulfate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch, p-Anisic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Talc, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol(1), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Bismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891).

    <li> Bought this product at Target and really wanted to love it, but it clogged my pores to an extreme extent. I&#x27;ve never gotten breakouts like this from only wearing makeup for a few hours. For the past 2-3 weeks I had been mixing it with another product, thinking the latter was causing the issue... After wearing this cc alone with some mineral powder, I can safely say it is the cause of my breakouts. I would only recommend this product to someone with dry skin and/or very small pores... Or perhaps someone living in a colder climate. In Florida, this product definitely made a mess of my face. It&#x27;s too bad, it had a great ingredient list.</li>
    <li> It is a great light makeup, but I do not see any reduction in brown spots and I have used it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It is sheer and natural looking and evens skin tones with light to no &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; (i.e., not makeup) and keeps my skin from drying out (here in Mediterranean environment, the air can get very dry.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints would be that my skin tone falls between this and the next darker shade, so one is slightly too light, the next up slightly too dark.  It is also a tad shiny on me (I have oily-to-normal skin and it seems to sit on my skin rather than absorb.  I use an Alba sunblock under it, so it might be the sunblock&#x27;s fault, but sorry, SPF 15 is like no SPF at all.)  Anyway, I just lightly powder or use blotting papers on my nose and cheeks, problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty comparable with Dermalogica&#x27;s tinted moisturizer which I used before I found this.  But I prefer to buy natural brands like Alba.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time, but it&#x27;s a little bit too much greasy for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review face products as everyone has different skin types, but this is just right for my dry sensitive skin.  It lightly evens out my skin tone and provides moisture with the added benefit of SPF.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> it has been very hard for me to find the correct base for my skin until i found alba&#x27;s cc cream. my skin is extremely fair, dehydrated &amp; sensitive. i need a product that will not irritate my skin or cling to my acne/dry patches. cruelty-free beauty is also crucial to me (yay alba botanica!) i was extremely happy to come across this product; even happier with the results. it doesn&#x27;t look like make up. it is just enough coverage to cover up redness. i put concealer only over spots and under my eyes so i don&#x27;t have heavy coverage all over my face. needless to say, alba&#x27;s cc cream is a must-have for me now. the only downside is the lack of shades... luckily for me, fair to light is a good match.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and will never turn back. Of the BB and CC creams I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far superior. Love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, blends easily, evens my skin tone, doesn&#x27;t oxidize orange, smells fresh, and has improved my skin&#x27;s texture. It&#x27;s also affordable! A dusting a mineral powder finishes my face. Such an easy morning routine. For reference, my skin type is normal to combination and my complexion light.</li>
