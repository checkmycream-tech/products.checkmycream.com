<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. Product was delivered on time and was as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Fahrenheit and when I found a site on amazon where you can purchase this 6.8oz for under $100.00 it was a no brainer to get it!</li>
    <li> I just love this cant go wrong with this. I will probably buy more in the future. I recommend this for and one.</li>
    <li> Nothing and I mean nothing, smells as good as this cologne.  I just don&#x27;t understand why being as \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; as it is, it&#x27;s still so damn pricey.  But nothing else on the market at any price smells this good.</li>
    <li> If best dreams could have a smell, they would smell of Fahrenheit. Very few EDTs can compete with it.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little wierd, I liked it when someone else had it on but hate it on myself, smells like mosquito repellent</li>
    <li> Good fragrance, expensive as heck, but a relatively decent price from this seller for the quantity, considering the cost of 1 oz in most stores is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> seems weaker than hi end store bought, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I want to warn everybody who used this edc that it is no longer the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;within the last 2-3 years the smell is not durable or long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;It does not last more than 5-10 minutes. It is now fake.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return, but no luck. It used to be a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing fragrance. Amazingly subtle, cool and sophisticated. Not overpowering and lingers effectively all day. Surprisingly this does not numb my olfactory sense even after hours of putting on (unlike most fragrances) so that I can myself smell it&#x27;s wonderful base notes of patchouli and cedar several hours after drydown leading to delightful satisfaction all day. I have several colognes including Kouros, Body Kouros, Dunhill Desire, Acqua Di Gio, Hugo Energize, Polo Sport, Drakkar Noir, Escada Pour Homme, Allure Homme Sport, Live Jazz, Eternity, Xeryus Rogue, Dior Homme etc but I don&#x27;t know why I had not tried this classic till a while back. Now it is my new favourite beside Acqua Di Gio, Body Kouros and Hugo Energize</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby for Christmas, but he bought his own little bottle at the drug store just after I ordered it.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... we compared the 2 and there was NO DIFFERENCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now have enough Fahrenheit to last a lifetime and then some!</li>
    <li> Fake! The smell didn&#x27;t last 30 minutes :( very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product was real and not fake or old...That was my first fear.&lt;br /&gt;All was without any glitch. Order went through fast, product arrived in a timely fashion and it was totally satisfactory</li>
    <li> My friend Sandy and I were walking through Broadway and both of us stopped DEAD in our tracks when we smelled this stuff.  It is without a doubt THE best masculine fragrance out there, bar none.  I have never found another I like better.  Ever.  Yeah, it&#x27;s an older scent but it has yet to be beat.  Very masculine and I wasn&#x27;t kidding, it stopped us both dead in our tracks.</li>
    <li> Awesome and great price! A+++</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance. Would like to try something different next time, however very hard to please in fragrance department.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance with tones of leather and a sweet smokiness. Not overpowering. After testing every cologne at Sephora, this is the one I liked the most. It was more manly than most.</li>
    <li> Shipping was timely and the cologne was perfect :)</li>
    <li> Do not buy it from amazon ,it is fake .I have been using this perfum for more than 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;This one I bought from amazon want last for 10 minutes . Tried to return to amazon the refused.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my all-time favorite scent. Always loved it, always will.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Dior it has a nice scent long lasting and you can&#x27;t beat 6.8oz for the money I would recommend this!!</li>
    <li> One of, if not the best smelling fragrance I have ever used. It is extremely difficult to find these days in retail markets but well worth the investment. I get the most compliments when I wear this fragrance. My second favorite is the D&amp;G Light Blue so also check that out.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Fahrenheit since it came out.  It is a perfect cologne for my body.  This is NOT the same cologne I have been using!  It is not as strong (about 1/2 strength) and does smell different.  It is not as deep and mysterious as it used to be.</li>
    <li> Very nice man perfume. Woody scent.</li>
    <li> Great quality in shipping and the product is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> my brother in law doesn&#x27;t ike it he told me its not the real thing, he use to have it , he bought in europe was much more intensive,,,</li>
    <li> Good shipment and Good quality</li>
    <li> wimmen love it! i like it,so i bought it</li>
    <li> I just got this item in the mail. The one that I received is certainly not an original. I&#x27;ve been using Fahrenheit for many years n I know how it should smell. I&#x27;m not saying these are all fake but the one I received was.... Beware!!!</li>
    <li> Good product and fast and speedy shipment.</li>
    <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
    <li> The smell of this cologne is beyond great.... all my friends love this cologne. I recommend this cologne to anyone who love smelling good.</li>
    <li> I love it! UPS had shipping issues so it came a little late but that wasn&#x27;t any one&#x27;s fault. When I run out I will definitely be buying some more!</li>
    <li> This has been one of my main scents for the last 20 years, and I always make sure to have a bottle of it. It works very well with my skin, but I&#x27;ve had some people tell me after they use it, they aren&#x27;t too impressed. For example, it might smell too woodsy or peppery to some people, or might not last very long on their skin. With Fahrenheit, I do a half spray on each wrist, tap my wrist together, and then do a full spray on my chest. The scent is amazing, and for me, lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at the 6.8oz bottle, don&#x27;t shy away based on the price. If it works well for you, that size bottle should easily last you 4 years or so.</li>
    <li> Awsome Cologne for those that have problems on retaining the scent on your body. Once on leave you with the nice scent all day. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of farenheit almost fourteen years ago and the smell never gets old.  You get a lot of compliments everywhere you go and the ladies love the smell!</li>
    <li> Genuine product, reasonable price...most importantly, great availability as this particular cologne can be hard to find in department stores.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best deals I have found for this product.  I have been using this cologne for years and generally pay what I did for the 6.8 Oz for the lesser 3.4 Oz.  So I give this site high marks</li>
    <li> Seems to be an old stock or fake, you need to put a lot in order to smell it and it doesn&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;long, the worse Fahrenheit I bought for 2o years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Farenheit for the past 20 years, I am loving everything about it, good for all seasons and occasions, long lastings and more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evans,&lt;br /&gt;Dedham, MA.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this for many years &amp; loves it! It is a wonderful blend of light musk &amp; citrus notes. Very masculine. Amazon.com offers the larger size at an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a few difference variants on the Fahrenheit fragrance for men.  I wanted the original and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, the smell is strong and pleasure. Excellent scent! A very striking, exotic aroma ... Hard to describe!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product , I have been using it for over  ten years now, but this size online is the best value for money that I have ever seen</li>
    <li> By the time I unpacked it when I arrived to my country, I realized that it was only alcohol whit no scent at all</li>
    <li> My favorites have been Paloma Picasso&#x27;s \\&quot;Minotaure\\&quot; and Givenchy&#x27;s \\&quot;PI.\\&quot; Now, Fahrenheit is a welcome addition to my repertoire of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often splurge on an almost hundred dollar luxury, but I&#x27;m glad I got the 6.8 oz. size as I feel I can use it more often with a big bottle. The smell is so pleasing, not quite as sweet as my former favorites, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten more than a few compliments on this.</li>
    <li> It was a great price for my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Is sweet, sexy, mature, makes me want to eat my boyfriend averytime he use it. You should try it. Seriously!</li>
    <li> This is a lot of product at a decent/fair price.  The department stores charge way too much for this Eau De Toilette (commonly used by fragrance houses interchangeably as cologne).  To me, this is cologne.  The strength is appropriate.  It&#x27;s a good fragrance.</li>
    <li> I first used this cologne about 15 years ago and it brought back a lot of fond memories for me. People do notice me wearing the fragrance, even though it is in a spray bottle and I know to be sparing when I use it. The scent carries for hours and this particular bottle is huge, so I dare say it will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a quality cologne that creates a positive impression. It&#x27;s not a cheap brand and delivers the quality you&#x27;d expect from Christian Dior.</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> i ask it for a friend. She gave it to her husband. She says it is great. She is really happy. The shipping was ok, about time and packaging was all ok.</li>
    <li> The best cologne I ever had</li>
    <li> This is not the same formula I have had in the past.  It does smell like the fragrance, but it does not last.  I used to spray this on my clothes and the clothes would smell for days.  Now if you get 3 hours out of it and the scent is gone.  I think this is a boot leg product.</li>
    <li> I chose this article because it is a fragrance that I used all my life.&lt;br /&gt;I find it strange that this colony in particular stain with a red coloring my skin , similar to an allergic reaction. Never before had happened.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it .</li>
    <li> this one is going to be an instant classic, this is my second bottle I have ordered from Amazon and beats the price from a retail store. I get plenty of compliments when using this, the package was flawless, everything was intact, would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Some of these don&#x27;t quite have the smoky sent... Okay, I&#x27;m a guy and describing it isn&#x27;t my strong point. I have been using this for years. My wife loves it. It has become ... over a 20 year period, my signature scent. This particular type has the real strength. Not watered down. Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> Always been a favorite.</li>
    <li> Too many colognes smell like Acqua di Gio and Cool Water.  This spicy manly scent will get you laid.  Okay, maybe not you, but most guys.</li>
    <li> Fahrenheit has become my signature scent.  I received a bottle of Fahrenheit as a gift many years ago, tried it, and loved it.  Since then, I may have alternated with another cologne, but never went more than a couple days without it.  I receive many compliments on it, and quite a few \\&quot;growls\\&quot; when people lean in to give me a hug. :)</li>
    <li> Works for all ages. My dad&#x27;s in his fifties and loves it, I am in my 20&#x27;s and I still love it and its appreciated. Always a great buy. Expensive, but you have to pay for quality. There is a reason why this was introduced in 1988 but is still popular.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PURCHASE...!!!!</li>
    <li> its a fake item, do not buy, dont waste you&#x27;re money, its a shame that amazon keep selling rip off items.</li>
    <li> Authentic, checked versus those available in brick and mortar boutiques.  Fragrance still has longevity and mystique.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the negative naysayers have been getting but all authenticity mechanisms are in place.</li>
    <li> this is an old school one for me. But by far my favorite in High school. the shipping was super fast and product was just as expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing how expensive cologne can be, but if a man is going to wear it, wear a great smelling one like this.</li>
    <li> Smells good. i use it everyday very nice perfume</li>
    <li> Almost everything we purchased was satisfactory</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better scent in 25 years!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use it for my Car even though I am a female because it smells THAT GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get a whiff of it you never forget it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This classic product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing/applying this now for about 15 years and have not found any other cologne that tops this. Many other colognes smell cheap, smell like soap or are just too strong. This has a nice scent that seems t be more like me. This used to be carried everywhere but lately have had a more difficult time finding it and at a reasonable price (and want to make sure I buy an authentic one too).  I spray lightly and enjoy the scent myself but more importantly is when I hear my loved one telling me that it fits me and drives her crazy. If you have not smelled it yet try it at a finer place like Macys and the buy from Amazon (its cheaper, and more economical buying the 6.8oz spray in the long run).</li>
    <li> It was too strong for my taste...very pungent and musky! Obviously this is subjective and depends on the person...but to me I felt like I was smelling gasoline!</li>
    <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
    <li> We opted for the largest bottle for the best price we could find online.  Thanks for making this item available.  We love the smell and the size!</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVE COLOGNES FOR MEN  THE SMELL IS JUST SO REFRESHING AND I ALWAYS GET ASKED ABOUT IT BUT NEVER TELL PPL THE NAME. I JUST SAY ITS CHRISTIAN DIOR LOL.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cologne. I am a woman and I am obsessed with the smell. I have been guilty of spraying some on my wrists with the dept. store tester and smelling my wrists throughout the day...and had I not taken a shower, the smell would have still lingered on me.....Yes, the smell does last a very very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the musky, strong smell. It has me hypnotized so much so that I ended up buying this for my husband. Now, he wasn&#x27;t too fond of the smell (not sure why) and that is why I had prolonged the purchase.... but I didn&#x27;t care...I just bought it and strategically placed it in the washroom. It&#x27;s been 2 months now and he has been spraying it on himself every morning before work. I think the strong has grown on him and he really likes it too! Well it actually doesn&#x27;t matter if he likes it or not, because I LOVE smelling Fahrenheit throughout my day!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, and great price too.</li>
    <li> The box was damaged and the bottle scratched but it&#x27;s the perfume it&#x27;s original</li>
    <li> I bought this based solely on the reviews here at Amazon, and had never smelled it prior to that, so I have nothing to compare it to regarding if it is authentic or not. That being said, I am very disappointed in this cologne. First, at least to me it smells a little bit like burned out motor windings. Not nearly as strong and not to the point it is repulsive of course, but nevertheless not one of my favorite smells, and certainly not something that would set the ladies on fire. I normally wear about three spurts of Oscar de la Renta - Pour Lui, and that normally lasts all day. I first used this Fahrenheit the same way, but by mid day I couldn&#x27;t detect odor at all. I tried increasing the amount every day last week, and by Friday I was spraying about 10 spurts on my neck and chest. I noticed very little if any change in how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great scent for that sexy man!!! Very clean!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne!</li>
    <li> It is not what it is being sold as</li>
    <li> Classic!!!!! will never go out of style. Every man should own a bottle even if you don&#x27;t care for it keep it in your closet for when that especial someone comes over put it on. It will b a night full of sparks I&#x27;m sure you will remember.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for a while and have continued to receive numerous compliments. Colognes change when they mix with your own body chemistry and natural scent and oils. When you find one that mixes well with you and continues to smell nice throughout the day or evening, keep it!  Amazon offered this at a great price so I bought it and will buy again. Great service and decent shipping time, considering it shipped for free.</li>
    <li> Great, timeless fragrance.</li>
    <li> This fragrance for men is amazing.  I first bought this when I was in the military and used up the bottle but at the time there were different types of fragrances coming out.  So, I forgot about Fahrenheit for 14 years, then I noticed the fragrance all over the place, Lord and Taylor, Macy&#x27;s Bloomingdales, Saks 5th Ave etc ..., its considered a \\&quot;masterpiece\\&quot; in fragrance.  I tried it out at Macy&#x27;s and was amazed, it burnt my nasal passages lol. Very deep+ very masculine and it lasts all day long.  10+ Hours......Highly recommend this fragrance , its refreshing, deep and leaves a nice scent all day long and gradually  slowly leaves a balanced spicy scent...gradually making the evening deep and spicy.......5 Stars easily. Classic and a MASTERPIECE of a fragrance. go ahead try it out you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> The product is good and the seller has fulfilled expected.</li>
    <li> I guess its ok but nothing spectacular. That being said I&#x27;m under 35 and this cologne it seems tends to suit older men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One my high school students told me I smelt like her Dad ...</li>
    <li> This is either very old or fake. Even with several sprays, there is no smell. Original bottle, but not the contents.</li>
    <li> I had received this from my wife for Christmas, and she bought it here at Amazon. Like other reviewers we both found this to be far from what we are used to when buying this particular cologne. The smell of this purchase is completely different, very light and has faded within a few minutes. Our normal supply of this cologne is very strong, lasts until the next day and is very distinctive. I cant say for sure this is &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34;, but something is very wrong with it indeed. However, the saving grace is that once we contacted Amazon and made them aware of our problems they refunded our money immediately. Its things like this that make you think twice about on-line shopping. In one way or another something always goes wrong at Christmas with our Amazon purchases, but we do a lot of shopping with them. However, once again, they never leave us out of pocket, so that is a good thing I suppose.</li>
    <li> It is not an &amp;#34;anytime, anywhere&amp;#34; fragrance, but if you want something different, this one is awesome.  It has this crazy-good gasoline/motor oil note in the opening that is absolutely unique.  That calms down after an hour or so, and what you are left with is a dark floral fragrance that is buttery smooth and confidence inspiring.  It might not be for everybody, as that opening is &amp;#34;love or hate,&amp;#34; so try before you buy.  For me, I look forward to any chance I get to wear Fahrenheit.  I work in a pretty conservative environment (small town lawyer), so it is a little risky for a work fragrance for me.  On weekends though, I Fahrenheit it up.  You will get noticed with this one, and pretty much always in a good way.  This came out in 1988, and I still have not smelled anything like it.  This will be on the shelves for another ~30 years - mark my words!</li>
    <li> Strong , Very long Lasting</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite cologne. I did not buy it from Amazon. Though the strong manly, woody scent is a mans smell! Its a mans scent!</li>
    <li> I love it ! I use it everyday and it never expires. Fahrenheit (red) is an excellent fragrance all year round, all day round.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fahrenheit by Christian Dior from 1993.  Ever since this was my regular perfume.  Oflate it changed a lot.  Now it is smelling like Petrol .  I dont know what happened to this perfume.  It has changed completely.  It is smelling awful.  Very very disappointed.  Some one can suggest me a new perfume close to this woody smell.</li>
    <li> I ahve used this cologne for 25 years. Have tried others in the past but nothing as appealing as this.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have gotten a smaller bottle for travel purposes, but the price was so perfect, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  Next I will get a smaller travel size.</li>
    <li> Love this on my guy....announcing!</li>
    <li> manly scent. daytime use. Sandalwood et al, drives both men and women to ask... \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; Worth the premium price, this is a classic Dior blend from the &#x27;80&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s timeless, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a fake of the original perfume. I bought this for my husband who has been using this fragance for almost 6 years and i just wanted to surprise him and bought this from amazon. But i got surprised because it didn&#x27;t smell the same and the spray pump doesn&#x27;t work. It sprays out the perfum like streaming water. Horrible buy. I will never buy perfumes online again.</li>
    <li> I had used Fahrenheit for years until I had received a sample pack from Sephora and decided to change to Million by Paco Rabanne. The Million was excellent, cheaper than Fahrenheit, but the scent did not last as long.  As a result, I bought this 6.8 oz bottle when the Million ran out about 10 days ago.  If you like Fahrenheit, this sized bottle is the cheapest/ oz.  I didn&#x27;t do a lot of comparisons with other sites, but the few I did revealed that Amazon had the lowest price.  Although it is a \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; product, the delivery instructions state that it may take 1-2 days before shipping.  I ordered this on 6-19-2014 and it arrived on 6-20-14!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is the spray top.  Its black and there is no indicator delineating the spray hole which is very difficult to see.  As a result, the first spray often hits the mirror, towel, dog, etc.  Mr. Dior, please place some indicator on the top (or provide a magnifying glass with your EDT).</li>
    <li> Good price. Good Service. Arrived on time as it was advertised. No problems of any kind. Great buy, look forward doing business again.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite cologne ever!  Smells fresh and clean.  Co-worker always compliment my fresh smell.  I recommend it for men or women.</li>
    <li> I dig this scent, and so do others. I work in customer service, so smell is an important first impression. I get comments often that &amp;#34;i&amp;#34; smell great. The bottle does seem watered down to some degree, but honestly, maybe I am just used to the smell. When it runs out years from now ( the bottle is a beast ) I will buy another.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne on my husband.</li>
    <li> Excellent Fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAAA++++</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance and it is difficult to find a retail markets.  Good price and excellent delivery time.  I have refilled his supply of this fragrance from Amazon over the years.</li>
    <li> Its original, good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years and always been complimented on it. My last purchase was a 3.4 oz bottle, at one of the major department stores, roughly 3 years ago. I use cologne sparingly and prefer the smell not to be overwhelming. Between 2 and 3 sprays (at most) from the previous bottle, lasted through out the day. The new bottle I purchased from Amazon smells diluted (like ethanol), and 5+ sprays are hardly noticeable after a 15 minute commute to work. Side by side (the previously bottle is nearly out, but still had some left) there is a noticeable difference between the old and new bottle when sprayed on opposite wrists. I am not sure if quality has simply gone down on Dior&#x27;s part, or the products being sold are not authentic / diluted. Returning purchase... I encourage buyers to be aware of similar reviews and if purchased, to compare this product with another source and write a review here.</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal. I&#x27;m used to buying the smaller bottles, a lot more expensive.  Hope I can find this same deal again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best eseence, great projection and fixation! Even for men and women! Love it, my prefferred perfume! Buy again and again! Love this fuel and woody scent</li>
    <li> This could be original or a knock off, not sure.  If original then ifs old and expired.  Smells like I poured VODKA over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it from a good quality department store.  To name a few: Macys, Bloomingdales, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth what they are charging for bad stuff.</li>
    <li> Great value for 200 ml perfume bottle</li>
    <li> I love the way my husband smells when he wears this stuff! It&#x27;s my favorite cologne for him! Good price too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this in years. I bought it and I am glad I did. It smells just as good as I remember.</li>
    <li> I ordered it 2 weeks before. It is fake. I only use this perfume since 1990, I can tell right away.</li>
    <li> its an old favorite of mine its one of those scents u can never forget</li>
    <li> Everything worked out great,delivery was as promised,shipped well,and packed well. The  product was as described and expected. A great place to search and fined pretty much anything your looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been harder to find Farenheit in the larger bottle! Great.</li>
    <li> This is not the actual cologne but a knockoff, smelled entirely different.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume for my husband .</li>
    <li> Very Earthy, long-lasting masculine scent. Timeless 80s cologne and one of the best :)</li>
    <li> I remmeber when i was younger my father used this scent&lt;br /&gt;cause this scent makes you feel like an important person&lt;br /&gt;Sincerily this is one of my favorite scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package eas very good</li>
