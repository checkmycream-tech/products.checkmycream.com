      <li>I have given a time to this product in order to give an honest and precise review and</li>
      <li>So I did a bunch of research online and your product seemed to come to the top of the list each time</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally, Joseph at Smooth Viking contacted me via email and wanted to make sure the product was working out.</li>
      <li>It works well and is great for their sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My husband can kiss me finely without poking me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*regardless of getting the item for free</li>
      <li>I find worth noting and think is really cute</li>
      <li>My beard is now silky smooth</li>
      <li>got this product free for review.</li>
      <li>I responded back that it was and that I was very pleased and he offered me an additional tin for free!</li>
      <li>I am pleased to say this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>when we first it for free* to try and review</li>
      <li>Oh, and the little burlap bags you send them in- is a nice touch!</li>
      <li>he felt that using them all at the same time (though they do state that you can) might be too much for him, however he will keep this for special occasions and wants to make sure he looks extra good, everything in place where it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it helps keep smooth and soft</li>
      <li>We definitely are Smooth Viking fans from here on out!</li>
      <li>Instantly made my mans beard look more manicured and neat.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s your guy then this is for them or just for the guy who has a basic goatee (which is my favorite).</li>
      <li>It had its shine back, the nice dark brown color (it had turned light brown when it started breaking) and the shape of it was going back to the nice shape it had prior to becoming brittle.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shape it as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>So really this is for hubby to use not me, but</li>
      <li>My husband really likes it</li>
      <li>Its been a couple weeks now, and it really has improved the look, feel and texture of his beard.</li>
      <li>Absolutely buy this beard balm.</li>
      <li>They come in these amazing little burlap sacks which makes a great gift presentation that looks expensive but, isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I like the ingredients, they are natural and pure.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a little pungent for my taste, but may be OK for others.  </li>
      <li>He had people complimenting it left &amp; right.</li>
      <li>It’s like a paste or pomade type product, thick and waxy feeling but soft and smooth enough to work with it easily.</li>
      <li>I then used my fingertips to smooth down and straighten out the areas I just ruffled by working this balm into his hairs.</li>
      <li>They are made from all natural ingredients like shea butter, beeswax, avacado oil, almond oil, mango butter and just everything that will make that lucious beard feel and smell like heaven.</li>
      <li>Said it makes his beard soft.</li>
      <li>So I have some pretty coarse facial hair and this product has helped immensely with that.</li>
      <li>Once all was said and done he looked in the mirror and touched it some and said that it was good, didn’t make his beard feel greasy or dirty but was holding the hairs in place without feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So kudos to the Smooth Viking folk as they seem genuinely interested in building a loyal customer base.</li>
      <li>The beard balm might have other uses, I haven’t decided exactly on those yet, but perhaps for styling regular hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sorry had to go back to my Honest Amish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the small price to improve the facial fur.</li>

<li> I bought the Smooth Viking beard balm &amp; the conditioner for my husband because his beard was looking very dry and was becoming brittle and breaking (insert very sad wife face here!).</li>
<li> I use half as much of this as I do the other stuff and get about 8x the hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Next time though I&#x27;ll likely get one of the other ones.</li>
<li> I been giving it a chance but the bland smell of it and the flat feeling it leaves my beard just isn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
<li> Surprised at some of these negative reviews.</li>
<li> I expected SOME smell, but there was none.</li>
<li> it is kind of annoying as well.</li>
<li> It is a much harder, tacky, paste like substance than other beard balms, which is where it gets its hold.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I used the balm by scraping out a small bit with my finger tips and used those same finger tips to work it through all the hairs on his beard and mustache.</li>
<li> A few things -- 1) I had been using the Prof Fuzzworthy product for a while.</li>
<li> /&gt;After using the balm a few times he’s decided it’s not something he is going to use all the time, since he also has an oil and conditioner</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t seem gloppy or too heavy.</li>
<li> But it will not go to waste.</li>
<li> I wanted something to tame my unruly manliness on my face and the reviews led me here.</li>
<li> It was oily, but did condition well, but provided very little hold.</li>
<li> Heavy Duty, they weren&#x27;t kidding!</li>
<li> This stuff took my crazy gnarly beard and sent it to military school.</li>
<li> This product does help with crazy hairs that just do not want to stay down.</li>
<li> Too bad my man shaved his facial hair before this came as a surprise :(.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i gave this as as gift to my dad, he loves it!!</li>
    <li> It does the job.  The fragrance is a little pungent for my taste, but may be OK for others.  It&#x27;s citrus meets an industrial cleaning closet.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it and i can see that his beard looks a lot healthier</li>
    <li> I have given a time to this product in order to give an honest and precise review and my overall opinion about is it definitely softens the texture of the beard but in my case i haven&#x27;t noticed any thickening or difference on growth speed, but my overall idea about is; it&#x27;s a great product for it&#x27;s price and i see no reason to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Heavy Duty, they weren&#x27;t kidding! This stuff took my crazy gnarly beard and sent it to military school. I can finally shape/style my beard the way I want. I&#x27;m in charge now, not the beard.</li>
    <li> Instantly made my mans beard look more manicured and neat. Didn&#x27;t seem gloppy or too heavy. It&#x27;s worth the small price to improve the facial fur. I&#x27;d without a doubt purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in order to provide my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> So I have some pretty coarse facial hair and this product has helped immensely with that. As far as having a fuller beard that is harder to tell since it could just be the hair growing in overtime so take that with a grain of salt. No unpleasant odors, good price and great customer service. Very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> I bought the Smooth Viking beard balm &amp; the conditioner for my husband because his beard was looking very dry and was becoming brittle and breaking (insert very sad wife face here!). So I did a bunch of research online and your product seemed to come to the top of the list each time so we thought we would give it a try. He started using it the day he got it and honestly, within one week of alternating between the balm &amp; conditioner his beard was looking magnificent again!! It had its shine back, the nice dark brown color (it had turned light brown when it started breaking) and the shape of it was going back to the nice shape it had prior to becoming brittle. He loves using it and I LOVE the results. We definitely are Smooth Viking fans from here on out! Oh, and the little burlap bags you send them in- is a nice touch! Its been a couple weeks now, and it really has improved the look, feel and texture of his beard. He has gotten a lot of compliments on it recently. Especially at the Spartan race we just ran in Colorado Springs this last weekend! He had people complimenting it left &amp; right.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my bf he started to regrow his beard it helps keep smooth and soft I totally recommended this to my roommate also!!</li>
    <li> This product does help with crazy hairs that just do not want to stay down. It doesn&#x27;t shape it as much as I thought it would. It&#x27;s more just to keep it all uniform. I like the ingredients, they are natural and pure. Beard Balm doesn&#x27;t leave the beard looking oily, or greasy. It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I write my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I been giving it a chance but the bland smell of it and the flat feeling it leaves my beard just isn&#x27;t doing the job. The fact that I have to scrape it with the back of my nail and try to emulsify it is kind of annoying as well. Sorry had to go back to my Honest Amish</li>
    <li> Surprised at some of these negative reviews. I use this product daily. It smells good, helps mold my beard into shape in the morning, and keeps it in good condition.</li>
    <li> My beard is now silky smooth</li>
    <li> Works great leaves a nice sheen. Great addition to my routine</li>
    <li> A few things -- 1) I had been using the Prof Fuzzworthy product for a while. It was oily, but did condition well, but provided very little hold. I wanted something to tame my unruly manliness on my face and the reviews led me here. I am pleased to say this is exactly what I wanted. 2) I got the unscented one, and I must say if you want unscented, it is perfect. Next time though I&#x27;ll likely get one of the other ones.

So kudos to the Smooth Viking folk as they seem genuinely interested in building a loyal customer base. Absolutely buy this beard balm. If you have unruly, cannot be contained MANLY facial hair, this will help you look your best.</li>
    <li> Living in Brooklyn, I see a lot of guys walking around with massive beards and handle bar mustaches. If that&#x27;s your guy then this is for them or just for the guy who has a basic goatee (which is my favorite). These make nice grooming kit gifts. They are made from all natural ingredients like shea butter, beeswax, avacado oil, almond oil, mango butter and just everything that will make that lucious beard feel and smell like heaven. They come in these amazing little burlap sacks which makes a great gift presentation that looks expensive but, isn&#x27;t. i received this item for reviews. Opinions are completely my own as you can see...lol.</li>
    <li> Really great ingredients. Awesome texture. Perfect mix of beeswax and nice essential oil blend for the scent - mostly cedar. Too bad my man shaved his facial hair before this came as a surprise :(. But it will not go to waste. It doubles for a sexy, manly hand salve.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and they love it! It works well and is great for their sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, he loves it..  Said it makes his beard soft.</li>
    <li> Thankful for this!!!! My husband can kiss me finely without poking me.</li>
    <li> So really this is for hubby to use not me, but when we first it for free* to try and review I helped him out because I wanted to also see what it was like for him to use. I used the balm by scraping out a small bit with my finger tips and used those same finger tips to work it through all the hairs on his beard and mustache. It’s like a paste or pomade type product, thick and waxy feeling but soft and smooth enough to work with it easily. I then used my fingertips to smooth down and straighten out the areas I just ruffled by working this balm into his hairs. Once all was said and done he looked in the mirror and touched it some and said that it was good, didn’t make his beard feel greasy or dirty but was holding the hairs in place without feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the balm a few times he’s decided it’s not something he is going to use all the time, since he also has an oil and conditioner he felt that using them all at the same time (though they do state that you can) might be too much for him, however he will keep this for special occasions and wants to make sure he looks extra good, everything in place where it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find worth noting and think is really cute is that this tin came in a tiny jute drawstring bag. The beard balm might have other uses, I haven’t decided exactly on those yet, but perhaps for styling regular hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting the item for free this is both mine and hubbies 100% honest opinions.</li>
