      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is good</li>

      <li>epilator is nicely designed, has great features and seems to get rid even of the tiniest hairs (legs, bikini and armpits).</li>
      <li>I loved this.</li>
      <li>PICKED THIS ONE FOR THE WIFE AND SEEMS WORKES GOOD FOR HER.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly I didn&#x27;t feel a thing when I did them.  </li>

      <li>So it has good features and not so good features.</li>
      <li>The hair came out finer, and I really loved that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as good as I&#x27;d hoped or the one I just had to replace (which lasted 10 years, btw).</li>
      <li>This is the best substitute for the original that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>This one is great, I love it.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>nice product!&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
      <li>but honestly beware of bruises and scars</li>
      <li>all in all i liked the results just not the pain durring the epilation process</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have a cordless option</li>
      <li>is a bit more pricey, but it does a good job.</li>
      <li>I would have given 5 stars for an effective machine.  </li>
      <li>If there isn&#x27;t hair, all you feel is the nice massaging rollers.</li>
      <li>and I can tell that it is a really nice epilator</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own carrying pouch</li>
      <li>and did I mention the ice pack was my new best friend?</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks good, it work good and is worth it, some area</li>
      <li>but either way it has good results, but i think the more tweezers the better.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, picks up all hairs and the light is wonderful.</li>
      <li>This works so good on keeping you hair free for a longer period, instead of shaving every two days.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best product ever!</li>
      <li>So far this epilator has been awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use!  </li>
      <li>Works great on my skin texture and no burns or allergy experienced till now unlike wax that reacts to my skin texture and forms red bubbles for a week.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working LOL</li>
      <li>But It&#x27;s a easy to adjust to kind of pain.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I finish more quickly but the results aren&#x27;t good.  </li>
      <li>However, I love the light!</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The Braun functions okay aside from this problem.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I totally recommend you this product!! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I had an older Silk Epil and the new one is better, more powerfull and you remove your hair in few minutes and you get smooth skin easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s so much easier and quicker than shaving and waxing.  I thought it was going to hurt a lot, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  Gets pretty much all of their hair and lasts for quite a while.  The only downside is that the cord comes out easily, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
    <li> Love this! My suggestion is also to wax your legs before the first time you use this, so it won&#x27;t hurt as bad. This works really well, better than waxing, but you do have to go back over the same spots sometimes. If there isn&#x27;t hair, all you feel is the nice massaging rollers.</li>
    <li> Love it, removes hair very effectively. Too bad it&#x27;s not water proof.</li>
    <li> Had to call Braun on how to start the it...did not tell you in the directions that you must turn the red ring around the big button to start it up...</li>
    <li> I loved this. I feel almost no pain compared to my old satinele. Is also easy to reach all regions of skin becausr if its head. Is very good. This model is to dry condition and with wire, there are other options, but this work well for me.</li>
    <li> first time epilating ever and I admit it does hurt at first but it&#x27;s less pain and time than using a tweezer. I love how it gets the shortest hair out as well. It only hurt where hair existed (of course) and I am guessing it should hurt less not only because my body would get used to the pain but because there will be less to tweeze out next time I epilate. Cleaning it is easy too with the mini brush that comes with it and water. It tends to really get the coarser hair, sometimes misses the really fine/thin hair but still worked great. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> i bought this epilator because my Braun silk epil soft perfection (body as in Silk Epil 3) stopped working. There seemed to be a problem with its motor.&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to decide with which design to go. I don&#x27;t care for fancy lights or shaver heads. It seems as though all the new styles had the light and pretty much they all had the new longer body. I think they look beautiful, but in my opinion this unit is a little big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mostly disappointed with the fact that the top part with the soft rollers/brushes does not come off. It is permanently attached to the unit itself.  As you will see from the two photos I attached of my own old epilator, there is an attachment that has those same rollers, BUT it is an option whether I want to use it or not. In all honesty, those rollers do not help in any way. Epilating will not be less painful or more pleasant if those rollers are present. I personally have never used that attachment on my unit, and I have epilating for more than 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I was really dissatisfied with this epilator because those tiny brushes/bristles are on the way of the tweezers reaching the short hairs and for this reason you are left with hair on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think Braun did a bad job designing this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it and ordered the newer version of my silk epil soft perfection which is silk epil 3 - it has the same body, but it has a light.</li>
    <li> It did okay. Gets all the hair off and I&#x27;ve even used it near my bikini line with success. Sometimes it missed a hair or two but I found that it&#x27;s usually because of the way the hair is growing out, so changing the direction I was using it in would help.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool. Avoids my legs and arm pits looking like an unshaven man !!</li>
    <li> This series is fine but after researching more I found that it is not cordless like the bottom description states.  I also call Braun directly thinking that I was not charging it long enough.  He too reasured me  that it was cordless.  So I decide to spend about $20.00 more and purchase the Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet &amp; Dry Epilator 1.  Well worth the money not to be attached to an umbilical cord.  To many cords in life as it is. Hope this helps and saves time for all.</li>
    <li> It is so good. I totally recommend it. It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This item is my absolute favorite item. I had a different brand one for about 7 years that I always used, well eventually ask thus do begin to break down as this had but I didn&#x27;t want to just buy any old one they had till offer. I did research after research &amp; really thought about what things would make my new one even better. Finally after literally about a month a reattach, I finally went with this item. The number of tweezers you get I&#x27;d a great amount for both large &amp; small areas, three bonus feature of the light is do helpful.  I didn&#x27;t realize the hairs I was actually missing until this little light pointed them it. It&#x27;s Shari very easy to clean, comes apart with little effort &amp; wipe it off &amp; it&#x27;s ready for the next use. Can&#x27;t in a travel case, etch I just use for storage. Also it&#x27;s much quieter then the previous over I had, they have really made some great updates with this model.</li>
    <li> I love the light although it seems upside down to me. The floating head scratched my skin. I gave it four stars because it gets more hair than any other epilator that I have used.</li>
    <li> It does remove some of the hair. I still have to tweeze or shave. I guess my expectations were too high.</li>
    <li> Honestly speaking,I did not use this brand however I will say an epilator in general has completely scarred my leg to a point where months after its use the marks are still present and I don&#x27;t believe they will ever go away. I am a colored girl maybe that it why I scar easily, however I can never where shorts anymore, I can&#x27;t even show my ankle! It is gross and maybe other girls have found it useful but honestly beware of bruises and scars</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with this epilator but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.... I was perfectly fine with my $20 emoji divine epilator and I thought I was upgrading with this epilator. But contrary to all it&#x27;s highlights, it does not pick up hairs &amp;#34;as short as a grain of sand,&amp;#34; it barely picks up regular length hairs. To get even most of the hairs removed on my legs I have to - slowly- go over the same spot more than 5 times and even then shorter, finer hairs are still left behind. Another fault is that I feel like I am completely downgrading as far as portability with this epilator; the emoji divine was battery operated so I could use it anywhere. I was led on that this epilator was chargeable, yeah, but I didn&#x27;t realize you had to plug it in for use, restricting you to use it within 4 feet of an outlet. The only things I liked about this epilator were that there was a light, and that the head was detachable for easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> The braun silk-epil 5185 epilator works great you will go over a spot 1 or 2 times but it does would also it will need to be plugged in to work it is not wireless</li>
    <li> a great epilator with an average price,  the best braun series i have in years and its worth your money.</li>
    <li> I am speechless with this bad boy. I&#x27;ve tried everything razors , wax &amp; they all irritate my skin really bad . I&#x27;m not ganna lie it seem kinda scary at first because for some reason you think its ganna cut you or something . I tried this &amp; I was like AMAZING !!! It is so gentle &amp; it leaves every part really smooth (; I love it &amp;#60;3 &amp; BRAUN send it to me for free hello what are you waiting for ? You need this bad boy in your life ASAP !!!</li>
    <li> It actually hurt me to use but I&#x27;m going to try it again with cooling pack! Other than that I think it would work ok with getting hairs short!</li>
    <li> It is a very good epilator. Remove hair very well and fast, you do not need to repass it too many times. The light is quite convenient to double check for those small hairs usually missed. The size and the angle of the machine make it very confortable to handle. The engine it is not loud at all, still some noise should be expected. But... The pivoting head is the most useless, non-sense, annoy thing ever, actually it is an obstacle for a perfect epilating job, so I just remove it, which it does not make me too happy since I do not like when I have to modidy a brand new expensive thing.</li>
    <li> It is a great buy. It works perfectly! I like it very much and will buy one for my sister also.</li>
    <li> I used to shave my legs, but the hair would grow back in two three days. Although i am not hairy but it is annoying in summer. Waxing is too much of a hassle so i got this, i have been using it for almost two yrs now. Things that i love about it&lt;br /&gt;- extra long cord&lt;br /&gt;- mini light to highlight the area in contact&lt;br /&gt;- detachable head so it could be washed&lt;br /&gt;Some TIPS for the First Time users :&lt;br /&gt;- When you detach the head there is a fine rotatory part that comes off, be careful when you are do this, i almost got mine go into the drain.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t try it on full blown hair growth....it will be excruciatingly painful. If you have full growth shave first then try in two/ three days.&lt;br /&gt;- Do try it on the underarms but same principle applies - don&#x27;t try on the full FORREST shave it first .</li>
    <li> Before receiving the Braun Silk-épil 5 epilator from Braun I was having to shave EVERYDAY, and even at that I was left with tiny dark spots all over my legs and underarms from the hair left behind in my pores. With the epilator my legs and underarms now look smooth and truly hairless, best part is that even after 3 days my skin still look amazingly smooth!!! The process is a bit painful but well worth the results. I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind great results in exchange of a little pain.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this epilator and I just can tell you that it is very efficient. The hair is pulled right from the root which makes the whole process really painful even with short hair (or maybe it is just my sensitive skin). This is a great product. Takes a little getting accustomed to but the results are worth it. I would definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I got my Braun SILK-&amp;Eacute;PIL 5 and won&#x27;t change it for nothing&lt;br /&gt;It looks good, it work good and is worth it, some area my hurt but is worth it the results are much better than the razor.  So if you are looking to save time in the long way its perfect</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this epilator, it did the job and was pretty efficient. At first it was pretty painful, but after a while, I kind of got used to it and there are methods to epilating that can really help it go by faster. The only downside to this which I was not expecting would be the cord. Maybe the one I got was defective but the cord just won&#x27;t stay! Ugh! It&#x27;s so aggravating especially when you&#x27;re in the middle of epilating and the cord just falls off your epilator. Other than that, I guess I could say it was worth the money. I usually only epilate once a week also which is when it&#x27;s at the optimal length where it&#x27;s not too long to where it would really hurt and not too short to where the tweezers wouldn&#x27;t be able to pick up the tiny hairs.</li>
    <li> the first two times it hurt like hell when i used this epilator but after that it feels like nothing… i have waxed and i think its hurts less than waxing… my armpits are also not as dark as they used to be…my hairs grow back zoo much slower now... I&#x27;m always going to use an epilator from now on</li>
    <li> So there&#x27;s no way around this, epilating hurts. You are essentially tweezing every hair on your leg at a really fast rate. So be prepared, it&#x27;s not going to tickle, especially if you have never done this before or you have thick hair with deep roots, like I do. It&#x27;s likely going to be red, irritated and sore where you used an epilator for a little while. That being said, if you are going to go this route, this product is the way to go. It&#x27;s small but powerful, comes with it&#x27;s own carrying pouch and did I mention the ice pack was my new best friend? Definitely helped to numb the areas first. It didn&#x27;t stay frozen too terribly long but it certainly came in handy. I would have much preferred a cordless epilator as that cord can be a little unwieldy but as for the epilator itself i think it&#x27;s a good product. The swiveling head makes it easier to reach the tougher areas (i.e. Behind the knee). All in all it&#x27;s a solid product but I don&#x27;t feel it warrants 5 stars for all the above reasons. I am still very happy I received this product free from Braun as a BzzAgent and would likely recommend it to any friend in the market for a new epilator</li>
    <li> I was given this epilator from the brand in exchange for my review. I&#x27;m a die-hard epilator fan, since I love that it is longer lasting than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my normal epilator, this one was so much more smooth to use. I kept thinking of the word &amp;#34;gliding&amp;#34; to describe how it felt on my skin. I loved the overall packaging of the epilator - I thought it was BRILLIANT that it included an ice pack, because there are times when epilators can really leave your legs feeling tender and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I LOVE this epilator. The ease of using it and the effectiveness are top notch.</li>
    <li> I started using an epilator about 6 months ago and I won&#x27;t ever go back to any other method. I bought a low end one before and this one is great, with a light (which really helps). Others have complained about the plug disconnecting, but you just have to make sure that it clicks in and you won&#x27;t have any trouble. I have pretty light hair, so it only hurt the first couple of times (especially the armpits). But if you stick with it, the hair gets lighter and softer. I epilate about once a week after 6 months of use. Great product and I expect the Braun to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used Epilady epilators for many years and was reluctant to change styles but I am extremely happy with both the effectiveness but also that there is none of the hair pulling feeling of the spring type epilator.  I really like the light since what hair I do have on my legs is so fine after so many years, it helps find the strays.</li>
    <li> Works better than waxing, although it leaves a few hairs they&#x27;re not nearly to the same amount as waxing. If you shave after epilating with this your legs will be silky for around 7 days - the little hairs it leaves behind are extrememly fine and slow growing so shaving gives you completely smooth for a few days, at least in my case.The first time I use this it was a little painful but the 2nd time I bearly felt it. Its sort of the same as when you first wax it gets better with time. I have very sensative skin and after I shave I always have red bumps and with this I didn&#x27;t. If used correctly and follow the instructions this epilator will be a life saver...no more money spend on waxing trips (which can be very costly) and best of all it has a cord to plug it in so you won&#x27;t need to be replacing batteries and it will always have the same power as you first used it which is a huge plus :).Super easy to clean just hold under water for a few secounds and thats all ..Look no further you wont be disappointed your legs will  feel so smooth..ready for the beach!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product to review from Braun. This product came with a bag for storange,a tiny brush for cleaning,a gel ice pack,and a very long cord. I would highly suggest you use the gel pack if you have sensitive skin or not used to using a product like this. The epilator has a light so you can see the hair,and has two settings. I was shocked by how much it stung the first time I used it. I then decided to use the gel pack,after doing half of my first leg I decided to read the instructions. *you have to stretch your skin while you are doing this* After I read that,it was a breeze with hardly any stinging pain. Overall,I enjoyed using this product. It did as it said and gave me very smooth legs,however,I did not like that it stung so much. I will say that adding the gel ice pack was a great idea!</li>
    <li> I had a series 3 and wanted to upgrade.  Saw this on sale and bought it.  I&#x27;m not new to epilation, so I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure when you buy the product though, you check to see what it is made for.  I forgot to do that and got this one which was specifically for legs.  Same product as body but with out all the different head attachments.  Again this was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ice glove is not something I use.  The light is somewhat useful.  It is water washable, which is very nice.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it has these massage rollers on the head that you can&#x27;t take off.  But again that is because this is the legs only version.  I make do by removing the cap altogether, and using it that way.  But if I were making the purchase again I&#x27;d get the body version of this model.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing system!! I love the Braun Silk Epil Epilator. I have used it for a while now and my legs have never looked smoother or felt better.</li>
    <li> nice product!&lt;br /&gt;worth it!</li>
    <li> I had the original silk epil some 20 or more years ago and was able to find someone selling a new old-style one which lasted another 10 years. This is the best substitute for the original that I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job and takes a little longer to do, but it&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I had the first silk epil that was launched over a decade ago. This one is so much better and less painful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good stuff. And it&#x27;s duble voltage (100-240v).</li>
    <li> I would give the Braun Series 5-5185 Silk Epil Epilator 10 stars if I could! I purchased this a few weeks ago and used it right after I brought it home, I still don&#x27;t have any stubble on my legs! It is fast and easy to use and with the power of 40 tweezers it takes half as long as shaving. I recommended this product to all of my friends and everyone is hooked. I suggest every women go out and get this asap!!!</li>
    <li> I have an older Braun which only has 25 tweezers.  It take 45 min to epi my legs.  I bought this Series 5 thinking my time would be cut in half as it has more tweezers.  Yes, I finish more quickly but the results aren&#x27;t good.  I think my hair is breaking more than getting pulled; that&#x27;s also the case with my older Braun Series 3.  Regrowth occurs within 5 days.  I have to epi every week.  I&#x27;m very envious of those who get 3-5 weeks hair free.  I&#x27;ve tried two Braun&#x27;s and an Emjoy.  Still need to epi weekly.  The cost of electricity is high in Hawaii so I may need to change back to shaving.  UGH!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I&#x27;d hoped or the one I just had to replace (which lasted 10 years, btw). I actually had to remove the cover over the head to get this to actually pick up &amp; remove the hair.With it on, I was running it back &amp; forth over the same area for what seemed like an unreasonable amount of time to get the job done!! However, I love the light! Saw all kinds of hairs I&#x27;ve probably been missing!</li>
    <li> Great little epilator. I love the thing  it has a light, really helpful. May be this item is a bit more pricey, but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Really good ... Replaced it with my old Braun one. Should last about two years and I will get latest.</li>
    <li> I have been using similar products but different brands well over eleven years. This is by far the best product ever! Love it!</li>
    <li> So, I received the Braun new Silk Epilator 5, for free, as part of a BzzAgent.com campaign.. The packaging was great. But after that, it all went wrong.  The cooling glove you receive with the product is awkwardly shaped and the gel pack that goes inside of it doesn’t fit quite right.  The product needs to be plugged in during usage,  which makes it difficult with it&#x27;s short cord.  Finally, I used the product, carefully following the instructions. It was the MOST painful hair removal process of my life and I still had to shave afterwards. This item may be better if it included a numbing gel.  Two thumbs WAY WAY down!</li>
    <li> this was my first time trying something like this. When i first got it i had let my leg hairs grow for about 1 week to make sure they were all long enough to get them all (leg hairs grow at different rates, so if you shave a few days before you may have to epilate every 2-3 days for a while till you get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The pain was horrid but i stuck thru it. after I was done with both legs I waited about 2 hours then got in shower and shaved with a razor just to make sure I wouldnt have a problem with ingrown hairs. Its really important that you scrub all the dead skin off after using the epilator. but to be easier i just shaved to get the dead skin off.&lt;br /&gt;it was about 3 weeks before i started feeling little pricklies here and there... now every couple of days i run it over my legs to get a few that have started to grow. it doesnt hurt at all anymore!!! only the first time hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for christmas 2012. 10 days ago i went ahead and bared the pain of my under arms. that was worse than my legs...but in 10 days i have bare soft underarms still!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this!!!  oh and on my underarms...i did 1 arm pit one day and the other pit the 2nd day.  ya im kinda a wuss! lol  but i love this!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried my bikini line... but it left lots of gross ingrown hairs and zit looking things... its was nasty..i wont do it there again, but legs and pits totally awesome!!</li>
    <li> However, it gives me a horrible rash.  Too bad, because I liked the way it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my skin is too sensitive or what, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I needed a new epilator and Braun met and exceeded my expectations. The cool pack and the build-in light are additional features which are very practical for warm weather and limited lightening conditions.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife about two months ago and she likes it so much and works great. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is the best epilator compared to some brands I used before. Braun is very good brand.</li>
    <li> Ok so this is my third epilator. I&#x27;ve owned an older braun but that died on me after 6 years of use. Then I bought the Remington wet/dry but that no longer holds a charge and you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (after a year use). Now I decided to get another Braun and was torn between the 5 series and the 7 series and I decided to go with the 5 series because I actually prefer the cord after having problems with the Remington not holding a charge, and I never really use the the epilator in the shower. Tried this one out yesterday and WOW. So much better than the older model, and it was significantly better than the Remington. I almost felt no pain (well no pain for epilating, of course it will hurt somewhat but it was very doable and a lot faster). I would definitely recommend the 5 series, the cord is long too). If you want to have the option to use it in the shower or don&#x27;t like a cord then go with the 7 series (reviews said they were very similar).</li>
    <li> A gift for my darling wife.  She seems to love it. It&#x27;s hard for me to say how they feel, personally, but if she asks you to do it for her, be a gentleman and say yes...</li>
    <li> My old Brown Silk-Epil finally kicked the bucket after eight (!) years.  I wanted a very simple model, because I do not use my epilator under water, neither I need pain-reducing massage or a laser aim. This model perfectly fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two features I absolutely love:&lt;br /&gt;- Little light. Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;- The unit is washable! I hated to use the brush to clean all hairs out of the tweezers. Now I can just rinse it, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the old-school model I used to have, this one has a better design. It is narrower and easier to grip; on/off \\&quot;dial\\&quot; is very intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain is very tolerable, but I am used to epilating/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is nicely designed, has great features and seems to get rid even of the tiniest hairs (legs, bikini and armpits). What not to love?</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean. The cord is nice and long. I never used one before, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, I am the first time user and was expecting to feel so much pain but this Epilator was just awesome, I mean there was pain but not that much, I just had a little problem with the cord at the beginning, It was a little loose and from time to time, It felt down then I said are you kidding me! I was in the middle of my underarm and it felt and felt.., but then I tried to fix it an actually it was so tight that I could not take it off very easily. Now it is 5 days that I don&#x27;t see any hair but in fact it does not remove all the hairs from the root if you are not posing it as instructions, which is 90 degrees with your body, so I guess it needs some practice but Overall I love that and do recommend it,&lt;br /&gt;Good luck on your hair removal,</li>
    <li> I am happy with the performance of this epilator - it&#x27;s easy to use, not too painful and efficient at picking up the hairs. It is NOT cordless (which was what was written in the comparison chart). I think this needs to be amended.</li>
    <li> I had used a Silk Epil in France for 10 years and was very happy with it. 7 years, ago, I moved to the US, and brought it along with me, but France runs 230v when it&#x27;s 110 here. I had then bought an adapter to convert the electricity settings,but it wouldn&#x27;t work properly. I liked so much the Silk Epil I had, that I bought an American one, and was very very disappointed with the result. I couldn&#x27;t see any difference with shaving as the hair seemed to be cut rather than plucked, resulting in a need to pass again almost everyday for the hope of a smooth result. So I gave up and went for waxing, with all its hassles. Recently, with the summer heat, I came to find it really inconvenient, not to mention that when you wax, you have to let your hair grow enough, which is pretty annoying while wearing shorts in the summer. I was therefore alternating between waxing and shaving, and never really liked the latter as my hair is coarse and dark on a very white skin. Tired with all this, I decided to give another shot to the silk epil, and purchased the 5185. Here is my experience after a day ( I will update in a couple of weeks):&lt;br /&gt;1. Pain: I can&#x27;t really tell, because with waxing and all, I don&#x27;t feel it anymore. I would say that the more you do it, the less you feel it. If you shave regularly, it will hurt more at the beginning, and then less and less as you use the Silk Epil. On that note, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use the cooling/soothing glove.&lt;br /&gt;2. Redness: I experienced way less redness than with waxing. I have a pretty sensitive skin, and the redness went away overnight. It usually takes 2 days with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;3. My legs are smooth and spotless. This epilator really catches all the hair, even the thinnest and shortest.&lt;br /&gt;4. On day 2, my legs are still smooth like after waxing, even better. I am not experiencing this shaving effect that I was complaining about with the older version of Silk Epil.&lt;br /&gt;5. The light is very convenient and helpful to grab all thehairs.&lt;br /&gt;6. The head really follows your shapes and it grabs it all even on the knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so far very satisfied with this product that has finally reached the level of effectiveness I was used to in France, + the light and the mobility of the head that my French one didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I know people complain a lot about the pain, but I really can&#x27;t tell because I have never shaved on a regular basis. I see how it can hurt then though...I know for a fact however, that the more you use this system, the less coarse your hair will be and the less pain you&#x27;ll feel.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun silk epil 3-series for 11 years. It still works but it&#x27;s loud with few tweezers so I decided to upgrade. This 5185 has all the good features of my old one but much improved. It&#x27;s very gentle, picks up all hairs and the light is wonderful. It took me half the time to get the job done and while there&#x27;s definitely some pain it&#x27;s bearable. I would highly recommend this product. Especially for the price it is an excellent alternative to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;PS. The chart comparison says it doesn&#x27;t have a pivoting head. It does. However, there&#x27;s no cordless option even though the chart says there is. Also, after about 3 months of using this I found out that the one big downside is that the cord gets unplugged from the unit very easily. I&#x27;m almost thinking of taping it/glueing it because otherwise the cord falls out every few minutes just from the movement of the epilator on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;PS. Thanks to a fellow user I realized that I wasn&#x27;t pushing the cord into the unit hard enough and now I no longer have an issue with it popping out.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators since 2000 and have gone through several brands/models including Emjoi Optima, Remington and two other Braun models all of which had individual pros/cons but with which I was generally satisfied.  The Braun Silk-Epil 5, Model 5185 is by far the worse epilator I have ever purchased.  The design is poor, the power cord keeps falling out of the device during use and the switch is difficult to turn, the actual epilator head is quite small and it did not get capture all the hair on my leg. I would return it if I could but I already opened and used it so for now  I am stuck.  I gave it one star for cute pink little carrying pouch.  I have the Braun Silk-Epil 3 with European adapter which I use when I travel and that is a far superior product. I&#x27;ll probably see if I can get an American adapter for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie and say it is painless. But It&#x27;s a easy to adjust to kind of pain.  And worth it!!  Gets every hair in one or two passes.  It&#x27;s been two months and I&#x27;m just barely seeing the faintest hair growth.  Used on bikini area as well.  Would not recommend unless you want to almost pass out from the pain!  Overall well worth the money!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love all the features. Works great. I&#x27;ve been using silk epil for 10 years til I fried mine abroad. This one has more tweezers, a light, and a head with shock absorbers. Glad the previous fried!</li>
    <li> My review isn&#x27;t about pain, I knew there would be some pain involved.  For those that dont expect it all I have to say is your crazy.  What do you think pulling hair out by the root would feel like?  Honestly it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as getting a tattoo, depending on where you are removing hair from.  Be realistic and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed with the fact that my legs were not smooth like when I shave.  I have epilated a few times now and find that each time it is getting a little better but I wish I had been warned, granted I would have still purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to fiddle with the plug because it tends to fall out and that is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am happy with it, and would suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the last Braun I had.  The plug keeps falling out of the device but I like the light and it seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> From the recipient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I got this model. I was really really skeptical, since I basically read all of the epilator reviews on amazon for about a month and a half because I was really uncomfortable with spending $50 to $100 on something that many reviewers had so many mixed experiences with the ones they&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a previous Braun model that was terrific; it epilated fast, and I could really tell that I had to epilator less often the more I used it. The hair came out finer, and I really loved that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching for that same one for weeks, I was frustrated that I couldnt find something comparable. I even contacted Braun to see where I could get a replacement, and all they could offer me was their newer models. So, I had to set out to find something that would hopefully work the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a few things that really stands out between this one and my old silk epil. First, this one seems to take longer to go over areas, and it&#x27;s less painful (which makes me think it&#x27;s probably cutting some hairs than tweezing them out). But the surprising thing is that I could use this one for my underarms (which was impossible to do with my old one because of the pain) and even a little around the bikini line. It also has a pivoting head which is helpful to go around the sloping areas, and a little light as well. I also chose this model because it was corded (I won&#x27;t buy a battery operated or cordless one, too much charging hassle). Now I don&#x27;t know if my legs are as smooth as they were before with my old model, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much as long as I properly exfoliate (since I was back to shaving anyway while trying to find a replacement epilator).&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my underarms was really the proof that this epil works; its SO much finer, and gets easier and easier to epilate with each application. Compared to my old model, I think I do have to use this epil alot more often (hair growth seems to still be pretty fast compared to my first epilator, but still less than shaving), but again, I don&#x27;t mind it, I just have to plan for it. It might be a good introductory epilator for you if you&#x27;ve never tried one since I do feel it is less painful than my first one. Also, I never use the second setting one this model since I feel the first setting doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs anyway, so I don&#x27;t want the epilating head to go any faster than it already is. I&#x27;ve had this model for 4 months now.</li>
    <li> Excellent. asdasd asdasd b b  zkxcas asdlkj kjbn;lk kjnkja asdkjqw klj lk poasd lkm aslk asldm,mn zcx akn asdn asdn</li>
    <li> so the cord to the plug is not really that long and yes it has to be plugged in while I&#x27;m using it. very uncomfortable. i really thought its cordless. woul not recommand to get this one. its annoying to use it</li>
    <li> I must be a glutton for punishment because I love this little torture device.  The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is because I feel it is not as effective as it claims and it definitely more painful.  I usually wax or shave, depending on how much time I have to allow for regrowth.  I hadn&#x27;t waxed my legs in a few months and had been having them.  I was only able to do a 2\\&quot; section before I had to stop as tears streamed down my face.  I thought I was just being a wuss and then I remembered that I play roller derby and have delivered a child without drugs.  I am no stranger to pain, but this was something fierce.  I got out a can of first aid/pain relief (lidocaine) spray and soaked my legs in that.  It certainly made it tolerable so I could finish.  I was able to go back and do touch ups the next day without any pain relief.  I&#x27;m sure with consistent use it will get easier.  After the pain of my legs I was hesitant to do my underarms because they normally hurt so much more.  Surprisingly I didn&#x27;t feel a thing when I did them.  They turned out nice and smooth with only a few missed hairs.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting (willing?) to try it out, but just know if you&#x27;re new to epilation it&#x27;s not as painless as others are claiming.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun epilator.  It works well.  I tried another brand in between my 2 Braun&#x27;s but sent it back because it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but not excellent, because you have to pass several times through the skin. However I recommend, is easy to use, easy to clean and convenient to store.</li>
    <li> This one is even better than the one I just wore out!  It&#x27;s quieter...and although I didn&#x27;t have an issue with pain with the older model I own, this one has even less!  I can hardly wait for my hair to grow back so I can use it again!</li>
    <li> finally updated and gave up on my old epilady, which I have loved for years.  I LOVE the new design and the light is very helpful!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  Love it.  It you have thought about that exensive No No, forget it.  This does the job and for a fraction of the price.  Even works well on that soft peach fuzz on the upper lip and jaw line.</li>
    <li> Yes it takes time to get used to the wretched feeling of pulling out hair by the roots, but after a few times of use, you don&#x27;t even notice it.  I do receive occasional ingrown hairs, but that&#x27;s the price you pay for having smooth legs for days - and trust me when I do traditional shaving I&#x27;m doing so every day on coarse dark hair - so to me this is a godsend!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that my legs were not as smooth as they are when I shave them. But after shaving my legs practically every day for forty years, it really is good to only have to fool with them every once every 7 to 10 days. I will stay with it.</li>
    <li> This epilator gets only four stars because it works great on my legs and arms, but I had to remove the guard that comes with it.  It does a better job getting at the hairs without the included guard that is shown in the picture.  I tried it on my bikini line and it did not do a very good job at all.  It pulled at the same hair (8 times at least) several times with out success.  So essentially it works well with very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, this thing is the devil.  Hurts so bad an leaves area red and not smooth. It is scary an loud!</li>
    <li> Everything as promised.  My old one (different manufacturer) was dull and worn out.  This one is great, I love it.</li>
    <li> My old braun Silk Epil was going bad after 5+ years of use, so I upgraded to this one, works just as well.</li>
    <li> Have owned this for a few months, and works well! I have been epilating for years and am used to it, like the way this one works.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much for the price!  It works well and I have no problem with the cord as some other reviewers mentioned.  If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator you might think it hurts but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The only issue I have with epilators in general is that one may get ingrown hairs because you are taking it off from the root not like shaving where you are cutting it at the surface of the skin.  Exfoliating is a must especially with older skin! I&#x27;ve tried waxing in the past but OUCH it hurts and what a mess to do yourself!  So for me this works great!</li>
    <li> Like the item..package and shipping were good. Only drawback is that unlike the waxing and shaving, you don&#x27;t have the smooth feeling when you epilate</li>
    <li> I have been used to waxing all my life, but recently I had to start doing it myself. I found it very difficult and time consuming, and I couldn&#x27;t get all the small hair. So I decided to buy epilator. Phillips and Braun are 2 brands known for their good epilators. I wanted something which was good, but didn&#x27;t need something very comprehensive. I looked over many products and settled for this one. The 5280 is an upgraded version with a shaver and trimmer head, but I didn&#x27;t need those as I don&#x27;t shave. 5185 is a good model with basic epilation, but can also be washed under water. The smart light is amazing and I am glad I picked Braun for it! I looked at a lot of websites and stores for this product, and Amazon had the best price with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my arms and legs and bikini area, and it is virtually painless - even though this is my first time ever using an epilator! Would definitely recommend this! If you&#x27;re looking for something more advanced, then I suggest the Silk Epil 7 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I have seen that the hair comes back in maximum 2 weeks, rather than 3-4 weeks that I have seen in other reviews of Silk epil</li>
    <li> works very well, easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would change is the chord that connects to the epilator, it unplugs too easily (loosely connected, I have to hold it so it doesn&#x27;t fall out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s the only draw-back though, it&#x27;s a very good product I&#x27;m glad I found it!! Lifesaver</li>
    <li> Even though the description says it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s an attachable cord. It is not at all (at least for mine) staying in when I connect it, so I have had to tape it together. For actually epilating, it does its job. You have to go really slow and go over spots multiple times to get most of the hairs. It&#x27;s not very efficient compared to other models that may cost only $10 or $20 more. It&#x27;s also extremely loud and can be mistaken as the sound of a vibrator (yes, that happened to me!) If you don&#x27;t mind an average epilator, this is fine. I do like how it comes with a gel pad though; that is one perk. It is also very easy to disassemble and clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this epilator twice and I can tell that it is a really nice epilator, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> great it was my 1st time and I have really sensitive skin but it was AWESOME because i usually wax but this was easier cause i freak out when i wax i got it for free from bzzagent</li>
    <li> so i ordered this epilator and did not no what to expect... let me tell you IT HURT LIKE HELL! (obviously) i dont care what anyone says tweesing or waxing all freaking hurt no matter what... but i took some motron and just bared thru the pain and boy oh boy it looked like i just got stung by a swarm of bee&#x27;s. the result the next morning was flawless, i had no hair what so ever on my legs and its been two weeks since i did the epilation. i would rather deal with the pain for like 30 minutes of torture to not have to shave every single day, or pay crazy money for waxing. all in all i liked the results just not the pain durring the epilation process lol</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s my third Braun epilator, and as always it&#x60;s awesome! The only thing the wire doesn&#x60;t sit tight in the epilator and it keeps falling out. Other then that it&#x60;s great!</li>
    <li> I like this product but it has a big problem,&lt;br /&gt;The charger is not really stick in its place and it will take out easily.&lt;br /&gt;It happened more than 10 times when I was using it.</li>
    <li> So this purchase would have been my 4th epilator. Most models come standard as cordless. Also since the description even said it was cordless, why would I question it? So the model is nice and sleek, so I try to charge it only to find out that it&#x27;s not a cordless model. returned it to look for a cordless model.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item knowing that epilators would be slightly noisy and that there would be some pain involved in the process. This product is very noisy but it does the job...that is if you can live with having to go over the same area MANY times. I went over my legs for a good half hour (each) and still have been tweezing hairs out because there were so many that were missed. I don&#x27;t know if that is normal or not for epilators since this was my first experience with one. I wound up returning it because the plug-in adapter continuously detached itself from the unit while in use. This was a big problem because I had to keep plugging it back in while working on my legs. I think that was a defect for this particular unit but, in any case, it had to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive for this item is that it is easy to clean and that the hair has not grown back (only the fine hairs have grown back - I think) so from a distance it doesn&#x27;t look like I have any hair on my legs. So it has good features and not so good features. Mine was probably defective. However, I think I will be looking for one that has a light so I can see some of the finer hairs and not have to do the job so many times.</li>
    <li> Twice they shipped me the wrong item. The one with cable. Even though i requested for cableless one, and the product specification said so..they repeteadly send the cabled one.Highly dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, comes apart easily for cleaning, light weight, very easy to use. Works really well. The light does help see any stray hairs. Head pivots for ease of use.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Very simple and fast to use.</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator in about 20 yrs and I just love them.  The hair grows back so slowly and so fine.  Note though, that initially you will have to let the hair grow out to stubble for it to have something to grab onto, and you have to do it a few times a couple of days apart.  This is because it cannot yank out the hairs that you have shaved off and are below the surface.  So it does the ones you see. Then in a few days the ones that were hiding pop up and you have to do them.  Then I am good for 4-6 weeks !! and the hair that grows back is so very fine that you really don&#x27;t even notice it at first.&lt;br /&gt;  This epilator is even better than my prior ones.  My first was a Braun and the second was a Remmington.  With the other ones I could really feel the hair being tweezed much more, yet this gets even tinier hairs.  How do they do that???  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working LOL&lt;br /&gt;  I even use my epilators on my facial hair, particularly above the lip.  It was a little sensitive the first time, but if you are used to tweezing or waxing.....its nothing!  I also have used it on my armpits.  It works fine, but just be sure to pull the skin to make it taut or it pinches the skin.  If you do that you will be fine&lt;br /&gt;  In the end, I love it even more than my previous ones, which I absolutely loved.  I only buy new ones every 10 yrs when mine wear out.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this epilator free from Braun!  I opened it, plugged it in, and got to work on my legs right away.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to get started, no assembly, just plug it in and go.  It would be nice to have a cordless option though so you didn&#x27;t have to stay close to the wall the whole time.  The epilation hurt, as expected, but not as bad as some that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light was a nice touch so that you can easily see all the hairs and make sure you aren&#x27;t missing anything.  It also came with a nice little pink carrying case.  I do think it took quite awhile though (20 minutes or so per leg, just passed the knee), and I&#x27;m not really a hairy person.  I used the cooling gel and that seemed to help with the irritation and stinging.  I hadn&#x27;t used an epilator in awhile, and I think those things would improve if you kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was satisfied and would recommend it, but I just wish it had kept my legs smoother for longer as promised.  I started getting stubble at 8 days.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 5 Epilator for free, from Braun to try it out and see what I thought about it!  This works so good on keeping you hair free for a longer period, instead of shaving every two days.  I can go up 3 weeks sometimes without using it again.  It&#x27;s easy to use!  It might hurt alittle at first, but it gets better after the first couple of times, but it&#x27;s breeze after that and I love being hair free!</li>
    <li> Does not work well, wish I had taken the time to return it.  Glides over hair instead of pulling them out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a neutral review from ratings...some said it hurts and some said it didn&#x27;t. I tried this when I received it and a small area and it hurt me, I had to squeeze a different part of my leg to withstand a small area of pain. Too bad this will be sitting idle for awhile. I do not know what pain tolerance people have and I was told mine was good yet I find this really awkward pain to endure. It resulted to me just shaving again.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!!  After years of waxing, shaving, tweezing, I gave in an bought this epilator.  I am impressed.  Did it hurt?  I little.  Much less than Threading (which I used to have done), about the same as waxing, but different.  I have a lot of growth due to hormone issues, and it removed it all.  There is some redness, but nothing that won&#x27;t go away overnight.  The same as with tweezing, waxing or threading.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My experience with the Braun silk-épil 5 has been excellent. I always use epilators frightened because they say it is painful and impossible to adapt, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and I regret not having used it before. My legs are soft and is more comfortable to use a razor. I recommend Braun silk epilator 5</li>
    <li> Works great.  Replaced my 15 year old epilady. The light is very helpful and the travel case keeps everything together. As with any product that pulls out your hair it is not pain free but is no more painful than waxing and I can use this easily by myself with no mess.  I just wish it were cordless.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great improvement from the old braun series I used to have. I like it.</li>
    <li> now this is a real winner!  I needed to replace an elderly Braun epilator.  was more than pleasantly surprised with this one.  1st, the cord is really flexible &amp; does not kink.  2nd, it does get the shortest &amp; finest hairs so I need to use it less often.  love that the head comes off for cleaning. not so happy with the on/off switch, but that is not so important.  definitely a buy if you are looking for an epilator</li>
    <li> Since the cord has to be constantly plugged in, it is a bit of an inconvenience to use it (occasionally, the cord gets disconnected and it stops working). Otherwise, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> After 15 years with my old Braun I decided it was the time to get a new one. I am very happy with this new one because is slim, easy to keep in your hand and it has a little light that allows you to find even the smallest hair!! Love it</li>
    <li> So hurt, I can see my blood</li>
    <li> it hurts a lot but maybe that is just me I don&#x27;t think it is good</li>
    <li> It is really painful and its wire unplugs continuously!I do not suggest to purchase it because you can not stand it.</li>
    <li> PICKED THIS ONE FOR THE WIFE AND SEEMS WORKES GOOD FOR HER. SO FAR SHE IS USING IT :). AN OK PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not always the best shopper.  My old epilady was cordless.  I just assumed all personal products like this were.  I was somewhat dismayed to find this Braun was not cordless, and the cord does not fit snugly in the hook up.  So, as I am using the Braun, the cord very often comes out of the machine and causes me to have to stop and replace - many times.  The Braun functions okay aside from this problem.  The machine is comfortable to hold and use, but I miss my old Epilady.</li>
    <li> Hi. I see alot of reviews where people are saying that the cord to this epilator won&#x27;t stay in place. (keeps falling out while using). I was having this problem at first also. In order to lock the cord in place you have to push it into the unit until you hear a \\&quot;CLICK\\&quot; once locked in place, you are good to go. BTW... I love this epilator...it works great and isn&#x27;t as painful as you think. I am very happy with this product....!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this thing, and my only complaints are small (to me). It works really good, but does hurt pretty bad before you get used to it. Once the initial pain is over, it&#x27;s really effective. But, the power cord does not fit snugly and you have to plug it in repeatedly or hold it in to the epilator.  Also, mine did not come with any shaver attachment, bit that&#x27;s not why I wanted it anyway. Used it one week ago and I can feel some hair but not see any. I would not use it on your arms, because I got a crazy rash from that, that I have had a full week. Initially I got really red legs, but it passed in 2 hours, and I have the ultimate in sensitive skin. Overall, I would recommend it if you are tired of shaving!</li>
    <li> Everything about this product is great except the cord.  I would have given 5 stars for an effective machine.  I took off four stars because the cord does not stay connected to the epilator.  While I&#x27;m running it over my legs, the cord is constantly falling out, and it does not store a charge so it keeps turning off.  It is really annoying.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, bringing the illegal use of the suffering endured, angry. Needs to initiate compensation.&lt;br /&gt;Braun most failed product</li>
    <li> It says it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it really hurt me. I barely did a section on my leg about an inch wide, and I couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. It hurt so bad!</li>
    <li> Very good really liked it .</li>
    <li> works great, i wanted to get the other one what this is the only one i can afford. but either way it has good results, but i think the more tweezers the better.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin texture and no burns or allergy experienced till now unlike wax that reacts to my skin texture and forms red bubbles for a week.</li>
    <li> So far this epilator has been awesome. Fairly painless (or as painless as can be expected) and efficient. My old epilator constantly missed hairs and was not as gentle as this. Love that it has two settings and rollers. The only issue I have is that it has to be plugged in- but the pros certainly make up for that.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife, she had to struggle with the pain for some time until she got used to it. She told me that she noticed that her hair is thinner now and it takes longer to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it does hurt a lot for the first times that you use it but then the pain level gets to a level that can be handled. Its only a matter of getting used to it.</li>
    <li> The product was described as new condition but the box had no seals and when I took the epilator out one could see it had been already used as there were hairs on it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product and bought a new one at Bed bath and Beyond.&lt;br /&gt;Very disapointed by Amazon, the one star is for that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! No more hassles of waxing! Such a time and energy saver. The pain is equivalent to waxing, so if you&#x27;re used to that, this doesn&#x27;t feel anything different, or maybe even less than that.</li>
