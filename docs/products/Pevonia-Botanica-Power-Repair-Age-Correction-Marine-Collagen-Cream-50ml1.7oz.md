    <li> I have really dry skin and started purchasing the Marine Collagen Cream from Pevonia about a year ago.  I love the product, you can wear it during the day with makeup on or at night before you go to sleep, it rubs into your face easily and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.  I have been using this line for three years, along with the toner &amp; cleanser.  I love how they make my skin feel &amp; look.  Have tried plenty of other brands, but am sticking to this one!!</li>
    <li> I found this at Amazon for a great price. I like this moisturizer because it feels creamy, goes on smoothly, and provides great coverage. It contains no sunblock, so I combine this with the Pevonia SPF 30 sunblock, equal amounts blended between my fingers, then I apply the combo. They work great together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin. This cream does not feel oily at all, though by mid-afternoon, I sometimes blot a tissue on my forehead. I feel comfortable using this cream over blemishes as it does not make them worse--in fact, I think it helps in the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Pevonia&#x27;s Glycocides at night or sometimes in the morning, under my moisturizer, and if I need it, I use the Spot treatment as well. All of this works well together.</li>
    <li> I found this product at local spa during a facial.  I loved how it felt and have used it since that day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Marine Collagen Cream as part of the Power Repair set that came with an eye make-up remover, cleanser, hydrating lotion and this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of, I LOVE the smell of this cream - it&#x27;s very fresh and pleasant. Nice consistency, goes on smooth and non-greasy. I used it as a night cream since I prefer a lighter lotion during the day, and woke up every morning with glowing skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> The cream feels good. The texture is nice, but like all of their products I&#x27;ve tried, the fragrance is just too much and slightly irritates my skin. I really don&#x27;t understand why these companies have to go so perfume heavy. That&#x27;s why I buy PERFUME, not face cream. Let me decide what strong scents I am going to deal with daily.  A lot of people enjoy fragrance and for them, I can see this cream being a winner. It&#x27;s just not for me.  UPDATE: Liking this better now. It&#x27;s actually very moisturizing. I wish they had an unscented option but this stuff actually works better than I thought.</li>
    <li> I love Pevonia products.. This one is not my fave.. It&#x27;s smells a little old lady to me.. Didn&#x27;t hydrate like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have been spending upwards ~80.00$ for a facial cream that I thought I had to have.  It was starting to get too costly, I searched around for a comparible face cream and came across Pevoina Power Repair for much cheaper.  I am getting the same results as the higher priced facial cream.  I am reordering the Pevoinia now as I am almost out of my first jar.</li>
    <li> I have liked using this product for a few years now. However, when I received my last shipment of it there was something different. It was more liquidy and had a unique smell. I still used it and will continue to be a pevonia supporter but some providers for amazon may be sending variations of the REAL product.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer, but I did not see any differences</li>
    <li> Love it! I look younger</li>
    <li> I use the vitamin C and the night serum too, all three compliment each other very well. I also use the Clairsonic Mia, Dermawand and the PMD.  All have changed my skin dramatically.</li>
    <li> Nice job at using 3rd party to fill my order. Your lack of involvement made this a less than pleasant experience</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I love the smell and will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any change to my skin after using this product for two weeks. I was disappointed with this product and will not continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. It was recommended to me when I had a facial years ago. Been using it ever since. It&#x27;&#x27;s absorbed quickly so it&#x27;s very easy to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Amazon, this is a great product, but your Prime rate and price changed with my reorder. The price went up 10.00 and the Prime shipping rate dropped. What&#x27;s up with this?</li>
    <li> This is a great skin creme and have been using ever since that spa treatment.  It is light and feels silky and hydrates well.  I am told I do not look my age.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product and think it has been worth the price I paid through amazon.  Not sure I would pay full price for it.</li>
