      <li>, it is definitely the best of moisturizers i use.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer it makes your skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
      <li>I am using this for cellulite and skin firming, but there was a St. Ives cellulite body shield which worked better for me on my cellulite.</li>
      <li>love the feel of the lotion it works</li>
      <li>I have been using another cream for over a month and it works better (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UJHSUI/ref&#x3D;ox_ya_os_product).</li>
      <li>Love the results I get from using this product.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love jergens in everything that they sale.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is carried by most stores.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
      <li>I put it on, then have to put water on a cloth and rub most of it off.  </li>
      <li>Smells better than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Love the product and the ease of shopping..</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>So many others have praised this product.  </li>
      <li>But being able to get it out of the bottle is now a huge hassle.</li>
      <li>It gives my  skin a great soft texture as well.</li>
      <li>Recently, however, I made an incredible discovery, quite serendipitously.  </li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>I think it works fine as a moisturizer but not as a firming cream.</li>
      <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for hydrating my skin, keeping it soft and supple, and for absorbing quickly into the skin upon application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a little over 2 weeks and it works great!</li>
      <li>it keeps my skin smooth and toned.  </li>
      <li>For me personally it&#x27;s been great.</li>
      <li>i dont really see a difference in firming but its a nice lotion.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m comfortable with the feel and smell of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m originally from the East Coast living in Northern California-</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t rate it on whether or not it toned and tightened my skin, because I can&#x27;t get pass the smell, and I am one who likes Jergens original scent of cherry/almond.  </li>
      <li>It does have a strong scent (which personally I really like), but if you happen to not like strong smelling lotions</li>
      <li>Ladies true story.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texcture after using the full bottle.</li>
      <li>Additionally, this product does leave a \\&quot;coating\\&quot; on your skin, so using it after late showers is probably best.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite lotion in the world.</li>
      <li>It has a very light scent its keeps my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty cheap solution.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>i use it simply cause it has a nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>and it goes on great not too greasy but not watered down either.  </li>
      <li>Great body lotion, which I hope does firm....</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m in the midst of shrinking my waist and shedding some excess bulge here and there and this product is great for keeping my skin firm and taunt as my body shrinks.</li>
      <li>The smell is too much like cheap lotion.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t stop using it as it keeps getting better and better, well at least it has for me. :)</li>
      <li>far as skin firming goes this lotion is fantastic!</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to scents like I am, this one is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>its an old favorite.</li>
      <li>Came right on time.</li>
      <li>I apply it right after a shower and towel-drying, and it absorbs well into my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Halfway through bottle with daily use and rigorous exercise...it&#x27;s just body lotion kids, sorry. I wanted a miracle too. Guess I&#x27;ll be saving for surgery.</li>
    <li> I think it helps a little with firmness, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very comfortable lotion if that makes sense.  I never look forward to putting it on.  Smells a little weird and feels weird on the skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference one way or another after using this for a few weeks. Maybe it just takes longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It made a HUGE difference on my stretch marks after only a month of use, the stretch marks are getting thinner by the day. Much better than other (rediculously expensive) stretch mark creams I tried. Way to go Jergens!!!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to \\&quot;get my body back\\&quot; after having my last child two years ago (had twins before that). After doing some research on the internet I decided to try a three step approach: working out, exfoliating and a firming lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some pretty dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that I am also working out and exfoliating, but I can feel this lotion \\&quot;tighten\\&quot; my skin after it is applied and I really feel that it is helping. It also smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it were a bit more moisturizing. I have SUPER dry skin and I usually have to apply a thicker moisturizer to my problem areas (knees, elbows, hands, etc). That probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for someone without dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you must understand that NO lotion is going to work miracles. If you have a lot of loose skin this product can help, but its not going to be the equivalent of plastic surgery! But I have been using it for about six months now and I do honestly think that it is making a difference in reducing the amount of loose skin that I have post-baby.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of using this lotion and a cellulite body brush, I believe I can see (not see?) as many fat dimples on my back thighs and buttocks. The lotion is not greasy and has a great feel to it. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer by Jergens is excellent! It leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I have been getting compliments from people who ask me what I use on my tan to keep it looking so nice. I don&#x27;t use anything but this product! And it is very inexpensive, feels silky and soothing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bottle came defective. The pump had snapped off. Packaging was very poor on Amazon&#x27;s part, hopefully they&#x27;ll work this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is fine, I wish it was a little thicker. But being able to get it out of the bottle is now a huge hassle.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Not greasy at all. Absorbs quickly. Wonderful moisturizer. Not sure of the firming/toning that it claims, but it can&#x27;t hurt to keep using it.</li>
    <li> As a soothing agent and moisturizer, this product is great, and for that reason, i will purchase again, however, the firming effects are negligible. Additionally, this product does leave a \\&quot;coating\\&quot; on your skin, so using it after late showers is probably best. I also noticed that if you do happen to sweat during use, it leaves a bit of an oily feeling on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, it is definitely the best of moisturizers i use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a little over 2 weeks and it works great! It doesnt really have a smell and my skin is tighter and with less cellulite dimples. I really, really like this product!</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty awful, the feel is pretty nice, the firmness with use is nothing for me. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product two weeks now and I can see the results. It gives my  skin a great soft texture as well. Def Want to stick to this product for a while to see the full result for the next couple of months .</li>
    <li> Got this item quickly, it smells great &amp; makes my skin very smooth. It does seem to be starting to firm my problem areas on my legs.</li>
    <li> I have been using the skin firming cream for about 10 days now.  My expectations were pretty low, after all how can a cream get rid of cellulite...but it works!! I can actually see an improvement in my legs after 10 days.  I have also been using it over my stomach and the extra skin (from having 2 kids) is actually firmer. Now, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you still need to get yourself to the gym a few days a week but it&#x27;s much better than just the gym alone and it&#x27;s a pretty cheap solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for little over a month now and it worked wonders for my dry skin. The firming part did not work for me at all and i&#x27;m almost done with the bottle. It has a very light scent its keeps my skin so soft and smooth. As for the firming i&#x27;ve been using another cream by nourish called skin tight its really good. Hopes this helps</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it just about every day and my skin is so soft. I finally got a pedicure this year and the worker was surprised when I told her I have not had one in a year and that I just use lotion.  I just wish they sold them in bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> great to wear after a shower right after a workout. i use it while im losing weight to avoid the hanging skin and it firms nicely. compression aids well with the lotion.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me even with daily lotion in of my problem areas. Went back to my old stuff.</li>
    <li> No idea if it&#x27;s doing anything &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently. I did notice an improvement in my skin texture &amp; elasticity from other Jergen&#x27;s Firming products in the past (though to be fair, any consistent use of lotion may work that way). Overall it&#x27;s more or less unscented, soaks in fast, &amp; feels very nice. I&#x27;m originally from the East Coast living in Northern California- the lack of humidity out here is brutal! I usually use St Ives but need to mix up my brands/formulas now &amp; then. I&#x27;m starting to become a very big fan of this lotion after the shower &amp; before bed.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. it keeps my skin smooth and toned.  its the only lotion I use on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and feels very good on my skin. It keeps your skin hydrated and the smell stay all day.</li>
    <li> I am using this for cellulite and skin firming, but there was a St. Ives cellulite body shield which worked better for me on my cellulite. This doesn&#x27;t work so well for me as that product did. So that&#x27;s one star knocked off. However, I&#x27;m in the midst of shrinking my waist and shedding some excess bulge here and there and this product is great for keeping my skin firm and taunt as my body shrinks. I use this all over: stomach, back (back fat), love handles, thighs, buttocks, knees, biceps, elbows, neck and breasts. Yes, I&#x27;m a woman and use this on my girls.&lt;br /&gt;I really recomend people buying this while they are losing weight because what most people don&#x27;t realize is that with weight gain the skin stretches, and after fat loss, it doesn&#x27;t shrink back to where it was before. You will have saggy skin. The older you are the worse this will be. And if you treat your skin after fat loss it will be harder to tone it back. So the best solution is to rub as you lose your weight.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I recommend this product is because the brand is available in multiple stores. I have the biggest issue with this. Half my herb pills, facial cleansers and body wash has to be bought online because no store carries it. This product is carried by most stores. I can walk into any Walmart or Target and they have it!</li>
    <li> My skin needs a lot of help because it&#x27;s so dry and this is the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried that does the job without feeling so heavy that I only want to use more than just at night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product faithfully for about 2 weeks and I did not see a difference at all. It smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, makes your skin feel smooth and smells wonderful.  Soaks in and heals dry skin very well.</li>
    <li> This product works great for reducing the appearance of &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34;/cellulite on my thighs and butt. I did not have an excessive amount of cellulite, so I am not sure how it would work for more severe cases.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I actually really like it.  It seems to be helping.  I use it on my stomach/torso/chest after a shower when the pores are still open and the skin is more malleable. Ive been using it a couple weeks and while nothing is going to be a miracle cure all, i can notice it helping tighten up the skin.  I supplement with gelatin to help internally and use this along with palmers and a few other topical moisturizers to help keep my skin healthy and bounce back as i tone my skin and change my body composition.  Don&#x27;t apply this then sit on the couch and expect to be 10 pounds lighter the next day, thats not what this is.  If you keep a healthy diet, and put in the work this will help you along the way.  I will keep using it and update if i feel anything changes for better or worse.  But when i ordered it, i ordered with no expectations and after a few days I could see some improvement.  As far as smell, it smells like typical lotion which I&#x27;m not a big fan of but its not a big negative. Texture, its very thick which might make it harder to apply than some but to me it also means it will be more effective than a thin greasy layer.  Give it a shot, for the low price its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion as it has almost not scent and rubs in dry so no oily residue and leaves my skin soft.  I did not see the skin firming action that some have seen but will continue to use it as a body lotion.</li>
    <li> I had used this sporadically with no results but when I started using it twice daily for a week I noticed a difference. They have not gone away but they are not as noticeable as they were a week ago. Will definitely continue and hope for better results.</li>
    <li> Now, I was not expecting a miracle, that it would be a face lift in a bottle. Actually, I was not expecting anything at all, because many products do not live up to their claims. However, this product is great. After only 3 days my skin looks a little better and a little firmer! Cool! I&#x27;ll be buying it from now on.</li>
    <li> Smell is great, and love that it doesn&#x27;t stay humid or sticky like some. but I have been using it for months now, ad haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as other reviews claim. I will continue using it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!! I loved it !</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. A little thicker than regular lotion, feels great.</li>
    <li> just started, the moisturizer</li>
    <li> My g/f has been losing weight and thought she would give this a try to help firm up her skin and it seems to be doing a good job so far so i bought her another bottle..</li>
    <li> I have to say this product is amazing!! Ladies true story. One day I was trying on a outfit I looked in the mirror to see how it looked and to my amazement my cellulite had decreased!! I was completely shocked Then I realize that I had been using this product for three weeks WOW what a surprise!! Give it a shot it worked for me..</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it makes your skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again. If you have very dry skin this is the moisturizer to get!&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Elkins.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to scents like I am, this one is overwhelming.  I put it on, then have to put water on a cloth and rub most of it off.  I wish Jergens would come up with an unscented version.</li>
    <li> The smell is too much like cheap lotion.  I even tried masking it with some essential oils.  It didn&#x27;t help.  I can&#x27;t rate it on whether or not it toned and tightened my skin, because I can&#x27;t get pass the smell, and I am one who likes Jergens original scent of cherry/almond.  Heck that was my lotion of choice back in the day.</li>
    <li> Excelente crema, hidrata y hace que la piel se sienta muy suave y mas elástica. Cada vez que la voy a usar le echo 2 gotitas de ácido hyaluronico y de aceite de argal y hago de una crema barata una excelente.</li>
    <li> Smells better than I thought it would. Not sure if I can tell the results of the skin firming, but I only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion, which I hope does firm....but makes skin so soft!  I will continue to use this Jergens Skin Firming Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love Jergens&#x27; moisturizers and they work really great. But I can&#x27;t say the same about this toning cream. I used it in my butt, thighs and arms and it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I used twice a day until I finished the bottle and nothing. It was very cheap and it smells good, but that&#x27;s all.  I think it works fine as a moisturizer but not as a firming cream. I have been using another cream for over a month and it works better (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UJHSUI/ref&#x3D;ox_ya_os_product). Yeah, it is more expensive, but it is worth trying. Maybe the Jergens product work, it has good reviews, but at least for me it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this in cvs a few weeks ago, and have been using it after I get out of the shower. I was skeptical that it would work on my legs, and unfortunately I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in stretch marks/cellulite at ALL. Its a really great moisturizer, smells good, keeps my skin nice and soft, but that is about it. Hopefully I will find something that actually works. Be careful, it does leave a coating on your skin for a while, so you will need to wait for it to dry before putting clothes on.</li>
    <li> Love the results I get from using this product. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texcture after using the full bottle. Florida weather is pretty harsh on my skin. This mosuterizer did help with my dry skin patches. so yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years!  It really toughens up your skin!  I got my belly button pierced when I was 18 and the guy doing the piercing had a hard time puncturing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s slightly more expensive on here than going to a store and getting the 25% more bottle for the same price.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for wonderful price. Will order again</li>
    <li> It is not going to be a miracle cure for cellulite, but it does firm and tone very well with a nice light scent. Great price on Amazon, even better than walmart. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just picked this up for winter dry skin and didn&#x27;t really read the bottle much, used it on my arms a lot, then started using it all over it works so well, I use it constantly now, it does firm up your skin.  And there is some improvement in cellulite also.  Maybe just from the collegan in it firming the skin, I am not sure, but it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> This Jergens Skin Firming Lotion is my Favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all- just as a lotion this product is great. You immediately notice a significant difference in the softness of your skin, it makes your skin feel great and moisturized. It is a very thick and buttery lotion which I really like but one downfall of this is that it takes a lot of lotion to cover a large amount of skin (legs for example) So you end up running out of lotion within a month or two when typically a bottle this size should last longer. It does have a strong scent (which personally I really like), but if you happen to not like strong smelling lotions its ok because the smell is gone within 5 minutes of applying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as skin firming goes this lotion is fantastic! You notice a reduction in your cellulite within a week of using it everyday. Don&#x27;t expect miracles! Obviously if you are overweight and have a lot of cellulite this alone isn&#x27;t going to get rid of it. It doesn&#x27;t exactly what the bottle says - reduces appearance of cellulite. After using this product for a month my legs look great compared to when I first bought this. Your skin feels tighter, smoother, and softer. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with embarrassing cellulite, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> My go to lotion been using for years. It really works.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year african american women. After only one use, which I applied generously to my problem areas, i noticed this lotion made by skin extremely dry and flaky about 1 hour after applying. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any lotion. I Do not recommend and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> love the feel of the lotion it works</li>
    <li> I can finally say, i brought a products that actual does what it claims to do. I read the other reviews for this product and decided for the price, why not. I have been using this product for about 10 days and i can say that i can definitly see the toning and firming in my skin, not sure about the cellulite reduction. This product feels good and smells great. Its a winner.</li>
    <li> There is no way anything you rub into your skin is actually going to affect the elasticity of your skin. It&#x27;s all marketing. It makes my skin softer, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the ease of shopping..</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I used to use it all the time years ago and I do believe it helped firm my skin. My grandmother has always used it, she&#x27;s 67 and looks 40, I&#x27;m 30 and look 18.</li>
    <li> Perfect for adding moisture and easily and efficiently absorbed by skin with no residue.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this as a lotion. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It is fairly thick. I am not sure how it is for firming, but it seems to be great as a mositurizing lotion.</li>
    <li> It has a nice light smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin. I believe it has firmed my skin in the last month since I&#x27;&#x27;ve used it daily. It rubs in easily and is best after a bath. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got the worst case of contact dermatitis from this lotion, complete with vesicles (blistering of skin).  I can only assume there is something very toxic in it, and will not be using any lotion going forward unless it has been certified non-toxic by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database.</li>
    <li> I love jergens in everything that they sale. Its very moisturizing. Nice and thick formula but not too thick. As far as firming, I&#x27;m sure if it does, but my skin feels awesome after applying it.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lotion in the world. I love the smell of this and it goes on great not too greasy but not watered down either.  I havent a negative thing to say about it because I dont use it for skin firming i use it simply cause it has a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> So many others have praised this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s readily available, though probably Amazon&#x27;s price is as good as anywhere.  Recently, however, I made an incredible discovery, quite serendipitously.  I had ordered a liquid product from a home shopping network, supposedly to remove tight rings that used to fit fingers better, a difficult task as we gain weight or grow older.  The product was a dud and I wrote a deservedly-bad evaluation on their web site.  But the product gave me an idea.  I use Jergen&#x27;s Skin Firming Lotion on arms and legs after my shower each evening, so I tried rubbing some on my ring finger.  Voila!  With a little effort, I was able to remove my wedding band and solitaire with less problem than when I tried the other product, meant for that purpose.  (By the way, hand creams hadn&#x27;t worked!)  I&#x27;ve done that most evenings, ever since.  A closing thought: If it makes finger skin tighter, isn&#x27;t that proof that it probably effects other areas as well?!!!</li>
    <li> Compared to a lot of the expensive firming lotions this is a great alernative in case you happen to be in a pinch. I take this with me on trips to fill in. It smells refreshing and clean, it does even out the skin tone and firm. If you choose to use this all the time use twice a day and in abundance. Your skin will be soft and thankful.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible ! I had to throw it out ! I tried using it but the smell was not good</li>
    <li> I like this lotion a lot. I do not know how much it actually firms my skin, but I like the smell, and I feel that it sufficiently moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent, been using it since early 90&#x27;s.  Highly recommended, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Came right on time. Love it</li>
    <li> Jergens Skin Firming Daily Toning Moisturizer that I purchased leaves skin feeling clean and toned. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> First of all don&#x27;t expect this to be an overnight miracle cream. It takes time to really see a difference with this moisturizer. For me personally it&#x27;s been great. I always lather up with it after a shower and here are some of the great things that this moisturizer has done for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce the appearance of  stretch marks. Although my stretch marks haven&#x27;t &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34; they are less noticeable since I&#x27;ve been using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-Tighter skin. Some great areas that I&#x27;ve seen major improvement on myself is under my jaw, on my upper arms, and on the backside of the upper parts of my legs. Skin is more tight and firmer now since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;-Super smooth skin. Wherever I put this my skin has become smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Not really an abnormal con but like with most lotions you really have to wait for the lotion to dry completely before getting dressed as everything will stick to you if you don&#x27;t. It also can have a bit of a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling to it. I always have to wash my hands thoroughly after applying it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone that wants smooth tight skin. You will need to use this for at least a week to see any noticeable changes. Don&#x27;t stop using it as it keeps getting better and better, well at least it has for me. :)</li>
    <li> The only way you can really firm your skin is to get your butt off the couch and exercise.  No amount of firming lotion will change your skin in a dramatic way.  It is a good moisurizer though.</li>
    <li> I love hot showers, and as a result I get dry skin on my butt, back of my thighs, and back of my arms.  I originally bought it for firming, which is to soon to tell, but if definitely cured the dry skins bumps.  I cannot feel any immediate firming action, only time will tell.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. i lost a lot of weight and was left with loose skin even after working out. after a month of using it i could actually notice a difference.</li>
    <li> my wife and I uses it daily. my wife says it firms her skin. I can&#x27;t really tell if it firms my skin or not but I&#x27;m comfortable with the feel and smell of it.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on great.  It feels smooth, and my skin feels moisturized for a long time.  I apply it right after a shower and towel-drying, and it absorbs well into my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure about any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; capabilities, but for a body lotion, I really like it.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for hydrating my skin, keeping it soft and supple, and for absorbing quickly into the skin upon application. I seek out this lotion whenever I&#x27;m shopping and would order it online if I had to. It&#x27;s that good! Has a nice smell and a very rich and luxurious texture. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and sticky all day. Does create a firming effect by hydrating skin so well that it lessons the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> treats your skin to a moisture bath. I will certinally buy again. what else must I say  to fill in the last 8 words</li>
    <li> i dont really see a difference in firming but its a nice lotion. ive only been using it a weeks at 2x a day so maybe longer use will make a difference?</li>
    <li> This lotion is a very good non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i love this lotion. its an old favorite. i can use all over my whole body and it keeps me moisturized. i can also even use it on my face and never break out. every other lotion makes my face break out.</li>
