      <li>I will most definetley continue using this product for ever and ever.</li>
      <li>ONE MORE THING...DONT BUY THIS FROM (COSTSELL)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every month or so for many years.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>If you can find a better product ...</li>
      <li>As with any protein treatment be sure to follow up with a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
      <li>and wow the results have been great.  </li>
      <li>I use this product to repair my over damage hair and it seems to be working fine.</li>
      <li>Whether, or not you are having trouble with your hair or scalp, this product is the BEST that money can buy unless you are a wholesaler!</li>
      <li>I am a true fan of affirm products.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal user of Affirm&#x27;s 5 in 1 reconstructor for over 4 years now.</li>
      <li>My hair is beyond thick even with a bone-straight relaxer, any weight is more than welcome lol&lt;</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years, and I am very pleased with it, I would recommend products to others.</li>
      <li>I love this product it makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s going to come out fantastic, thanks to this miracle worker.</li>
      <li>(Please, please, please make sure when you use this product to use a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards and do not use with heat (e.g. placing a plastic cap on and sitting under the drier) as this product has a lot of protein in it and can be very drying; you simply apply the product after washing, applying a plastic cap to your head and then wash out the product after the product has been in your hair for 30 minutes (no heat required) and deep condition with a MOISTURIZING conditioner afterwards!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for a few minutes and even better as a deep conditioner under the dryer.</li>
      <li>My first experience with this product was when my hairstylist \\&quot;mistakenly\\&quot; over-processed my hair attempting to put highlights in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually quite glad that it can be used as a 30 minute re-constructor, in addition to a 5 minute re-constructor between the relaxer and neutralizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>I PERSONALLY GIVE MY HAIR ONE MORE SHAMPOO,</li>
      <li>I noticed results immediately with the first application and week after week</li>
      <li>Fortunately, only cute men I was interested in.</li>
      <li>I now have my healthy hair back and even though I do not use the stylist any longer, I do continue to use the 5 in 1 reconstructor!</li>
      <li>Yes, I did say weekly, for some that may be a bit much but for my coarse, thick hair it was ideal!</li>
      <li>I now have a head full of soft manageable thriving hair.  </li>
      <li>added this to my hair care routine (along with an hot oil pre-poo, sulfate free shampoo, a multi vitamin and hair, skin, &amp; nail vitaimin daily)</li>
      <li>This really does help prevent breakage by strengthening hair.</li>
      <li>IS REALLY GETTING IN YOUR HAIR AND SCALP</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>AFTER I PUT THE 5 IN 1 RECONSTRUCTOR FOR 30 MINUTES, TO GET THE PRODUCT COMPLETLY OUT OF THE HAIR, BECAUSE IF YU DONT, YOUR HAIR CAN BE REALLY DIFICULT TO WORK WITH, TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CANT EVEN USE THE COMB, IT CAN BE TOO RESISTANT, BUT</li>
      <li>and it has really helped the look and feel of my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real McCoy and they deliver on time.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY DO EVERYTHING IS DESCRIBING</li>
      <li>I was  previously using Aphogee as a monthly strengthening  treatment and it does work well, but I prefer Affirm better because I was able to see results quicker with Affirm than Aphogee, also it has a pleasant scent (IMO-Aphogee stinks), it is thicker--it has the consistency of pancake syrup</li>
      <li>After blow-drying and flat ironing, my hair is shiny, bouncy, smooth and spreads out  on my silk pillowcase like, well, silk.</li>
      <li>I continue to use the Affirm 5 in 1 monthly to maintain the strength of my hair (a week prior to relaxing) and will continue to remain a loyal Affirm  5 in 1 user.</li>
      <li>THEY USUALLY HAVE GOOD PRODUCT, BUT IN MY LAST EXPERIENCE BUYING FROM THEM, THIS 5</li>
      <li>but i still think its good for limp, damaged, or dry hair.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new treatment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it the past three weeks after shampooing, I leave on for 30 minutes, rinse and the results have been fabulous!</li>
      <li>The large size means you will have it for several months.</li>
      <li>, they might not using enough (or using too much if it&#x27;s drying out your hair).</li>
      <li>I have natural hair</li>
      <li>, i use it religiously every week when I get my hair done and it has really done wonders for my hair.  </li>
      <li>, then hug me again to smell my hair again or take some in their hands to feel how soft it is and smell it.</li>
      <li>when my hair was permed it was great, but now that my hair is natural, it makes my hair really stiff and hard to comb out.</li>
      <li>I compared the new bottle to the little that was left in my old bottle.</li>
      <li>texture is a little more runny than it is thick</li>

    <li> I have been a loyal user of Affirm&#x27;s 5 in 1 reconstructor for over 4 years now. My first experience with this product was when my hairstylist \\&quot;mistakenly\\&quot; over-processed my hair attempting to put highlights in.  My stylist offered to correct the problem of excess shedding and breakage due to the damaging effects of the highlights with the implementation of the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor into my weekly visits. Yes, I did say weekly, for some that may be a bit much but for my coarse, thick hair it was ideal! I noticed results immediately with the first application and week after week I noticed less and less shedding and breakage--it took about a month before the breaking and shedding stopped completely. I now have my healthy hair back and even though I do not use the stylist any longer, I do continue to use the 5 in 1 reconstructor! I was  previously using Aphogee as a monthly strengthening  treatment and it does work well, but I prefer Affirm better because I was able to see results quicker with Affirm than Aphogee, also it has a pleasant scent (IMO-Aphogee stinks), it is thicker--it has the consistency of pancake syrup (Aphogee is watery and makes your hair hard after its dry) and you don&#x27;t have to stay stuck under a hair drier for the product to work. (Please, please, please make sure when you use this product to use a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards and do not use with heat (e.g. placing a plastic cap on and sitting under the drier) as this product has a lot of protein in it and can be very drying; you simply apply the product after washing, applying a plastic cap to your head and then wash out the product after the product has been in your hair for 30 minutes (no heat required) and deep condition with a MOISTURIZING conditioner afterwards!!  I continue to use the Affirm 5 in 1 monthly to maintain the strength of my hair (a week prior to relaxing) and will continue to remain a loyal Affirm  5 in 1 user. This product will always be a mainstay in my hair maintenance regiment.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, and I am very pleased with it, I would recommend products to others.</li>
    <li> Great strengthening product.</li>
    <li> If you can find a better product ... it wont be on planet earth.This products manages my hair like nothing ive seen before.</li>
    <li> Another long-term user (about 6 or 7 years) who LOVES this deep conditioner. Nothing else delivers for my relaxed hair like this baby does. I tried, NOTHING ELSE. I think 3 or 4 years ago I bought the 32oz and it&#x27;s lasted this long....less than $30 for 3-4 years??! &amp; I use it every week?!? Of course I bought this again! I looked through the other reviews and a few people said it made their hair hard or difficult to comb or dried their hair out. I&#x27;ve never had this experience, they might not using enough (or using too much if it&#x27;s drying out your hair). I&#x27;ve known plenty of other relaxed girls to be extremely light handed with products because they&#x27;re afraid to weigh their hair down. My hair is beyond thick even with a bone-straight relaxer, any weight is more than welcome lol&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little more runny than it is thick but it&#x27;s still thick enough to give me plenty of slip when I&#x27;m detangling my hair. My hair feels stronger and stronger in between relaxers (10-12 weeks apart). My secret weapon ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I bought mine from Uh Bargain Outlet. I compared the new bottle to the little that was left in my old bottle. It&#x27;s the real McCoy and they deliver on time.</li>
    <li> Love it! It Works well on both real and fake hair! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new treatment.</li>
    <li> I DONT WANT TO WRITE A LONG REVIEW, EVEN THOUGH THIS PRODUCT DESERVE IT, I WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. EXCELLENT!!!!!! IF U HAVE DRY HAIR, DAMAGED HAIR, IF YOU COLOR YOUR HAIR, IF YOU RELAXED YOU HAIR, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. THIS PRODUCT REALLY DO EVERYTHING IS DESCRIBING HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE!!! MAKE SURE WHEN YOU USE THIS PRODUCTTO, RINSE YOU HAIR VERY GOOD, WITH PLENTY OF WATER. I PERSONALLY GIVE MY HAIR ONE MORE SHAMPOO, AFTER I PUT THE 5 IN 1 RECONSTRUCTOR FOR 30 MINUTES, TO GET THE PRODUCT COMPLETLY OUT OF THE HAIR, BECAUSE IF YU DONT, YOUR HAIR CAN BE REALLY DIFICULT TO WORK WITH, TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CANT EVEN USE THE COMB, IT CAN BE TOO RESISTANT, BUT THAT IS BECUSE IS REALLY GETTING IN YOUR HAIR AND SCALP,YOU WILL DEFINILY SEE AND FEEL THE CHANGE ON YOUR HAIR. GOOD LUCK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AHH!!! ONE MORE THING...DONT BUY THIS FROM (COSTSELL) THEY USUALLY HAVE GOOD PRODUCT, BUT IN MY LAST EXPERIENCE BUYING FROM THEM, THIS 5 IN 1 RECONSTRUCTOR WAS BAD, THEY EITHER HAVE AN EXPIRED ONE, OR I DONT KNOW, THE SAFETY SEAL WAS ALSO BROKEN.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair very soft. and it&#x27;s great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m actually quite glad that it can be used as a 30 minute re-constructor, in addition to a 5 minute re-constructor between the relaxer and neutralizing shampoo. After blow-drying and flat ironing, my hair is shiny, bouncy, smooth and spreads out  on my silk pillowcase like, well, silk. Everyone comments on how great I smell and this is the only scent I have on. I&#x27;ve had men hug me, then hug me again to smell my hair again or take some in their hands to feel how soft it is and smell it. Fortunately, only cute men I was interested in. So this conditioner might have benefits you don&#x27;t expect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t done a roller-set in a while, I was having some tangling and uneven relaxing issues, but this system seems to have resolved it. I think it&#x27;s going to come out fantastic, thanks to this miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I use the reconstructor once a month with a moisturizing conditioner and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Now this product worked extremely well on my daughters hair I really enjoy all the products and very pleased with the results of our hair. I am a true fan of affirm products. Thank you. Very pleased customer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using this every month or so for many years. As with any protein treatment be sure to follow up with a moisturizing conditioner. This company also has a great Humecto Conditioner that has been used in salons for years.</li>
    <li> I use this product to repair my over damage hair and it seems to be working fine. Will recommended for anyone with damaged, dry, frizzy, lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> Whether, or not you are having trouble with your hair or scalp, this product is the BEST that money can buy unless you are a wholesaler! It has been 25 years since I&#x27;ve used it, but the quality of it, nor the outcome has not changed. BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using the reconstructor, i can see a change in my hair; it grew a inch. I also use Mizani conditioner and souffle. I will continue to use reconstructor  for few months to determine if it truly works.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product at the salon and I cannot thank her enough! it is wonderful, i use it religiously every week when I get my hair done and it has really done wonders for my hair.  My hair was shedding like a sheep dog, the ends were brittle and the overall appearance of my hair was dull.  I now have a head full of soft manageable thriving hair.  I will most definetley continue using this product for ever and ever.</li>
    <li> This really does help prevent breakage by strengthening hair. The large size means you will have it for several months.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair stylist used it on me, but I couldn&#x27;t purchase it anywhere in my area.  This is my 2nd bottle.  I give myself a hair treatment about 2 times a week and it has really helped the look and feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a believer! This stuff is amazing!  As background, I am African-America with relaxed hair that has recently thinned around the edges, as well as shedding...not enough to be terrifed, but enough that I feel I needed to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added this to my hair care routine (along with an hot oil pre-poo, sulfate free shampoo, a multi vitamin and hair, skin, &amp; nail vitaimin daily) and wow the results have been great.  I&#x27;ve used it the past three weeks after shampooing, I leave on for 30 minutes, rinse and the results have been fabulous! My shedding has decreased and after yesterday&#x27;s use, so far, I have had NO shedding.  My hair has nice body and just seems more healthy since I&#x27;ve begun using this product.  I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> when my hair was permed it was great, but now that my hair is natural, it makes my hair really stiff and hard to comb out. so i&#x27;m on the fence. but i still think its good for limp, damaged, or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best all in one conditioner!! It&#x27;s great for a few minutes and even better as a deep conditioner under the dryer.</li>
