    <li> Wonderful hairspray. It is not made any more and what is left is too expensive. Wish they had something similar.</li>
    <li> met my needs. have been using for at least 5 years</li>
    <li> Dry Look Hair Spray Extra Hold works great for holding hair in place without that stiff sticky look.</li>
    <li> I have been using dry look for men hair spray for the past 40 years and quite disappointed when I can no longer find your product on store shelves. I am now 72 years old and my acquiantances are now bald or have receding forehead and they envy me for still having \\&quot;full hair\\&quot;. I used other hair sprays but my hair starts to thin out. It must be in my genes OR a component in your product that keeps my hair intact. I&#x27;m really happy to find you via Amazon and will place a box or boxes before you totally ran out.</li>
    <li> Having used this product many times prior to my order, I was familiar with the product.  I purchased it because of convenience. Service was excellent.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for many many years and I was glad I could find it on Amazon.  He&#x27;s kind of a stickler for staying with the same product, so it makes my life easier that I could find it here.  I&#x27;ve looked and looked, but cannot find it in any store around us.</li>
    <li> My son has thin hair and hates it and hates hiding under a baseball hat all the time; after reading reviews about this spray, I ordered it for him to try. He loves it; with a good cut and this spray, his hair can even handle the wind (which was the enemy) and yet it looks and feels natural not plastered like other sprays. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is great if you need your hair to stay in place and you don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; most hair sprays give you. I am definitely a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I have used this hair spray for years (I&#x27;m female), I borrowed it from a guy once and found it to be the best hairspray ever. It holds hair in place, but doesn&#x27;t look sticky. It will hold the style even after you brush it out. Stores no longer carry it. Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> ABoslutely the best, hair feels soft, stays in place  with just a dab of spray. Beats other brands by far.</li>
    <li> The product is what i used to use back in the 70&#x27;s and i still like it. The price was fair and delivery was on time. Ken</li>
    <li> caps were cracked,but product was ok</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this product in stores for over a year.  It&#x27;s the only brand my husband will use.  I&#x27;m so thankful that I can still get it on line.</li>
    <li> I like the fact you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your hair gets messed up, you can restyle with just a little bit of water (wet comb)&lt;br /&gt;and it will hold your style just like applying more spray would.</li>
    <li> This product shipped on time and met my expectations. Product now difficult to find in stores and is something I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I have used the Dry Look For Men for years.  My hair is thin and I liked the way it controls my hair.  But it seems that the large companies (Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreen, Kroger, etc.) have all decided that they don&#x27;t want to sell it anymore.  I don&#x27;t know why they would not want to carry a product that they have been selling for years but it probably has to do with price points. At any rate, Amazon has it and can ship it immediately to your door or mailbox.  It is packed very nicely in a 3-pack box. And that is why I like to buy from Amazon.  I can sit in my office chair and order just about anything I want at a lower price, free freight, and&lt;br /&gt;no taxes for most items.  What&#x27;s not to like about that?&lt;br /&gt;  Al Lott</li>
    <li> Same review on this product as previously submitted. I will continue to send orders for this product when I need to do so.</li>
    <li> have used your product for years-just couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores where we live. will continue sending for it when i run out.</li>
