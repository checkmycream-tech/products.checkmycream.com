      <li>This product works great for me.</li>
      <li>My face kept feeling like it was burning and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
      <li>I hope no one catches on that this product (Pond&#x27;s) is every bit as good as the astronomically priced skin creams.</li>

      <li>Made my skin much more oily.</li>
      <li>I love the tingling feeling the cleanser gives me while washing my face</li>
      <li>I use this product to deep clean my face; however, it is an excellent to exfoliate any part of your body--legs, feet, hands, etc.</li>
      <li>For the price there is nothing better, and I have yet to find a formula that keeps me acne and irritation free as well as this product.    </li>
      <li>The pack of 3 is great value for money since they sell these at nearly $8 at Safeways and</li>
      <li>cleanser is awesome, the light creamy texture is much easier to control than liquidy pump-bottle cleansers, which I really appreciate.</li>
      <li>, it feels good, is reasonably priced, and seems to clean well.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, and need an oil free product.</li>
      <li>Plus, its oil free</li>
      <li>I have tried many products but none have left my skin feeling so good.</li>
      <li>(it stays put on your face almost like a mask but rinses off easily), it does a great job cleansing my face without drying it out, and it lasts a long time</li>
      <li>This is great for women over 50 who have started to get dry skin and light wrinkling.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and a slight refreshing tingle(not</li>
      <li>My skin has becomed more and more healthy now that I no longer wear daily foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for the face, yet excellent enough to use anywhere effectively.</li>
      <li>feels very clean and makes your skin feel very refreshed.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the only product that&#x27;s actually fought off my acne successfully.</li>
      <li>and my face always feels so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many high end cleansers</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve got normal skin, but would also recommend it to people with oily skin (just use more than the dime size drop that i use).</li>
      <li>This is also gentle enough to use on and around my eye area and removes my make up easily with warm water.    </li>
      <li>If you use very light makeup or none at all and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it may be worth a try.</li>
      <li>Some products claim to be oil free, but really are not.</li>
      <li>NEVER a problem with this product, and my skin is soft and healthy when I use it.</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Oil Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser does a good job of deeply cleansing your face.</li>
      <li>This product is really good for anyone whose had a history of reactions to other products.</li>
      <li>but this&#x27;s the first time I bought it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This helps keep my face clean from Acne and works better than all other products that I have tried.</li>
      <li>It makes my face tingle a liitle and feels so soft and clean after rinsing.</li>
      <li>there is a difference between this cleanser and the \\&quot;neutrogena deep clean foaming cleanser\\&quot; (if i remember the name correctly) that looks almost exactly identical to this one except for that one word.      </li>
      <li>Somehow, it manages to even my complexion so that I look better than when I used foundation/powder with other cleansers, even though I don&#x27;t use a toner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I started using this face cleaner when I was in high school.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it really works for sensitive skin and those who have acne...</li>
      <li>This one is gentle and can be used on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use this product once in the pm, sensitive skin Cetaphil cleanser in the a.m., and gentle wash after eating.</li>
      <li>I am beginning to have a normal looking face again, and am so grateful for this product.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give me that dry feeling that most cleansers do, nor does it feel thin and watery like most water-based products.</li>
      <li>As soon as I applied this product I had to rinse it off immeditately as to minimize the effects of the Menthol and pray it got nowhere near my eyes.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin soft, with no oily residue, and there is no drying effect.</li>
      <li>The last time I tried to find it, it seemed that it had been discontinued, which was very disheartening.</li>
      <li>Between growing out of teenage acne and this cleanser, my skin is now very even-toned, my pores have shrank, and the only redness is a natural blush on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>You would definitely need moisturizer afterwards if you have normal skin like me though.</li>
      <li>This barely removed any of the pressed powder foundation I use on my face and though the bottle says it leaves no residue, it feels like it does.</li>
      <li>Other products that are oil free over dry the skin and make it tight, and dry or flaky but this has just the right amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of other more expensive cleansers but had to come back to Neutrogena deep clean.</li>
      <li>The cream cleanser did not dry out my skin and if not for the menthol I would have continued to use this product.</li>
      <li>Its gentle enough to use twice a day and it helps keep the acne down.</li>
      <li>(is that good or bad?)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years.  I work in the entertainment industry and constantly get compliments from makeup artists about my skin tone. This product works great for me.</li>
    <li> there is a difference between this cleanser and the \\&quot;neutrogena deep clean foaming cleanser\\&quot; (if i remember the name correctly) that looks almost exactly identical to this one except for that one word.      i love this cream cleanser--i like the feel of it (it stays put on your face almost like a mask but rinses off easily), it does a great job cleansing my face without drying it out, and it lasts a long time (you only need to use a tiny bit each time).  i&#x27;ve got normal skin, but would also recommend it to people with oily skin (just use more than the dime size drop that i use).</li>
    <li> I use this product to deep clean my face; however, it is an excellent to exfoliate any part of your body--legs, feet, hands, etc. It&#x27;s gentle enough for the face, yet excellent enough to use anywhere effectively.</li>
    <li> This product is really good for anyone whose had a history of reactions to other products. There&#x27;s no parabens, little alcohols, and no propylene glycol (which I found out I&#x27;m somehow allergic to).    Plus, its oil free and it doesn&#x27;t give me that dry feeling that most cleansers do, nor does it feel thin and watery like most water-based products. Its gentle enough to use twice a day and it helps keep the acne down. I&#x27;ve only had one or breakouts in the months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> The name is misleading. The only suggestion that the cleanser is working I the tingling from the menthol, but that&#x27;s all marketing. This barely removed any of the pressed powder foundation I use on my face and though the bottle says it leaves no residue, it feels like it does. It also makes my skin look \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;...not oily, but it definitely has a sheen I don&#x27;t like. If you use very light makeup or none at all and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. The last time I tried to find it, it seemed that it had been discontinued, which was very disheartening. This is great for women over 50 who have started to get dry skin and light wrinkling. I&#x27;m 73 and it keeps my wrinkles at bay. My friends tell me I could pass for late 40&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t have any crows feet and my skin is very smooth. I always use a moisturizer, which is Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream. I hope no one catches on that this product (Pond&#x27;s) is every bit as good as the astronomically priced skin creams.</li>
    <li> Product did not work too well for me. Left my face very dry and caused it to peel. I could have lived with it since I use a facial cream after cleansing, but the Menthol in the product was unbearable. My face kept feeling like it was burning and it wasn&#x27;t pleasant. As soon as I applied this product I had to rinse it off immeditately as to minimize the effects of the Menthol and pray it got nowhere near my eyes. I have since switch over to Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit cleanser and have been having excellent results after only 3 days of use. I actually no longer need to use a facial cream after using it!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many high end cleansers and I always come back to this when they screw up my complexion. I have oily skin, and need an oil free product. Some products claim to be oil free, but really are not. Other products that are oil free over dry the skin and make it tight, and dry or flaky but this has just the right amount of moisture. For the price there is nothing better, and I have yet to find a formula that keeps me acne and irritation free as well as this product.    This is also gentle enough to use on and around my eye area and removes my make up easily with warm water.    I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne, or needs an oil control product/cleanser. There are also no parabens in this product!</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Oil Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser does a good job of deeply cleansing your face. You don&#x27;t need alot and it feels nice on the skin UNTILL  the menthol kicks in. This is the ingrediant to have a \\&quot;refresheing\\&quot;  feeling. To me, my skin did not like the menthol ingrediant and irritated my face.  Also the scent of the menthol is not pleasant to me. The cream cleanser did not dry out my skin and if not for the menthol I would have continued to use this product. I guess I should have looked at the ingrediants on the back  before I purchased this product. We as consumers need to be informed with the necessary information in order to make the best purchasing decision for ourselves and our families.        I gave this product two stars due to the menthol in this product.                        Susan, Omaha, NE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena cleanser for a couple of years now but this&#x27;s the first time I bought it from Amazon. The pack of 3 is great value for money since they sell these at nearly $8 at Safeways and $6.50(if you catch of on discount) at drug stores. I love the tingling feeling the cleanser gives me while washing my face (is that good or bad?) and my face always feels so fresh and clean afterwards. I&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of other more expensive cleansers but had to come back to Neutrogena deep clean. You would definitely need moisturizer afterwards if you have normal skin like me though. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I started using this face cleaner when I was in high school. I had a lot of acne with fair, oily skin, so I would always stray towards specifically &#x27;acne fighting&#x27; cleansers. I had lots of issues with other cleansers drying out my skin, the acid causing irritation and further redness, and little success with acne treatment. My mom finally took me to a dermatologist which prescribed antibiotics, a benzoic acid topical ointment, and BC. The benzoic ointment instructions recommended a non salicylic acid face wash to reduce irritation. A friend of mine recommended the neutrogena brand which I had shyed from because it was a little pricy for me, but I heeded her advice. I searched for a non acidic, non oily cleanser, non mature-skin cleanser and picked out this one.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is awesome, the light creamy texture is much easier to control than liquidy pump-bottle cleansers, which I really appreciate. It has a great smell and a slight refreshing tingle(not the sting of acidic washes). And it works wonders for my skin. Somehow, it manages to even my complexion so that I look better than when I used foundation/powder with other cleansers, even though I don&#x27;t use a toner. My skin has becomed more and more healthy now that I no longer wear daily foundation. It leaves skin soft, with no oily residue, and there is no drying effect. My acne went away also, though I was on other treatments as well (and it has stayed away). Between growing out of teenage acne and this cleanser, my skin is now very even-toned, my pores have shrank, and the only redness is a natural blush on my cheeks. My only complaint would be that the tube design makes it a troublesome to get all the cleanser out of the tube, however, I will be using this cleanser until it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the only product that&#x27;s actually fought off my acne successfully. It tingles a bit when I lather it on, and I don&#x27;t feel dried out after I wash it off.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser, it feels good, is reasonably priced, and seems to clean well. The problem I have with it is that it has salicylic acid, which for some reason actually makes me break out. For this reason I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Always love neutrogena products. This one is gentle and can be used on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This helps keep my face clean from Acne and works better than all other products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleanser.  My skin is very subject to reactions, drying, breakouts to cleansers and moisturizers. NEVER a problem with this product, and my skin is soft and healthy when I use it.</li>
    <li> Always use this product..Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It makes my face tingle a liitle and feels so soft and clean after rinsing. I have tried many products but none have left my skin feeling so good.</li>
    <li> A bit thick but just use a small amount feels very clean and makes your skin feel very refreshed. Love it!</li>
    <li> Although this product alone did not get rid of my hormonal cystic acne, it seems to have helped stop the constant infection that has been happening on my chin area. I am also taking 100 mg of Spironolactone daily, Beyaz birth control, Retin-A at night, and Skinoren in the a.m. However, I had been taking all of these medications for some time, and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using this product that I began to see some relief. It has even cleared some tiny infected bumps on my chin that had been there for months, and had never come to a head. I always felt that so long as I had these bumps under the skin, I&#x27;d always break out. This product helped dry them up and pull that infection out. I am beginning to have a normal looking face again, and am so grateful for this product. I use this product once in the pm, sensitive skin Cetaphil cleanser in the a.m., and gentle wash after eating. I also make sure to brush and floss before washing my face, and washing my face after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s HORRIBLE!! Made my skin much more oily. I don&#x27;t think it really works for sensitive skin and those who have acne...</li>
