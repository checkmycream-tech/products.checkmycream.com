<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had not try the night cream, but I felt in love with it. All the image products do great things to my skin.</li>
    <li> Used after cleansing as a moisturizing night cream.&lt;br /&gt;This product hydrates better than any moisturizer Ive ever used - without being at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Estee Lauder Time Zone and think Image Skincare the Max is far superior and less expensive:)</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
    <li> I just started using the Image line a few months ago. This cr&amp;egrave;me has made my skin smooth and youthful again.</li>
    <li> I love my Max Creme.  It has really improved the texture of my skin.  Image Skin Care is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  I really love it!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and this product line!  I&#x27;m 66 years old and this cream makes my skin so smooth and healthy.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy Image Skincare products!</li>
    <li> deserves 5 Stars, thanks</li>
    <li> Best price for this brand and product.  This line sells for twice as much in the Spa&#x27;s.  Rock On Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and everyone tells me how great my skin looks!  I have tried other products, but never had these same results.  My skin is smoother and younger looking.  Wish I had taken a before and after pic!  I know it is expensive, but it is worth cutting out something else in your budget to fit this in!  Especially if you are in denial about aging! (like me!)</li>
    <li> Love this product and ordered many times. But the December 2014 order is very different and not effective. Not sure if it has changes formula or was frozen during shipping. May try once more.</li>
    <li> great product, rich moisturizer, wont cause breakouts, smells great, but really pricey.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, reduces redness and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I have tried tons of different creams, and this by far is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> Had an OXYGEN facial recently and afterwards was given a trial kit of IMAGE products to use afterwards including this item.  Ended up ordering ALL the products because my &amp;#34;combination - post menopausal still w/t-zone&amp;#34; skin has never looked so good!&lt;br /&gt;Have received MANY compliments on my skin!  So glad I treated myself to the facial which introduced me to these great products!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I have been using it for about a year and a half now, and I just can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Just be aware there is no sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this cream by my facialist to help my skin recover after a particularly nasty allergic reaction to some weeds that managed to touch my face.  This cream was extremely beneficial in helping my raw, blistered and peely skin to recover when I couldn&#x27;t stand to put much else on my face.  Expensive, but worth it!</li>
    <li> aesthetician recommended IMAGE and love it.</li>
    <li> Great product good price</li>
    <li> It is ok. Since I had the problem with the Vital C serum, I am kind of transitioning back to my Emminence products though.  Guess psychological:-) Sorry!</li>
    <li> I seem to use slightly a little more of this than certain other moisturizers.  I have only used this at night so far.  I have only been using this Creme with the The Max Serum for about a week and a couple of people have already commented on my skin.  Not sure if I would use this during the day under foundation - may be a little too thick.</li>
    <li> This cream is expensive but, paired with Image Vitamin C Serum,  I am happy with the way it makes my skin look and feel.  As an older woman, I have decided that there is a time and place to use a more extensive product, even if it costs a little more than others.  This is my time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten great results using this with the Max Serum.  I first tried this at a Spa and have used for more than a year.  Great skin.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing skincare line. Anyone who wants to take good care of there skin should try this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Been using 7 months now as my night cream. I also use Image face wash and sunscreen. Great product! Very pricy in spas but Amazon makes it affordable. These products are of great quality, better then any I&#x27;ve tried. This moisturizer has made my face soft and smooth and a little goes a long way. I highly recommend, especially if u have sensitive skin like myself. Never used ANY skincare products for 7 months straight. Came on time just as described.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!! thats all I can say. This cream is amazing goes on so smooth and light makes your face look flawless!!! I have been using this cream for about 2 years. My dermatologist had sold it to me, mind you very expensive until I found it on Amazon I was thrilled with Amazon&#x27;s prices!!!! A must try.</li>
    <li> Great price and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for night time! I use it after removing and washing make-up offs with Image cleansing face scrub and wash.</li>
    <li> I love Image, but this is their best. The Max eye cream is even better. I have super dry skin and this has improved it. Plus I got it right away.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with my jar and can honestly say, I can&#x27;t see any difference. Will not purchase again. I do really like their tinted moisturizer with sunscreen and definitely will purchase that again.</li>
    <li> If you have ever stepped outside right after a rain, then you will know what this marvelous moisturizer feels like when you apply it to your skin!  The Max Creme is so lightweight, yet incredibly full of moisture for thirsty, dry skin.  It has no greasy feel and soaks in quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the smooth application of other makeup products on top of it, as some moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced for a great moisturizer, I would recommend this product to anyone who lives in a very dry climate, or has aging and dry skin. You only need a tiny amount to cover your whole face, so the jar lasts a long time.  I would also recommend combining it with other products from this line for satisfying results from your skin care regime.</li>
    <li> Since using this face cream, I can see a difference in my skin tone and the diminishing of lines. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I use this product around the house, under makeup, and at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;It will  make your skin soft and nourished, Help restore dry old looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;And at Amazon you will save Money. I went to a Beauty Salon and had a facial she used the same product on my face and I looked great, So I bought this from her and paid twice as much. She stated she was the only one that could get this Product. So don&#x27;t be a fool like I was, always check the Internet first before you buy!  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy or smelly. Has really improved skin.</li>
    <li> My jar smelled strange when I opened it.  I tried to convince myself that I was imagining it but, after several tries, I knew it must be spoiled or something.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because I&#x27;ve ordered this online before and had absolutely no problems.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product in the Image line. Love it! I love the compliments I get too.</li>
    <li> This is my biggest indulgence - love it!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin so smooth and vibrant looking. A little goes a long way, so it lasts long also.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month now.  I can see the difference in just one apply.  Feels so much better.</li>
    <li> great price comapre to the spa and does help make the skin moisturized</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS VERY MUCH AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT</li>
    <li> Great company great product I payed half the price</li>
    <li> Just started using it a wk ago ..gave 4 stars since its been only a wk..like how it feels on my skin. .its nice to see it for haft the price on Amazon so I know where to go when I&#x27;m ready for a new jar...hoping it does what it claims...</li>
    <li> I was recommended this creme by my dermo&#x27;s office. I was thrilled to see that Amazon has it for sale for much less than at the dr. office. I am in my end 40&#x27;s and my skin looks so smooth and nice for my age. lol. I really cannot go without this creme. I use it at night after I take my makeup off from my work day. Give the creme about 4 weeks and you will definately see a remarked difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchases and received them in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I give it four stars because it is very expensive.  The consistency is like a thick serum which I like since it bridges  serums and heavier moisturizers.However,If you want smooth hydrated skin you can find less expensive products that work just as well.  L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena have very nice serums that come in a pump packaging which I prefer for sanitary reasons. Yet there are many positives to this product. As I said the consistency is nice. It has a very light, pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Because I have mature skin that needs a firming moisturizer, I apply a heavier firming moisturizer (unscented) from Oil of Olay. But I will probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Living in a dry climate, I have very dry skin and have tried a number of moisturizers over the last few years. I also have sensitive skin and  need to avoid fragrances in lotions for my hands. When it comes to facial moisturizers, many feel heavy, clog pores, and irritate my skin. At 47 (don&#x27;t tell my kids I just stated my age!), I don&#x27;t think I should have to deal with acne AND lines in my face at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;I started using The Max Creme about a year and a half ago. It&#x27;s pricey, but I love it! I could feel the difference immediately. I think my fine lines are less visable and my skin feels more smooth. I know my skin feels great and stays moist all day. A little goes a long way, too. I use it at least once a day, right after I shower in the morning, and sometimes again after washing my face at night. One jar lasts about six months. I am addicted to this creme!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, The Max line is my favorite among the Image Skincare options.</li>
    <li> I have used this product  for a few years and it is wonderful. It moisturizes at night and smooths my skin overnight like no other product. Sometimes I use other products, and after a week I wonder why I did that&lt;br /&gt; This product works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product before I purchased it, which made me more incline to purchase it but it felt as if the cream itself absorbed whatever natural moisture there was on my face.  The second time I used it I fist put on argon oil than the cream but the same thing happened, instead of having that feel of moisturized skin, it gave me a dry feel.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream, now I can&#x27;t  live without! I&#x27;m Asian in mid 40&#x27;s, been troubled by red spots, redness, itchy skin for about two years. I stopped using all other skincare products I used to love and switched to Image, then redness has been noticeably lighten up. This cream is easily absorbed, almost like &#x27;gel cream&#x27; and not greasy at all. If you spend $$ on department store cosmetics, this is definitely a good buy!  My redness will take time to be completely cleared up but so glad my facial looks far better thanks to Image products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and like it, but my last jar, the formula is separating (just like their sunscreen did in their latest formula). I don&#x27;t want to buy it again if it seperates.</li>
    <li> First bought this at the Spa and enjoy using it in the winter months for that added boost. I use it morning and night with a good eye cream.</li>
    <li> This skincare product is the best I have used. It is hydrating. And after applying feels light on the face.&lt;br /&gt;And for this price, Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> 8/28/2015 -  SA  &amp;  NY&lt;br /&gt;this product is  A M A Z I N G !!!  can i buy stock in your company???&lt;br /&gt;got started with the Image Vital C Hydrating repair cream that smells like citrus/oranges and the Ormedics facial cleanser that my facialist where i was receiving a series of micro-derms from the plastic surgeon spa who are big on botox and all kinds of injections.  i would not let them do anything to me or use synthetic creams, products, so they recommended the Image line.  i saw the ingredients and started using - really expensive from the spa/plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then started looking at the Image website to see if i could get the product direct - which i could not - not licensed esthetician or doctor.&lt;br /&gt;meantime i decided to try the eye lift gel and the Max - in 2 months all my friends where complimenting me on my skin; and literally-physically the sleep creases and crows eyes (which were minimal) DISAPPEARED!!!  i am serious.  i did try the Vital C eye product - NOT HAPPY.  The Max and the eye gel do work.  try it for 6 months and you will be shocked.  Respectfully and Sincerely,  mar</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> The creme works just like any other - no better, no worse. In fact, surprisingly, it&#x27;s not as thick as I expected it to be. But I&#x27;m not paying that much money for another bottle.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the max creme at the day spa I have facials at.  I loved it but it is very expensive when you buy it at a spa.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cr&amp;egrave;me!  I had gotten a sample after a peel and fell in love!  It feels great and smells great!  I will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> I have used it before and was pleased with the results.  It is a light cream that doesn&#x27;t leave a heaviness on the skin.</li>
    <li> This Ageless Creme is the best I have ever used. Totally non allergenic, pure moisture, and supposedly has stem cells that keep your skin young forever. I don&#x27;t know about that, but it DOES HELP!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the genuine product or not. The creme seemed slightly thicker than the one that I purchase locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and I love it. I use it in conjunction with all the Image Skin Care products.  It makes my skin smoother, diminishes fine lines and my skin appears brighter.  I have NOT found anything better.  I highly recommend all the Image Vital C Products.</li>
    <li> This night cr&amp;egrave;me is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  Skin seems to retain moisture better and feels much smoother in the morning.</li>
    <li> Just started using this.  It is non-greasy and absorbs easily into your skin.  It looks like it is improving my skin texture so would recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> The Max cream was recommended by the women who does my facials.  It is the only creme that does not inflame my rosecea. A little bit goes a long way.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful creme that feels light weight on my skin, absorbs quickly and smells great.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous night cremes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> wish i could return the product, felt its not worth for the price. I dont know, it could be the product, or it could be my skin, after using it for 2 consecutive nights, the next morning i woke up with the area around my eyes red and almost swollen, feels like im a raccoon..</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon at half the price it was at my local salon.  I prefer Pevonia for sensitve skin because I live in a very dry climate but this is pretty darn good.  Recommended to me for a night cream only but I wear it all day too.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my dermatologist to reduce fine lines and brown spots due to aging and sun exposure.  I am so glad I can order replacements through Amazon.com.  It was so easy!</li>
    <li> Lavish this one at night, as the moisturizing and hydration affects are very good.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and apply evenly.  There is no methyl paraben which is a wax.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at great pricing  Great quick shipping and packaging.  .  Would recommend and would order again.  Love the product.  Thanks so much . Image great light orange scent in white moisturizing cream</li>
    <li> Use it on my toddler grandson&#x27;s rough cheeks, too!</li>
    <li> Love the Image products.  Glides on smoothly. Smells great.  I feel like I kind I look pretty good.  I use in morning and night.</li>
    <li> The cr&amp;egrave;me has a funny smell and different texture than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image Skincare products for over a year and I love them. I have very sensitive skin is this product doesn&#x27;t bother it a bit. Leaves my skin soft, supple and radiant. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other pricey products, but this brand was recommended by my plastic surgeon, and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Actually makes a difference in skin texture and appearance.</li>
    <li> This cream works! It soothes and controls breakouts and black heads!  It also is not tested on animals because it isn&#x27;t made of chemicals!</li>
    <li> This is a very rich cream. Great for aging skin or to keep wrinkles at bay. Great for throat and decollete.</li>
    <li> Husband got me a facial for Christmas and this product was used. I had very dry skin and had tried every kind of lotion. Purchased a sample pack of this product along with the cleanser and lotion. I use the cleanser and cr&amp;egrave;me everyday. Love it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped with dry patches and my pores look smaller.  Overall, I feel my skin is smoother and I feel confident without makeup.  Definitely a win for my normal to dry, extremely sensetive skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It is non-greasy, smells nice and refreshing, lightweight on your face, highly recommended to anyone looking for a nice night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this when I went to get a facial and my skin has never been the same!!  I&#x27;m so thankful that it&#x27;s sold on Amazon &#x3D;)</li>
