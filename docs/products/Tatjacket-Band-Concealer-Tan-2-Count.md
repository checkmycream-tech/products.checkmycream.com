      <li>Love the ease of it witout the hassle of make up</li>
      <li>It mostly retains its origional size but because it&#x27;s on my forearm it rubs on surfaces like desks</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s just meant for the wrist :)</li>
      <li>but on me, something more fitting was needed.</li>
      <li>these are way better..</li>
      <li>The band is very light weight and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>However, the fabric is light and breathable and having the sleeve over my tattoo is better than nothing, or having to apply makeup to cover it.</li>
      <li>I use this to cover a tattoo for nursing school and it stays in place easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, covers my tattoo on my forearm.</li>
      <li>I got my package quickly and it was unopened!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more very soon!!</li>
      <li>Comfortable material and does a great job covering up my wrist tattoo in a corporate environment.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for someone with bigger wrists.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight, comfortable to wear</li>
      <li>and they are easy to wash and keep clean.</li>
      <li>They arrived within the week of ordering and fit like a glove on my petite forearm.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my wrist well.</li>
      <li>The tatjacket is so comfortable</li>
      <li>I was blessed with a new job that has many more restrictions on dress code than I am used to.  </li>
      <li>These are PERFECT for covering my small heart shaped tattoo on my foot.  </li>
      <li>Easy-to-use and clean would have given it 5 stars</li>
      <li>Would probably purchase the full sleeve</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased :)</li>
      <li>wish there were a better solution than these tatjackets, but they pretty much have the market cornered.</li>
      <li>they shipped fast and no problems!!</li>
      <li>Love it and so does the old lady.</li>
      <li>It is unsightly and the Tatjacket was just the right size to cover the removal site.</li>
      <li>I have to wrap gauze on my tattoos first, then slide these on so that they will stay on.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed to cover my wrist tattoo for work.</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>they do exactly what they state...</li>
      <li>Nothing major just had to pull up often and elastic seemed to stretch somewhat easily.</li>
      <li>If you work doing something less active they would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the company has their logo printed on the inside of the fabric and with the sleeve being as sheer as it is, in the right light</li>
      <li>I can see this would be great on a guy or for a women with larger wrists and arms, but on me, they slid up and down and didnt hold still.</li>
      <li>I have five tiny birds flying down the side of my forearm and this does the job great.</li>
      <li>These bands are too large to stay on the smallest part of my wrist.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re comfortable, but they do stretch out and slide around as the day goes on, so I&#x27;m constantly adjusting them in order to prevent my boss from seeing my ink.</li>
      <li>they work really well</li>
      <li>They were the same price and free shipping from the site.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
      <li>It really covers up the tattoo on the wrist.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>They work really well.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty much just nude colored socks with the ends cut off as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, they always slip down..</li>
      <li>Those are a bit heavier and have a non slip band at the top so they do not slide down.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I do wish they has a little more stretch in them</li>
      <li>Wish it was a little better in water</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and as far as the printing on the inside you really don&#x27;t see it show through.</li>
      <li>It is a little loose (hoping if I wash it, it will shrink to fit my tiny wrists better).</li>
      <li>I do have to pull it up pretty frequently as I do have tiny wrists/arms</li>
      <li>so they are a little more snug only difference..</li>
      <li>I stay hot all the time and needed to get rid of the long sleeves.</li>
      <li>Completely covers tattoo but leaves a tan line.</li>
      <li>It was great, but wish it were s little smaller, have small wrists</li>
      <li>It is snug but not tight to the the point that it would leave marks on my wrist.</li>
      <li>I purchased these sleeves to cover a small, lightly colored tattoo on my wrist (all color, no black outline) and I could still see it through the fabric.</li>
      <li>not sure if it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I bought the smallest size available in this product to cover a small wrist tattoo.</li>
      <li>but beware they do slide down so make sure to get a sleeve that is long enough to cover then some.</li>
      <li>My expectations for the sleeves were probably higher than they should have been due to the price.</li>
      <li>and I barely notice it!</li>
      <li>As it is, these are so loose on me that they slide and move around all day, so they don&#x27;t really do much in concealing my tattoo.</li>
      <li>The cover does the trick, but is an obvious distraction for any professional pursuit.</li>
      <li>For anyone who only needs to cover a smaller tattoo occasionally you can buy beige Kinesio Tape for half the price and cut it to fit your ink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So, I bought these to cover up a tattoo on my forearm due to tattoos being frowned upon at my \\&quot;professional\\&quot; job and crappy wrist bands just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. I read the reviews about tatjacket bands/sleeves and was iffy about purchasing due to the massive amount of reviews saying that this sleeve had the tatjacket logo branded on the outside making it pointless to even purchase. Despite the negativity, I took a chance. They arrived within the week of ordering and fit like a glove on my petite forearm. NO LOGO was printed on the outside. It was, however, printed on the inside. Which idgaf. No one sees it. There is minimal slippage, but slippage none the less. Unless ur one handed, I don&#x27;t see this being a problem. Takes one second to tug it up a bit. Overall I&#x27;m pleased :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight, comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> My expectations for the sleeves were probably higher than they should have been due to the price. They&#x27;re pretty much just nude colored socks with the ends cut off as far as I&#x27;m concerned. They&#x27;re comfortable, but they do stretch out and slide around as the day goes on, so I&#x27;m constantly adjusting them in order to prevent my boss from seeing my ink. They don&#x27;t breathe as well as you would imagine for how thin they are and I noticed my skin getting irritated toward the end of an 8 hour shift on a humid day. Also, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the company has their logo printed on the inside of the fabric and with the sleeve being as sheer as it is, in the right light, it looks like a tattoo is showing through the sleeve. I have to be careful about how I position it when I&#x27;m under the florescent lighting in my police station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there were a better solution than these tatjackets, but they pretty much have the market cornered. For anyone who only needs to cover a smaller tattoo occasionally you can buy beige Kinesio Tape for half the price and cut it to fit your ink. That is what I used to do, but my skin started to get irritated from doing it 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t buy the tatjacket if there were another alternative - but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
    <li> Awesome I love these to cover my tattoos for work !</li>
    <li> Covers my tattoo perfectly for work.</li>
    <li> So like every nursing school in the world, visible tattoos are a no-no. I love my tattoo, but I would also like to graduate my program. This was great. I have five tiny birds flying down the side of my forearm and this does the job great. I do have to pull it up pretty frequently as I do have tiny wrists/arms but I don&#x27;t get in trouble and I don&#x27;t get an irritation from bandage tape. The set of two is perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It really covers up the tattoo on the wrist. I also have a tattoo on my forearm and it will stretch up to there but it stretches it out and then you can see the tattoo through the cover. So it&#x27;s just meant for the wrist :)</li>
    <li> Great love this for my job</li>
    <li> Too big!! Doesn&#x27;t fit my wrist well.</li>
    <li> It was great, but wish it were s little smaller, have small wrists</li>
    <li> these fit perfectly, and cover up my tats easily. plus, they aren&#x27;t tight and binding. it&#x27;s just a shame that I have to cover up my beautiful artwork.</li>
    <li> this works great for me, covers my tattoo nicely, the cover stays in place, I work in a very professional business environment and this does the trick. --- i recently ordered the cover up from this company can&#x27;t wait to try that next</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good, but wold have liked the color to match the skin more.</li>
    <li> Good product. Provided great coverage. Easy-to-use and clean would have given it 5 stars but it did have problems with staying in place. Nothing major just had to pull up often and elastic seemed to stretch somewhat easily. Overall it wasnt a big deal and it did what it was purchased for.</li>
    <li> Fits around my penis like a glove. Love it and so does the old lady. Now I can let it hang out without having to show off that mistake of a tattoo I got on my shaft</li>
    <li> I bought these to use while I waited for a bad accident scar to fade. I can see this would be great on a guy or for a women with larger wrists and arms, but on me, they slid up and down and didnt hold still. Im not even a tiny person (5&#x27;10&amp;#34;/125lbs) but on me, something more fitting was needed.</li>
    <li> Covered two tatoos on wrists so that I could work in nursing profession at a nursing home&lt;br /&gt;They did the trick</li>
    <li> Works perfectly at covering my tattoo. It does slide up my wrist sometimes but not much.</li>
    <li> They work really well. Wish it was a little better in water but it work ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, they always slip down.. Got the Small size &amp; still big. If you work doing something less active they would be perfect. I&#x27;m in housekeeping not so great.</li>
    <li> they work really well the only thing I don&#x27;t like is they don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
    <li> They are great they cover my tattoos well and they are easy to wash and keep clean. I do wish they has a little more stretch in them but they stay in place and don&#x27;t get in the way</li>
    <li> Perfect for covering up the wrist tattoo for work.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re the perfect size!  I wish they wouldn&#x27;t move but they don&#x27;t move as bad as others so I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very nice solution for a unique problem. I had skin cancer removed on my arm... It is unsightly and the Tatjacket was just the right size to cover the removal site.</li>
    <li> I bought the smallest size available in this product to cover a small wrist tattoo. These bands are too large to stay on the smallest part of my wrist. I am a small-framed female, and the smallest size just isn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
    <li> Completely covers tattoo but leaves a tan line. Would probably purchase the full sleeve</li>
    <li> I purchased these sleeves to cover a small, lightly colored tattoo on my wrist (all color, no black outline) and I could still see it through the fabric. Also I can&#x27;t imagine the color of them matching anyone&#x27;s skin tone unless the person is jaundiced. However, the fabric is light and breathable and having the sleeve over my tattoo is better than nothing, or having to apply makeup to cover it. Will definitely have to find an alternative to cover it for my wedding, though.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay up.  I have to keep adjusting them to cover my tats.  I have to wrap gauze on my tattoos first, then slide these on so that they will stay on.</li>
    <li> Works as intended but it&#x27;s starting to wear out a little already. It mostly retains its origional size but because it&#x27;s on my forearm it rubs on surfaces like desks and it&#x27;s starting to fuzz a little. Also the lable is printed on the inside but does show through a little bit, but i just put that side on the inside part of my arm.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to cover my wrist tattoo for work. I work at a bank and I was having to wear long sleeves to keep it covered.........  I stay hot all the time and needed to get rid of the long sleeves. I recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> covers my small forearm tattoo for work without stretching out or making my arm sweat as I run around so much</li>
    <li> I work in an assisted living facility where the policy is to have no visible tattoos. I wear my tatjacket sleeve on my wrist every day. It fits great and stays where I need it to be. The color blends well with my skin tone so it doesn&#x27;t call a lot of attention to the area I am trying to not bring attention to. The band is very light weight and is comfortable. It is snug but not tight to the the point that it would leave marks on my wrist. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this for anyone who works a job that has no visible ink policy.</li>
    <li> They have some kind of stamp label on the inside of the jacket and it shows through. Even my tattoo shows through but it&#x27;s covered enough and it&#x27;s on my underside of my arm so it&#x27;s not bad. I do have thick arms and the medium was snug. Not muscular arms just big.</li>
    <li> I know my wrists are on the slender side, but I thought these would be a lot more fitted.  As it is, these are so loose on me that they slide and move around all day, so they don&#x27;t really do much in concealing my tattoo.</li>
    <li> It is a little loose (hoping if I wash it, it will shrink to fit my tiny wrists better). Other than that, it definitely does the trick!!</li>
    <li> They fit perfect and stay pretty well...they do exactly what they state...I will be ordering more very soon!! May go with a size smaller so they are a little more snug only difference..they shipped fast and no problems!!</li>
    <li> Fit great and washes up well. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for someone with bigger wrists. Mine are small but I did not expect it to that big. I got my package quickly and it was unopened! Only thing was the size of the bands themselves.</li>
    <li> This works perfct to hide my tattoos at work. It comes with 2 in the pkg. Doesn&#x27;t move around or slip.I usethe second one for my ankle tattoo. Great buy!</li>
    <li> does not stay In place and looks rather out of place unprofessional I can not use it a bracelet works better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, covers my tattoo on my forearm. Washes well. Does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Not a good product.  Didn&#x27;t stay out, I&#x27;ll fitting. Regrettable purchase.</li>
    <li> Way too loose for my little arm!  I can&#x27;t find any smaller.  Quite uncomfortable but not sure if it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Comfortable material and does a great job covering up my wrist tattoo in a corporate environment.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of it witout the hassle of make up</li>
    <li> The cover does the trick, but is an obvious distraction for any professional pursuit.</li>
    <li> Too big for my wrists.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with a new job that has many more restrictions on dress code than I am used to.  These are PERFECT for covering my small heart shaped tattoo on my foot.  Thank goodness I don&#x27;t have to waste a band aid daily to cover that little guy up!  The tatjacket is so comfortable and I barely notice it!</li>
    <li> I thought that the would cover my tattoo&#x27;s for work but they&#x27;re 4&amp;#34; which is a smige to short for me so i will have to get a longer pair and that sucks so pay attention to the size you pick and measure your tattoo . but over all i did like the fact that i can stop using the cover make up because that was $$$$$ these are way better..</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and as far as the printing on the inside you really don&#x27;t see it show through. If you are looking for a very light cover these will work for you but beware they do slide down so make sure to get a sleeve that is long enough to cover then some. I took off a few stars only because these things seem to slip down constantly.&lt;br /&gt;After trying these a few times I decided to order Ink Armor sleeves. I ordered the 6\\&quot;. Those are a bit heavier and have a non slip band at the top so they do not slide down. They were the same price and free shipping from the site.&lt;br /&gt;These are basically small nylon stockings that to me were way overpriced for the quality of the item.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use this to cover a tattoo for nursing school and it stays in place easily.  I have small wrists and it is a little big, but not enough of an issue to reduce my liking of the item.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the work place....very comfortable</li>
