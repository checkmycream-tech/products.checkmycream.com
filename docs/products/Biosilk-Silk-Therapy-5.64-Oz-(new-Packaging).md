    <li> It gives my hair much better texture, more silky and nicer drape.  I was really glad to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pretty strong.  Some people could not use it because of the fragrance.  Some of my friends might not be able to be around me because of the fragrance.  It would help to have a fragrance free version of Biosilk.</li>
    <li> Used this product and it works better than any other products I&#x27;ve used. Also good on skin. Works great on making feet smoother also</li>
    <li> Very good for stressed hair.  Always keep one on hand. I apply a very small amount on dry hair</li>
    <li> Good product and good price. I use this every day.</li>
    <li> I  use this product on the lower half of my hair.  You only need a pea size amount on each side.  It will help your hair maintain a lustrous shine, it will feel silky, it eliminates fly-away hair from static in winter, and will prevent your hair from being fried by a hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Nothing compares on all counts. Great price.</li>
    <li> FAKE PRODUCT. WAS FILLED SITH ALCOHOL OR ANOTHER ORODUCT TO FILL THE BOTTLES.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your hair soft and silky. This product also keeps your hair from frizzing and smells grest.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product - used for years!  A delivery problem not caused by vendor was quickly addressed and rectified! Will definitely make future purchases from this company!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have dreadlocks and have had a problem with dryness and after using Biosilk these past few weeks, my locs are much softer. I love the smell as well. I give Biosilk a five star rating and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I accidently came across this about two years ago.  It was sold as a stocking stuffer so I bought a couple.  I loved it!  Silk Therapy is now a regular in my ritual of getting ready for the day.  It leaves my hair shinny, soft, manageable. I am in my fifties so my hair needs plenty of extra help.  Since my hair is short, a dab is all it takes. Also, I have two inside dogs that I bath regularly and use Silk Therapy on occasionally. Their coats look and feel amazing!  Yes it is a little pricey for dogs, but  you use a small amount and for me only once every week or two.  If you are a dog lover you will want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> The bottle is small but it does last long. Probably a few months.&lt;br /&gt;It took away a small amount of frizz, so my hair still is a bit frizzy. It made my hair FEEL soft but not LOOK soft. Im able to brush my hair now without any tangles. It made my hair a tiny bit shiny but its not tha noticable.</li>
    <li> This is intended for the hair, but it can also be used on the hands and arms.  It makes the hair or skin soft and shiny.  I have used this for several years.  A few drops do the job.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used before and was&lt;br /&gt;very happy to find it again, produced with a different&lt;br /&gt;name.&lt;br /&gt;A very small amount on freshly washed hair makes&lt;br /&gt;it feel soft and silky all day. And the scent is&lt;br /&gt;subtle but very nice, I&#x27;ve received compliments on&lt;br /&gt;the way it makes my hair smell. I love it and plan&lt;br /&gt;to buy more when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I have fine, flat hair but I use this and it really helps give my hair volume and shine!  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it on my face under make-up and a small amount on my hair. Was very happy with my order from amazon.</li>
    <li> Smooths down friziness and helps to protect against heat. Be careful using too much, can be greasy if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT REAL BIOSILK. This is a watered down version of the real product. They are adding water or alcohol or body spray?? It didn&#x27;t smell right and should not be runny. It should be a thick serum. This is the 2nd time in a row this has happened to me on Amazon I will stick to purchasing it in a salon. And I will be requesting a refund and reporting this fraud to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years...wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  And like the fact that it comes with an inner &#x27;seal&#x27;.  Try this if you want really soft hair!</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine, flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair. i also have extremely oily roots. now onto the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;makes hair way less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair straighter and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;super soft hair&lt;br /&gt;weighs flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;does not make my hair greasy (the way i use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray. i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very easy to overdo it. use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me. dont apply to roots especially if you have oily hair but thats obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it breaks me out on my neck, back and sides of jaw but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet but i havent been using it long enough..i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was *really* bad. then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet. i only give it four stars because its not foolproof, you have to tweak your method until it works for you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for yrs It is great whatever weather u live in It will make your hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> My Mum has been using Biosilk for over 20 years and she has had copies of it but they are NOT the same.</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING like this product out there. This is simply THE BEST if your hair is dry or damaged. I noticed a HUGE improvement after the first use. I will never go without this hair product.</li>
    <li> I will not be ordering from UglyNBeauty again. I have been using Biosilk for well over a year - and I know what the consistency and smell are like. The real thing doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol and isn&#x27;t watery. This fake version was both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bummed that it took me so long to open it, (but I hadn&#x27;t finished my other bottle), or I would&#x27;ve returned it. Be careful who you order from!</li>
    <li> It leaves hair feeling soft and easy to manage. smells delicious throughout the day, my hair stays untangled, gives shine and no more frizz. I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> this product is very well known and one of the best sellers.&lt;br /&gt;i used it for many years ( 7-8 yrs) i love it.&lt;br /&gt;you can tell the difference right a way.&lt;br /&gt;it is in Costco with better price but they have a hugh size one.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;this one bottle lasted about a yr with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;you dont need very much to have a shiny look.</li>
    <li> This product seems much thinner and runnier than when I bought it 2+ years ago.  It used to be a gel but now it runs out of the bottle like water.  I am not sure that I would get it again.</li>
    <li> I am always in search of the perfect conditioner. Biosilk Silk Therapy is definitely one of them. When my hair gets to be at it&#x27;s worst, I can always count of this stuff to bring it back to life. I swear you could put this on an old broom, and it would come out looking like Veronica Lake! If there is any drawback, I&#x27;d say that you should avoid using it after every single shampoo, because it can tend to build-up. However, I would not even deduct half a star for this, because you don&#x27;t really need to use this after every single shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biosilk could even save you from getting a dreaded haircut that you really don&#x27;t want. It has taken my hair from that krispy-krunchy state to soft and manageable. After a shampoo, work small drops of this onto the palms of your hands and work it through your hair, concentrating on the ends. Add tiny amounts as needed. You will feel the knots and tangles just slip out. The smell is also very fresh and flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try before you pick up the scissors or head to a salon for a pixie. Very good stuff.</li>
    <li> Best leave in product ever.  This is the real Biosilk, not a knockoff like others have posted.</li>
    <li> Smells good, leaves hair soft, not greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved biosilk. For someone with not so great hair, this helps A LOT. My hair feels silky smooth, make sure to follow directions &amp; don&#x27;t use so much. Also best when your hair is wet. After scouring stores and the internet, they had the best prices! Love this product, definitely worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> love this product for my gray fly away hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years and love how it makes my hair feel and shine.  Tried other products but not the same.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dull or greasy, just a little controls the  frizz that comes with humid weather and my perm.  When the bottle gets low, I buy another.  I  have tried other products, but this one remains my favorite.</li>
    <li> Finally found product that gives shine and incredible softness. Love Biosilk</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of things at Amazon.  It&#x27;s convenient.  And I&#x27;ve reviewed a multitude of items (once a Top 1000 Reviewer).  And once in awhile Amazon sends me an e-mail, asking me to review an item.  But since I bought a bottle of Biosilk last month, I&#x27;ve gotten seven (count &#x27;em) e-mails nagging for a review of Biosilk.  I hope this makes it all stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biosilk works fine.  It&#x27;s not as good as Lea Journo&#x27;s styling cream (but easier to find), and about the same as Curl Life (for those with wavy or curly hair).  If I use too much, my hair feels sticky and doesn&#x27;t curl, so I have to be careful.  That&#x27;s about it.  It works okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon is happy now.</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than expected and i am very pleased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I swim every day and have thats why very dry hair.  it is great product and works greate on my dry hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wire-y hair that I wash with unfiltered well water on a farm. I was a mess. With this, my hair is soft and beautiful!! I get so many compliments now. I have honestly been stopped on the street by strangers twice now because they wanted to ask me how I get my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I used it on my show dogs for years and thought...why not ME?</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product and I love it. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted but way less money,( $10 or $15 less I forget exactly).  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great for all hair.  Adds shine, makes it easier to brush and reduces frizz without looking oily.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers of this product (search biosilk), it is very watered down!! When you open and pour it on your hands, it runs everywhere!! I&#x27;m SUPER DISAPPOINTED and DISSATISFIED!! I was hoping I would dismiss reviewers negative comments by purchasing it here, but I guess NO LUCK! Do Not Purchase online - go in store even if it cost more!! You&#x27;re wasting money by getting this!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Little bit def goes a long way. Had crappy shampoo and conditioner which made my hair feel heavy and thick and a small amount of this makes it feel shiny sleek and manageable</li>
    <li> My wife love this product, she has a fat and think hair and this product does the work</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair! Just a quarter sized amount in my hair is all I need to get a shiny look,  too much will make it look greesy. It smells great too! This is the best!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly..and makes my hair and skin so soft!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is better than chi, or John Frieda !!!!!!! I always have instant body after using this product.</li>
    <li> as always this product is excellent on skin and hair...love the scent and how it feels. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Water down version of Biosilk or fake?  First time order from this vendor.  It seem to have too much water in it compare with the real one.</li>
    <li> Bottle was open n it smelled a little like alcohol. It also looked a little water down not as thick as others I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this as I have been using Biosilk for a long time. I opened it, squirted a little into my hand and a quarter of the bottle came out in one squirt as it is completely watered down. It&#x27;s not even real biosilk at all. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly and did everything I wanted .  I color my hair and this product protects my color from uv and styling damage .  Love it.</li>
    <li> excellent product makes my hair look soft and silky and I got a lot of compliments on my hair</li>
    <li> I had been using Chi&#x27;s &amp;#34;Silk Infusion&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s kind of expensive so I decided to try something different.  It totally was different.  This is more like a watery substance compared to Chi&#x27;s which is more of an oil.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny or smooth and I ended up just throwing it away.  I guess you get what  you pay for.</li>
    <li> Smoothes hair, helps with split ends and doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky - perfect.</li>
    <li> The bottle came OPEN.  I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> seems a little thin, but the fragrance is delightful as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is wonderful for your hair.  You only need a dime size even with long hair. Last all day long.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product because it is easy to use and only requires a small amount.  It leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t leave any build up &amp; it&#x27;s lightweight. I like to use it after adding product on natural hair for that added shine &amp; soft hold.</li>
    <li> I dont ever want to be without this....it makes my long hair easy to manage and always refreshes when needed to dull, lifeless hair.. This is truly a great product for me....I also use it on my Springer Spaniels hair....makes it soffter and silkier...my vet thinks its a great ideal....  Love  love love it!</li>
    <li> Even though this product is for the hair to make it more manageable and shiny,  I have used it exclusively on my face each morning before applying make-up.  And again, at night, after I take off the make-up.  I try not to run out of a bottle because no other product will do.  Biosilk is difficult to find in this area because it is sold primarily to beauty shop owners. Amazon is my only source to keep me supplied.</li>
    <li> I always use this product plus the shampoo and  conditioner also. It is  great for thick hair. It makes your hair silky.</li>
    <li> So far satisfied, it doesn&#x27;t make the hair looks greasy and that&#x27;s what I like about it</li>
    <li> Lovely smell to it--makes hair silky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I first purchased it for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair (at the recommendation of her other grandmother), but then I ended up using it as well.  It is pricey, but well worth it.  Both of us have had great success with it... our hair is growing like mad, split ends are gone, and it doesn&#x27;t leave our hair looking &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as it conditions it.  Also, I was able to save money by purchasing it online versus the local stores.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> NOT BIOSILK! I just opened  mine, and it is what seems to be alcohol. I will be contacting amazon for a refund. THIS IS A FRAUD!</li>
    <li> The price was amazing on the amount I received works in my hair keeps it light and not so heavy</li>
    <li> This is the best hair serum that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy but still improves how it looks and feels.</li>
