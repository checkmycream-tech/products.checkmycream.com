      <li>was able to seal all three bundles of hair that I had purchased on both sides and still have some sealer left!&lt;br /&gt;make</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I purchased weft sealer and this one was a good choice.</li>
      <li>It was a fairly easy application process.</li>
      <li>I think the product works fine, but it made my scalp itch.  </li>
      <li>It significantly decreases shedding.</li>
      <li>First and most of all the hair doesn&#x27;t shredded.  </li>
      <li>so I cant give a true review on what it is doing.</li>
      <li>Works well, just comes out quickly...</li>
      <li>and it dries quickly</li>
      <li>Very good product but its jst too small for the price</li>
      <li>As a Natural Hairstylist, I have tried many products to hender shedding but nothing seems to truly work until I tried Shed Stop.</li>
      <li>After the first application to the track , the appearance of track change and hair seems to look like I first purchase the hair.</li>
      <li>I wrap the top in a paper towel and store it away for next use.</li>
      <li>sure if you do use this product that you are using it on a flat surface and have something protective</li>
      <li>Easy application and quick dry.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily and is black which looks great on dark wefts.</li>
      <li>the shipping is pretty fast</li>
      <li>The wefts were very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Not as much as it would have been had</li>
      <li>I would advise anyone to get it before you use your new hair!  </li>
      <li>I love that its black and you won&#x27;t see the glue all over your track.</li>
      <li>That being said that my hair was virgin Brazilian hair ordered from Alilba, and had a decent quality of weft.</li>
      <li>but you have to have really steady hands when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>only thing is that the wefts wont be able to open up after sealing it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The hair still shed and I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it stated it was highly flameable.</li>
      <li>Used on a new hair that I never purchased before.</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it was black and not clear like Fray Chek.  </li>
      <li>I not used it, but do not expect this product to completely stop the shedding.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before strong smell but does the job very little to no shredding after use...</li>
      <li>Stops shedding but make sure you use only a think coat because will harden and be hard for needle to go through.</li>
      <li>You do not want to get this on anything because it does dry fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thin in consistency which makes application super easy, the color is black</li>
      <li>I can see a huge different- less hair in the bathroom!!!.  </li>
      <li>Easy application, but can be a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

<li> and my extension didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Other than the fact I had a hard time cutting the tip down to open it, this weft sealer is great!</li>
<li> The product did not live up to its name.</li>
<li> I just finished applying it to 3 bundles of virgin hair, it was applied to both sides and i still have enough left to do another bundle or go over the previous ones!</li>
<li> I rated this product only 3 stars because the bottle is small for the price, and it did not stretch enough for me to do both sides of the two wefts I had.</li>
<li> So I am not sure if other weft sealers are the same.  </li>
<li> And even then, only the part that you cut would shed and no more.  </li>
<li> I had very minimal shedding on my extensions even after washing with this products.</li>
<li> I like the fact that it is black</li>
<li> I use this product to reseal my previous tracks.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that after the 2nd application the wefts became entirely to tough to even put a needle through.</li>
<li> trash don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Worked well on my wefts and had very little shedding with the application.</li>
<li> so I can give a shed update in a few weeks!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little on the thin side</li>
<li> I had got some bad hair and this didn&#x27;t help not one bit!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely recommend if you want to extend the life of your extensions and put a stop to shedding. A must need if you have Remi Hair extensions!</li>
    <li> Stop what?? This product is TERIBLE!! I recommend fray check or something similar to that.. I had got some bad hair and this didn&#x27;t help not one bit! Won&#x27;t be buying this product again, throwing out what I do have left of it.. Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have if you are planning to have extensions.  I can see a huge different- less hair in the bathroom!!!.  Before I discovered this product, I was seeing hair EVERYWHERE!! and my extension didn&#x27;t last long. But not anymore. This is my third week since I installed my remi extension and it is going great. I definitely recommend this product. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Stops shedding but make sure you use only a think coat because will harden and be hard for needle to go through.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.  Easy application and quick dry.  Wasn&#x27;t to pleased with hair but I can&#x27;t imagine how P.O. I would be if I hadn&#x27;t used A sealer.  Who knows...  my hair is not shedding so I&#x27;m thankful.</li>
    <li> Used on a new hair that I never purchased before. The hair does still shed but I didn&#x27;t expect it not to. I don&#x27;t know how this hair would have behaved without it so I cant give a true review on what it is doing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this stuff twice and used it to seal the wefts on my brazilian hair. It&#x27;s thin in consistency which makes application super easy, the color is black so it blends well with the weft. It significantly decreases shedding. It&#x27;s affordable I highly recommend this product. Oh-only con is the screw tip applicator doesn&#x27;t close after it&#x27;s cut. I wrap the top in a paper towel and store it away for next use. No biggie!</li>
    <li> its okay still had shredding</li>
    <li> Love this product. I sealed my wefts on my weave and no shedding at all. The wefts were very sturdy. My only complaint is that after the 2nd application the wefts became entirely to tough to even put a needle through. If you do the sew-around method then this is great. Next time, I would just apply it to one side for the 2nd install. YES I&#x27;m buying this product again! Love this!</li>
    <li> Works well, just comes out quickly...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before strong smell but does the job very little to no shredding after use...i continue to buy product it last on my extensions...this time I purchased  2 the shipping is pretty fast i like to have on hand just in case i change my style...</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable weft sealer for some hair I had just purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The sealer is great but you have to have really steady hands when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to seal all three bundles of hair that I had purchased on both sides and still have some sealer left!&lt;br /&gt;make sure if you do use this product that you are using it on a flat surface and have something protective&lt;br /&gt;underneath. You do not want to get this on anything because it does dry fast.</li>
    <li> Very good product but its jst too small for the price</li>
    <li> I use this product to reseal my previous tracks. After the first application to the track , the appearance of track change and hair seems to look like I first purchase the hair. I am greatly impress with the transformation of this product and how it make my tracks look. First and most of all the hair doesn&#x27;t shredded.  I am happy. Should I used this product on my tracks before installing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most amazing products. I would to suggest to anyone who wears extensions/weaves. I had very minimal shedding on my extensions even after washing with this products. *That being said that my hair was virgin Brazilian hair ordered from Alilba, and had a decent quality of weft.</li>
    <li> this is really good. seals my weft very great. only thing is that the wefts wont be able to open up after sealing it</li>
    <li> I rated this product only 3 stars because the bottle is small for the price, and it did not stretch enough for me to do both sides of the two wefts I had. Also, I have since had the wefts installed, and still noticed some shedding as well. Not as much as it would have been had I not used it, but do not expect this product to completely stop the shedding. Overall, I will reorder this product, but will look around to see if I could beat the price.</li>
    <li> Other than the fact I had a hard time cutting the tip down to open it, this weft sealer is great! I love that its black and you won&#x27;t see the glue all over your track. It was a fairly easy application process. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all . I  still have hair shedding all over the place . Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local beauty supply(Memphis) for 7.99, yes, 7.99! I like the fact that it is black and it dries quickly so don&#x27;t have to wait around for hours for results! I just finished applying it to 3 bundles of virgin hair, it was applied to both sides and i still have enough left to do another bundle or go over the previous ones! I am getting my install today so I can give a shed update in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I think the product works fine, but it made my scalp itch.  So I am not sure if other weft sealers are the same.  I liked the fact that it was black and not clear like Fray Chek.  I will try another product later to see if its the same story.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased weft sealer and this one was a good choice. Easy application, but can be a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful. Worked well on my wefts and had very little shedding with the application. Does not have a foul odor. Wefts are still flexible after application. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a Natural Hairstylist, I have tried many products to hender shedding but nothing seems to truly work until I tried Shed Stop. It is the best weft sealer that I have ever used. It goes on easily and is black which looks great on dark wefts. I&#x27;m so imporessed! It is also flexible so that I can fold the wefts for sewing very easily. The is a must have product for sewn weaves.</li>
    <li> I searched reviews on good weft sealers and stumbled across this one online.  It does the job just like it claims.  I am definitely going to continue purchasing this product going forward.</li>
    <li> I use this product before co-washing all of my virgin hair. It definitely prevents shedding!! Thisis a must have product for extensions!! Its also genius that it is in an applicator tube!!! Company note: Please provide a larger tube!!!!!</li>
    <li> trash don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This works on weaves!  I would advise anyone to get it before you use your new hair!  No shedding at all unless you cut it.  And even then, only the part that you cut would shed and no more.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I make wigs for others and this stuff is really good... it&#x27;s a little on the thin side but it stopped the shedding and dries quicker than har glue... i guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s thinner....</li>
    <li> The product did not live up to its name. The hair still shed and I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it stated it was highly flameable. I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair for that reason but my sister tried it on hers.</li>
