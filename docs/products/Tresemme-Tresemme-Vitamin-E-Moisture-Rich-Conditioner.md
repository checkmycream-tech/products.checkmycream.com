      <li>positive review.</li>
      <li>I mixed about a tablespoon amount of Moisture Rich with a cup of water into a spray bottle and my hair just drank this stuff right up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for dry hair, but it doesn&#x27;t always help.</li>
      <li>very soft and you get your moneys worth for it.</li>
      <li>Other than that minor issue, it is great.</li>
      <li>Helps conditions the hair and helps keep them hydrated for the whole day</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t help much).</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from it</li>
      <li>Tresemme conditioner works really well.</li>
      <li>Tresemme is a much stronger detangler than any conditioner out there.</li>
      <li>I was very satisified with this product.  </li>

      <li>I love this conditioner,i left it in my hair for 15 minutes while showering shaving and scrubbing my skin,then i combed my hair with a wide tooth comb and rinsed it, my hair was full shiny and very soft</li>
      <li>I cant really say much bad stuff about this product except that it would be a great leave-in if it was silicone free.</li>
      <li>(suddenly it was knot free and so soft!).  </li>
      <li>but it was easy to work through my hair while it was wet, and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and fluffy. I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave build up.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference from your regular or average conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair and Tresemmme shampoo. Same price in stores here in Hawaii. Will buy more later on.</li>
    <li> i love everything about this conditioner. i love the fact that its a bigger bottle and therefore lasts long, the price is good and the it smells good. i sometimes use it for cowashes and also add it to my oils for deep conditoners. great product</li>
    <li> Tresemme conditioner works really well. It is very affordable and will last you a long time. I have been using it for more that fifteen years. I&#x27;ve tried them all but always come back to Tresemme.</li>
    <li> The condition itself is really great and works wonderfully! I ordered two of them cause TRESemme is great. However, when the bottles were delivered to me, one of the bottles had leaked and spilled out cause the lid was not properly shut. So, that was sort of disappointing. However, nothing was messed up because not much leaked out. Other than that minor issue, it is great.</li>
    <li> So now that i decided to grow out my hair, I realized that shampoo alone isn&#x27;t going to cut it. For the price and the quality of it, there is a for sure chance that I will by this again. It works so well with Its A 10. The combination of both makes my hair flowing.</li>
    <li> Every time I wash my hair the last thing I put in it is this conditioner. Rubbing this conditioner through my scalp and hair, I could feel the moisture that was being supplied to it. Washing it out did not strip my hair of the moisture either. This is more than I could have asked of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The next time I get a chance I want to purchase the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have African American Relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I like it and so will you. Helps conditions the hair and helps keep them hydrated for the whole day</li>
    <li> This conditioner works so well, and the price is so affordable. I have very long and curly hair. It can be super difficult to brush out, but this conditioner makes it much more manageable and easy to brush. I have 3 little girls and I started using this on their hair and it works great for them as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I would give it no stars if I can, first off the ingredients are not what&#x27;s listed on amazon. I order two of them and I most say I am very disappointed at the seller of this product, the ingredients are not what I received, there&#x27;s no good oils that was listed. I bought this with knowing that some of the stuff was cones and what not, but I expected the same ingredients on amazon list to be what I intended to buy, it was no where near what was listed besides the biotin. Well not ever buy from this seller ever again.</li>
    <li> Great product for bleached blondes who also happen to be long term vegan and do not use any product tested on animals. I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair daily with the condition and maybe once a week use the companion shampoo. Quality and price unbeatable. As stated great detangler. Put on in shower, comb through, step out of shower and WA LA..you are done. I am a wash and wear kinda girl. Never use any heat on my hair. And I am old. Pushing 68 hard. And I have great long blonde hair. TRESemme. An incredibly undervalued product.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this conditioner. I tried the expensive brands and the inexpensive ones like Suave. Tresemme is a much stronger detangler than any conditioner out there. I have bleached dark golden Blondel hair. When I wash it its matted from the damage. Tre semme detangles it in seconds! Its far faster than Pantene or Dove. It smells good but i wish there was another smell choice like an herbal smell versus the light cologne smell it has.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s good, does the job as a detangler and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Yep, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair so shiny and soft! This is my second time purchasing this product. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it, why on god&#x27;s green earth doesn&#x27;t this product get more hype in the natural hair community?? I am 15 months post relaxer (I have not done the big chop) and recently brought a sample size 3oz bottle from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. I mixed about a tablespoon amount of Moisture Rich with a cup of water into a spray bottle and my hair just drank this stuff right up. It detangled my hair like a dream. Best of all, the level of breakage in my hair has significantly decreased since using Tresemme Moisture Rich. I think it is because it has biotin listed as one of the ingredients which is known to make hair stronger. My hair has never felt so moisturized or so soft. I have done a bantu knot out with my mixture and it left my curls defined like they&#x27;ve never been defined before. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair at work. I really wish someone would have informed me on how great this product was before I shelled out $13 on Kinky Curly Knot Today, which in my opinion is mediocre compared to this stuff. You get four times the amount of product and ten times more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDENOTE: Tresemme has just recently been brought by another company and has changed the formula of the majority of their products (&amp; I don&#x27;t mean for the better). When purchasing any shampoo or conditioner from Tresemme make sure it is the one with the white cap and not the black one.</li>
    <li> it is an alright product but i think i prefer the conditioner i we using before.  there is nothing really wrong with it but for me it is not as frizz reducing as my former product.</li>
    <li> I was very satisified with this product.  Well worth the money and I would buy it again. Started using it as soon as I recieved it.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best conditioners that i have tried from Tresemme. It left my hair feeling really soft and moisturized. I cant really say much bad stuff about this product except that it would be a great leave-in if it was silicone free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for dry hair, but it doesn&#x27;t always help. Sometimes my hair will still be dry even when I use this while other times, it actually works.</li>
    <li> Used this in the winter time&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair feel soft but at the same time weak and dry. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time, and it is great. really good thing</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this reminds me alot of aussie moist but its almost better the slip was great and it quenched my dry tangly hair.. also smells like watermelon candy lol you get alot for a small price!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner,i left it in my hair for 15 minutes while showering shaving and scrubbing my skin,then i combed my hair with a wide tooth comb and rinsed it, my hair was full shiny and very soft</li>
    <li> make my dry hair feel smooth and silky the package came very fast and pack well done..i will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Really nice conditioner. Easy on the hair and keeps everything sleek and shiny.</li>
    <li> very soft and you get your moneys worth for it. great scent and it is also awesome for my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I used this as a co-wash and I loved the way it made my hair feel. I plan to use it for both my daughters as well</li>
    <li> I would never in a million years have tried this conditioner on my own... I have an outdoor shower and one year I grabbed some &amp;#34;cheap conditioner&amp;#34; to stock next to it. Within the first few weeks several people commented about the conditioner asking what it was.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I decided to just try it out for myself- LOVE IT! it is by far my favorite daily conditioner! I have been using it for years now and have yet to find anything I like better for standard conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I only shampoo once or twice a week but I will use this conditioner daily and it leaves it clean and soft! I just scrub it into my scalp and rinse! It detangles and softens with ease leaving my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thin hair and I have not noticed a buildup from it. I don&#x27;t know why it works so well but it just does! I have now turned on so many people to this conditioner I have lost count!</li>
    <li> It does amazing things to my unruly natural african hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> TRESemme Conditioner Luxurious Moisture, Moisture Rich, Vitamin E, 32 oz  is so soft and silky, love it.  Didn&#x27;t know it is bad for septic system, can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner at Dollar General for $2.50 and I must admit I LOVE this stuff ! It smells great and leaves your hair soft as ever ! I&#x27;m a 4c natural chick and I&#x27;m loving it !</li>
    <li> I bleach and dye my hair purple and I ran out of my expensive stuff so I decided to buy this because my mom swears by it. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from it but it was easy to work through my hair while it was wet, and when it air dried my hair was super soft and silky. I also use herstyler serum and l&#x27;oreal leave in conditioner while it&#x27;s damp, but even before these products it was soft! I got this at walmart for 3.50 though. I just wanted to comment on how well it works :) would recommend for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for the first time in Walmart yesterday for 3 dollars and change and tried it when I got home. It made my hair feel like butter! Now, my hair is going through a falling out phase because of postpartum reasons, but I felt the difference as a ran my wide toothed comb through it. Now it&#x27;s try and it still feels silky and awesome. I wonder how it would work as a leave in, but I&#x27;ve been scared to leave something in my hair that specifically says to wash out. Who started that, anyway? lol&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have a hair blog. If you are interested, copy and paste this: curlsofinnocence.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, and nothing more. I expected more though because of the all good reviews. Garnier fructis conditioners do better job for my hair.</li>
    <li> I buy this brand because it&#x27;s cheap and for the size of the container. Love the smooth tangled free hair after using this in the shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay conditioner. I have long, thick, straight coarse hair and was previously using the Ogx line of conditioners... With this you get more product for your dollar, but I have found that my hair is just as smooth but drier using this conditioner. I am hopeful it won&#x27;t dry out my hair too badly over time but will probably switch to another product once this is all gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tresemme Conditioners before but my hair feels silkier with this particular conditioner than with the other Tresemme conditioners. Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> Best value. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well and leaves hair managable, as well as infusing well into my hair during use,  and rinsing completely.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different brands and this is the only conditioner that really works for me. As you comb it through your hair it detangles it and leaves it feeling soft. High recommend, especially if you have thick, wavy or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and never buy any other brand. I love the way Tresemme leaves my hair very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER! It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I have tried many other conditioners and I love Tresemme because it is the only product that makes my hair soft without making it look greasy.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have very thick, curly hair - this has been the absolute best conditioner we have ever used. Better than many expensive brands. Keeps hair moisturized and manageable. we don&#x27;t use shampoo - just wash with tresemme conditioner and comb through in the shower to detangle. Problem is my eldest daughter who insists on keeping her hair long can go through a bottle a week!! nice to find it on amazon to purchase in large quantities!</li>
    <li> There was spillage on delivery but not enough to were I would want to return it or ask for a refund, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this conditioner out but it&#x27;s always sold out so I&#x27;m happy I found it at a great price!</li>
    <li> It does wonders to soften my crazy hair. I love how the bottle is huge, because I have a ton of hair and use a lot of conditioner. It helps to not run out so quickly. Good price, great performance.</li>
    <li> I have really long straight hair.  It always gets tangled.  I also recently moved to a town with terrible water quality (we got a shower filter but it didn&#x27;t help much). My hair is also bleached.  Prior to using this conditioner my hair was fragile, majorly damaged, dry and always in knots.  I picked this up and within one use I already saw a significant change in the feel of my hair (suddenly it was knot free and so soft!).  Been using it ever since and my hair is better than ever. Wish I&#x27;d gotten this condition sooner!</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with this product. You get a lot for your money. It will leave your hair soft, easy to detangle after each wash.</li>
    <li> The product is not the one described here, they changed the composition. Too bad. They tooked of all the moisturizing itens...</li>
    <li> Love the Texture is great and the smell is awesome! I give this product&lt;br /&gt;a positive review. Price is a Plus!</li>
