      <li>and I received it on Tuesday, WOW great service.</li>
      <li>Great experience with this Argon Oil, so far.  </li>
      <li>The best thing I like about it is that it has absolutely no smell!!</li>
      <li>Great for a deep conditioner and to touch up dryness!  </li>
      <li>Used once so far and am very happy with the shine and overall healthy look</li>
      <li>And, its great with olive oil as a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>Need to apply with a light hand...</li>
      <li>makes your hair feel so soft and healthy and on top of your hair</li>
      <li>but today, an easy comb through after it was dry &amp; voila - good hair</li>
      <li>This not only works well as a hot oil treatment for my wife&#x27;s hair, but we also discovered it&#x27;s great for massages.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it worked wonderfully for hair conditioner, both individually and as a weekly deep</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the product and also with the recipes of how to use in hair masks to deep treatment to my hair..</li>
      <li>and i realized the pure oil and strong power of the Argan oil.</li>
      <li>I also really wanted something organic and this fit what I needed.</li>
      <li>Great product, be careful not to use too much.</li>
      <li>what I REALLY like is that you can use it on your face also and it makes your skin just creamy smooth.</li>
      <li>, I also love how everything in it is natural</li>
      <li>Use minimal amount as directed and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>The seller even sent us a nice email recommending a home spa recipe for a Crème Brûlée Deep Conditioning Hair Mask.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much - I make sure to just do a few drops on my palms and use most of it on my ends.</li>
      <li>i was wondering if i can put a little amount in my shampoo and conditioner also.. :p .</li>
      <li>Dark bottle is good.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been this smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>If you have frizzy, dull, uncooperative hair this is a great product to resolve those issues.</li>
      <li>being sensitive to fragrances, this is important to me.  </li>
      <li>And it was the first time I was ever able to use a flat iron without losing tons of hair.</li>
      <li>Normally I would spend the whole day with a head full of fuzz.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a hot oil treatment for my scalp, it has really helped with my psoriasis.</li>
      <li>Word of warning: The temptation to use extra oil is huge.</li>
      <li>The important thing is to use just drops of the product on the middle to ends of hair, otherwise your hair is oily.</li>
      <li>and it really helps with the frizz.  </li>
      <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This works really well in moderation.</li>
      <li>Works really well.  </li>
      <li>She noticed after the first treatment that the her hair was more manageable with less frizz.  </li>
      <li>It would have been nicer if it smelled nicer as I have used other oils with Aragon that smelled better.</li>
      <li>Also, this works far better than the prescription creams have worked, and his skin isn&#x27;t dry or sore or scabbed up at all.  </li>
      <li>Works just as well as any other Argan oil treatment, but there is not the strong smell that accompanies many other brands.</li>
      <li>We consider this product to be very high quality and it lives up to its claims of being &amp;#34;guaranteed to leave hair soft, lustrous and manageable.</li>
      <li>Quite noticeable and an unexpected bonus!</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t require me to send back the first product.</li>
      <li>This works much better than the commercial brands of argan oil that only tend to dry your hair out over time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Better, I have a grandson who is young, and who has had severe exzema since he was an infant.  </li>
      <li>I find a have to use quite a bit though as my hair is pretty long.</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair, the oil made my hair softer and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>My hair had a party when i first tryed just directly aplying to my hair, the only thing was that i poured a big amount and my hair was oily for some days but was also absorving all the mostiture power of the oil..</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use this product on my dry hair or it is too greasy but adding it to my wet hair make it super soft.</li>
      <li>well sorry for being late to send my feedback about this oil i recieved in perfect conditions of package</li>
      <li>I noticed right away that my hair was shinier and less frizzy-flyaway.</li>
      <li>My hair is not dry with this product.</li>
      <li>I do not need to use much oil on my med length hair and it keeps the frizz down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great oil and does not feel greasy but it really gets into your hair. I find a have to use quite a bit though as my hair is pretty long. I would have given it 5 stars but it does not have a nice smell. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but not much of one. It would have been nicer if it smelled nicer as I have used other oils with Aragon that smelled better.</li>
    <li> Totally fragranced free!!!!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. I have naturally curly hair and needed an oil treatment to help condition and tame the frizz. I also really wanted something organic and this fit what I needed. I am completely satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This works really well in moderation. It&#x27;s easy to use too much - I make sure to just do a few drops on my palms and use most of it on my ends. Works well for a deep conditioning treatment, as well, just don&#x27;t leave a ton in your hair afterwards or it can get greasy. Very nice though!</li>
    <li> Just received yesterday &amp; tried it this morning.  I love that it is truly unscented!  being sensitive to fragrances, this is important to me.  I used a small amount on my ends &amp; length of my damp, just washed hair.  my hair is gray &amp; long-ish.  Normally I would spend the whole day with a head full of fuzz.  but today, an easy comb through after it was dry &amp; voila - good hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a small amount.  cover the opening with the palm of your hand, turn the bottle upside down, leave your hand in place and and re-right the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was hesitant about trying Argan Oil, because of my very fine hair.  But it works wonderfully with my type of hair.  I was afraid it would be too heavy for me, but it was not.  A little goes a long ways and I love how it makes my hair feel so smooth and shiny.  By using it as a treatment before shampooing, it has helped the condition of my hair.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This not only works well as a hot oil treatment for my wife&#x27;s hair, but we also discovered it&#x27;s great for massages. The botanical oils and extracts absorb into your skin without leaving it greasy. I googled a few of the ingredients and it turns out, according to Wikipedia, that gingko biloba acts as a reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. This means that it has a mood-enhancing effect. Quite noticeable and an unexpected bonus! We definitely like this product and will order again.</li>
    <li> I forgot that I had not reviewed the product earlier.  Regardless, it worked wonderfully for hair conditioner, both individually and as a weekly deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better, I have a grandson who is young, and who has had severe exzema since he was an infant.  This product, has worked wonders and we use it on his skin, and even on his chapped lips (which we relate to exzema) because no amount of other chap stick has worked.  Also, this works far better than the prescription creams have worked, and his skin isn&#x27;t dry or sore or scabbed up at all.  He has had multitudes of prescription creams to work with too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would use it again for our hair, and we would for sure use it again for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was great!  Shipment arrived quickly, well packaged, and the store was super great at communicating with us.  I was the one who forgot to leave a review for so long, but the product is awesome and so is the store!  Will for sure buy it again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this product on my dry hair or it is too greasy but adding it to my wet hair make it super soft. And, its great with olive oil as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> made my hair so greasy it looked like it was wet. definitely will not use or buy again. . .</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy, dull, uncooperative hair this is a great product to resolve those issues. I noticed right away that my hair was shinier and less frizzy-flyaway. There is no fragrance and you only need a very small amount to see results.</li>
    <li> Used once so far and am very happy with the shine and overall healthy look it gave my hair. Use minimal amount as directed and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife because she is always complaining that no matter what she does, her hair is frizzy and hard to manage.  She noticed after the first treatment that the her hair was more manageable with less frizz.  She has been using it for a week now and swears by it.  We consider this product to be very high quality and it lives up to its claims of being &amp;#34;guaranteed to leave hair soft, lustrous and manageable. Gently nourishes, restores, strengthens and conditions each strand, taming frizz and smoothing flyaway for a magnificent shine.&amp;#34;  We are glad to have purchased this product and plan to buy more when we run out.</li>
    <li> I use this hair treatment on my hair after washing in order to reduce frizz. I am African American and my hair will frizz in the summer humidity and heat. This helps immensely. Love it.</li>
    <li> Make&#x27;s my hair feel like satin, I also love it&#x27;s 100% natural mixed with other essential oils, i use it on my face as well.</li>
    <li> I do not need to use much oil on my med length hair and it keeps the frizz down. I like the product and would order it again</li>
    <li> well sorry for being late to send my feedback about this oil i recieved in perfect conditions of package and i realized the pure oil and strong power of the Argan oil. My hair had a party when i first tryed just directly aplying to my hair, the only thing was that i poured a big amount and my hair was oily for some days but was also absorving all the mostiture power of the oil.. I am very satisfied with the product and also with the recipes of how to use in hair masks to deep treatment to my hair.. i was wondering if i can put a little amount in my shampoo and conditioner also.. :p . Good product. good price. i am very happy with my Argan oil... after looking for it in argentina products and brazil products finally I found in Amazon.. i would like to recieve what other products the company &#x27;&#x27;Earth Element&#x27;&#x27; have...</li>
    <li> It does make my hair smoother and softer.  My only complaint is the packaging.  The opening is too large and the oil pours out; it is hard to get just a small amount. I&#x27;d rather a pump or a squeeze bottle, as opposed to having it pour out. And, it&#x27;s not easy to put oil back into a bottle once it is in your hand.  I&#x27;ve definitely wasted quite a bit ...</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free. It seems to be lacking some of the surfactants other products have so it feels different in my hair. Word of warning: The temptation to use extra oil is huge. Just use a little and work it into your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is truly fragrance free!</li>
    <li> Great product, be careful not to use too much.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  A little goes a long way.  Just what I needed for my dry grey hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not argan oil. it&#x27;s a mix of oils.</li>
    <li> I use it as a hot oil treatment for my scalp, it has really helped with my psoriasis. No more of those commercialized products for me. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price, it is the lowest I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been this smooth and soft! And it was the first time I was ever able to use a flat iron without losing tons of hair. I will definitely have to keep this in stick at my house!</li>
    <li> Very nice seller. This works much better than the commercial brands of argan oil that only tend to dry your hair out over time.</li>
    <li> I ordered my oil on a Sunday and I received it on Tuesday, WOW great service. I have thick wavy hair, the oil made my hair softer and healthy looking.  Will recommend to all my friends, I also love how everything in it is natural and I can pronounce the ingredients. I will order again. Would have been better if it was scented maybe Lavender or coconut. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the greatest. . . makes your hair feel so soft and healthy and on top of your hair what I REALLY like is that you can use it on your face also and it makes your skin just creamy smooth.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending a replacement... My hair feels wonderful and I feel that this is the perfect complement to the coconut oil I use on my hair</li>
    <li> Great experience with this Argon Oil, so far.  The seller at Earth Elements shipped it to me promptly.  I had it in my possession and was using it 2 evenings after I had purchased it on Amazon.  My fiancee and I are using it to pamper each other by giving one another scalp and temple massages with this argon oil, before bed time. This evening ritual, accompanied with a glass of wine, takes the edge off of our toughest and most stressful days.&lt;br /&gt;I also massage a drop of it into my scalp, after I shower &amp; shampoo in the morning.  My hair feels softer and when I look in the mirror, it seems to have a healthy shine that I don&#x27;t remember seeing before.  I would recommend the Earth Elements Argon oil to anyone who is looking for solutions to a healthier head of hair.  The seller even sent us a nice email recommending a home spa recipe for a Crème Brûlée Deep Conditioning Hair Mask.  My fiance loved it!!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed because I expected it to add shine to my hair; it did not.  Also, I hoped that it would help to stop my scalp from itching; it did not.  I would, however, buy it again.  I think I need to give it more of a chance.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  I just put a few drops in my hair while it is still damp and it really helps with the frizz.  The best thing I like about it is that it has absolutely no smell!!</li>
    <li> Very good for the hair. Not greasy or to oily. My hair is not dry with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for a deep conditioner and to touch up dryness!  And, I feel good using it.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my chemically process hair..I gave it to my dad who likes it.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any other Argan oil treatment, but there is not the strong smell that accompanies many other brands. As someone who needs conditioner in the form of an oil, I was struggling with the odor that came along with other oils. This is an excellent way to get the conditioning I need without needing to go outdoors to do it or dealing with the nausea that comes along with most odors. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Earth Elements sent the wrong product. For that, I would deduct all the stars from the seller, but not the product obviously. But I liked the product they sent, even though I didn&#x27;t order it (lavender instead of argan oil). And then they sent me the correct product once I told them. They didn&#x27;t require me to send back the first product. So I ended up with two oils. And I like both of them. 5 stars! Argan oil works as intended. Dark bottle is good. Didn&#x27;t have a bad odor. Need to apply with a light hand... working on that part. Using it on my hair as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> This does wonderful things for my mid length hair.  Helps make it manageable, where it tends towards flyaway.  The important thing is to use just drops of the product on the middle to ends of hair, otherwise your hair is oily.</li>
