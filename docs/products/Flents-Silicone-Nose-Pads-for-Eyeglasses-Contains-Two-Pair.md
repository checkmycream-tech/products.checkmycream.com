### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This dealer is an excellent supplier of aseveral types of health and beauty aids.</li>
      <li>For the heavier pair, I used \\&quot;Perfect</li>
      <li>They arrived in good time and were silicone.  </li>
      <li>Customer service had a particularly nice touch.</li>
      <li>very comfortable once you put them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  </li>
      <li>I would choose a different brand, the adhesive on these aren&#x27;t the best</li>
      <li>These nose pads did not stay on the glasses more than one day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting a bit more quality</li>
      <li>but nope, just adhesive rubbery material...Guess I need to look some more and call my eye doctor tomorrow...</li>
      <li>was better off with the felt version.</li>
      <li>I still like the foam type better, but these worked.  </li>
      <li>While they are stuck on they are fine.  </li>
      <li>I wanted original nose pieces for my son&#x27;s sillouette glasses.</li>
      <li>The item photo is deceptive----these are nothing more than sticky pieces that you adhere to the pads (exactly like the ones you can find for .99 at grocery stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Super glue doesn&#x27;t work on silicone.)  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with their performance during the short time they did work.</li>
      <li>but it feels pretty cheap</li>
      <li>The clear composition made them visually nice, but the glue or adhesive became very gooey and I eventually had to remove them and clean the goo (adhesive) from my glasses.</li>
      <li>These are really noticeable and fall off quite easily</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really complain because of how cheap I bought them for but wish they would hold longer.</li>
      <li>They are easily cut into smaller pieces to fit on the plastic nose part of my glasses.</li>
      <li>They are fine as far as the product goes, I just thought I was getting something else.</li>
      <li>These are pretty flimsy, the adhesive is nowhere strong enough to hold these on a pair of glasses.</li>
      <li>These are ok but do not stick as long as the others.</li>
      <li>These silicone nose pads work pretty good, but only for about two days as the other reviewer noted.</li>
      <li>The only way to get them to hold on securely is by applying epoxy and clamping them to the nose bud piece.</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t expect too much for the money.</li>
      <li>One star is too much for a product that goes straight to the trash bin.</li>
      <li>I had to use a much stronger glue to keep them on-</li>
      <li>does not stick to my glasses very well.</li>
      <li>If you buy these make sure you have a set of small clamps and epoxy or super glue.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable but does not hold the adhesiveness for long.</li>
      <li>Too bad, because they were perfect otherwise.</li>
      <li>the adhesive that comes on the back isn&#x27;t strong enough, but they have lasted since gluing them.</li>
      <li>It peeled off the double sided tape it was sitting on right after I put it on the nose piece</li>
      <li>I got these to reduce irritation on my nose from a new pair of glasses and they are not working.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Decided to re-glue them myself, and cleaned off all the old goo.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall they work okay, but not nearly as well as the typical hideous foam ones which work</li>
      <li>A major dissapointment !</li>
      <li>You would have to constantly adjust them or put new one on.</li>
      <li>and I ended up having double sided tape sticking to the nose piece and earned the trouble to clean it off.</li>
      <li>I Like them because they&#x27;re thinner than others I&#x27;ve found locally before, and they&#x27;re clear, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Flents Silicone Nose Pads is a decent value, does the job, not really substancial</li>
      <li>These pads are nothing more than poorly die cut shapes with an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot; back.  </li>
      <li>I felt these were better than the other two that I tried because it was thinner and didn&#x27;t look that thick when on my glasses</li>
      <li>highly functional for our daughter; adhesive needs some additional kick for the active person--we are trying some silicon sealant to glue them stronger.  </li>

<li> From the picture I thought they covered the nose pieces, but they just stick on like all the others, and don&#x27;t stay on that long.</li>
<li> it makes it that long.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve found others that last a few days longer.</li>
<li> I put these nose pads on my Warby Parker frames and they stayed put for about four days after which they started slipping and sliding all over the place.</li>
<li> The Flents Silicone nose pads do keep my glasses from slipping.  </li>
<li> But at least they are clear, but sitting at a restaurant, my daughter pointed out one had migrated down my nose.</li>
<li> usual, after about a week or so, I noticed one pad beginning to walk across the inside of a lens, and the other pad was starting to slip, too.  </li>
<li> I have tried other silicone stick-on nose pads and have written reviews for them.  </li>
<li> I thought I would try these over the other brand Apex which I had already tried.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m trying to find nose pads that keep my glasses from slipping down my nose.  </li>
<li> After scratching the hard pads that come on the glasses with sandpaper in prep for gluing, I found that just doing this added enough friction to stop the lighter pair from slipping.  </li>
<li> I would have given a NEGATIVE five if there was such a thing.</li>
<li> Got these to stop 2 pairs of glasses from sliding down my nose.  </li>
<li> like previous view, pads slip on glasses,not a solution</li>
<li> (although silicone, you can still see I have nose pads on my glasses since my frames are black).  </li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t even use for a few days.  </li>
<li> I wasted my money.</li>
<li> Waste of my money.  </li>
<li> I would fix the nose pad, and within about 15 minutes, it would have slipped back into the wrong position.</li>
<li> They do help hold up your glasses when your skin is slick with sweat or oil.  </li>
<li> These pads, when properly applied are the answer to slipping, painful nose pieces.  </li>
<li> These nose pads are as hard as the ones that comes with any eyeglasses frames.</li>
<li> They have sharp edges that are uncomfortable and they are no more than 1 millimeter thick and are totally useless.  </li>
<li> The adhesive is extremely weak.  </li>
<li> Obviously, I am very disappointed and would like my money back.</li>
<li> This is a completely useless product.</li>

    <li> slip constantly.  was better off with the felt version.</li>
    <li> Not only are the shapes of the nose pieces not completely cut from the silicone, but the adhesive sticks to the paper backing and not the silicone. Do not waste your money. This is a completely useless product.</li>
    <li> They arrived in good time and were silicone.  The clear composition made them visually nice, but the glue or adhesive became very gooey and I eventually had to remove them and clean the goo (adhesive) from my glasses.</li>
    <li> Got these to stop 2 pairs of glasses from sliding down my nose.  I Like them because they&#x27;re thinner than others I&#x27;ve found locally before, and they&#x27;re clear, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, after about a week or so, I noticed one pad beginning to walk across the inside of a lens, and the other pad was starting to slip, too.  Didn&#x27;t debit the rating, since these things always do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to re-glue them myself, and cleaned off all the old goo.  After scratching the hard pads that come on the glasses with sandpaper in prep for gluing, I found that just doing this added enough friction to stop the lighter pair from slipping.  For the heavier pair, I used \\&quot;Perfect Glue\\&quot; by Liquid Nails, clamping them with alligator clips.  (Super glue doesn&#x27;t work on silicone.)  They haven&#x27;t budged since.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try these over the other brand Apex which I had already tried. These are ok but do not stick as long as the others. They are easily cut into smaller pieces to fit on the plastic nose part of my glasses. They do the job but I was getting about 2-3 weeks out of the others.  This one last about a week it it makes it that long.</li>
    <li> These silicone nose pads work pretty good, but only for about two days as the other reviewer noted. I was very pleased with their performance during the short time they did work. The adhesive turned into goo and slipped off, getting the goo on my nose. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I had to use a much stronger glue to keep them on- the adhesive that comes on the back isn&#x27;t strong enough, but they have lasted since gluing them.</li>
    <li> useless. keeps falling DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money.  Will not stay stuck in the long term.</li>
    <li> The item photo is deceptive----these are nothing more than sticky pieces that you adhere to the pads (exactly like the ones you can find for .99 at grocery stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they work okay, but not nearly as well as the typical hideous foam ones which work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ on packing and shipping, though.</li>
    <li> I thought these were replacement nose pads, that screw in, which is what I needed. The stick on pads I received instead will hopefully last me long enough to order what I truly need. They are fine as far as the product goes, I just thought I was getting something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long used the foam  pads, but never again. These pads, when properly applied are the answer to slipping, painful nose pieces.  This dealer is an excellent supplier of aseveral types of health and beauty aids.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered these Silicone Nose Pads to help hold up my sun glasses.  They do help hold up your glasses when your skin is slick with sweat or oil.  I pair these with silicone covers for the ear pieces and they work together quite well especially if your glasses are not as tight or do not fit as well as they should.  I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the nose pads I purchased and plan on returning the ones I haven&#x27;t used. The price is way overkill for the quantity and quality. The life span once applied to my eye glassses was 2 days. If I had known this I would not have purchased them.</li>
    <li> I got these to reduce irritation on my nose from a new pair of glasses and they are not working. Irritation still exists. I thought they looked like a silicone cover that fits over the entire nose piece but nope, just adhesive rubbery material...Guess I need to look some more and call my eye doctor tomorrow...</li>
    <li> While they are stuck on they are fine.  &#x27;the adhesivegives out in a week or so.</li>
    <li> The nose pads are not screwed on, but rather rubber stickers. They dont last long and and not worth what you paid for. I recommend look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> does not stick to my glasses very well.The nose pad is very big i doubt anyone would need that. I was expecting a bit more quality but it feels pretty cheap</li>
    <li> not enough adhesive they keep falling off</li>
    <li> From the picture I thought they covered the nose pieces, but they just stick on like all the others, and don&#x27;t stay on that long. But at least they are clear, but sitting at a restaurant, my daughter pointed out one had migrated down my nose.</li>
    <li> These nose pads did not stay on the glasses more than one day.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend these silicone nose pads.</li>
    <li> These nose pads are as hard as the ones that comes with any eyeglasses frames. There is not any difference between them, meaning these nose pads does not relief any pressure made to the skin nor any damage as well.</li>
    <li> These are pretty flimsy, the adhesive is nowhere strong enough to hold these on a pair of glasses. If you buy these make sure you have a set of small clamps and epoxy or super glue. The only way to get them to hold on securely is by applying epoxy and clamping them to the nose bud piece.</li>
    <li> I only gave a star because you have to in order to give a rating, otherwise I would give no stars.  The sticky film separates from the silicone leaving them unusable.  Couldn&#x27;t even use for a few days.  Waste of my money.  Obviously, I am very disappointed and would like my money back.</li>
    <li> I have tried other silicone stick-on nose pads and have written reviews for them.  I felt these were better than the other two that I tried because it was thinner and didn&#x27;t look that thick when on my glasses (although silicone, you can still see I have nose pads on my glasses since my frames are black).  In addition, these didn&#x27;t leave a sticky goo when they were about to fall off.  As for duration, it lasts about the same amount of time as any of the other stick-ons (~2 weeks).</li>
    <li> These suck, wouldn&#x27;t stay on and when they did they weren&#x27;t non slip.</li>
    <li> I still like the foam type better, but these worked.  If you like silicone nose pads, you&#x27;ll probably like these.</li>
    <li> The nose pads only stay adhered to my glasses for about one week. I have since started gluing them with epoxy. That extends the time to about 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> These pads are nothing more than poorly die cut shapes with an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot; back.  They have sharp edges that are uncomfortable and they are no more than 1 millimeter thick and are totally useless.  The adhesive is extremely weak.  A major dissapointment !</li>
    <li> Flents Silicone Nose Pads is a decent value, does the job, not really substancial but you can&#x27;t expect too much for the money. I like the neutral color which works well with all color eyeglass frames. I would buy more if needed but only at a less expensive price.</li>
    <li> The adhesive will not stay attached to the frame</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to find nose pads that keep my glasses from slipping down my nose.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  The Flents Silicone nose pads do keep my glasses from slipping.  But they only last about 2 or 3 days before having to be replaced.  I&#x27;ve found others that last a few days longer.</li>
    <li> highly functional for our daughter; adhesive needs some additional kick for the active person--we are trying some silicon sealant to glue them stronger.  Customer service had a particularly nice touch.</li>
    <li> I put these nose pads on my Warby Parker frames and they stayed put for about four days after which they started slipping and sliding all over the place. I would fix the nose pad, and within about 15 minutes, it would have slipped back into the wrong position. I dealt with this for about three days and then finally gave up and took them off. Too bad, because they were perfect otherwise.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold on the glasses, the glue doesn&#x27;t last too long. It also made the bridge of my nose hurt</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose. very comfortable once you put them on.&lt;br /&gt;but only stays on for....maybe a week the most?&lt;br /&gt;if you are in Cancun, it will stay on for 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;but if you only wear your glasses at home only, in or dry climate, it may stay on longer perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;great idea though.</li>
    <li> I would have given a NEGATIVE five if there was such a thing. One star is too much for a product that goes straight to the trash bin. The silicon piece would not stick at all. It peeled off the double sided tape it was sitting on right after I put it on the nose piece and I ended up having double sided tape sticking to the nose piece and earned the trouble to clean it off.</li>
    <li> There are no nose pads.  It is just a rectange of sticky silicone with an outline that you can try to use to cut out a nose pad.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> They slip &amp; slide off your glasses after about two week. I would choose a different brand, the adhesive on these aren&#x27;t the best</li>
    <li> like previous view, pads slip on glasses,not a solution</li>
    <li> I bought these for my eyeglasses. They are comfortable but does not hold the adhesiveness for long. The pad would slide around. You would have to constantly adjust them or put new one on. Can&#x27;t really complain because of how cheap I bought them for but wish they would hold longer.</li>
    <li> These are really noticeable and fall off quite easily</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I was ordering, picture was deceiving. I wanted original nose pieces for my son&#x27;s sillouette glasses. These were just pads that fell off after a day.</li>
