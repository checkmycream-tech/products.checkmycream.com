      <li>and it does not do a good job of removing the dirt and oil from my face.</li>
      <li>It does a good job cleaning without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>This Avalon Organics Hydrating Cleansing Milk is exceptional at softening skin as well as removing makeup and the oil that builds up during the day.  </li>
      <li>Felt great, was refreshing, and loved the citrus smell.  </li>

      <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months and am pretty happy.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not as satisfied with it as I am with the cleansing milk.</li>
      <li>I love my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can find something else that meets my needs better than this product.</li>
      <li>Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel, Vitamin C, 8.5 Ounce]], and</li>
      <li>so I love it when I find products that I can count on to do the job it says it will produce.</li>
      <li>but I am glad to read it</li>
      <li>I need something that&#x27;s not so creamy and does a better job of cleaning my face.</li>
      <li>Works better than cleansing gel for me.</li>
      <li>When the pump would no longer pump product, there was clearly more in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 years and have found the price on Amazon to be reasonable, but not always the best when compared to sale prices in my local stores, however, the convenience offered in ordering from Amazon, can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very good at soothing irritated or dry skin.</li>
      <li>Of course, it is fine for morning cleansing too, but to wake your skin up in the morning, I prefer [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Their is nothing like a clean,soft, smooth face and neck.</li>
      <li>The fresh, fruity smell is my favorite part of this face wash.</li>
      <li>I love the brand, but more importantly, this cleanser really works for my face.  </li>
      <li>But so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling clean with no tightness.</li>
      <li>but if you use a wash cloth it will get the job done and wash away clean.  </li>
      <li>this lotion is incredibly soothing if anyone else ever unfortunately has this experience from this product; also good for sunburns, etc.)</li>
      <li>Great product - nice, delicate orange fragrance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a fresh, bright citrus scent that is very pleasant and a thick consistency that falls somewhere between normal facewash and lotion.</li>
      <li>The aroma is pleasantly invigorating, it&#x27;s smooth &amp; creamy without feeling greasy, and it&#x27;s not irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This would probably be good for older, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t have issues with acne still and where the layer of \\&quot;cleansing milk\\&quot; would probably feel nice.</li>
      <li>the price on Amazon is much better than what it costs at Whole Foods or Target.</li>
      <li>Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel, Vitamin C, 8.5 Ounce]], which really gives you a zing after you get out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about the product.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, sometimes, but nothing that I would have thought would give me this kind of reaction.</li>
      <li>This product naturally balances my combination (sometimes oily, sometimes dry) complexion, giving my skin a \\&quot;perfect world\\&quot; feel.</li>
      <li>It also lasts a long time, so I found the price point to be a good value.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural face wash</li>
      <li>I have just started using this as I&#x27;ve run out of Philosophy&#x27;s Purity and wanted to use a more natural companies cleanser.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great on very dry and getting older skin.</li>
      <li>I would buy it again for the right price and</li>
      <li>It removes my foundation well, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth, unlike many cleansers that leave it feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a great product, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>My skin right now is red and bumpy with enlarged pores and more blackheads than I have ever had.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use daily and love it.</li>
      <li>You simply can not get better this.</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t exactly pimples though</li>
      <li>This cleanser is ok but definitely not a stand-alone  cleanser.</li>
      <li>I usually use Neutrogena Naturals, which works wonderfully with my skin (clear with the occassional breakout, and very sensitive), but I wanted to get away from companies that test on animals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for organic beauty products that actually work (and sadly not that many do), but I really like Avalon&#x27;s Cleansing Milk.</li>
      <li>, it is very soothing and relaxing just before bed, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This product seemed promising</li>
      <li>and I really felt like my skin was soaking it in.</li>
      <li>certain if I&#x27;m allergic to any of the particular ingredients in this product or</li>
      <li>&#x27;s meets other peoples&#x27; needs :-)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really been faithful enough in my use to give a full review, however, I ordered the cream and gel cleansers plus the astringent and I really like all three.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is the equivalent of smearing lotion all over your face and then rinsing it off with water, only to be left feeling like I needed a different kind of cleanser to wash my face off!  </li>
      <li>you have oily skin, I might not recommend this, but if you have skin that&#x27;s a bit dry, it&#x27;s a great gentle cleanser without harsh ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have used in the past the Avalon Organics Lavender cleansing milk and toner and liked those quite a bit (and still use the moisturiser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels a little too rich for a cleansing milk sometimes, so I may switch to a different product if I find something better.</li>
      <li>(did not realize that was the main purpose of this product until I read the label closely to write this review</li>
      <li>I put it aside, vs. throwing it out, just because it was reviewed here so highly.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>I had almost given up hope of being dry patch free, and ihad tried everything, including far more expensive options, and nothing gave me the healthy dewy glow I sought after.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s kind of hard to find in stores)</li>
      <li>The natural \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; fragrance and gentle ingredients refresh and revive my skin, affirming quality and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and not at all dry.</li>
      <li>As for the rest of my face, it started to burn within a few seconds, so I would just try to quickly spread it around and then rinse it off right away.  </li>
      <li>This is my new go-to for night time cleansing.</li>
      <li>I just want clear, vibrant skin and for the price</li>
      <li>Rinsed well immediately, then washed with regular soap to clear any residue, and sure enough, my face (especially cheeks and chin) were very inflamed,</li>
      <li>It keeps it clear!  </li>
      <li>My daughters use it regularly and when guest come to visit and use it for the first time they always ask where they can buy it.</li>
      <li>This cleanser does not foam, it feels very gentle even though it takes away all the days grime and leaves my skin feeling softer than any other cleanser I have used (and I&#x27;ve used the more expensive popular brands, this cleanser is head and shoulders above those).</li>
      <li>cleanser is light and creamy, it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of getting down into the pores; but all of the grime and oil (sunblock) and waterproof mascara is gone and my skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and thought this would be a better fit than the regular cleanser which can be harsh when it&#x27;s dry outside.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so popular here due to our warm humid climate that it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to find any on the shelf, hence why I buy it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural, earth-friendly, cruelty-free face wash and everything in Hawaii is crazy-expensive.</li>
      <li>It goes on so creamy and my face feels amazingly soft and never feels stripped of its moisture.</li>
      <li>All the ingredients are natural and certified organic.  </li>
      <li>However, it just feels like applying a layer of grease to my face that then has a hard time washing off, and certainly doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clean.</li>
      <li>happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give this two stars, but added an extra because my old face wash was extremely drying, and with this one I could actually clean my face without the need to immediately grab for some moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough not to bother skin conditions (such as my rosacea)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but more reasonable to get it online than in the store.</li>
      <li>This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>skin has finally calmed down about 16 hours later thanks in part to Shikai Borage Therapy Children&#x27;s Lotion.  </li>
      <li>During tha process you either get too much or too little.  </li>

<li> fire red, oh-so-sore and skin felt tight.  </li>

    <li> This product smells great and has a nice citrus scent.  It doesn&#x27;t lather great but if you use a wash cloth it will get the job done and wash away clean.  I would buy it again for the right price and the price on Amazon is much better than what it costs at Whole Foods or Target.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really been faithful enough in my use to give a full review, however, I ordered the cream and gel cleansers plus the astringent and I really like all three.</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident when I was reaching for [[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel, Vitamin C, 8.5 Ounce]], and boy am I glad I discovered it!  This Avalon Organics Hydrating Cleansing Milk is exceptional at softening skin as well as removing makeup and the oil that builds up during the day.  Gentle enough not to bother skin conditions (such as my rosacea), it is very soothing and relaxing just before bed, and leaves my skin soft and smooth. This is my new go-to for night time cleansing. Of course, it is fine for morning cleansing too, but to wake your skin up in the morning, I prefer [[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel, Vitamin C, 8.5 Ounce]], which really gives you a zing after you get out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also highly recommended:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000PILCJU Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004AIEBGW Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Facial Cream, 2 oz (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> The fresh, fruity smell is my favorite part of this face wash. My skin always feels rejuvenated after I use this cleanser!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and am pretty happy. It does a good job cleaning without drying my skin. It feels a little too rich for a cleansing milk sometimes, so I may switch to a different product if I find something better. But so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  Felt great, was refreshing, and loved the citrus smell.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about the product.  But I won&#x27;t buy again because of the pump.  When the pump would no longer pump product, there was clearly more in the bottle.  To use the remaining you have the messy process of removing the pump, finding a place to put it down, and trying to get the product out of the bottle.  During tha process you either get too much or too little.  Just a disaster.  I found it annoying and wasteful.  Too bad.  I really liked the product itself.</li>
    <li> My complexion has never been more perfect since I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful facial cleansing milk. The natural \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; fragrance and gentle ingredients refresh and revive my skin, affirming quality and effectiveness. This product naturally balances my combination (sometimes oily, sometimes dry) complexion, giving my skin a \\&quot;perfect world\\&quot; feel. I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 years and have found the price on Amazon to be reasonable, but not always the best when compared to sale prices in my local stores, however, the convenience offered in ordering from Amazon, can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and thought this would be a better fit than the regular cleanser which can be harsh when it&#x27;s dry outside. However, it just feels like applying a layer of grease to my face that then has a hard time washing off, and certainly doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clean. This would probably be good for older, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t have issues with acne still and where the layer of \\&quot;cleansing milk\\&quot; would probably feel nice. Too bad it came in a two pack because both bottles are still full sitting on my shelf.</li>
    <li> Great product - nice, delicate orange fragrance.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and not at all dry.</li>
    <li> I used this because I had unexplainable teeny tiny bumps on my forehead. They weren&#x27;t exactly pimples though so I knew it was just my skins way of screaming out for something. So I was recommended this by a friend and ordered it online (it&#x27;s kind of hard to find in stores) It totally changed my skin! I massaged it into my face while it was totally bone dry and I really felt like my skin was soaking it in. Then I wet my hands and wiped it off. Turns out my skin was dehydrated because this stuff totally wiped the little bumps out! One thing I have noticed though is that if I leave it on my face a little too long it will start to burn, but nothing too alarming. It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s like washing your face with lotion and it&#x27;s very good at soothing irritated or dry skin. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this as I&#x27;ve run out of Philosophy&#x27;s Purity and wanted to use a more natural companies cleanser.  I have used in the past the Avalon Organics Lavender cleansing milk and toner and liked those quite a bit (and still use the moisturiser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is light and creamy, it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of getting down into the pores; but all of the grime and oil (sunblock) and waterproof mascara is gone and my skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I updated my review from 4 to 5 stars because this stuff is fanstastic.  This cleanser does not foam, it feels very gentle even though it takes away all the days grime and leaves my skin feeling softer than any other cleanser I have used (and I&#x27;ve used the more expensive popular brands, this cleanser is head and shoulders above those).</li>
    <li> My daugther and her friends use this when  they go out to the desert so, I tried it when she forgot it at  my house.&lt;br /&gt;It is great on very dry and getting older skin. You can use it as a regular moisterizer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Avalon cleanser for 3 years. Creamy, smells nice, softens skin. Not botox in a bottle - wear your wrinkles proudly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for organic beauty products that actually work (and sadly not that many do), but I really like Avalon&#x27;s Cleansing Milk. (I use this at the end of the day, and an exfoliating facewash in the morning in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh, bright citrus scent that is very pleasant and a thick consistency that falls somewhere between normal facewash and lotion. It removes my foundation well, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth, unlike many cleansers that leave it feeling dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin, I might not recommend this, but if you have skin that&#x27;s a bit dry, it&#x27;s a great gentle cleanser without harsh ingredients. It also lasts a long time, so I found the price point to be a good value.</li>
    <li> Perfect no soap cleanser and very gentle on my skin. This is my second purchase and will continue to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I usually use Neutrogena Naturals, which works wonderfully with my skin (clear with the occassional breakout, and very sensitive), but I wanted to get away from companies that test on animals. I tried this out, and since I first used it I have had the worst acne since I was in middle school. My skin right now is red and bumpy with enlarged pores and more blackheads than I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, but it definitely did not work for me. I continue my pursuit for a cruelty-free product that keeps my skin happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give this two stars, but added an extra because my old face wash was extremely drying, and with this one I could actually clean my face without the need to immediately grab for some moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used the Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Hydrating Cleansing Milk for over a year now and I can&#x27;t use anything else! It goes on so creamy and my face feels amazingly soft and never feels stripped of its moisture. It&#x27;s so popular here due to our warm humid climate that it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to find any on the shelf, hence why I buy it on Amazon. My daughters use it regularly and when guest come to visit and use it for the first time they always ask where they can buy it. I have used the gel but I&#x27;m not as satisfied with it as I am with the cleansing milk.</li>
    <li> Their is nothing like a clean,soft, smooth face and neck. I love my skin so I love it when I find products that I can count on to do the job it says it will produce. And this does.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is BAD. I was looking for a more natural face wash so I gave this a try just now. My face started burning almost immediately; I have applied an ice cold wash-cloth, used moisturizer, etc -- and still feel like I am on fire. I have somewhat sensitive skin, sometimes, but nothing that I would have thought would give me this kind of reaction. This bottle should come with a warning label -- seriously.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural, earth-friendly, cruelty-free face wash and everything in Hawaii is crazy-expensive. This product seemed promising so I ordered it. The aroma is pleasantly invigorating, it&#x27;s smooth &amp; creamy without feeling greasy, and it&#x27;s not irritating to my sensitive skin. I use daily and love it. Going to check out their other products in the near future.</li>
    <li> I tried it for one month – my face got red every time I used – I am afraid to continue – might be allergic</li>
    <li> I like to use a cleanser that can cleanse my eye makeup off also, but with this, I found myself trying to avoid the eye area because it burned a little.  As for the rest of my face, it started to burn within a few seconds, so I would just try to quickly spread it around and then rinse it off right away.  It&#x27;s not that my skin isn&#x27;t used to vitamin C either.  I use Philosophy&#x27;s Vitamin C powder without any problems.  This cleanser is the equivalent of smearing lotion all over your face and then rinsing it off with water, only to be left feeling like I needed a different kind of cleanser to wash my face off!  I put it aside, vs. throwing it out, just because it was reviewed here so highly.  I guess I figured that one day, I&#x27;ll try it as a back-up cleanser when I run out of cleanser. Today, I decided to see what beautypedia said about it.  SURE enough, POORLY rated and it is said to leave RESIDUE on the skin and \\&quot;the citrus oil (plus other unidentified essential oils) makes it a problem for use around the eyes and mucous membranes.\\&quot;  I guess my skin wasn&#x27;t THAT crazy after ALL. Tossing this crap in the trash tonight.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product, especially for the price.  All the ingredients are natural and certified organic.  You simply can not get better this.</li>
    <li> Works better than cleansing gel for me. Leaves skin feeling clean with no tightness.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is ok but definitely not a stand-alone  cleanser. I did not see any improvements in my skin while using it and it does not do a good job of removing the dirt and oil from my face. I need something that&#x27;s not so creamy and does a better job of cleaning my face. I look 10 years my junior and have dark brown skin so \\&quot;sun-aging defense\\&quot; is not top on my list of skin-care priorities (did not realize that was the main purpose of this product until I read the label closely to write this review lol smh). I just want clear, vibrant skin and for the price I&#x27;m sure I can find something else that meets my needs better than this product. Just bought the Aveeno cleaning pads today and will give that a whirl and see how it works for me. This product is not for me but I am glad to read it&#x27;s meets other peoples&#x27; needs :-)</li>
    <li> Tried this face wash last night and within seconds my not-so-sensitive skin felt like it was BURNING.  Rinsed well immediately, then washed with regular soap to clear any residue, and sure enough, my face (especially cheeks and chin) were very inflamed, fire red, oh-so-sore and skin felt tight.  NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE!  Frightening actually.&lt;br /&gt;Not certain if I&#x27;m allergic to any of the particular ingredients in this product or perhaps the combination of ingredients renders it being caustic.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, because of this experience I would NEVER recommend any of the items in this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has finally calmed down about 16 hours later thanks in part to Shikai Borage Therapy Children&#x27;s Lotion.  (Just FYI this lotion is incredibly soothing if anyone else ever unfortunately has this experience from this product; also good for sunburns, etc.)</li>
    <li> One bottle lasts me a long time.  I love the brand, but more importantly, this cleanser really works for my face.  It keeps it clear!  When I travel on business, I sometimes forget to bring it with me and I notice a difference when I&#x27;m not using it.  It&#x27;s expensive, but more reasonable to get it online than in the store.</li>
    <li> I use this face wash with my Mia Clarisonic and it has worked wonders. It cleared up my acne, and helps to brighten and reduce my acne scars.</li>
    <li> This stuff along with the rest of the vitamin C line has truly changed my dryer than dry skin. I had almost given up hope of being dry patch free, and ihad tried everything, including far more expensive options, and nothing gave me the healthy dewy glow I sought after. I work on a negative airflow floor of a hospital and my dry skin had reached its peak until I found this. If you&#x27;re wavering, take the plunge, you will not regret it.</li>
