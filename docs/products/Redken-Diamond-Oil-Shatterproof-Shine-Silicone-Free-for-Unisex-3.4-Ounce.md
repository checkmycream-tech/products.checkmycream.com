<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many other products but always come back to diamond oil. I love it. It keeps my hair from frizzing in the humidity and it adds shine.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have had some problems with my hair due to health issues. My hair isn&#x27;t strong anymore and doesn&#x27;t hold up well when I get it highlighted. It&#x27;s extremely damaged and before this nothing worked and I&#x27;ve tried it all. With only one use this product used in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner completely transformed my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after blow drying my hair. It was so soft and healthy looking. Just a few drops is all it takes and the results are unbelievable. I recommend this to anyone, especially those with weak and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Background: I have dry, curly hair that I wash once or twice a week. I typically use Olive Oil brand or Garnier Fructisse. I&#x27;ve purchased lots of Redken product in the past and have never found it to be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff rocks. It is the most lightweight hair oil I have ever used. I use probably a quarter-sized amount each time and just scrunch it into my curls. It makes my hair looks shiny and healthy. I also rub it on my ends when I flat-iron my hair for a sleek finish. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a dropper of oil, it makes it hard to evenly get on your hair.  I so far don&#x27;t see any benefits.</li>
    <li> works great on dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> It does not work its not the original i threw it away because it felt so greasy its like cooking oil</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell and I didn&#x27;t get the rave review results that so many other women were writing about.  My $5 bottle of Suave Moroccan oil does a much better job and smells better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this giant bottle that will last the rest of your natural life, try to get a sample from a salon or the company to be sure it is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 4-5 drops at first on damp hair - NOTHING.  Went back and added another 5 drops to the ends - warming in my palms, as recommended.  I think the smell also turns me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very funny how personal these hair products are, what some people absolutely adore just won&#x27;t do the trick for other people.</li>
    <li> this product produces a great shine to your hair with just a few drops, worked in and brushed through when dry. my problem that stopped me from using it is the smell.  I am to young to smell like someones 90 year old grandma.  and the smell has staying power, its not overwhelming but its there.  all day long its all I could smell. its an old lady perfume scent from the 80s.&lt;br /&gt; that being said, if you like the smell, or dont care how your hair smells or wear enough of another scent to cover it, this will produce a great shine and smooth split ends. it does smooth the ends down.&lt;br /&gt; the bottle is glass and heavy, and the dropper is glass, you need to be careful when using it, as you will get slick fingers when trying to recap the product.</li>
    <li> This bottle resembles a fine perfume decanter so it&#x27;s pretty enough to display if you wish.  The oil is very effective in de-frizzing hair and rendering it soft.  The length and condition of your hair will determine the amount you need to apply--use the dropper to release what you need in your palms, rub them together and run your hands through the hair.  My hair is fine so I don&#x27;t need too much or it will become limp.  A little goes a long way.  Results in silky shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long coarse hair.  Until a year ago it was healthy and shiny.  I had to start taking some medication that left my hair dull and lifeless.  I saw this at a salon for $40 and decided to look it up on Amazon and read the reviews.  I am so glad I did.  This stuff is amazing!!!  I have my old hair back.  I use about 5 to 6 drops after blow drying and before styling.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny, bouncy and full of life!  I have used other oils in the past that left my hair oily and stringy but this one is so light weight I even use it on my roots with no problem.  I would highly recommend this product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I really want to return this product. It will cost $6 to get back my $21.00&lt;br /&gt;I brought it to my salon and it is a fake or it&#x27;s been altered in some way. It&#x27;s not the same as the one i use in my salon whatever it is. I regret buying hair product from this company. I went to their GBS website and they don&#x27;t even carry this product or any other redken products that i searched for.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  It smells like Skin so soft and feels like baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy the real thing from a salon. Or even try precious oil from pureology.  I bought that after this stuff dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> False product! Diamond Oil as sold in salons does not smell like dime store Musk oil. The product that was delivered is a knock off! This was the first time that I purchased this type of product over the Internet. I really didn&#x27;t believe that you could only purchase the real product from salons. I was wrong. I took my product to the salon today and compared the real with the fake. No smell! I put this stuff in my hard for two weeks and it started breaking! and it weighed it fown like baby oil. I will never stray away from real salon products again! I just lost $30. On this imposter product! I am disappointed in Amazon for allowing this to happen!</li>
    <li> perfect and WAY cheaper than buying it at the Hair Salon</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, I love redken  products but this one didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I will try the shampoo and conditioner line to see if it works for my hair.</li>
    <li> I havent had a chance to really get to use this product but I occasionally put it on mine and its a good oil for hair!</li>
    <li> DISCUSTING leaves hair oily and flat</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now and my hair looks amazing.  Just a few drops and my hair was so shiny and it smells great. It may be a little more expensive but it is worth the price. The package comes like an expensive bottle of perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and smells great! Wish they made a perfume in this smell!</li>
    <li> I just received my packaged. I am so happy to have this product. The salon price was ridiculous and this fit in my budget. I love the smell and it immediately makes your hair super soft. Apply only to the ends of your hair obviously and a little goes along way. This product is better than moracan oil hands down. Moracan oil can&#x27;t even come close to the way my hair is super soft and manageable after this use. I just did that balayage to my hair and this is perfect to keep my color beautiful and not dried out looking.</li>
    <li> Love! You don&#x27;t need to use much of this. Besides applying to dry or damp hair before styling, I apply this to my hair before I shampoo on my split ends. Additionally, I add a few drops when I&#x27;m deep conditioning my hair as well. Also great on skin &amp; nails too! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have densely growing hair. My strands are fine (smaller diameter) and my hair tends to by dry, wispy with light natural waves. This product made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two weeks. Very oily and dull. I had to wash, recondition and re-dry my hair to fix it--not great on a workday morning!  May work well for other hair types, but it was horrible for mine. High shine my foot!</li>
    <li> THIS GOLDEN OIL IS A STYLIST DREAM ! ,&lt;br /&gt;THIS OIL IS VERY VERY  LIGHT, NOT GREASY AT ALL !&lt;br /&gt;*SMELLS WONDERFULLY NICE CRISP AND FRESH !, ,&lt;br /&gt; * I HAVE BLEACHED MIXED TEXTURED HAIR, KINKY &amp; WAVY AND NEEDED SOMETHING TO MAKE MY BLEACH BLONDE HAIR SHINE !

WORTH THE MONEY... SHOP AROUND FOR DEALS, SLEEK HAIR, EBAY, AVEYOU ETC.....</li>
    <li> I have been using the Redken argon-6 oil for years, and thought that I would try the Diamond Oil after seeing it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t even know why I did that since I was very happy with the argon-6 oil! Nevertheless, I got the Diamond Oil anyway, and I was very disappointed after using it for 2 weeks. It completely dried out my hair even more than ever and made it very brittle. It made my hair very unmanageable and my hair did not flow like it did with the argon-6 oil. I stopped using it and immediately went back to the argon-6 oil. My hair was back to normal after using the argon-6 oil for only 1 day. I now have the entire bottle of Diamond Oil sitting on my shelf collecting dust. I have been using Redken products for 5 years now, and feel that they should be embarrassed with this product.</li>
    <li> Product seemed old.  I only used it several times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of brand name products. Saw this ad in my Allure. I&#x27;ll tell you, the bottle design is absolutely horrid. All glass, which leaves it slick after application. Yes, I know, we are rating product not design, however if you spill a $40 bottle of product, then what the hell? And I almost spill it every time I use it. It&#x27;s good stuff admittedly, but be careful of how much you use or you will look like a duck after an Alabama Gulf Shores oil spill. Save your money and get the $10 serum at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Good shine, fragrance ok but, use sparingly can make hair too oily.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and damaged from chemical processing, and this Redken product makes it feel soft without feeling heavy. I only need to use it about every two or three weeks so it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Good product and decent price</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Using it with the compatible conditioner, this product has left my hair shiny, shiny, shiny!!!  The best!</li>
    <li> Great smell and not oily at all which doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy.!!!!</li>
    <li> Only hair product I&#x27;ve found worth the extra money. Takes so little it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have wavy short hair which has the tendency to frizz easily looking dull and dry, no matter what I apply on it. The only way to make it look better is to straighten it. I have bought and tried so many different products and last time when I was at Ulta, when I spoke to one of the employees, she gave me a sample of this product. The first time I tried it, I loved it, as it smelt great and kept my hair flexible and frizz free all day. I was so happy and wanted to buy it. But the price was too high and wasn&#x27;t ready to pay that much at the store. I wanted to see in Amazon if there is any deals and found this for almost half price. GREAT Price and I ordered it right away. The best thing about this product is- you only need a few drops daily and you can use it with moist and also dry hair. I dont like washing my hair everyday, so this works perfect for me. I love love the smell of this product.Just be careful not to put too much in your hair and use exactly as recommended. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample from Ulta - after using the sample i knew i wanted to continue using it.  This product does not make your hair oily looking, directions say to use 4 drops - i use more - maybe 6-8, but i have dry, over processed hair therefore it soaks it up.  It tames the frizz down. The fragrance is great!  I use it on my damp hair before i blow dry and on dry hair before using my flat iron.  I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Was glad I got it for her. Makes your hair really shiny and stops the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and neck every morning.  It has really helped my &amp;#34;older dry skin&amp;#34; and it feels great!</li>
    <li> Great for mixed, bi-racial hair, I use diamond oil with the Redken Steam Infusion straightener.  Calms frizz and makes hair silky smoothe.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and was hesitant to try as most oils/serums make my long, baby fine hair flat with no body, or at the very least, greasy feeling. Not this product! My hair is naturally wavy, prone to frizz and very damaged due to highlighting and straightening. I tried today, only used about two small drops, and was amazed! After I blow dried there was no frizz whatsoever but what really sold me was that my hair has MORE body! Didn&#x27;t even need to straighten to manage the frizz, which is great- one less damaging styling step. The smell is faintly masculine (men&#x27;s cologne or soap) at first but after blow drying I didn&#x27;t notice it at all. Writing this review for anyone who has fine &amp;#34;seaweed on a rock&amp;#34; hair :)  and is leery of trying an oil. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil I have ever used.  The extra bonus is that this oil can be used on skin as well.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I have coarse, dry, greying hair and this makes and look and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love that this oil makes my hair look shiny without making it look greasy.  I do use more than the two drops that the bottle recommends, but I see that as a starting point anyway.  Most people will probably need more than two, unless they have really short hair.  It&#x27;s definitely something you just have to figure out how much you need.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a powerful smell once it&#x27;s in your hair.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product after my hair sylist used it on me and gave me a sample.  I absolutely love the smell and it makes my hair nice and smooth.  I put it on before I blow-dry it and only a small amount is needed.  Otherwise, if you use too much, your hair looks greasy.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Amazing for your hair!!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone! It&#x27;s not oily at all!</li>
    <li> Ok this bottle is huge !! And beautiful glass ! U only use 2 to 3 drops per use and at that rate it could last me 5 years !&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and just makes my hair feel and look so healthy . I have blonde dyed hair very dry very brittle and this has made the ends and overall look amazing . Smells like patchouli !!! Yum&lt;br /&gt;Cool pump right in the top</li>
    <li> When you use to much it makes your hair look greasy - when you use the recommended amount 2 drops it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything - get the Diamond mask - much better than this oil.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> If you have very thin or fine hair, even the littlest amount will make you feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Love most Redken products but this isn&#x27;t for my hair type.</li>
    <li> smooths my hair and makes it so shiny and you only need a few drops I use it on damp hair before I blow dry and dry hair before I straighten</li>
    <li> Been using the oils from the department store and noticed a huge difference when I bought and tried this.  My hair rarely lays down flat at the end of a long day and doesn&#x27;t feel yukky.  Lotta bang for the buck in this one.  For my short do, recommended 2-4 drops... there is like a bazillion drops in this bottle!</li>
    <li> GET  A GREAT STYLIST AND THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS.SHOULD IMPRESS MOST</li>
    <li> I found this to be just OK. It helps put some life into my hair when it&#x27;s dry and helps it to dry softer and shinier when I use it in damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will order this again because it doesn&#x27;t do anything better than my argan oil hair treatment that is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> When I had my hair colored at the Hair Cuttery salon, they bleached my hair and damaged it. So I was looking for something to repair my damaged hair and found this product. When I read all the positive comments about this product I didnt believe it until I have tried it. It is amazing, it is not greasy and it makes my hair look smoother and more vigorous. Though the product is great but is pricey. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Light weight, smells light and leaves my hair feeling fantastic.  ALot of oils are too heavy (the Argans).  You do not need alot.  I use a little and it goes a long way.  I used it on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> It only takes two drops and my hair is shiny, soft, and stronger than ever.  I used this for 6 weeks and my hair grew so long because it wasn&#x27;t breaking off as much.  My hair stylist even noticed!  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot (2-3 drops) to get great results so the bottle will last you forever.  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I used way too much and it made my hair look oily. I&#x27;ve learned that you only have to use a very small amount, even for long thick hair, and it makes my hair behave. It cuts our frizz and smells great ,too. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through a sample in the mail which prompted me to purchase some for myself.  The scent is devine and it works awesome.  My hair feels and looks smooth and shiny.  Be careful not to over use it because if can leave your hair looking greasy if you put on to much.</li>
    <li> Really like the product.  Great price and good service.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing.My hair looks healthy and doesn&#x27;t appear dry anymore</li>
    <li> My hair has received a quintuple whammy of damage-- 1) a history of poor nutrition has caused brittle, dry, thin hair, 2) genetics have caused dry, brittle, thin hair, 3) coloring has caused brittle, dry, damaged hair, 4) poor habits of exposing my hair to hot water daily has caused brittle, dry, thin hair, and 5) wearing my hair in a ponytail has caused it to break off in spots. In other words, my hair is in bad shape. It is extraordinarily dry and brittle, and is so damaged that it is a ball of frizz almost all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though I have tried just about every product under the sun trying to repair the damage, or at least to prevent further damage. After trying just about every shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, hair mask, and post-washing treatment available, I fell in love with the Redken All Soft line of products and used them loyally for many, many months.  Last time I had my hair cut, though, the stylist used this Redken Diamond Oil Shatterproof Oil in my hair and I was FLOORED at how soft and NORMAL my hair looked and felt.  It was so remarkable that I didn&#x27;t even flinch when I heard the price of this treatment; I snatched it up straight away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use the Redken Diamond Oil in my hair at least twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I generally towel dry it and then let it air dry for about 10-15 minutes before I rub two or three drops of Redken Diamond Oil into my just-below-the-shoulder-length hair. I then let my hair air dry completely. The Diamond Oil allows my hair to air dry without become frizzy, and also allows my natural waves to be enhanced instead of being the catalyst for frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken Diamond Oil has a slight \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; scent, that compliments the yummy scent most of my other Redken products (primarily the \\&quot;All Soft\\&quot; line) has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken Diamond Oil is an oil, but it is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil, which means it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair LOOKING oily at all. I use a moderate amount, but my hair doesn&#x27;tlook oily unless I overdo it OR if I get the oil near my scalp.  I would STRONGLY suggest keeping the Diamond Oil at least several inches away from the scalp in order to avoid the hair looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken Diamond Oil is extremely pricey compared to some other similar products, but it is a FAR superior product to its look-alikes. It is a dry oil that SOFTENS hair, but does not weigh it down, that de-frizzes hair, but that does not lacquer hair in silicone.  Many products like this one are made of either a heavy oil OR a silicone product.  Redken Diamond Oil has neither the heavy oil nor the silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hightly recommend this product to anyone who has seriously damaged hair, as I do. It works well!</li>
    <li> It make your hair soft , shinny, and manageable. I don&#x27;t give it a 5 however because it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Really helps to repair my hair from damage of daily brushing. It smells wonderful and you don&#x27;t need much. I also use it for a deep conditioner, saturate the ends of your hair leave it in over-night and it does wonders to dry brittle ends.</li>
    <li> I only use three drops at a time and it really makes my below the shoulder length hair shine!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I know it&#x27;s a little pricey, but I usually use keratin oil that costs $8.00 a bottle and have to use A LOT more for half of the effect.  I have tried so many products and none of them compare to this stuff.  My hair is smooth, shiny and beautiful with all of the flyaways hidden or blended in.  BIG TIP:  Every product I have ever used says to just use a few drops or a dime sized amount and it is never enough for my thick, wavy, dry hair; I usually have to use way more, but this stuff....just use a small amount!  And don&#x27;t get it near your roots.  This is the 1st product that this has actually been true for my hair.  And it works so well that it is the only product I have to use on it, and with the small amount, the bottle will last for a very long time.  No more other oils or products, so even with the high price tag, I am actually saving money! Another thing:  the smell is not very feminine, at least to me, but once your hair is dry, you really can&#x27;t smell it, so it&#x27;s no big deal.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff!  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the results, the product is all it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried similar products, this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again in the distant future.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.......................</li>
    <li> ok if i mix it with conditioner. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful ! Just like a very expensive perfume. I have very fine hair, and the 1st time I applied it I got the wrong amount and my hair became heavy and greasy. The container is so beautiful !</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really makes my hair shiny and helps with frizz. It&#x27;s convenient in that you can use it when your hair is wet or dry!</li>
    <li> This is like perfume for your hair. I like the product, but I have fairly long hair and I shake out 5-7 drops vice the 3-4 recommended, and it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t feel much difference in my hair.  I guess it&#x27;s meant for short-haired or very fine/thin haired people. But it makes my hair smell good.</li>
    <li> smells nice but not for people with asthma...softens hair but i get better results with coconut oil...u get a nice big bottle and the bottle is pretty...u can apply on arms and legs...not just for hair...</li>
    <li> A little goes a long, long, long way!</li>
    <li> Just like any hair product, I guess it depends on your hair.  One reviewer says Redken Argan works better for her.  For me, the opposite is true!  My hair is naturally coarse, wavy and thick... very unruly!  My stylist gave me a sample vial of this when it came out thinking it would help me.  It helped better than anything else I have ever tried.  I use this after blow drying and styling.  It instantly tames my 1980&#x27;s looking hair!  Without it, I still have crazy hair no matter what technnique/product I try.  With it, I have sleek, shiny well behaved hair!  It is pricey, but worth every penny!  Redken is famous for discontinuing their best products, but I hope they keep this one or my crazy hair will be back for good!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long ways with this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses it so I was familiar with the product and wanted it for home.  Very satisfied and the delivery was as promised</li>
    <li> I use 4-5 drops of this with a dime-sized amount of leave-in conditioner after a shower. I then put my hair in a bun and take it out after it&#x27;s dried. I&#x27;ve noticed when I do this, my hair is extremely soft. I love the smell of this oil. It&#x27;s like pine trees and musk. It&#x27;s a little spendy but they give you a good amount in each bottle. It should last me at least a couple years. It also makes me feel special using it since it&#x27;s in a fancy diamond shaped bottle. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and the smell is not strong or offensive. 5 star product! I hope they always make this.</li>
    <li> the first time i used this stuff was at the salon when my hair stylist put some in my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how SOFT my hair was so I asked her \\&quot;how much is that?  I love it!\\&quot; She told me \\&quot;$40.00\\&quot; and I walked out of the salon without it. Went home and jumped on Amazon, found it, and for such an AWESOME price.  I just got it in the mail today and was so happy to have it.  It was packaged amazing and this is the real deal it is NOT a knock off.  After being ombre for 2 years my hair needs all the TLC it can get. Redken is AMAZING and my hair loves the DIAMOND OIL! Get it and you wont be sorry! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I put it on my hair at night and sleep in a satin cap. When I wash my hair in the morning, it feels stronger, thicker, silkier, and most of the frizz is gone.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD USE IT AFTER EVERY SHAMPOO MY HAIR IS EXTREMELY COURSE LIKE A BLACKS ALMOST BUT THIS DOES THE TRICK FOR ME</li>
    <li> This just makes my hair feel oily and tacky. I tried different ways of applying it from wet to dry to leaving it in, and washing it out right away, but I have yet to see &amp;#34;amazing results.&amp;#34; save your money and buy marrakesh products instead.</li>
    <li> Horrible for fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and brittle, so this product left my hair needing more &amp; more. It just wasn&#x27;t enough. It would be great for someone with normal hail.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I think the fact that this oil is actually a treatment oil is overlooked and I don&#x27;t know why. I mean, yeah its great for shine and to tame fly aways, but I rarely ever hear anyone talk about how this stuff is amazing on bleached and over processed hair. This is worth every penny and a tiny bit goes a long way. My 3.4 floz bottle has lasted me over a year. I still have a little under half of the bottle left. This smells amazing, too! Its a very luxe product. Definitely a must have! Here is a link to my full review on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fdAN8pPUMeg&amp;list&#x3D;UU0J9EjuD9YEALD9B_5IYIJA</li>
