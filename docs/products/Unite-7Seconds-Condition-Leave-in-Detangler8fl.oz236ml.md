<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair stylist recommended this to me, and I love it. Due to bleaching my hair (had to strip out some bad color with a &amp;#34;french wash&amp;#34;) I have some damage. So my hair breaks easily. I keep a bottle of this conditioner in the shower. As soon as I&#x27;m done showering, I spray this in my hair. Then I run my fingers through my hair (NO tangles!), press the water out of my hair, then wrap in a towel. It makes my hair so much softer &amp; more manageable. I do also use a regular conditioner in the shower too.</li>
    <li> pump did not work on bottle</li>
    <li> I love this detangler/leave in conditioner. It smells like heaven and keeps my (and my two girls) hair soft. I even spray it in sometimes on dry hair. I Just spray on my hands and smooth through ends.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is amazing. Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other spray on conditioners when I had difficulty finding this one, but I went right back to Unite 7 Seconds.  Works great on my long easily tangled hair.</li>
    <li> Best product for processed hair.</li>
    <li> makes my hair so soft!!! i really like this product. I would buy it and try it for sure - Carrie</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for the last two years. I have very long hair and this keeps it healthy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for probably 4-5 years and just love it.  Just a few spritzes after washing my hair and I can glide a comb right through it.  Without this stuff, I get tangles and breakage.  A bottle seems to last awhile too - you don&#x27;t really need to use very much.</li>
    <li> I have long hair extensions and it&#x27;s a must to use leave in to keep them in good condition longer... they get dry and split ends very easily so I&#x27;ve tried TONS of leave-ins.  My hair dresser had a sample of this and told me to try it.  I found it here on Amazon and it&#x27;s truly amazing! I also don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it greasy at all!  Conditions great and can still go two days in between washes!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long, fine hair. She&#x27;s six and plays like a six year old does, so there are always lots of really &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; knots in her hair if we leave it out. This product has saved both of our sanities. She used to cry when I approached her after her bath because she was so worried about me having to de-tangle her hair. Now we spray quickly, wait a bit and I brush it out - no problems no tears. Unite 7 Seconds is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product so soft</li>
    <li> Unite seven seconds is the BEST detangler/leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not heavy whatsoever and it does its job perfectly. My hair is very long and curly, and is naturally a mess when I get out of the shower. With a couple sprays of Unite, it becomes smooth, easy to brush and so soft. I usually blow dry my hair, and there is no noticeable build up on my hair after I style it. I give this stuff an A++++</li>
    <li> This is truly  amazing leave in detangler, and conditioner.  I am a freak about smell, and when I tell you it smells amazing..... it smells amazing.  love love love it!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed! Makes your hair super soft right away! And it smells so good! I have very long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. Each bottle lasts me 6 months or so. I do use a good amount (4-6 sprays), although I don&#x27;t need to use that much at all....I just cant get enough of the smell :) Love it! Every friend I have had try it, has ordered it the very next day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best leave-in for extensions!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would diminish static, and this works great! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty. I ordered it on a Friday evening and it arrived Monday. I&#x27;m really picky about hair products, but I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry hair much more manageable and silky feeling.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love how you can use this when your hair is wet, damp, or dry. It NEVER leaves that gross sticky feeling that some detanglers do. I only wish it came in a bigger size because I love it so much. When it gets down to the bottom of the bottle I pour a little water in it and shake it up, crazy..I know.. but it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dresser recommended this product after lots and lots of processing and trying to fix it with reprocessing and reprocessing. Just a few squirts into my hair and it&#x27;s soft and easily combed through. I would recommend this to anyone whose hair is coarse, over processed or tangles easily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this stuff. I know it is on the expensive side but believe me you will not be disappointed. 4 spritz&#x27;s of this secret potion and your brush will fly right through all of your tangles.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I spray it on my hair morning and night, gets the tangles out and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to all of my friends. It&#x27;s well worth the $$. I don&#x27;t shower without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product. I swim every day so my hair gets very dry. This product works great. Will buy again and again</li>
    <li> Must have product. I use it every time I shower.</li>
    <li> Does what it says . If you have dry hair like straw , try this product ! Makes your hair super soft.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter is Ethiopian and I have always been looking for the best leave in I can find and this one is at the top of my list!&lt;br /&gt;It makes teh comb slip throuhg her hair like buttah! Not one OUCH! since using this product. It is pricey but so worth it!</li>
    <li> the sprayer does not work, I requested two bottles and recieved only one that is defective and the other bottle is a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that gets very tangled. My stylist used this product on my hair and it seemed to work (and smell) great. I ended up buying it, as I was looking for something different than the Moroccan Oil I had been using, which seemed to weigh my hair down.  I am absolutely hooked on the Unite 7 Seconds Detangler.  I highly recommend it, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> #1it is made without testing on animals! !!! Works great amd smells great to :) Love the 7 second conditioner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years,  it is  the best. I&amp;#34;ve got my daughter and granddaughters using it, it makes detangling the hair  so easy.</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde hair and have to use a leave in conditioner instead of a conditioner in the shower which will weigh my hair down.  I used to use It&#x27;s a 10 religiously -- until I found this product!  It really does detangle your hair in 7 seconds and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I will never use another leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with very thick hair that I keep very long, and one of my annoyances has always been brushing my hair after a shower. This product is amazing though. The brush just glided through my hair after a few sprays. It also smells good too. Definitely recommend this if you have hair that is tangled after a shower.</li>
    <li> First tried this after a shower at a spa.  This is the BEST leave-in conditioner.  Incredible product for my fine, wavy-to-curly-hair.  Just a few sprays into the palm of my hand, and then gently rub it through my wet hair.  My hair then combs out easily.  It does not weigh down my fine hair.  Along with the other Unite products for volumizing, my hair is no longer a fuzzy, stiff halo.  It is smoother, feels soft, and looks better than it has ever looked. An absolutley INCREDIBLE product.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I ever purchased!!</li>
    <li> This has become an everyday accessory for me. I don&#x27;t use conditioner in the shower anymore. You only use to use a few pumps. Hair smells delicious and is very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Within 7 seconds tangles disappear and combing difficult tresses are a thing of the past.  Great product and price.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does help detangle hair, but it leaves behind some crunchiness.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have long blonde hair that comes down to my waist.  I don&#x27;t buy that it only takes 7 seconds to \\&quot;de-tangle\\&quot; your hair but this stuff is still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The routine I use:  I get out of the shower, wrap my head in the towel.  Put lotion on my face then Take the towel off my head and spray down my hair with this leave in conditioner.  I then brush my teeth, when I&#x27;m done I brush my hair and it&#x27;s not tangled at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, LOVE this stuff and will continue to purchase.  Well worth the price!  I&#x27;ve used it three days in a row and can tell a noticeable difference in the strength and health of my hair.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff!</li>
    <li> detangles in 7 second!</li>
    <li> My husband complained about the price of this product at first but when he used it on my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair he told me to buy a case of it!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair everyday!  I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s dry so my hair splits more easily.  Since using this I have noticed a lot less split ends.</li>
    <li> The best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve found. Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is salon quality and really relaxes my wavy hair when I blow dry it straight.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I have trouble keeping my fine hair moisturized without products weighing it down and making it flat. This product is amazing. Spray some on wet hair and blow dry. It protects your hair from heat damage and it DOES NOT weigh your hair down. Love it!</li>
    <li> Now sometimes I love it and sometimes I really like it. I&#x27;m not sure why the inconsistency, but overall not a bad product for my coarse and thick hair. I&#x27;m on my second bottle which says a lot in and of itself. If there is a better product out there I&#x27;d love to know because this is pricey and it doesn&#x27;t do well as a leave in for me. I only use it to detangle before I was my hair and I feel that I&#x27;m wasting the product that way. Will I continue to buy? For now, yes. If the price were reduced, will I always buy it? Yes, because it does a great job overall.</li>
    <li> This came in super fast and is used daily I my household.  Any person with long hair who wants to save time in the mornings, this is for you!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used.  Detangles but does not weigh hair down! Love it!</li>
    <li> All of Unites products are amazing. My stylist uses these and I use EVERYTHING she puts on my hair. Amazng</li>
    <li> Great detangler for my daughter&#x27;s curly long hair.</li>
    <li> It definitely untangles your hair and leaves it silky.  When I first used it, my hair took longer to dry (I have crazy curly tangled hair), but it was silky like a Pantene commercial! I think they are selling themselves short by calling it a \\&quot;detangler.\\&quot; It is a miracle product.  I received a free sample when I ordered something else and promptly went bananas and ordered a full size. It&#x27;s that good!!</li>
    <li> I have REALLY long fine hair and it takes me forever to brush out my hair I used this for the first time tonight and it ROCKS!!! It normally  take me 20 min to brush out my hair that&#x27;s how tangled it gets with this only a few mins I am so happy I am buying more I never want to run out of this. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ME :)</li>
    <li> It smells good that&#x27;s about it did not work for me definitely not worth $30! I&#x27;d be better off with coconut oil!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Detangles any mess I have in my hair (I have knots all the time). Protects your hair as well. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle this year. I used the first bottle quick because I like the smell so much it was like perfume for my hair. Best product ever!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from my hairdresser and immediately ordered the full size when it ran out. Makes my hair so much more manageable after showers and detangles like a dream. silky smooth and none greasy. it&#x27;s costly, but it truly improved the condition of my wavy, ever-color-changing hair.</li>
    <li> This is so greasy, it&#x27;s ridiculous. Spraying this anywhere aside from over a towel or carpet will wield slick, dangerous floors. It also didn&#x27;t help my tangles any more than a drugstore detangling spray, however the light scent is definitely a plus. Considering the price of this stuff, I&#x27;d had hoped for more than just scent to be an upside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the top came with a small crack (assuming from shipping) and leaked contents in the package. Had to transfer into another bottle to even use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair, works like magic!</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny! I have two daughters - my oldest has very thick, curly hair, while my youngest has fine, thin hair. I&#x27;ve been through many products, looking for a conditioner that would help stop my curly-haired daughter&#x27;s tears every time I tried to comb her hair. She would literally tell me to just not comb it because it hurt so much! With just a few sprays, this product softens your hair and makes it super easy to comb through. It is not heavy at all (a few sprays goes a long way), so it is just as effective on fine, thin hair! Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I will be back to get more. This really clears up the tangles and makes your hair feel so good and thick.</li>
    <li> This is a must for thick hair that takes forever to comb out after the shower!!!! Leaves my hair soft, conditioned, and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> At first when I used the product I thought it really make a huge difference, then I forgot to use 1 day and do not know how much this works?  I purchased mainly as my hair is longer and color treated, and tangles very easily.  I am still on the fence with this, and will continue to use, but so far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for years and it makes all the difference in the world on how my hair feels.</li>
    <li> I first started with a sample from my hairdresser.  Thought I loved it.  My hair has gotten much longer now (3 inches below my bra strap) and it works great for the ends but not for the top to middle of my hair.  It does smell great.  It seems a little slimy.  I am going to try Beauty Protector, Protect and Detangle and hopefully that will be a little better.  I love my other Unite products though!</li>
    <li> Works very well at getting snarls out of very fine hair</li>
    <li> I think this product smells slightly different from the one I purchased at my salon, it upsets me cause I paid the same price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from seller GSM King because my hair salon was out and I am sorry that I did. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old stock or a knockoff but it is not the same as the Unite7Seconds that I get from my local hair salon. It didn&#x27;t have the same consistency or fragrance and did not feel the same in my hair and did not produce the same results on my hair. I was finally able to pick up a bottle of this from my hair dresser and back to what I was expecting for results.</li>
    <li> Works well for de-tangling &amp; keeping ends from fraying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Love it.  I would give it 5 stars only because I still think it should be priced lower.</li>
    <li> My hair is as tangly a they come and this product is the only one on the market that actually works, it has made brushing my hair a dream!</li>
    <li> I use this every day before I brush my hair.  I spray my hair thoroughly and wait a few seconds before brushing it out.  Then I apply some &amp;#34;Unite Luxury Argan Oil&amp;#34; before I blow dry my hair. I don&#x27;t always use the Argan Oil, but I ALWAYS use the 7 Seconds Leave in Detangler.  My hair is much softer and sleeker because of it.</li>
    <li> i have relatively thin straight hair and this is literally the only reason I am able to brush my hair when its wet. doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy afterwards either.</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly thick and tangles easily. This product is great at allowing me to get a comb through it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and I love it. Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Lightweight.  Great has heat protection.I am never without this product.  I highly recommend to anyone with all hair types damaged or not you will love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural detanglers to detangle the dry hair we have and decided to go with this after lots of screaming from my kiddo. It worked in seconds and smelled to high heaven forever after. Less perfume!!!! Please!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I had to switch from using oily hair products, but wanted to keep the great detangling aspect that oil hair products had to offer. THIS IS THE SOLUTION. I have very long and thick hair, so I cannot wash it every day. I use this product after I shower (and shampoo) every other day. It leaves my hair feeling silk without the oily scalp. The product feels like it has oil in it, but it is very light. This is absolutely a necessity for anyone with thick hair. I used to spend hours ripping through my wet hair with a brush (which is not good, as it pulls your hair out). This product makes it feel like brushing through butter.</li>
    <li> This is my new conditioner! I only use this after showering for my conditioner. It has done wonders for having thinner hair that was never full. Put life back into my hair! I love this line of products, thankful my hairstylist pointed  them out to me!</li>
    <li> It really helps to detangle my hair, making combing out my hair after a shower a lot easier.  Plus, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and have tried many leave in conditioners.  My hairdresser introduced this stuff to me about 4years ago and I only buy this and will continue.  The minute you put it in it is soooo easy to brush your hair and you can even use it the next day on dry hair for touch up</li>
    <li> This product really does deliver! I usually dread the after wash detangling session but this has really cut down on the combing time. I have thick, course, mid back length curly hair and this gave me hope in gaining length since my hair tends to get matted. Now I can finger comb in the shower before I spray this on and comb it through without losing as much hair and dealing with a ripping sound. I will get more when this runs out, too bad it&#x27;s so pricy but worth it. I just hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get resistant to it like it does with other products.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, not super curly as some of the other reviewers, but I love the finish 7 Seconds gives my hair.  I use Unite Expanda Volume Spray and then 3-4 spritzes of this Leavein Detangler.  The combination gives me body along with softness in my dry ends.</li>
    <li> This leave-in condition works great! I sprayed a few sprays into my towel-dried hair, combed through and left to air dry. My hair felt noticeably softer and silkier after using this product. The only downside is that it makes your floors and counters super slippery from the spray. I&#x27;d suggest covering your floor with a mat or towel before spraying onto your hair.</li>
    <li> makes my hair soft and conditions nicely</li>
    <li> The product did arrive, very happy with it, shipping took a while.</li>
    <li> best detangler conditioner out there. It smells FANTASTIC. I don&#x27;t wear perfume or lotions and people comment on how I smell good. Thanks unite!</li>
    <li> Best leave-in ever.  Makes hair so soft, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, somewhat thin hair and only 3 short sprays is all I need for conditioning. After spraying, a brush just glides thru my hair. Volume is important to me, but this conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I have short hair but a lot  of it and I also have it colored so my hairdresser gave me a same of this and said it would protect it while using my blow dryer.  Frankly I thought it was kinda a joke as it looks like water .  Since I am older and no longer have oily hair I have been using shampoo for colored hair and a conditioning balm to soften my hair.  WOW---this stuff is awesome.  It truly not only does a great job on detangling thick hair but I can&#x27;t honestly remember my hair being this soft in years!!!  It does a great job for all of us who use a blow dryer for daily use.  You just gotta use this----it is worth every cent you spend on it!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, best price is on amazon and I do not have to struggle to brush my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. The 2 bottles I ordered were sent wrapped in bubble  wrap and mailed in a plastic envelope:  bottles were wet when they arrived, some product seeped out--shipping in a box would be optimal.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, makes my hair soft--regardless of the shampoo or conditioner I used. Best hair product to date! Thank you, Unite!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My hair has never felt so soft and it really detangles that fast!!! Truly an amazing product. I&#x27;ve even be using generic shampoo and my hair feels gross till I put this on! Can&#x27;t wait to try more products! It also smells great!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good detangler for my thick, curly hair. I am so glad I found this product on here!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product. If you have fine hair that tangles easily this product is the BEST. I have a daughter with a sensitive scalp and hair that tangles instantly, this is the only way we can comb through her hair. The product is light, smells nice and leaves her hair shiny once dry, not greasy &amp; weighed down. Worth the $.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t see a massive difference after using this with my hair but I DID feel that my hair was softer and felt less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still damaged but this product helped it feel less damaged and gave a soft texture to my hair rather than a brittle one!</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years and it is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s harder to find so I went to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Usually buy at a store, but better pricing from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Smells great &amp; leaves my hair soft n conditioned but not heavy &amp; weighed down. I have used it for 2 yrs. as I have all the Unite products</li>
    <li> I have never had such an easy time detangling my waist length hair -which happens to be very fine and to tangle easily. This product leaves it super smooth and my comb slips through with no struggle. My hairstylist recommended it a few months ago along with the Unite Blonda Shampoo and I&#x27;ve been using ever since.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anybody male or female, long or short hair it is the most incredible hair care conditioner I have ever used in my life. I have had long hair all of my life natural curly crazy coarse hair. If ONLY I had had this when I was back in my teens, and early younger years. I have been using this now for about 15 yrs and I could NOT have my long now shiny hair if it was not for this 7 second dream mist. I love the smell totally addicting but the results are A+++++++!!! Best of anything and I have tried them all !!! Hooked for life and it helps my hair stay conditioned through hi lights and or blow outs, straightening Irons etc. Rock on and never stop making this hair crack! Forever yours UNITE!!!  XO LOVE LOVE LOVE A MUST HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. I have tried this on my husband, guy friends, girlfriends and just blow mind wowza for all!! It fixes anything that needs fixing dryness, split ends, softens, and comb outs are  ten times easier too~ Thank you to this company.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling soft and amazing</li>
    <li> My hubs has a pony tail to his waist and couldn&#x27;t live without this conditioner!  We&#x27;ve tried about a zillion other kinds, but this is the only one that really works.</li>
    <li> I have thick long coarse hair and it does detangle but you need to rise it off after because it tends to dry up your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it religiously to easily control my tangles.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker!  I have long thick naturally wavy hair that is dyed.  It tangles so bad!  Once I spray this in I am able to brush it with no problem!  This product was worth every cent!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and works really well. I have shoulder length hair so can&#x27;t speak for how well it works on longer hair but it works great for me. I spray it on my damp hair and then just let it air dry- no tangles for me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! leaves your hair soft!!!</li>
    <li> A quick couple of sprays, even after my hair is blown dried, and it nourishes the little dry ends.  I always have this on hand.</li>
    <li> This is the best detangler I have ever come across.  Well worth the money.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This product Works so well. My daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I brush her hair. It is Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Unite products, so I had high hopes for this leave-in detangler.  I had to use more than what&#x27;s recommended on the directions (4-5 pumps), I have to use more like 7-10, but I also have long hair, so it was to be expected.  This stuff really does detangle in about 7 seconds.  The first time I used it, I left it in about 10 seconds and it was pretty impressive.  I towel dry, spritz, do my make up (about 3 minutes) then brush it out and there are no rips or tears.  I also find that it controls frizz very well.  Very happy with this product! I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s quite pricey, but I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Buy this now if you have frizzy dry hair from damage, this is the best product to repair your hair. It works instantly making your hair soft shiny and healthy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past few years.  It is AMAZING!  My hair is thick and curly and I live in a dry climate, which wreaks havoc on my hair.  The Unite 7 seconds conditioner is my only savior.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and am very happy to have found it on Amazon.  I have naturally curly hair and it keeps it straight if I blow it dry and curly if let it dry naturally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivered within 3 days of ordering!</li>
    <li> I honestly cannot imagine not using this every day. Literally only needs 7 seconds on your head before your hair becomes so easy to brush. Honestly what got me hooked, though, was the smell. It&#x27;s so fresh smelling, smells like you are right in the salon. Love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. One of my best friends gifted me a sample of this and it&#x27;s amazing! I have extremely curly hair that knots very easily. This stuff helps my brush just glide through my hair after the shower. I highly recommend pairing it wth a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush, it&#x27;llchange your life and save you lots of time!</li>
    <li> Truly my FAVE as far as leave in conditioners go! I have used this for years now and never get sick of it. I have changed and tried more expensive brands (albeit this is not cheap either), and this is by-far the best! I have ever used! It never leaves a residue, doesn&#x27;t weigh down or dull the hair. Also - it smells great!</li>
    <li> Does this work on African American relaxed hair? I am looking for a great leave in detangling moisturizer to help untangle my hair after shampooing the chlorine out of my hair from a day in the pool. My hair is long and comes out from too much pulling to comb it through.</li>
    <li> After reading all the amazing reviews I decided to purchase this product. I was very disappointed with it. I have normal thickness straight long hair but I have a lot of hair and once I started coloring it I find it gets extremely matted and hard to detangle after I wash it. I was really hoping this product would be the solution to my tangled hair problem and sadly it was not! It did not detangle my hair very well and I barely noticed a difference compared to not using any leave in conditioner and trying to brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very worst thing about the product is that if I sprayed it anymore than 2 times on my hair, once it dried my hair would feel and look oily and as if my hair was dirty. A few times I had to take another shower and wash the product out because of how oily it made my hair look.  I didn&#x27;t get through half the bottle and threw it out. As noted in my title if you have straight normal to fine hair SKIP THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the spray mechanism on the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work, so I&#x27;m not 100% happy.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  I have long fine hair, which I am trying to grow out even longer, and frequently use heat products (blow dryer, curling iron, straightening iron) that damages hair.  The detangler keeps my hair healthy despite this...detangler is certainly a misnomer, as it REALLY improves hair&#x27;s quality.  My hair is left soft and ultra manageable.  And while its a bit pricey, it lasts a very long time.  I use this daily, and have been using the same bottle for nearly 3 months.</li>
    <li> Especially if you partake in activities which cause your hair to become tangled and matted. Prior to discovering 7 second conditioner, I&#x27;d lose handfuls of hair and experience breakage on a level which made me question whether or not my hobbies were actually worth going bald over. With this product, i no longer feel torn between 2 of my favorite things; one being my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also a good thermal protectant.</li>
    <li> Best smelling, don&#x27;t need a lot, makes hair super soft!</li>
    <li> Love it. This is my favorite on my long thick hair. Really does the job.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and this is by far the best product I have ever found for it. Works exactly as advertised. Spray on, wait 7 seconds, brush through. WOW! My hair is soft all day. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  It really does detangle quickly. Helps keep hair free of static.</li>
    <li> When they say 7 seconds they really mean it! This is my 4th bottle of this stuff and I swear by it. Leaves my hair without tangles and it is smooth after a few seconds. I normally don&#x27;t splurg on hair products but this ois the only one I will. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and is very good for curly hair. IT holds the shape of my curls without any stickiness.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this stuff as I have tried many products to smooth and hydrate my mid-back length dry hair and nothing has blown me away. It worked ok, but not any better than cheaper drugstore leave in conditioners. Not sure if I will use the rest of the bottle or toss it.</li>
    <li> Love this detangler, it&#x27;s amazing! I have natural curly hair and before my hair used to break a lot. not it&#x27;s much easier to brush my hair! The only con was the price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! From going brunette to really blonde my hair has been impossible to brush while wet, 7 Seconds makes it so I can!</li>
    <li> Wow a product that actually as described. Going to shop the rest of they&#x27;re line!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite detangler.  It is works quickly and leave my hair smooth.  I just can&#x27;t quite believe the price and don&#x27;t understand why it is so darn expensive.</li>
    <li> My daughters love the smell.  The first use, the tangles were east to take out.  I would have given 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t work after the first use.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner/detangler! Does exactly what it says it will do. It&#x27;s light and leaves hair soft and manageable. Love this product.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has doubts about this product working, put them aside! This item smells amazing, i get constant compliments on my hair smelling good after it, and it works like magic. 7 seconds is all you really need to let it work and your hair brushes over sooooo smoothly. My hair dresser used it on me, and now i&#x27;ve bought bottle after bottle.</li>
    <li> Perfect conditioner for fine hair! I would recommend to anyone with fine, soft hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down but detangles without any breakage, Quick shipping from seller.....</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  It works great and take out most of the tangles.  Better than anything else I hav eused.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best hair care product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using normal conditioner and only apply this after a freshly shampooed head, fresh out the shower! The smell, the feel and the shine of my hair is unmatched and I am in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by an acquaintance with rave reviews. I like the scent of Unite but it isn&#x27;t the best&lt;br /&gt;leave in I&#x27;ve used. It works good enough for me though!</li>
    <li> My cousin told me about this product.  It was so expensive at the salon, but I happen to see it on Amazon for a great price so I decided to try it.  It works like majic and does not way my hair down or leave it greasy.  I love this!!!</li>
    <li> Hair de tangles very quickly feels soft and has lots of shine</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Have been using for a long time.. a couple of sprays, leave in and my wild hair is tamed.  Have curly hair, so it is still curly, but looks healthy.. feels soft.. thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased it directly from their website therefore I am sure I wasn&#x27;t scammed. My hairdresser recommended it saying that it is the absolute best thing ever; sadly I have to say this product was a waste of money...Walmart carries better stuff than this!</li>
    <li> Detangled my crazy wavy hair in no time! A must try. Use on damp hair with a comb and gently comb the product through. Volia!</li>
    <li> I have tried many leave-in hair conditioners/detanglers and this is the only one that I love. It even works great with my hair extensions. The smell is lovely and it does not weigh my hair down or leave it greasy. I will most likely buy this product for the rest of my life! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It makes my hair feel so soft and doubles as a great heat protectant for blow drying.</li>
    <li> Softens my hair and smells great! I like to spray it generously onto my wet hair and then coil it into a bun. Hair comes out with beautiful waves, texture and smell :)</li>
    <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years . It really works.</li>
    <li> This product works as stated. What&#x27;s nice about it is that it is a non-rinse detangler. I was using a great detangler but my hair would look super flat the rest of the day as it was so relaxed. This helps me remove tangles at a fraction of the time without it. I will buy again. I only gave it four stars due to the perfumy scent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love perfume... my perfume. I wish it were unscented for this reason.</li>
    <li> Best detangler ever.Recommened by my stylist cos of hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  I am African American with very tight coily hair.  This product moisturizes my hair without a lot of product buildup.</li>
    <li> I have curly &amp; thick hair and this brand/type of product works great for my hair and curls! I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product from the salon but thought I could get it cheaper on-line.  This was much thicker than normal and appeared like it was old and had been sitting around for a while.  I would have returned it but didn&#x27;t have time around the holidays.  I would not  buy this product on-line again.</li>
    <li> I spray my hair and wait about 20 seconds and I can brush my hair without any pain. This smells amazing. Pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> I used to use this product in a salon I worked in. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere. I was happy to find it on amazon; although, the price is kinda high. The smell is amazing. It works miracles. I don&#x27;t comb my dry/bleached hair without a few spritzes of this first. The mist is very fine. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite. I use it every day and it does not weigh it down at all. Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft, similar to that when I have my hair blown out in the salon. The price on Amazon is much more reasonable that the mark up in the salon. LOVE this product</li>
    <li> Yes its good detangular for hair after bath&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell and i will keep buying it for my hair and i advice any one to try it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it. I purchased few times already, my daughter and my mom also really liked.  This product leave our hair very soft and smooth, easy to brush.</li>
    <li> This is another of Unite&#x27;s products that I can&#x27;t do without. It adds a nice finish to my hair, which I wear straight. It keeps it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My hair looked amazing after I used this. Lots of body and smooth as silk</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product! I cannot say enough. I bleach my hair blonde and it still looks great while using this product. Without it I cannot even comb my hair, and it looks terrible. Love love love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was given a sample bottle at the salon and just purchased it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t spray it directly in my hair, but into my hands (3-4 pumps )and then run my hands through my hair. I also use this for my daughter.  What I especially love about this product is that I&#x27;ll use it on dry hair too- spraying the product in my hands and through my/my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It tames frizz on dry windy days and still detangles morning bed head! I will always continue to refill the sample bottle and carry it in my purse.  This stuff is amazing and it smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I have long,dry, curly hair and it gets all knotted up. It is slowly beginning to dread. Tried this product and it didn&#x27;t help detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely great, and now i can&#x27;t live without it.  Every time i wash my hair I spray it on and I am extra conditioned and my long hair doesn&#x27;t tangle.  Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally course. I got a perm last year and it&#x27;s half way grown out. It&#x27;s frizzy where the perm was. When I use this detangler my hair feels soft with perfect waves, not heavy at ALL. I love it. I have to use a lot, I&#x27;ve gone through the bottle in 2 months! I have thought about trying a cheaper detangler but I can&#x27;t imagine finding one more perfect. It makes my hair look very healthy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about styling it, I just let it be naturally beautiful. I also like to use CHI Kerotein spray, but that&#x27;s just for hair health reasons. This detangler is a 7 second miracle all on it&#x27;s own!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the amazing comments I thought I would give it a try. Honestly, I don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t notice any significant change in my hair. I could have done without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using It&#x27;s a Ten Miracle hair treatment for a month now and love the way it shines my hair.  It&#x27;s fantastic and just for fun yesterday, I switched and put this in my hair after I got out of the shower before blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blows It&#x27;s a Ten out of the water.  My new boyfriend said I look hot, and I think it was because of how my hair looked. It has body, shine, texture, stays where I put it, is thick and absolutely gorgeous.  Even the color is more pretty. It took out the harsh color and now is a soft prettier blond.  My hair was perfection, and the next day it still looked good and fell into place by itself as soon as I got up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This adds protein.  My hair looks like it&#x27;s the healthiest hair in the world when I use this.  My stylist insisted that this was the one to get and she was right.  I had stopped using this a few months ago when I got some new products and now that I see this in action,  I won&#x27;t go back.  I was about to get another bottle of It&#x27;s a Ten, which is a truly amazing product, but after seeing the results with this, I will stay with this as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well \\&quot;instantly\\&quot; conditioning my hair which is damaged by coloring.  Can be used every morning without requiring washing, conditioning &amp; rinsing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! Have not heard of it before so must have been a well kept secret. It truly works with great slip to make combing easy and really silky. Being a product junkie I got the shampoo down, but am always looking for the perfect conditioner to give me that Pantene commercial look of healthy silk looking hair. This is a great choice.</li>
    <li> Great product that detangles and conditions.  Leaves my curly locks very soft.  I have bought this from a very high end salon but found it less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave in products I&#x27;ve ever used. The price is good too. Love it love it</li>
    <li> Pricey for leave in conditioner which made me not reorder.. But if it&#x27;s in your price range I definitely recommend it. My hair stylist uses it in her salon and also on herself. It&#x27;s nice and light weight but works! I have long &amp; fine hair which can get tangled as I have a lot of it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now. It is wonderful for detangling my 8 year old&#x27;s thick, waist-length hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. Especially in the summertime with ocean water, sun, chlorine, etc. it detangles like no other leave in conditioner has done for me before. I heard about it after getting my hair done on newbury st. and the stylist couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair, which is a norm for me. After using this stuff she combed my hair without too much of problem, at that point I decided I needed this stuff for myself. Works great &amp; I would definitely recommmend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever, the ultimate all-in-one! It detangles, conditions, and acts as a heat protectant! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is my NEW favorite leave-in conditioner. My stylist actually gave me a couple mini samples, and I just fell in love with it. I had problems with the ends of my hair being dry (I am active, workout and wash hair semi-often, as well as swim - getting chlorine exposure, etc.) and I before was using the &amp;#34;Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Leave In Conditioner&amp;#34; which I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product my hair has been a LOT softer, I&#x27;m growing my hair out even longer so I wanted to keep it healthy! I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> NOT AUTHENTIC!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this staple in my beauty routine.  Light weight and does the job beautifully.  Not as laden with chemicals as other beauty products.  I prefer fragrance free products, but this one is beautifully lightly scented.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner / detanger is life changing!  I have very long hair that has some wave.  Brushing my hair after showering was a nightmare and could take 10 minutes before I purchased this spray.  I absolutely love this detangler!!  It now takes just a minute or two to brush through my hair after showering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this detangler for several years and love it! I have dry, colored hair and this is one of the few products that has helped. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner!  No need to rinse it out het it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  Perfect for fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my daughters unruly hair.  Its much better than the general children&#x27;s spray detangler.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! AWESOME! GREAT AND FAST! I was so happy with this purchase! Thanks again, so very much! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Yes. This is the greatest conditioner on the planet. It saved my hair from getting baled. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this leave in conditioner. It detangles (I am tender headed, so that&#x27;s a big plus for me) and leaves my hair smooth and silky without weighing it down or making it greasy. I am not so impressed with some of their other products (ie, the dry shampoo), but I really love this product.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this leave in conditioner and I&#x27;m glad I tried it! Love the smell, it works well as a detangler (I have super curly hair) and adds a light layer without weighing my hair down (I also have fine hair). I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great!  You just spray it on and continue to style your hair.  Just a little goes a long way.  very good product.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says it does- everyone loves my waist-length hair! I will be using this product for life!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this and was almost certain I would love it. I have fine long blonde hair that runs a little on the dry side due to color. This leave-in smells great but made my hair feel dried out and not soft or silky AT ALL!! I&#x27;ve used other high end leave-ins that truly do leave my hair looking/feeling silky soft and smooth. I will just stick to those products that work for me! I will never buy this again nor do I recommend it! Not impressed!</li>
    <li> I use several unite products and love the quality and scent of them all. I have wavy / frizzy hair and this helps to calm it down. I love to mix this with the lazier straight and I can just let it air dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using Unite products for years. I have very curly hair, so when I get out of the shower,&lt;br /&gt;Even after using, Unite, Smoothing Conditioner, I use 7 Second LEAVEIN Conditon Detangler. This product does a perfect job!&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue, you only need a few sprays over your wet hair, I work it through with my fingers, comb and I am done!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my grand daughter when she comes for a sleepover.</li>
    <li> Light and adds a lot of shine. It takes very little to get this result</li>
    <li> Because the ingredients for this product were not available I bought this product not realuzing all of the parabans and silicones that are included. Havent really used it since I dont use sulfate shampoos and you cant remove silicones without sulfate.</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;grey market&amp;#34;. It has been relabeled. It&#x27;s a fake. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore. Just spray on, run my fingers thru my hair to spread it around, and dry. Even using hairspray, my hair isn&#x27;t dry and stiff feeling. Hair shines. Even my husband uses it and the frizzies are gone. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is so good!  Smells amazing and works wonders on my hair.  Don&#x27;t listen to the &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a fake product&amp;#34; comments because it&#x27;s not...I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve been wasting their money on but this is the real deal and is one of the best leave in products I have ever tried on my hair.</li>
    <li> I used to be a hair product junkie.  Not anymore!  I have been using only this for a couple years now and it&#x27;s fabulous.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny and healthy.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> Unite is an amazing brand!! I regularly use the 7 seconds and I love it!! Usually buy it at the Solon but thought I would save a few bucks and get it on Amazon!! Very happy and it&#x27;s definitely the real deal!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> This product works well for me. It smells good. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. Here are four more words.</li>
    <li> The best detangler I have tried on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair; cuts right through the tangles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of highlights and I have been using it&#x27;s a Ten leave in spray which works well but I bought this just to try it and my hair felt some what like my hair feels leaving the salon great product! Don&#x27;t waste your money on multiple products when all your hair needs is this and it does it all of course a good blowdryer is also needed as well however great product!! Leaves hair soft and shinny!! Will definitely be using this from now on!! The results were well worth the price!! Edit: been using this product for a year almost and I still love the results I ordered a few Oribe products and none of them even come close to this product! All I need is this and I&#x27;m good to go</li>
    <li> Always looking for new products and this one is amazing. If you want a nice leave in that does NOTTTTT leave residue and does not leave hair greasy this is a must!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says.  It really detangles within 7 seconds and it smells so good.  The scent is hard to describe, is like some fresh smelling shampoo. This product will definitely replace my It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair Very shiny and detangles easily. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this detangler for several years on my very fine, curly hair. It helps detangle my hair very much. It&#x27;s the best conditioning detangling I&#x27;ve found. Leaves my hair shiny. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I like that it is also a heat protectant. Smells great too. I can go on and on😊!&lt;br /&gt;I just hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love the product but not the price. It is hard to find this product in Florida salons though. Needs to be more available.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and has been through countless dye jobs, curling irons, hard water, the works. This is the first detanglet I&#x27;ve ever used that actually made a noticeable difference in my hair. Not only right after I shower, but keeps my hair tangle free all day, and even through the night. Worth the money, it smells nice and fresh too.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated and super fizzy hair. I LOVE this stuff, I put it on when I get out of the shower and it helps hydrate my natural waves. It helps control my frizz and it makes my hair super soft. I can tell the difference when I have forgotten to spray it because it would naturally feel more &#x27;straw&#x27;-like. Just remember to shake the bottle well, its always good to get ALL the contents mixed together so it works like it should. I&#x27;m going to purchase my second bottle today!</li>
    <li> I have two young daughters and I have tried many detanglers, consequently spending a lot of money only to discover they all fail to detangle. Unite is expensive, but worth it. No more tears and my girls love it!</li>
    <li> This product worked great for detangling my hair and it smells great! The only downside is the cost but I think it is totally work it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with thick afro-like 4C hair.  I have sensitive skin.  I used this product one time and into the trash it went.  Detangling properties?  Meh.  I&#x27;ve had better.  I don&#x27;t get what the other reviewers are talking about.  Maybe my hair was just too thick for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the meat of my review.  After using this product, I broke out into an itchy, red, enflamed, bumpy RASH on my neck, shoulders, back and frame of my face.  Pretty much everywhere my hair touched my skin.  I was miserable.  I had to wash it out immediately and re-do my hair.  NO bueno.  BEWARE those with sensitive skin.  Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Love Love this 7 seconds!!  You just put a few squirts on and the comb goes through your hair like butter.  So recommend it!</li>
    <li> The best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve come across</li>
    <li> I hair course thick wavy/curly hair that snarels very easy. After I started using it I have been getting so many compliments. They say my hair  looks so healthy. It is a great detangler!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It makes my hair silky smooth and shiny.  It also helps with frizz. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I have tried many leave in conditioners in my day and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Use it once, you will love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the vampire diaries star Nina,D promoted it in her interview! Her hair is so shiny ..guess what she didn&#x27;t lie. She should be a spokeswoman</li>
    <li> This works great on fine hair that tangles especially when wet. However, I hardly use this anymore since I started using the Acure Conditioner. Now that is an amazing NATURAL product...smooth, tangle-free hair without the weight of a heavy conditioner.</li>
