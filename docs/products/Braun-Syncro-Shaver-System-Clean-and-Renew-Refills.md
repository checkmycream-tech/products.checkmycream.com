      <li>Happy Shaving Guys!</li>
      <li>This is a very good value for 3, but is still $5+ each.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great shaving system and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it</li>
      <li>Also the refill keeps the moving parts lubricated so they work great.    </li>
      <li>These refills works great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
      <li>It does work great.  </li>
      <li>Braun shavers work great</li>
      <li>Braun does a great job on the usability and industrial engineering.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>cleaning system works great.  </li>
      <li>And it works amazingly well!  </li>
      <li>The cleaning system does a great job and is superior to the Norelco automatic cleaning design.</li>
      <li>But one the liquid dries, the shaver has a pleasant aroma.  </li>
      <li>It must be a good product but what to do about it?</li>
      <li>My razor hums, does a good shaving job</li>
      <li>I will continue purchasing them, even if they are fairly pricey.     </li>
      <li>They do a nice job and smell quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Effectively Cleans&lt;br</li>
      <li>OK guys you already know you love this product but the great thing about ordering from Amazon</li>
      <li>Very easy to insert, use, and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver.</li>
      <li>This is the best price I have seen on these items, and I have ordered before on E Bay for more cost, so I really stocked up here.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s even more cost-effective.  </li>
      <li>The shaver gets super clean and smells great after a cleaning session.  </li>
      <li>I set it to 3 months (about when I&#x27;ll need more refills).</li>
      <li>but I am sure I will never buy from them again.</li>
      <li>I understand some of you guys might have to shave more often and disinfect the shaver more often also.  </li>
      <li>Lubricates&lt;br /&gt;The residual lubricant can be felt on the shaver head if you run your finger through the top and sides of the shaving head.</li>
      <li>I have no problem with the product, in fact love them with three boys/men in the house</li>
      <li>You definitely need to shop around for the best deals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I am frequently able to find these refills at CVS &amp; Target, there have been a number of times when they were out/unavailable.  </li>
      <li>However, electric shavers have greatly improved in recent years, and the new Brauns are about the greatest shavers on the market today.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to replace the refills.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m reading through some of these reviews and most are happy with the razor but incensed at the cost of the cleaning fluid.  </li>
      <li>have not tried any of the newer Braun models, as my 7-year-old Syncro is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>My dad has had his Braun shaver for over 20 years, and it still works as good as new.  </li>
      <li>Once a week has been fine for me for about seven years.  </li>
      <li>I was under the impression that items offered with Amazon Prime were all available for the 2 day or 1 day shipping</li>
      <li>Therefore I am eligible for a discount and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>( Remington Shaver Saver works great for this mid week tune up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So for me the cost of the refills is worth a healthy skin.</li>
      <li>alcohol solution has a light lemon scent and an oily consistency.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that my shave wasn&#x27;t as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.    </li>
      <li>Please it give you free shipping.</li>
      <li>Not very happy with Amazon on this one even though for the most part, Prime membership has been awesome.</li>
      <li>I guess you could clean another shaver daily, but the Clean and Renew is about the best way I have seen to maintain a consistently close shave.  </li>
      <li>cleaning solution contains just the right proportion of alcohol to lubricant ratio to achieve just the right viscosity for effective cleaning.</li>
      <li>for having a hygenic, clean razor - it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
      <li>I have always noticed one thing, after every clean</li>
      <li>Clean your razor once a week.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to pull out the cutter block (blade cartridge) and clean that too.  </li>
      <li>Just to give you an idea, I normally clean my shaver every 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>In between, I thoroughly clean my shaver about once a week thoroughly with the brush.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves having a clean fresh razor every time he shaves an this is the easy way to get it.</li>
      <li>Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills cleans, lubricates, and sanitizes all in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can be like me and simply clean your razor manually.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking it apart and clean the shaving head.  </li>
      <li>Just clean the blade periodically with the brush that comes with the shaver.  </li>
      <li>And yes, after each time I use the Clean &amp; Renew Refill -</li>
      <li>So your cost to keep your razor clean and lubricated, automatically, works out to about five dollars every month.  </li>
      <li>My suggestion is clean your shaver as thoroughly as you can.  </li>
      <li>The Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills cleans, lubricates, and sanitizes all in one step.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily clean the razor after each use.</li>
      <li>Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I spend about 13 cents a day to clean it.  </li>
      <li>You might as well take a $5 bill and send it directly to Braun, maybe with a nice note:</li>
      <li>To prevent too much shaving debris from collecting in the cartridge, I brush the cutter and the top of the shaver under the foil before cleaning.</li>
      <li>Like other reviews here, I found that these refills work great and really clean your razor</li>
      <li>This cartridge will fit even the early model Syncros, all the way to the latest Pulsonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;The highly volative alcohol evaporates fairly quickly, especially in hot weather.</li>
      <li>The price of these replacement cartridge may be high, but the cartridge do a bang-up job of cleaning, lubricating, and sanitizing your shaver head!</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as it should (with the price I paid for my shaver), the product itself and ease of installation is excellent.</li>
      <li>I clean my razor using the cartridge daily now because time is more important to me</li>
      <li>This is a pretty straightforward item.</li>
      <li>I top mine off with standard rubbing alcohol and has worked fine for years (yes and still somehow retains that lemony smell)</li>
      <li>Braun makes great shavers but shame on them for this environment waste.....</li>
      <li>and sometimes I add a touch of pre-electric save for lubricant and fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every 13 pennies to me.</li>
      <li>when you have a dedicated cleaning system, right?</li>
      <li>price of these replacement cartridge may be high, but the cartridge do a bang-up job of cleaning, lubricating, and sanitizing your shaver</li>
      <li>A $65-70 a year estimate is fair, which boils down to about $5.50 a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But still, it is nice to be able to simply use your razor, place it in the cleaning stand, and then have it ready for you the next day, with no effort on your part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But considering the alternative of having to spend the time and manually clean the shaver like I used to do with my old Norelco, it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>After trying it for the first time though, I was hooked.</li>
      <li>First of all...</li>
      <li>(if your interested you can find instructions via a Google search).</li>
      <li>This is the first time I am going to order a refill after 6 months of use.  </li>
      <li>Yes if you use any electric shaver for a prolonged time, they do get hot, and the friction will give your skin a burn.    </li>
      <li>Lets see, I have been an avid braun fan since I started shaving.</li>
      <li>Most important of all - when not in use, take out the refill from the unit, and close it tight with the snap on lid that cames with it.  </li>
      <li>Over the average of 30 days (I do clean mine every day and love it that way...</li>
      <li>I shave daily and clean two or three times a week, so I get about 2 months out of a full cartridge.  </li>
      <li>, you get a clean close shave, and these cleaning systems really keep the shaver running like new.     </li>
      <li>A problem arises however, when the solution registers low on the cleaning unit - the solution becomes more viscous from the lubricant, and the solution becomes less effective in cleaning the shaving head.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer.</li>
      <li>Each Sunday morning I open the razor, brush it with the included brush, put it on the cleaner/charger and enjoy the fresh smell Monday morning.  </li>
      <li>I have the Braun 9595 (my first \\&quot;real electric razor\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>the shaver does smell fresh and new.</li>
      <li>Not only did it not shave closely, I also had to physically clean it with a brush regularly and after awhile it became a chore that seemed more of a hassle.  </li>
      <li>I have found that if I lift the back end of the station up about 1/2 inch (I slide a toothbrush under it) when the yellow light first comes on, the yellow light goes off and I can get about 13 more cleans before the yellow light comes on again.</li>

    <li> This is a pretty straightforward item. Although it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as it should (with the price I paid for my shaver), the product itself and ease of installation is excellent.</li>
    <li> Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cartridges last MUCH longer than advertised, even if used as directed. I don&#x27;t necessarily clean the razor after each use. If I have only one use on the unit, a visual inspection shows that there really is no need for a full cleaning. Following the recommendation in the manual to pop the screen loose, the run the razor with the screen in that manner shakes out a massive amount of the detritus accumulated in the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this manner, I clean the razer with the cleaning system every other or every third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does and EXCELLENT job of cleaning and the alcohol takes care of any nasty creatures that may have developed on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was skeptical of this when I first saw it, but after using it for a week or so and calculating the actual cost of the cleaning cartridges, I have concluded that this is, indeed, a product that I NEED&gt;</li>
    <li> cleans the razor - works like it should.  Sure, it might be a little pricy but 3 of these last almost a full year for me.  for having a hygenic, clean razor - it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
    <li> Because Braun could not be bothered to incorporate some kind of plug into the design, the alcohol solution evaporates from these cartridges at warp speed, making this a pretty major rip-off if your shaving ritual is intermittent. I&#x27;ve had one of these things go completely dry before I could use it even once! You might as well take a $5 bill and send it directly to Braun, maybe with a nice note: \\&quot;Dear Braun, I found this fiver in my wallet and immediately thought of you. Buy yourself something pretty.\\&quot; But if you&#x27;re gonna order these cartridges anyway, get the 2-pack instead of the 3-pack; as of this writing, in the 2-pack they cost around $5 apiece, whereas it&#x27;s about $6 in the 3-pack.</li>
    <li> The cartridges can be refilled with alcohol. How can I say this with certainty? Way back when, when Braun introduced these self cleaning shavers, i purchased one. After my cartridge ran dry I went to purchase another but there were none to be found. I called Braun, they acknowledged that the cartridges were impossible to find because it was a new product and It was suggested that I thoroughly rinse the cartridge out and refill with alchohol and sometimes I add a touch of pre-electric save for lubricant and fresh smell. I have been doing this for over 8 years. Braun makes great shavers but shame on them for this environment waste.....</li>
    <li> It must be a good product but what to do about it? You cant ship it through courier or even in personal baggage because it falls in \\&quot;inflammable\\&quot; class. When I tried to carry it in packed box, it was taken out and discarded by airport securities. I wonder how Braun is supplying it through out the world to its dealership. However, I couldn&#x27;t find in my country even with Braun dealers/partners. May be Braun can give some solution to shipment of this item!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  Just clean the blade periodically with the brush that comes with the shaver.  If you want to take an extra step use some shaver oil in a can that braun or norelco sells.  These refill cleaners are a scam.  Basically it&#x27;s a way for a company like Braun to make you keep buying stuff.  A shaver can be properly maintained per the instructions that they come with for years.  I had a Syncro 7575 (believe that was the model) which came with this system of automatic cleaning.  After buying one refill I never bought it again, all the cleaner is made up of is some lubricant and alcohol maybe a detergent.  I went on to use the Syncro for four years without a problem.  I then bought an activator and have never used the automatic cleaning apparatus, just use it to hold the shaver and the shaver hasn&#x27;t had a problem for at least three years now.</li>
    <li> I use this for my Braun shaver, and it cleans the shaver really well automatically.  It&#x27;s easy to replace the refills.  I highly recommend this for anyone who owns a supported Braun shaver.  I used this for years, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet.</li>
    <li> My husband loves having a clean fresh razor every time he shaves an this is the easy way to get it. OK guys you already know you love this product but the great thing about ordering from Amazon is it is the same price or cheaper than it is in the stores, their never \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; and someone brings it to your door.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product...    I used it at least once a week for my shaver and it has keep the inner working of the blade smooth and cool. I will continue purchasing them, even if they are fairly pricey.     One way you can save some money would be to set it up on Subscribe &amp; Save here on Amazon. You can choose the order frequency and even make changes just before your order is shipped. Please it give you free shipping.</li>
    <li> Lets see, I have been an avid braun fan since I started shaving. Braun shavers work great, you get a clean close shave, and these cleaning systems really keep the shaver running like new.     I have always noticed one thing, after every clean, I get a closer shave. If I just clean the shaver with a brush, no matter how much time I spend, I can&#x27;t actually get it clean enough for a close shave. Also the refill keeps the moving parts lubricated so they work great.    I took my shaver overseas and didn&#x27;t take my clean N charge base, so I spent a few week cleaning my shaver with a brush, and what I realized was that I had more nicks and cuts than ever. Only because the shaver wouldn&#x27;t get some hair, and I would keep going over that area over and over again, ending up with a burn or cut. Yes if you use any electric shaver for a prolonged time, they do get hot, and the friction will give your skin a burn.    So for me the cost of the refills is worth a healthy skin. Also the alcohol disinfects the shaver which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I shave daily and clean two or three times a week, so I get about 2 months out of a full cartridge.  In addition to cleaning less than every day and sealing the cartridge when it is not in use, there is another way to save on these. Mine reads \\&quot;empty\\&quot; when it is still about a third to half full of cleaning fluid.  I just strain the liquid through a coffee filter (or a napkin) to remove shavings and reuse it.  Be careful not to overfill or you will have to clean up a small puddle of alcohol. Two \\&quot;empties\\&quot; works perfectly - it gives you nearly a new full cartridge, cutting waste and extending the life of the cartridge.</li>
    <li> Amazon had this as a bundle and I bought this based on that recommendation with a shaver for my son.  Big surprise it was for another shaver not the one I bought.  So I wanted to return it.  Guess what?  It can not be returned for safety reasons.  I am still waiting for Amazon to respond to my email on this and another issue .  I suggest you buy these at Wal-Mart.  Also, a lesson learned.  I will definetly reconsider shopping via Amazon and check out the local stores.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m reading through some of these reviews and most are happy with the razor but incensed at the cost of the cleaning fluid.  Here&#x27;s my take.  I have these on rotating subscription with Amazon.  Therefore I am eligible for a discount and free shipping.  I&#x27;m paying about $12.00 for three cartridges.  That&#x27;s $4.00 each.  Over the average of 30 days (I do clean mine every day and love it that way...it&#x27;s WHY I bought it) I spend about 13 cents a day to clean it.  13 cents!  And here we have those trying to &#x27;beat the system&#x27; by taking theirs out, manually cleaning the foil and blades, running it under water or even worse yet, making their own solution.  13 cents!  Sorry, but for what you can&#x27;t even buy a stick of gum for anymore, you can have your razor clean and santized every day.  It&#x27;s worth every 13 pennies to me.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the product, in fact love them with three boys/men in the house BUT if you are ordering with Amazon Prime, 2 day and 1 day shipping are NOT available on this item.  After talking with customer service, I was told  due to weight and dimensions only standard shipping was available (this after I was 3 days into my order) I was under the impression that items offered with Amazon Prime were all available for the 2 day or 1 day shipping so I didn&#x27;t even check shipping options.  I know, buyer beware!  Just be aware that this one is standard shipping only and even though it as shown as an Amazon Prime product, the only benefit you get for Amazon Prime is standard shipping which is not really any benefit.  Not very happy with Amazon on this one even though for the most part, Prime membership has been awesome.</li>
    <li> These refills works great. However, be careful which seller you are buying from. Last time Amazon did not have them in stock so I buy them through Price-Break (still at Amazon.com) and choose the expedited shipping. It took them 11 days to ship it to me. I am not sure what kinds of expedited shipping this is but I am sure I will never buy from them again.</li>

I recommend an alcohol with a 90% - 99% alcohol concentration. To top it off when the cleaning unit registers low on the cleaning solution, simply pour the alcohol directly into the shaver housing (where the shaver sits during cleaning). There&#x27;s a hole that directs the alcohol back into the cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;The price of these replacement cartridge may be high, but the cartridge do a bang-up job of cleaning, lubricating, and sanitizing your shaver head!---  The price of these replacement cartridge may be high, but the cartridge do a bang-up job of cleaning, lubricating, and sanitizing your shaver head!</li>
    <li> Any time I stop to gripe about the cost of these Braun Syncro refills, I think back to my Mach 3 Turbo straight edge days.  I would take a 3 pack of these over expensive blade replacements and shaving cream any day.  I find these generally last a little over a month with daily cleaning Monday - Friday. A $65-70 a year estimate is fair, which boils down to about $5.50 a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am frequently able to find these refills at CVS &amp; Target, there have been a number of times when they were out/unavailable.  Also I have sometimes been limited to the 2 pack.  The prices on Amazon are competitive and I tend to order them when I&#x27;m down to my last one so I&#x27;m ready when the cleaning stand&#x27;s red light goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol solution has a light lemon scent and an oily consistency.  I would always be careful where you keep the stand in the event of a leak.  I have had no problems with it, but I could see a spill being a big mess.  Also, I have a relatively sensitive neck when it comes to shaving and the solution has not added any noticeable irritation.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t clean everyday just every week and only purchase these occasionally.  I top mine off with standard rubbing alcohol and has worked fine for years (yes and still somehow retains that lemony smell)</li>
    <li> Clean your razor once a week.  I disagree with the idea the stuff evaporates if you don&#x27;t use it daily - I put a new cartridge in about every three months.  Each Sunday morning I open the razor, brush it with the included brush, put it on the cleaner/charger and enjoy the fresh smell Monday morning.  If you brush the stubble out of the razor before cleaning, the fluid lasts a lot longer.  Once a week has been fine for me for about seven years.  My razor hums, does a good shaving job and I&#x27;m happy.  I replace the cutting foil and head once a year.  One day it&#x27;ll be over and I&#x27;ll have to bury it.  But I think that&#x27;s a long time from now.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews here, I found that these refills work great and really clean your razor but they are pricey (I give it 3 stars because of the price). You definitely need to shop around for the best deals. If you care to prolong the life of the refill then the trick is the reduce the amount shaving residue that the unit is going to clean by manually brushing it off and/or reduce how often you run it in the cleaner and reseal the cartridge between uses or long durations. A lot of evaporation occurs when the cartridge is left open. Of course all of this increases how much time you spend cleaning your razor so it&#x27;s a trade off that you need to decided for yourself. I clean my razor using the cartridge daily now because time is more important to me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend refilling these things yourself unless you have a lot of extra time on your hands but it is possible if you did it correctly (if your interested you can find instructions via a Google search).</li>
    <li> I use the Braun cleaning station daily after each shave. I normally get about 34 cleaning operations before the yellow low fluid level light comes on, and 7 cleans after that before the red empty light comes on. I have found that if I lift the back end of the station up about 1/2 inch (I slide a toothbrush under it) when the yellow light first comes on, the yellow light goes off and I can get about 13 more cleans before the yellow light comes on again. Then I get the usual 7 cleans after that before the red empty light come on. In this way  I have been getting roughly 34+13+7 &#x3D; 54 cleaning operations per cartridge.     To prevent too much shaving debris from collecting in the cartridge, I brush the cutter and the top of the shaver under the foil before cleaning. To prevent damage to the blades, I brush the cutter with strokes perpendicular to the long axis of the cutter block.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver nearly 3 years ago as a first Father&#x27;s Day gift. Before that, I had a Norelco rotary shaver.  To be honest, I hated my Norelco shaver.  Not only did it not shave closely, I also had to physically clean it with a brush regularly and after awhile it became a chore that seemed more of a hassle.  With the Braun shaving/cleaning system, it shaves as close as a blade and I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking it apart and clean the shaving head.  All I have to do is put the shaver back in the base and press a button and it&#x27;s taken care of.  The cleaning solution is not cheap. But considering the alternative of having to spend the time and manually clean the shaver like I used to do with my old Norelco, it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first but decided to give it a try.  It does work great.  It is quite pricey so I only do the cleaning when it needs the intensive clean, about every 2-3 days.  This also helps to prolong the use.  I would recommend buying it on Subscribe and Save to save some money.</li>
    <li> I have started to use it very minimally as per advice of one of the reviewers...after cleaning is done, I am storing the cleaner so that the alcohol does not evaporate....</li>
    <li> This is the replacement cleaning cartridge for Braun&#x27;s line of automatic cleaning stand for their electric razors.  This cartridge will fit even the early model Syncros, all the way to the latest Pulsonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried any of the newer Braun models, as my 7-year-old Syncro is still going strong.  However, be assured that they all use the same cleaning cartridge, even though the newer models have an improved cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works great.  It cleans, dries, and lubricates the razor.  However, bear in mind that the cleaner is alcohol-based.  Meaning it will eventually evaporate.  It starts to evaporate as soon as you open the seal.  Each cartridge will last approximately one month.  So your cost to keep your razor clean and lubricated, automatically, works out to about five dollars every month.  That&#x27;s not so bad, considering that shaving with a blade will cost you money in hot water use, shaving cream, and replacement blades.  I would say that perhaps the electric razor might come out cheaper.  You can be like me and simply clean your razor manually.  That&#x27;s even more cost-effective.  But still, it is nice to be able to simply use your razor, place it in the cleaning stand, and then have it ready for you the next day, with no effort on your part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Braun cleaning system and you want to use it, this is your only option.  So it really doesn&#x27;t make a difference whether I recommend it or not (I do).  As should be the case, you&#x27;ve chosen your system based on the quality of shave it gives you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for over 1yr now and thought I&#x27;d never use the cleaner, but just plug it in to the wall. After trying it for the first time though, I was hooked. Just the thought of it being all clean/disinfected plus that smell, and there&#x27;s no turning back.    I only charge/clean it once a week and just shake it out daily. This seems to last 2-3 months per refill. I think that&#x27;s acceptable. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The cleaning system does a great job and is superior to the Norelco automatic cleaning design. Braun does a great job on the usability and industrial engineering. I find the pricing to be a bit better at the local big box store. (Target). As for complaints about the cost, this is still way cheaper then shaving with a Gillette blade system.     Note that Amazon does not accept returns on this item.</li>
    <li> This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads \\&quot;low\\&quot; I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3, but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large, smashed, under-protected box, the 5 stars is for the quality product, convenience, and ease of use. Very easy to insert, use, and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL.</li>
    <li> Hi Guys,    For all those of you who are complaining about how expensive this refill is, perhaps this review might give you some ideas on extending the life of a refill, and maximizing its usuage.    I have used one refill since February of this year.  It is August now -- that is about six months!!!    I think the secret to extending the life of this refill is the number of times you clean/disinfect your shaver.  Most important of all - when not in use, take out the refill from the unit, and close it tight with the snap on lid that cames with it.  This will prevent the liquid from evaporating.    Next, if you have a heavy growth and need to shave often, perhaps you might want to clean your shaver more often with the brush that comes with the unit.  My suggestion is clean your shaver as thoroughly as you can.  Don&#x27;t forget to pull out the cutter block (blade cartridge) and clean that too.  By cleaning the shaver properly, you have less hair particles left in the machine - which will mean less residue left over in the refill tank after each use.    Just to give you an idea, I normally clean my shaver every 2 weeks.  I shave every other day (Mon/Wed/Fri), and sometimes on the weekends.  In between, I thoroughly clean my shaver about once a week thoroughly with the brush.  This is the first time I am going to order a refill after 6 months of use.  The liquid now is still quite clear #still blue), but I can see some residue beginning to settle at the bottom of the tank, and the liquid is about half way gone now.  I understand some of you guys might have to shave more often and disinfect the shaver more often also.  So instead of 6 months, you might end up using it for 4 months.  But still better than using a new refill unit every month or month and half.    I hope this review was helpful.  And yes, after each time I use the Clean &amp; Renew Refill - the shaver does smell fresh and new. And it works amazingly well!  I think $16 a year for two refill packs for me, is a smallinvestment.  This shaver is just like a car.  Treat it well, take care of it, and it will last a long time.    My dad has had his Braun shaver for over 20 years, and it still works as good as new.  That&#x27;s probably why I got this shaver, too!    So I hope this review was helpful.      Happy Shaving Guys!</li>
    <li> Those of us who shave have to \\&quot;face\\&quot; it.... shavers and razors all have repeated costs.  A normal razor requires new blades, shaving cream, and after-shave (sometimes pre-shave).  People have gotten used to the idea that electric shavers should have fewer consumables (especially given the cost).  However, electric shavers have greatly improved in recent years, and the new Brauns are about the greatest shavers on the market today.  Part of the way they achieve such a close cut is that they do not \\&quot;gunk up\\&quot; with skin cells and oil the way other shavers do.  I guess you could clean another shaver daily, but the Clean and Renew is about the best way I have seen to maintain a consistently close shave.  I accept the monthly cost of these cartridges the way one would buy shaving cream, shampoo, or any other toiletry.  They do a nice job and smell quite pleasant.  Only issue is that the smell is not designed to go right on your face.  If you remove the shaver mid-cycle and try to use it, it is not a pleasant experience.  But one the liquid dries, the shaver has a pleasant aroma.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It&#x27;s a great shaving system and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it so I don&#x27;t see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I&#x27;ve had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn&#x27;t as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.    I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I&#x27;m also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that).</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun system for like 5 years now...(how long will this battery hold out, I wonder?). This is the best price I have seen on these items, and I have ordered before on E Bay for more cost, so I really stocked up here. I use the cleaner one or twice a week. In between, you can just vibrate the debris out of the shaver with it turned on and the foil half open. I keep a can of aerosol lubricant cleaner spray handy to give a blast or 2 to the cutting heads so they wont dull up.( Remington Shaver Saver works great for this mid week tune up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the cleaner daily as opposed to it evaporating...not a problem.  Save the snap on cover that seals the cartridge..and snap it back on as soon as the cleaning cycle is over (or in the AM when you wake up). In other words, don&#x27;t leave it open in the unit! Take it out of the unit and seal it, then set it in a drawer until you want to use it again. My cartridges last about 5 months, this way.  So at the Amazon price...that is about a buck a month.  As I say, I have done the Braun for at least 5 years and have replaced the cutting block once. I&#x27;ll just be really bummed if the battery stops charging now that I have all this cleaning fluid stock piled..you know?</li>
    <li> First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily, you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have the Braun 9595 (my first \\&quot;real electric razor\\&quot;). At first I was a little bummed out that I&#x27;d have to spend $15 on these \\&quot;refills\\&quot; that I would probably need every few weeks. Well, I was wrong on my assumptions to say the least!    1. The shaver gets super clean and smells great after a cleaning session.  2. The cleaning solution also lubricates the shaver thus increasing life.  3. The solution lasts about 2x as long as I thought it would.    I started using the shaver around March 7. I shave 2 times a day thanks to a super heavy beard that grows super fast. I have a 6 oclock shadow at 10:00am... So, I tried to use the cleaning solution once a day but ended up using it twice a day (I shave in the morning and at night). Just today (April 9 2008) the low light came on. That means 1 cleaning cartridge lasts a little over a month with 2 cleanings per day for me.    One thing I do that may help the life is after every single shave I take off the head - blow out the shaver and put the head under the faucet for 2-3 seconds. I know, why do this when you have a dedicated cleaning system, right? Well, for a $220 shaver, I&#x27;ll do whatever I want. lol. Washing out the shaver head may have extended the life of the solution - I&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews as well.    Sign up for the subscription and the price will go down 15%. I set it to 3 months (about when I&#x27;ll need more refills). Compare that to buying razor blades every month for $20 and shaving cream every few months - this is a savings.</li>
