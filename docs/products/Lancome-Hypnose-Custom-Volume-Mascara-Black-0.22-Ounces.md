      <li>Lancome by far, makes the best mascara ever!!!</li>
      <li>To be sure I took this product to the Lancome counter at Dillard&#x27;s (department store) and was told it was not an authentic Lancome product.</li>

      <li>They make a great product &amp; this was a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I love the product and will order again from you.  </li>

      <li>I Love this mascara.  </li>

      <li>I have short blonde lashes and this makes them absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>There was a time I worked for Lancome, but once I didn&#x27;t I couldn&#x27;t really afford it anymore and thought there&#x27;s got to be another mascara that gives as much</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was an older mascara that they sent, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>Hypnose was very clumpy and I had to keep cleaning it off of my lashes and starting over.</li>
      <li>I have long lashes, so they really need lots of volume to ensure it doesn&#x27;t look like I have spider legs</li>
      <li>well if I&#x27;m looking for a more dramatic look.</li>

<li> the item I got have the same problems as the other two reviewer&#x27;s (see the comments on mascara part!).</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I recently found out that Kim Kardashian used this mascara</li>
<li> It was crazy cheap.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other mascara.</li>
<li> (!) on my face, and this does the trick, bringing unbelievable volume.  </li>
<li> This mascara does not clump, even if you add additional coats after it dries, however, I think it would be bested suited for people with long, naturally thick lashes.</li>
<li> This really thickens your lashes, and gives you a very dramatic effect.  </li>
<li> For example, the wand was a little bit thicker.</li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d try it because I usually buy Lancome&#x27;s Le extreme.</li>
<li> You can pile it on and on and your lashes never get clumpy or messy.</li>
<li> it was missing lancome sticker on the bottom of it 2.)</li>
<li> Here are a few reasons...1.)</li>
<li> I saw these prices were a little less expensive.</li>
<li> Always thick, but never clumps.  </li>
<li> Worst Mascara that I have in hole my life,very sticky and you feel uncomfortable when you have it,anyway don&#x27;t rush and try some of them in cosmetic store and then order it,the drugstore mascaras are much better.</li>
<li> This is terrific dramatic mascara!!  </li>
<li> However, to get that dramatic evening look, you have to apply at least 2-3 coats.  </li>
<li> had you read the comments/review, you will noticed that there is defiantly something wrong with this online store.</li>
<li> I promised that there is something wrong with the mascara!</li>
<li> It burned my eyes terribly.</li>

    <li> Hands down best mascara I have ever used! It makes my lashes look great. I only need one coat to make my lashes pop but it also layers well if I&#x27;m looking for a more dramatic look. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is terrific dramatic mascara!!  Absolutely love it!!  I will continue to order it as it is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
    <li> I ordered what I thought was Lancome Hypnose Mascara. I have been using this mascara for years now and I usually buy it directly from Lacome at the department store. I decided to try amazon b/c I saw these prices were a little less expensive. When I received this product I noticed a few differences compared to what I am normally used to.  For example, the wand was a little bit thicker. To be sure I took this product to the Lancome counter at Dillard&#x27;s (department store) and was told it was not an authentic Lancome product. I messaged the seller regarding this issue and I never heard back. BE AWARE.</li>
    <li> had you read the comments/review, you will noticed that there is defiantly something wrong with this online store. don&#x27;t trust this seller! I promised that there is something wrong with the mascara! the item I got have the same problems as the other two reviewer&#x27;s (see the comments on mascara part!). Don&#x27;t trust this seller! it is not about the money, I don&#x27;t even care anymore if I get a refund, it is about credibility!  this is a feud seller! should not even be exited on amazon!</li>
    <li> Well, I had good customer service with this seller however I do not believe this is an actual Lancome product. Here are a few reasons...1.) slightly different tube with a different brush &amp; it was missing lancome sticker on the bottom of it 2.) It smelled differently than the same tube I had 3.) It was crazy cheap. So, I did receive a refund and the seller was easy to deal with I just believe it was a faulty product.</li>
    <li> This mascara does not clump, even if you add additional coats after it dries, however, I think it would be bested suited for people with long, naturally thick lashes. Mine are very fine and, even though each lash was covered without clumping, they did not appear to be much thicker.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I recently found out that Kim Kardashian used this mascara so I gave it a shot.  It was definitely worth it:)  However, to get that dramatic evening look, you have to apply at least 2-3 coats.  For the daytime, one coat is ample.  Lancome by far, makes the best mascara ever!!!</li>
    <li> He orders my makeup for me and then pays the price...hehehhehe...I Love this mascara.  Always thick, but never clumps.  It&#x27;s my one splurge</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It gives my lashes a lot of extra volume, but still keeps every lash defined. I also think this is a good curling mascara. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara!  You can pile it on and on and your lashes never get clumpy or messy. This makes your lashes long and beautiful</li>
    <li> This mascara is just okay. I thought I&#x27;d try it because I usually buy Lancome&#x27;s Le extreme. Should&#x27;ve stuck with that one! Hypnose was very clumpy and I had to keep cleaning it off of my lashes and starting over. Maybe it was an older mascara that they sent, I don&#x27;t know. It didn&#x27;t lengthen as I&#x27;d hoped. Did thicken, though, just too much, way to clumpy for my own taste!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the shipping and all. This is a Lancome product so it&#x27;s pricey... I have found that some drugstore brands work just as well</li>
    <li> I love the product and will order again from you.  I used this product many years ago and remembered how wonderful it worked.  It was not Hypnose but Lancome&#x27;s mascara.  Thank you again.  Linda</li>
    <li> I had to throw this mascara out. It burned my eyes terribly. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other mascara.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. I have short blonde lashes and this makes them absolutely gorgeous. I&#x27;ve used every mascara I can get my hands on and this is by far the best one out there.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Lancome. They make a great product &amp; this was a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve used Lancome for years &amp; find it helps to emphasize my lashes. It is also very easy to remove.</li>
    <li> The only one I like better is Chanel.  I was looking for a mascara that was as good and the Chanel Mascara and this is the closest that I could find for quality.  BUT...  I am going to back to Chanel, just cannot beat the quality.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read close enough.  This is good but not what I was expecting. . . . . .</li>
    <li> This product is EXPENSIVE for a mascara, BUT there&#x27;s has never been a better volumizing mascara on the market.  There was a time I worked for Lancome, but once I didn&#x27;t I couldn&#x27;t really afford it anymore and thought there&#x27;s got to be another mascara that gives as much volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried many in retail stores, department stores, and beauty stores like Ulta and Sephora, and I STILL have never found anything that comes close.  I have long lashes, so they really need lots of volume to ensure it doesn&#x27;t look like I have spider legs(!) on my face, and this does the trick, bringing unbelievable volume.  This really thickens your lashes, and gives you a very dramatic effect.  Love them!</li>
