<li> Nothing wrong with treating myself once in a while</li>
<li> With in an hour or so, it will probably rub off, crack, or run, making you look like a crazy person.</li>
<li> Truly awful.</li>

    <li> Would never buy this again and would return it if I could. It is a poor substitute for high quality eye liner. It is very wet and this makes it difficult to line the eye. Used it once and threw it in the back of my drawer. Truly awful.</li>
    <li> It clearly says I ordered liquid eyeliner and the box it came in was labeled liquid eyeliner however what was inside the box was a pencil eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I have a customer who uses this product it is for her.</li>
    <li> Love this item however it was not quite as I expected. Product may have been sitting for a while. It was a bit dried out</li>
    <li> I love May Kay great eyeliner</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s products are almost all really great makeup products.  Their liquid eyeliner is alot better than almost any eyeliner out there, even ones that are double the price.</li>
    <li> OK product. A little runy. Colar is a nice black,</li>
    <li> not the item in the picture this is a small marker like product  do not order! waste of money and is far from a liquid eyeliner</li>
    <li> PORQUE EL PRODUCTO NUNCa me llego y no recib&amp;iacute; mi dinero, continuo a la espera de mi devolucion. o del producto o del din ero. y me maltrato amenzandome con  que quitara mis comentarios.</li>
    <li> The product is very wet and will sometimes even drip into the eye. Once it dries, it becomes very stiff and cracks and flakes easily. The color is very dark and the applicator is smooth enough, but in the end it&#x27;s not worth your effort. It is also not water proof at all. With in an hour or so, it will probably rub off, crack, or run, making you look like a crazy person.</li>
    <li> Just what a was expecting</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is being discontinued!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this eyeliner for a couple of years. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Goes on easily and stays on.</li>
    <li> I tried another eyeliner and it smeared off within a couple of hours. I came back to the Mary Kay liquid eyeliner and will not try changing again. I can put this on &amp; forget about it. I wear contacts, so any eyeliner I use needs to be smudge proof to keep from affecting my contacts. This one has worked perfectly for me for years.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is the best, pricy but the best in my opinion. Nothing wrong with treating myself once in a while</li>
