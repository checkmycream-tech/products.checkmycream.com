### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I find a wide-tooth shower comb works best, again, avoiding getting product on scalp.</li>
      <li>Its great!!!</li>
      <li>The best conditioner for curly hair</li>
      <li>The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>and they are all awesome!</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great Smell - no build up</li>
      <li>This is a great every day conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is great shampoo and conditioner and have bought many times.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I use a lot of conditioner and think this large size with pump is a great value.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>Agadir really works great as a co-wash for me and my daughter.</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Makes my clients hair so healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair.</li>
      <li>so they are easy to use without having to pick them up and turn them over.</li>
      <li>I can easily come through my hair after using this.</li>
      <li>Normally that is good, but in this case I so wish I had bought an 8 oz bottle and tried it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular bottle is the best finacial deal Ihave seen so far on Agadir.</li>
      <li>Its sulfate free so it will not strip your color.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to contact customers and ask for a review, then be aware it doesn&#x27;t feel good to have the tone change when you don&#x27;t get exactly what you want in a response.  </li>
      <li>for my hair, it is fine for detangling, but not improving the dryness noticeably, or doing any special detangling.  </li>
      <li>OK price, nice to find the larger size.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft, manageable, and smelling nice</li>
      <li>It came quickly and well packaged.</li>
      <li>I love Agadir products and was glad to see I could such a large bottle of conditioner separate from the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for extra dry hair like mine</li>
      <li>I think I bought it expecting to like the scent due to reviews, so that is why I&#x27;m sharing that it kind of turns my stomach.  </li>
      <li>Now I have a large size Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, both with pumps</li>
      <li>- it makes it very manageable.</li>
      <li>This is subjective, and other people may love it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get my tangles out as well as other conditioners, but love everything else about it.</li>
      <li>Creates healthy shine, helps a lot with frizz/dryness and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
      <li>It was not worth the time to me to file a complaint, as most of the conditioner was still in the container, but it bothered me that the merchant solicited me for a review all nicely, and then when I wrote back that it had leaked and I did not like the fragrance, the merchant didn&#x27;t respond and curtly referred me to Amazon Fulfillment.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hair looking shiny and feeling soft.</li>
      <li>If you spend lots of time &amp; money getting just the right hair color &amp; you want to keep it looking new as long as possible and if your hair is dry &amp; brittle and you want to make it look soft &amp; silky......</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not all that horrible objectively, but yet I really dislike it when I use it, and I typically enjoy conditioner for the nice scent and aromatherapy during the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my dry coarse color treated hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Product is what was expected so not other major issues</li>

<li> This conditioner leaves my dry coarse color treated hair soft and manageable.</li>

<li> It compares all right to other conditioners, but it&#x27;s not a super conditioner.  </li>
<li> instead  Had leakage from cap but not major.  </li>
<li> Cannot go without this shampoo &amp; conditioner for my long naturally curly hair that frizzes so much less with this and the oil.</li>
<li> I have been using Agadir shampoo &amp; conditioner for a long time now (years).</li>
<li> My processed hair, (blonde highlights), needs extra moisture without being weighed down.</li>
<li> I will say that it covers well with a small amount, which means the big bottle will last a long time.  </li>
<li> Each time it makes my hair silky, knot &amp; tangle free and keeps my very very expensive color job from fading.</li>
<li> Would have rated 5 stars but conditioner was crushed  during shipping and lost half contents.</li>
<li> product had messily leaked a small amount of the contents out onto other items when it arrived (loose cap), which may or may not be the fault of Amazon Fulfillment, who knows at what stage it came loose.  </li>
<li> It moisterizes without weighing your hair down.</li>
<li> I get it all through my hair, avoiding my scalp and let it sit for maybe a minute, (or less).</li>
<li> the lid is not screwed on tight</li>
<li> you are not enjoying it&amp;#34; would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was annoyed that my other items were greasy and smelling of the fragrance I do not like.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a fresh scent; vaguely rancid, or just not appealing to me at all.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s too expensive to waste.</li>
<li> and I am addicted to the scent!</li>

    <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair smooth and frizz free. It came quickly and well packaged. I use a lot of conditioner and think this large size with pump is a great value.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my tangles out as well as other conditioners, but love everything else about it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my dry coarse color treated hair soft and manageable. I have used it for years. I wanted to buy a larger size and almost did not purchase this because from the picture I could not tell that it was a pump bottle, which is what I wanted. Now I have a large size Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, both with pumps so they are easy to use without having to pick them up and turn them over.</li>
    <li> OK price, nice to find the larger size. Agadir really works great as a co-wash for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....I LOVE HOW IT FEELS IN MY HAIR.....I LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY HAIR SMELL...AND I LOVE THE WAY IT HELPS ME MAINTAIN THE LUSTER.</li>
    <li> Sent Pump. instead  Had leakage from cap but not major.  Product is what was expected so not other major issues</li>
    <li> I love this product. However every time I order it the lid is not screwed on tight so a portion of the conditioner leaks out in shipping.</li>
    <li> Cannot go without this shampoo &amp; conditioner for my long naturally curly hair that frizzes so much less with this and the oil.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner and have bought many times. Would have rated 5 stars but conditioner was crushed  during shipping and lost half contents. At $30 a bottle it&#x27;s too expensive to waste.</li>
    <li> I love Agadir products and was glad to see I could such a large bottle of conditioner separate from the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product because the fragrance bothers me.  I find it off-putting.  It&#x27;s not a fresh scent; vaguely rancid, or just not appealing to me at all.  This is subjective, and other people may love it.  I think I bought it expecting to like the scent due to reviews, so that is why I&#x27;m sharing that it kind of turns my stomach.  It&#x27;s not all that horrible objectively, but yet I really dislike it when I use it, and I typically enjoy conditioner for the nice scent and aromatherapy during the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair, it is fine for detangling, but not improving the dryness noticeably, or doing any special detangling.  It compares all right to other conditioners, but it&#x27;s not a super conditioner.  I will say that it covers well with a small amount, which means the big bottle will last a long time.  Normally that is good, but in this case I so wish I had bought an 8 oz bottle and tried it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had messily leaked a small amount of the contents out onto other items when it arrived (loose cap), which may or may not be the fault of Amazon Fulfillment, who knows at what stage it came loose.  I was annoyed that my other items were greasy and smelling of the fragrance I do not like.

If you&#x27;re going to contact customers and ask for a review, then be aware it doesn&#x27;t feel good to have the tone change when you don&#x27;t get exactly what you want in a response.  Just a short &amp;#34;sorry you are not enjoying it&amp;#34; would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product again, nor will I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Helps control and soften and shines my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Been using for 3yrs and I still love it. I actually use the shampoo, conditioner, and oil and they are all awesome!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for extra dry hair like mine - it makes it very manageable.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my clients hair so healthy and shiny. This is my hair crack in a bottle!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> The best conditioner for curly hair I&#x27;ve ever used. I swear by it and I am addicted to the scent!</li>
    <li> I have been using Agadir shampoo &amp; conditioner for a long time now (years). Each time it makes my hair silky, knot &amp; tangle free and keeps my very very expensive color job from fading. Its sulfate free so it will not strip your color. This particular bottle is the best finacial deal Ihave seen so far on Agadir. If you spend lots of time &amp; money getting just the right hair color &amp; you want to keep it looking new as long as possible and if your hair is dry &amp; brittle and you want to make it look soft &amp; silky......try this stuff u won&#x27;t regret it!!!!!! Its great!!!</li>
    <li> I am a *big* fan of the argan oil products, especially since I flat-iron my hair almost daily.  It keeps my hair looking shiny and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair. It moisterizes without weighing your hair down. Will definately keep buying it!!! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling soft, manageable, and smelling nice</li>
    <li> This is a great every day conditioner. It softens, detangles, and smooths without having to use a lot of product.</li>
    <li> My processed hair, (blonde highlights), needs extra moisture without being weighed down. This conditioner is one of my favorites! I can easily come through my hair after using this. I get it all through my hair, avoiding my scalp and let it sit for maybe a minute, (or less). I find a wide-tooth shower comb works best, again, avoiding getting product on scalp. Creates healthy shine, helps a lot with frizz/dryness and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Great Smell - no build up</li>
