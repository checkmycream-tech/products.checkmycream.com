      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It works okay for me.</li>

      <li>but I love this product.</li>
      <li>This product works ok.</li>
      <li>I read an article in More magazine suggesting to try this if you have sparse eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>wish they had more colors</li>
      <li>It stays on for days, then you can thicken your brows even more with an eyebrow powder and brush.</li>
      <li>I love love love love love this Gimme Brow.</li>
      <li>This is so much better than using an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
      <li>Finishes your face when your brows stand out alittle more.</li>
      <li>and maybe then I&#x27;d have a good and fresh cosmetic for my money.</li>
      <li>A pencil works better.  </li>
      <li>know this may sound superficial, but the  I love that the packaging is</li>
      <li>Fast, good shipment too.</li>
      <li>It was extremely easy to use, even for someone who doesn&#x27;t know beyond the basics about filling in btows , like me.</li>
      <li>My eyebrow becom mor easy to draow it and become mor nature</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>I wore it all day at work and it stayed on strong.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t figure out what... Seems to work fine filling in my brows though.</li>
      <li>On me, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions but no matter how many times I tried to perfect the look, I ended up with harsh, cartoon-ish brows - not the look I was going for!</li>
      <li>It was also a bit &#x27;globby&#x27; as it went on and you have to make sure to comb it through fast before it dries.</li>
      <li>I have gotten this product from Ulta previously and was extremely happy with it, ordering online the tube I received was empty/dry.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product for simplicity and coverage as well as a natural look.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it really doesnt take much to give your brows the boost and color you need.</li>
      <li>but otherwise, I love how natural the application is versus brow gel or powder that sticks to your skin.</li>
      <li>I combined this product plus a pen to give right shape.</li>
      <li>Exactly as claimed.</li>
      <li>To me, the product seems like nothing more than a deep brown mascara.</li>
      <li>the solution to no brows, if you can afford it, is to travel to a skilled and licensed esthetician who will essentially tattoo the brows on.  </li>
      <li>I recommend to all women, that when buying cosmetics that cost a pretty penny, stick with the brands store.</li>
      <li>I paid twice as much as I would have at the store.</li>
      <li>I really like this concept and item.  </li>
      <li>The product collects at the end of the brush and then too much of it winds up on the brow bone.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for those of us who have thin eyebrows.</li>
      <li>For anyone who has thinning brows, I would absolutely recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>The product was completely factory sealed and in its original packing box, but I guess it was just old or something.</li>
      <li>(I have very dark brown hair) and looks so natural on, there&#x27;s no way you can tell these aren&#x27;t all my own brows.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again mainly because of the price.</li>
      <li>but the applicator wand tends to make applying the product a little challenging.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to explain, but for that reason would not purchase again.</li>
      <li>I thought this was one of the coolest new products ever.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>love the wand, but i usually have to wipe excess off before applying.</li>
      <li>It is pretty tiny, however.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned the smell!</li>
      <li>The tiny brush is perfect for shaping, covering grays and filling in a bad eyebrow wax.  </li>
      <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>but it leaves the brows looking glossy as natural brow hair as opposed to look as opposed to the powdery look of pencils and powders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural but finished looking.</li>
      <li>Tames those wild brown.</li>
      <li>And btw, I now get complimented on my brows frequently.</li>
      <li>so I used a brow brush to smooth out my brows once the product dried.</li>
      <li>It is preferable to a pencil, though, in creating a natural look, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>allergic or sensitive to it.</li>
      <li>😍😍 I i love you this product I must say I was skeptical at first</li>
      <li>I received this product quickly but it was dried out and useles.</li>
      <li>Only down side is it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>You have to be careful when using it so too much doesn&#x27;t get on</li>
      <li>I have it now and won&#x27;t need another for a 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Unique product, colors only the hairs in my eyebrows (my eyebrows hairs are white), makes them look natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thinning and some grey brows.  I absolutely love this product for simplicity and coverage as well as a natural look.</li>
    <li> This product was ok; I feel though that it was overpriced and any mascara would work just as well. It was also a bit &#x27;globby&#x27; as it went on and you have to make sure to comb it through fast before it dries. I probably would not buy it again, but rather a mascara in the same shade as my brows. It is preferable to a pencil, though, in creating a natural look, in my opinion. Might purchase again  only if it were less expensive since it has a thinner applicator than a mascara</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fill in quite as well as I would like.</li>
    <li> defective.  I have gotten this product from Ulta previously and was extremely happy with it, ordering online the tube I received was empty/dry.  Dispaapointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I was worried about it looking unnatural but it is not.  It makes my eyebrows look like they&#x27;ve grown back.  I have thin/sparse eyebrows from waxing/plucking and I never use eyebrow pencils, but i saw this stuff and had to try it.  It was a little darker than I thought but it doesn&#x27;t look too dark for my hair color.  Fills in my eyebrows perfectly with just one coat.  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love love love this Gimme Brow. It&#x27;s so natural but finished looking. Definitely will reorder!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  I wanted it to cover the gray in my brows and it does just that.  Easy to use and it does stay on for a long time.</li>
    <li> Really good to fix your eyebrows in place. I combined this product plus a pen to give right shape.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were so good. I wasted my money. Doesn&#x27;t look good at all.  A pencil works better.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has thinning brows, I would absolutely recommend this product.  Application takes a bit of practice for good results, but the product does what is advertised:  it fills-in brows with a natural, subtle look.</li>
    <li> This product works ok. Does the job well. My biggest problem with it is the size of the product. I thought for the amount of money I paid for it, I would receive a larger product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again mainly because of the price.</li>
    <li> I was very impatient waiting on this delivery but was very disappointed when it finally did arrive. To me, the product seems like nothing more than a deep brown mascara. Not to mention the tube is just about dried up. I guess I should have bought from the actual \\&quot;Benefit\\&quot; company and maybe then I&#x27;d have a good and fresh cosmetic for my money. The product was completely factory sealed and in its original packing box, but I guess it was just old or something. I recommend to all women, that when buying cosmetics that cost a pretty penny, stick with the brands store. Just safer that way......Bernadette Ostrawski.</li>
    <li> Great product. love the wand, but i usually have to wipe excess off before applying. stays all day. wish they had more colors</li>
    <li> This really works. Tames those wild brown. Covers the white strays.......will continue to purchase. It is pretty tiny, however. You pay a lot of money for a bity product.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow filler/tint is perfect and exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! The medium/deep matched my eyebrows perfectly (I have very dark brown hair) and looks so natural on, there&#x27;s no way you can tell these aren&#x27;t all my own brows. It&#x27;s SO easy to apply and get the perfect shape/coverage you&#x27;re looking for AND stays perfectly in place ALL day. I will never go back to the pencils or powder applied via brush EVER again...I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been without this Benefit Gimme Brow all my life! And btw, I now get complimented on my brows frequently.</li>
    <li> Good color coverage but the applicator wand tends to make applying the product a little challenging. The product collects at the end of the brush and then too much of it winds up on the brow bone. Kind of hard to explain, but for that reason would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. It works okay for me. I find it that my brows look drawn on and I look like a cartoon character but it does what it says it going to do. I will look up some different techniques and practice perhaps I can make it work.</li>
    <li> Nice medium brown shade. Be careful not to put it on too heavily, you could end up looking like Joan Crawford but it leaves the brows looking glossy as natural brow hair as opposed to look as opposed to the powdery look of pencils and powders.</li>
    <li> Exactly as claimed. Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> this product is not at all what they advertise it to be..I&#x27;m really not sure how this has been rated as high as it has been..the medium/deep is actually a gray color. It just adds &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; to your eyebrows which any plain brow pencil can do. There is a tiny amount of product for an overly expensive price. It&#x27;s hard to apply it and again just doesnt really do anything for your eyebrows. I dont even know why this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; exists. I returned it. Huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My only complaint is that like some mascara, it can clump up on the applicator. To fix this, I just wipe the applicator with tissue before each use. It does fill in my eye brows really nice and doesn&#x27;t look like paint or anything.</li>
    <li> The best things I&#x27;ve done for my eyebrows! This is a great product and worth the money. Fast, good shipment too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in medium/deep to fill in the bare spots of my dark brows. I followed the directions but no matter how many times I tried to perfect the look, I ended up with harsh, cartoon-ish brows - not the look I was going for! I&#x27;m glad it works for some people, unfortunately, &amp;#34;Gimme Brow&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work for me. I will continue to use La Prairie Luxe Brow Liner instead.</li>
    <li> I thought this was one of the coolest new products ever. The tiny brush is perfect for shaping, covering grays and filling in a bad eyebrow wax.  The color matched perfectly and blends in with my coloring.</li>
    <li> The formula is so dry it cannot be used unless scraping the product inside the tube. I&#x27;ll toss it, wash the brush and save it for lower lashes mascara.</li>
    <li> Works quite well. Only down side is it wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly. I saw a big difference in my brows after one coat. It was extremely easy to use, even for someone who doesn&#x27;t know beyond the basics about filling in btows , like me. The product stayed put once applied and lasted for about 8 hours.  Definitely a holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this may sound superficial, but the  I love that the packaging is oh so cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came on time and in perfect condition .</li>
    <li> I paid twice as much as I would have at the store. I have it now and won&#x27;t need another for a 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Unique product, colors only the hairs in my eyebrows (my eyebrows hairs are white), makes them look natural.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but I love this product. It is easy to use and my eyebrows look great!</li>
    <li> 😍😍😍 I i love you this product I must say I was skeptical at first so I purchased the sample size the best investment does not fade or smear it is waterproof. I wore it all day at work and it stayed on strong. I personally liked it better than Anastasia brow bar. If u have dark brown to black hair you can get deep medium.</li>
    <li> helpful browse to look wonderful</li>
    <li> My eyebrow becom mor easy to draow it and become mor nature</li>
    <li> Wow. I have hair that looks black. Never thought something deep brown would work on me but it does! Really a nice touch. Finishes your face when your brows stand out alittle more. Never realized that as one matures, the eyebrows get thinner. Now they look great when I add makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of us who have thin eyebrows. It stays on for days, then you can thicken your brows even more with an eyebrow powder and brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this concept and item.  The only issue I have with it is controlling the amount of the product on the brush. Despite this problem, I will probably purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Love this, it&#x27;s perfect. I bought it for my mom but she said that it burns and so she&#x27;s prob. allergic or sensitive to it. On me, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> If you have zero hair and apply this product you end up with color on the brow area along with these fibers that do not , I repeat , they do not look like brow hair.....the solution to no brows, if you can afford it, is to travel to a skilled and licensed esthetician who will essentially tattoo the brows on.  One time charge of around $200 for both and you are set for life!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really doesnt take much to give your brows the boost and color you need. It takes some work, so try different techniques of brushing it on to get the oompf you desire but otherwise, I love how natural the application is versus brow gel or powder that sticks to your skin. My sole complaint is the price, I think it could be at least $5-10 cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the petite brush!  Allows you to darken only eyebrows that are grey.&lt;br /&gt;Need control when applying so eyebrows don&#x27;t look too heavy, but the ones that need coverage are taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> I read an article in More magazine suggesting to try this if you have sparse eyebrows.  Sorry to say my 2.00 eyebrow pencil does a better job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and I&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned the smell! Maybe they need to dry but all I&#x27;ve smelled for the past hour is this stuff on my eyebrows. It has a chemical smell that reminds me of something but I can&#x27;t figure out what... Seems to work fine filling in my brows though. Might try this with a combo of my pencil and this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not worth the cost of it tho.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyebrow makeup!!</li>
    <li> Works great! No smearing no smudging...will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  It clumps and looks unnatural especially if you have dark hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product quickly but it was dried out and useles. Money was refunded quickly, but unsure if I even want to try again!!!!! Maybe just try Maybelline Brow Drama. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than using an eyebrow pencil.  You have to be careful when using it so too much doesn&#x27;t get on but otherwise I am very happy with how it works.  The downside, extremely expensive for this little tube.  And then I just saw advertised, the same type of product by Maybelline at prices of 13 dollars and 7 dollars.  So I will try that before I purchase this again for 22 dollars.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see the purpose of this product for my use &amp; the color was too dark.</li>
    <li> I have almost completely white brows and white hair. I grew up with very black hair, brows and lashes. I have brown eyes. I had tried shadows and pencils in grey colors to improve my brows. Never was completely happy. I bought this product in January, 2015. I purchased the medium/deep color because of my eyes and usual practice of wearing a touch of brown eye shadow for day wear. I am very pleased with my choice of color. I found the product a bit clumpy so I used a brow brush to smooth out my brows once the product dried. That helped. I also added some over-the-counter eye drops (obviously sterile solution) to the container once I thought I might get a drop or two into the bottle. I shook the tube and moved the brush in and out a couple of times to mix the eye drops. That helped too. I find the gel stays put even after working out and sweating.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
