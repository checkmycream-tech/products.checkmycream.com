      <li>Does not feel greasy like most splitend products, made my hair feel soft and smooth after using a hot iron.</li>
      <li>The product is sticky and actually caused more breakage them binding!</li>
      <li>Using the product I was very dissapointed!</li>
      <li>IT helps soo much!</li>
      <li>Most shine serums I&#x27;ve used were more like a thick gloss.</li>
      <li>I do not like it very much because it does not help much with the humidity.</li>
      <li>I think this product is suitable for thick damaged hair but shouldn&#x27;t be used if you have fine hair.&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>The item arrived fast and well packaged.</li>
      <li>However, since the price has increased so much, I decided to give it a try to this one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I also will use a tiny amount to calm fly-aways and it does the trick.</li>
      <li>They were light enough in weight, when i removed them from the packaging (which was opened, and taped shut) to actually merit my looking inside the bottles.  </li>
      <li>The funny thing is that this was the item i was least excited about</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, non-greasy (and I have thin hair), and gave my hair a totally healthy new look.</li>
      <li>I look like a hair model, right down to the ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely tames split ends immediately and doesn&#x27;t make them look greasy or weighed down, but the key is less is better.  </li>
      <li>I have dyed thin hair that breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>I was afraid it would make my hair greasy like most products do, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>THE BOTTLES ARRIVED LESS THAN HALF FULL.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair a little flat though, but will keep using because I notice a positive change.</li>
      <li>My hair dresser used to tell me my hair was in bad shape but now comments it looks good.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Redken serum for a very long time. However, since the price has increased so much, I decided to give it a try to this one. I do not like it very much because it does not help much with the humidity. On the other hand, the seller was trustworthy. The item arrived fast and well packaged. Also, the price was really good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price.  Goes on nice and smooth.  I like NEXXUS because they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
    <li> Most shine serums I&#x27;ve used were more like a thick gloss. This one feels like hair lotion. It left my hair shiny but stiff and hard to manage. I don&#x27;t use it to straighten my hair anymore. Now I just use it to make it shiny when I put it up. I will continue to use it until it runs out but would not recommend or buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works ..you&#x27;ve got to try it on your split ends ..once you see it ..you&#x27;ll keep ordering !</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non-greasy (and I have thin hair), and gave my hair a totally healthy new look. I was going to cut it because the severity of the split ends but this made them disappear.</li>
    <li> I have LONG straight hair &amp; found myself always dealing with tangles in my hair, frizzy split ends, and an excess amount of static. I used this product the first time and after 6 hours at work i can run my fingers through it with ease and my hair feels soft silky and smooth!!! IT helps soo much! I cant wait to show all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> THE BOTTLES ARRIVED LESS THAN HALF FULL.  AGAIN...THESE BOTTLES ARRIVED LITERALLY HALFWAY EMPTY.  They were light enough in weight, when i removed them from the packaging (which was opened, and taped shut) to actually merit my looking inside the bottles.  BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my thin, frizzy curly hair. I got it to help protect my hair color from sun fading and it worked great!</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much more healthier and shiny. Definitely noticed a difference since I&#x27;ve bought Nexxus Pro mend. The funny thing is that this was the item i was least excited about and It works the best by far.</li>
    <li> Hard to find a product you can use successfully on wet or dry hair.  This does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Seller even included a trial size of another product.</li>
    <li> Such a great product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I was afraid it would make my hair greasy like most products do, but it doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;m so happy. It makes my hair shiny and smooths it perfectly. I really really want to try the heat protector spray, shampoo, and conditioner. The only thing is I wish the bottle was bigger. Not sure how long it will last, and I have long hair past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> Using the product I was very dissapointed! I used a little amount of the product rubbing it in the palm of my hands and then spreading it evenly through my hair from half lenght to the ends. The product is sticky and actually caused more breakage them binding! I think this product is suitable for thick damaged hair but shouldn&#x27;t be used if you have fine hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used a couple times, and notice it helps with my damaged ends. It makes my hair a little flat though, but will keep using because I notice a positive change.</li>
    <li> I have dyed thin hair that breaks easily.  I use a curling iron daily and this product maybe twice a week. This product not only smooths down all the little broken ends, it adds shine.  Seems to work in the heat of a humid summer and the cold dry air of winter.  My hair dresser used to tell me my hair was in bad shape but now comments it looks good.  I don&#x27;t notice any stickiness (although you do have to rinse your fingers after putting it on).  Apply sparingly.</li>
    <li> Sticky feeling, not what I expected at all. Definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Just as I feared, it makes my hair look greasy and it doesn&#x27;t give a polished look. I have thick hair and I used only a small amount and it did nothing but make my hair look dirty. I willl be going back to my Aveda products which never disappoint. Two thumbs down for this product.</li>
    <li> Wow. This makes my frizzy hair into luscious glossy curls. And it makes it look darker, so I don&#x27;t have to re-dye it as often. (See the explanation of the key ingredient, PVM/MA copolymer polyelectrolyte complex, on the blog called The Beauty Brains.) The effect persists through about 2 shampoos. One big problem, for me, but maybe not for others, is that it has a fragrance. I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. This one is not too irritating, unless it gets close to my eyes. So the only way I can use this is to pull my hair into a ponytail immediately, wash my hands, and leave the house for it to air-dry outside. I use it anyway, because there just are not many unscented products for long, frizzy hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nexxus ProMend Smoothing Shine Serum is great. It gives my hair shine without the grease. I have thick course hair and my hair is accustomed to being moisturized with greasy moisturizing leave in conditioners and grease, which have been replaced with the use of this product. My hair loves it so do my shirt collars.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my hair shiny, without frizz and is a great treatment to use prior to straightening!</li>
    <li> Definitely tames split ends immediately and doesn&#x27;t make them look greasy or weighed down, but the key is less is better.  I also will use a tiny amount to calm fly-aways and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with shipping. Maybe I had bad luck. It was not sealed and it is not full. Looks like it was used. Package is old and broken. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Nexxus line and this product just compliments the line. It helps me to control my split ends.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Does not feel greasy like most splitend products, made my hair feel soft and smooth after using a hot iron.</li>
    <li> Thsi products help to control split ends. My ends are not that bad considering I havent trimmed it in 4 months. I am glad that I bought it</li>
    <li> I love this product, and it does what it says it will do.  I use after drying, but before styling, but I have friends who use while hair is wet.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that&#x27;s also layered so it always looks feathery and damaged, even though it&#x27;s not. I use this stuff and suddenly it&#x27;s like an herbal essences commercial! I look like a hair model, right down to the ends of my hair. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it immediately after a blow-out to nourish and seal any split ends. I also use it before I use any heat appyling styling tools. I can immediately tell that it&#x27;s giving my hair moisture and I don&#x27;t notice any strays/split ends. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (I don&#x27;t like the greasy look). I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> It was just alright. I find that the oils work better for my fine hair I put on while damp. no notice difference for me.</li>
