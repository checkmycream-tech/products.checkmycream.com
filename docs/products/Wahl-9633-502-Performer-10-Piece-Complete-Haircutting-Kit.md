      <li>This is not my first Wahl and I am happy to continue my allegiance.</li>
      <li>And considering that I had most of the accessories, I bought this one since it doesn&#x27;t come with many accessories.</li>
      <li>I wish there were a fixture larger than 2in, but beyond that, everything about the purchase is great!</li>
      <li>more-</li>
      <li>but they still get the job done, just pay attention :)</li>
      <li>I have cut my hubby&#x27;s hair many times now and will surely get these again.</li>
      <li>Was for my brother in law, he said the item was OK., but looked like chipper than the price I paid for,</li>
      <li>Then switched to the 3/8 inch attachment for the top.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I would spend more money a get</li>
      <li>I had the phone in my hand to return it UNTIL I read the manual and learned about \\&quot;adjusting the power screw\\&quot; &amp;lt;-WAHL&#x27;s words OK?</li>
      <li>I had a great set of Wahl&#x27;s clippers, but after 6yr of use, I thought I needed a new one.</li>
      <li>this product ships very quickly.</li>
      <li>Use it as a beard trimmer works just fine and price was very cheap but seems like it will last a good while.</li>
      <li>it looks and feels really cheap</li>
      <li>I got comfortable with them in 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>It was cheap, so it will pay for itself in 2 cuts.  </li>
      <li>I felt really comfortable using this product and knew its going to come in</li>
      <li>It felt great &amp; is much better than other Razors in this price range.</li>
      <li>Finally resorted to using poultry shears (the kind that cut bone!)</li>
      <li>After a while the guards get loose and don&#x27;t stay on great</li>
      <li>I have fine hair on top because of bolding and thicker hair on the sides, cuts everything with one pass, I would highly recommend to anyone needing a hair trimmer.</li>
      <li>I had not had a &#x27;real barber&#x27;s haircut&#x27; for more than a full year.</li>
      <li>Just received this and decided to trim up my hair right away, using the #4 guard - worked perfectly, nice smooth action, no burning smell.</li>
      <li>The price is right, but the manual is for another higher end Wahl with more functions.</li>
      <li>The product came from california thats why I got it so quick.</li>
      <li>Although the width of clippers and its blade are a little smaller than I&#x27;m used to, they still cut pretty good, and, for the most part, are a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>I am a novice at giving hair cuts but this kit makes it very easy to learn on the job without any major mishaps.</li>
      <li>it cuts hair just fine, but i was using it for 10 minutes , and it was getting pretty hot.</li>
      <li>I always felt I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It was FUN and FRUGAL.</li>
      <li>It works good, as expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tricky at first but not impossibleand worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Yes at some point they may break down, but you will get good cuts for a while.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping and very fast delivery</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 8 months since my first haircut that is done by</li>
      <li>pretty damn well watching myself in the mirror.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this, spend a little more and buy another!</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>It is not easy to cut one&#x27;s own hair, but that is not fault of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Also you must clean &amp; oil them properly to stay working.</li>
      <li>This unit is also cheap, however, the quality of this is FAR beyond anything I&#x27;ve tried for $35 or less.</li>
      <li>The only think I used from this kit was the oil to oil my older cutter, and it again started to work like a pro!</li>
      <li>Topless female hair stylists here in Sin City charge much</li>
      <li>Plus, its loud.</li>
      <li>I have fairly fine, straight hair, that I usually keep in a very short crew cut.</li>
      <li>It barely cuts.</li>
      <li>I had to go back to my old ones...</li>
      <li>Short, or buzzed completely.</li>
      <li>As quiet as I expected and really cuts well.</li>

<li> It does not directly apply to self-service haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It always take me a long time (30minutes) due to low quality Razors.</li>
<li> My only wish is that the supplied oil last a little longer.</li>
<li> Only comes with a few size blade guards, and the shortest one is 1/8\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a very short, simple style that they are tired of going to the hairdresser every 2 weeks to maintain!</li>
<li> Its loud, it slow, and it doesn&#x27;t do the job well!</li>
<li> My biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s not adjustable for different hair length.</li>
<li> so it makes less noise, but yea it works.</li>
<li> If you like painful uneven hair cuts, this product is a real winner.</li>
<li> These clippers are not ajustable and seem dull.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m updating this review after using it for approximately 5 haircuts.  </li>
<li> This is a very poor set of clippers.  </li>
<li> Not too bad for the price.  </li>
<li> &#x3D;/</li>
<li> Boy was I disappointed with this product!</li>

    <li> Just received this and decided to trim up my hair right away, using the #4 guard - worked perfectly, nice smooth action, no burning smell. I have fairly fine, straight hair, that I usually keep in a very short crew cut. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a very short, simple style that they are tired of going to the hairdresser every 2 weeks to maintain!</li>
    <li> Although the width of clippers and its blade are a little smaller than I&#x27;m used to, they still cut pretty good, and, for the most part, are a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for years now. It always take me a long time (30minutes) due to low quality Razors. That cost me $12-$20 at regular stores. This WAHL Razor get&#x27;s the job done in 5 minutes! It felt great &amp; is much better than other Razors in this price range. I had several WAHL&#x27;S a long time ago &amp; felt foolish that I forgot how well they work. I will never go back to the stores again. Yes at some point they may break down, but you will get good cuts for a while. I always felt I got my money&#x27;s worth. Also you must clean &amp; oil them properly to stay working.</li>
    <li> This clipper is quiet, but it pulls, so haircut takes a long time. It was cheap, so it will pay for itself in 2 cuts.  I&#x27;m updating this review after using it for approximately 5 haircuts.  This is a very poor set of clippers.  It barely cuts. I would not purchase it again, but as I said earlier, I guess it paid for itself.  Will have to buy a different one soon.</li>
    <li> Was for my brother in law, he said the item was OK., but looked like chipper than the price I paid for, but it&#x27;s OK., the machine is working good.</li>
    <li> it cuts hair just fine, but i was using it for 10 minutes , and it was getting pretty hot. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Performing as advertised. This is not my first Wahl and I am happy to continue my allegiance. My only wish is that the supplied oil last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this one again. My biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s not adjustable for different hair length. Short, or buzzed completely. Plus, its loud. I would spend more money a get \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; one next time.</li>
    <li> Is perfect, works fine and is cheap</li>
    <li> It works good, as expected. The price is right, but the manual is for another higher end Wahl with more functions.</li>
    <li> No complaints works great. I have fine hair on top because of bolding and thicker hair on the sides, cuts everything with one pass, I would highly recommend to anyone needing a hair trimmer.</li>

    <li> Use it as a beard trimmer works just fine and price was very cheap but seems like it will last a good while.</li>
    <li> this product ships very quickly. it looks and feels really cheap but i actually like how it looks , you might have to tighten the power screw with a coin so it makes less noise, but yea it works.</li>
    <li> Been using cheaper sets of clippers for years. This unit is also cheap, however, the quality of this is FAR beyond anything I&#x27;ve tried for $35 or less. Only comes with a few size blade guards, and the shortest one is 1/8\\&quot;. I like my hair a little shorter, but I can live with it for the price.</li>
    <li> The set of clippers just tears at your hair and then stops working. If you like painful uneven hair cuts, this product is a real winner.</li>
    <li> I wish there were a fixture larger than 2in, but beyond that, everything about the purchase is great!</li>
    <li> This clipper works a treat . It was initially so damn noisy I had the phone in my hand to return it UNTIL I read the manual and learned about \\&quot;adjusting the power screw\\&quot; &amp;lt;-WAHL&#x27;s words OK? And then it was a treat to use. As quiet as I expected and really cuts well. Comb, scissors, and 4 height attachments and clipper oil included. I had not had a &#x27;real barber&#x27;s haircut&#x27; for more than a full year. Now I have to say I did pretty damn well watching myself in the mirror. The results are pretty darn impressive. Others say it looks great! It&#x27;s tricky at first but not impossibleand worth the effort. Haircuts in Vegas are $20 minimum and go up from there. Topless female hair stylists here in Sin City charge much more- but you get much more too! These clippers have already paid for themselves and I can do it at home. They cut through my thick hair like right now. I used the 1/8 inch attachment for the sides and around my big ears. Then switched to the 3/8 inch attachment for the top. No attachment was used when I trimmed up the back of my neck. It was FUN and FRUGAL. MEN..I&#x27;m speaking to YOU now. Buy these..I got comfortable with them in 5 minutes. Save some dough, gasoline, etc etc..and be proud of being self-reliant.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;How to give a hairtcut&#x27; booklet is for you giving someone else a haircut. It does not directly apply to self-service haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only BEEF..I nearly needed an F&#x27;ing CHAINSAW to get the extra-thick and heavy industrial grade plastic packaging open. Finally resorted to using poultry shears (the kind that cut bone!) to get at my legitimate purchase.It hacked me off to no end..I&#x27;m almost over it now...almost.</li>
    <li> These clippers are not ajustable and seem dull. In my opinion they do not work well on african american hair. I had to go back to my old ones...</li>
    <li> chose expedited shipping and it came in one one day. very fast shipping and very fast delivery and i tried it and everything works excellent. would recommend this product plus the haircut kit to anyone who would love to cut their own hair and don&#x27;t have to go to a barbershop and wait for someone to cut your own hair. excellent product to have. I used to go to a barbershop to get a haircut but I don&#x27;t have to anymore because I got an excellent haircut kit and its excellent. I felt really comfortable using this product and knew its going to come in handy anytime i need to cut my hair. choose expedited shipping and the product will come in one day depending on what state you are in. The product came from california thats why I got it so quick.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 8 months since my first haircut that is done by myself.&lt;br /&gt;great price, I will definitely buy another one of this</li>
    <li> I had a great set of Wahl&#x27;s clippers, but after 6yr of use, I thought I needed a new one. And considering that I had most of the accessories, I bought this one since it doesn&#x27;t come with many accessories. Boy was I disappointed with this product! Its loud, it slow, and it doesn&#x27;t do the job well! The only think I used from this kit was the oil to oil my older cutter, and it again started to work like a pro! Don&#x27;t buy this, spend a little more and buy another!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Packaged great! The clippers work very nice for the price I paid for them. I have cut my hubby&#x27;s hair many times now and will surely get these again. AA+</li>
    <li> Does the job as advertised. It is not easy to cut one&#x27;s own hair, but that is not fault of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used the clippers to cut my hair and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I am a novice at giving hair cuts but this kit makes it very easy to learn on the job without any major mishaps.</li>
