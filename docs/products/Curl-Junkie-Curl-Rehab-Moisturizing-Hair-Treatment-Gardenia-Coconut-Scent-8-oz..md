<ol>
      <li>CJCR is an excellent moisturizing hair treatment that I used as a DC after shampooing my hair.  </li>
      <li>Use this 3 days/week and my curls are perfect</li>

      <li>Wonderful stuff</li>
      <li>I used this product and it worked GREAT!</li>
      <li>I specifically wanted it because it sounded like it would smell delicious.</li>

      <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>smell amazing lots of creamy product and spreads wonderfully</li>
      <li>it worked great, but it&#x27;s too pricey for me to use</li>
      <li>The product worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I have to fall in line with the rest of reviewers and say that this is a very nice conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I loved the way my hair felt afterwards</li>
      <li>I have struggled to find a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>and it all smells GOOD.</li>
      <li>Maybe the ingredients don&#x27;t smell very good and the strong fragrance is there to cover it up.  </li>
      <li>It worked great for both, but like most Curl Junkie products (most of which are just as good as this one)</li>
      <li>Really love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>It had a smooth, custard-like consistency, great slip, and it smelled like bananas.</li>
      <li>It ships and arrives fast, I have been using it for about a year now and still very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>nice smell (not too coconut smelling)  </li>
      <li>best in my whole life.</li>
      <li>But after reading many good reviews, I went with my gut and brought it the minute I got my pay check.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I used it as a moisturizing treatment, and as a leave-in on the more frizzy, kinky areas of my hair.</li>
      <li>just ok .</li>
      <li>okay?</li>
      <li>love it..</li>
      <li>And I LOVE the smell of Curl Rehab.</li>
      <li>Excellent deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I did love this product.</li>
      <li>I can go to CVS and get some cholesterol for a lot cheaper and it would work much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of that overwhelming coconut smell.</li>
      <li>That stuff is magical. :)</li>
      <li>this stuff was fantastic!</li>
      <li>This was more a hype, and nothing else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to buy this again if it goes on sale, though.</li>
      <li>This is a very rich, moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
      <li>for the price I was expecting amazing doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia or coconut just a light pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>do want to test its capabilities as a pre-poo (on dry &amp; damp hair) and as a leave-in condish and may purchase the Strawberry fragrance if I can catch a really good sale because this would be a great conditioner to use after a protein treatment or whenever my hair needs a moisture boost.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong in the shower but mostly rinses away.</li>
      <li>Great for highly porous fine hair....</li>
      <li>This is the BEST and most consistent deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend the Curls in a Bottle by Curl Junkie to go with this product.</li>
      <li>Good thing is that it works pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for ages.</li>
      <li>CIAB made my clumps and curls stay beautifully formed (even when I finger combed, they REFORMED), and this Curl Rehab kept my uberdry hair moisturized enough not to decurl into a frizz-bomb.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have 2c/3a, fine hair that is not porous at all.</li>
      <li>I have layered a penetrating conditioner like Giovanni Tea Tree or Sally&#x27;s GVP conditioning balm over it for the double conditioning method also called WCC method with great results.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>gardenia coconut smell is more pleasant than I expected.</li>
      <li>I have tried many and this is my favorite by far.</li>
      <li>and because it has aloe vera and shea butter in it, it serves as a great styler if you want to wear your hair out while it is deep conditioning ;-)</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>But now I have shiny, bouncy, super wavy hair...</li>
      <li>so I would be able to use it more often in my daily routine.</li>
      <li>Left my hair moisturized, very penetrating, great shine,</li>
      <li>After applying, I lightly spritz my hair with warm water and apply a second layer.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell -- more gardenia than coconut and strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
      <li>I really liked how my hair felt and would definitely re-purchase this product when I have the chance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly natural and isn&#x27;t full of silicones...which builds up so easily on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many high and low end products.</li>
      <li>I know, it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>If you can afford it, and you want happy curls, get the Daily Fix for washing, the Smoothing Conditioner to rinse out, the Curl Rehab to leave in (and deep treat), and the CIAB to define curls.</li>
      <li>I loved the way it made my hair soft and manageable after the deep conditioning process.</li>
      <li>Finally, I have paired it with Coconut Oil or a keratin protein conditioner like Camille Rose Coconut Water if my hair needs strength + moisture and it works very well like that.</li>
      <li>First, the scent.</li>
      <li>The KEY is to apply it damp so that it can soak into the hair and not just sit on top.</li>
      <li>Slight mix up with delivery but product makes my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
      <li>:) I really like the smell and as I was combing through my hair, it felt so light, buttery and fluffy</li>
      <li>It is pricey, but very effective at providing lasting moisture to dry, highly textured hair.</li>
      <li>Well, today, I have very nice third day hair (and for you air-drying or Pixie-curl-diffusing/scrunching curly-heads, you know how hard it is to have nice second day,</li>
      <li>but I definitely won&#x27;t  purchase this fragrance again - the Gardenia scent is too strong</li>
      <li>I have fine, low porosity 2B (I think 2b)</li>
      <li>so you do not have to use much.</li>
      <li>This was ultra-moisturizing and really quenched my hair.</li>
      <li>It really tackles the frizzies well.</li>
      <li>I was able to easily detangle my hair with a comb after leaving the product on for about 5 minutes; I then twisted my hair and kept it under a plastic cap &amp; towel for 1.5 hours before rinsing with cool water.  </li>
      <li>I use it on freshly washed hair that is damp (t-shirt dried) and apply it warm since my hair is low porosity.</li>
      <li>Same quick delivery I expect with Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good product not great... has slip and softens the hair temporarily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been hearing hype about CJ products, old and new.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I was really surprised that I didn&#x27;t need to use so much; I only took two scoops.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>My hair is shoulder length and naturally curly now for about 20 months.</li>
      <li>First time (writing a review ) long time (amazon customer).</li>
      <li>Put a cap on and set for an hour (I have pretty dry curls).</li>
      <li>product is the only one I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds in the past three months searching for good curly hair products) that has given my hair enough moisture to leave it moist the next day.</li>
      <li>I leave it in and it softens my hair and keeps it soft especially after I condition with Repair Me Reconstructive Hair treatment by Curl Junkie.</li>
      <li>I have rather coarse, curly hair and this leaves it soft and well moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Although it has a very thick consistency, it distributed easily in my hair and had my curls clumping instantly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a very rich, moisturizing conditioner.  I have rather coarse, curly hair and this leaves it soft and well moisturized.  It doesn&#x27;t contain silicones for those who prefer products without them.</li>
    <li> just ok . for the price I was expecting amazing doesn&#x27;t really smell like gardenia or coconut just a light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best--it&#x27;s soooooo moisturizing, and makes my hair feel incredible. I just discovered my hair loves this as a leave-in too. I know, it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Plus, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Also, I completely agree with the other reviewer about Curls in a Bottle! That stuff is magical. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been hearing hype about CJ products, old and new. I decided to try them. Well, today, I have very nice third day hair (and for you air-drying or Pixie-curl-diffusing/scrunching curly-heads, you know how hard it is to have nice second day, much less third day when your have a tight and frizz-prone dry hair type, like a 3b).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only one I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds in the past three months searching for good curly hair products) that has given my hair enough moisture to leave it moist the next day. The only one that tamed my straw-like ends into softness for 24 hours. (I lose moisture like mad, highly porous color-treated hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gardenia coconut smell is more pleasant than I expected. There is also the option of a strawberry scent I&#x27;ve heard smells scrumptious and I want to try next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend the Curls in a Bottle by Curl Junkie to go with this product. CIAB made my clumps and curls stay beautifully formed (even when I finger combed, they REFORMED), and this Curl Rehab kept my uberdry hair moisturized enough not to decurl into a frizz-bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly wonderful line. If you can afford it, and you want happy curls, get the Daily Fix for washing, the Smoothing Conditioner to rinse out, the Curl Rehab to leave in (and deep treat), and the CIAB to define curls. Wonderful stuff and it all smells GOOD.</li>
    <li> love it..smell amazing lots of creamy product and spreads wonderfully</li>
    <li> I leave this product on for longer than the recommended time - usually 2-3 hours.  My hair feels like silk after rinsing.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a treatment that didn&#x27;t require heat so I would be able to use it more often in my daily routine. I use it about once a week. I have fine, low porosity 2B (I think 2b) curly hair. I love this stuff!  I can get 3 day hair when I use this. It really tackles the frizzies well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell -- more gardenia than coconut and strong. I typically choose no fragrance products, but I like this enough that I forgive the smell and am buying a second. Using once a week, it has lasted several months.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I have very dry curly, frizzy hair. It was really no better than pantene as far as conditioning. I specifically wanted it because it sounded like it would smell delicious. In fact, it smells terrible. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is old and and so smells bad, but I was very disappointed. Also for the price you hardly get any product at all. Would not buy again. I can go to CVS and get some cholesterol for a lot cheaper and it would work much better.</li>
    <li> I have to fall in line with the rest of reviewers and say that this is a very nice conditioner.  Leaves hair crazy soft.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  I probably should&#x27;ve ordered the strawberry instead.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant buying this product because it was a little expensive in comparison to other products I buy for my hair. But after reading many good reviews, I went with my gut and brought it the minute I got my pay check. The first time I used it, I was really surprised that I didn&#x27;t need to use so much; I only took two scoops. :) I really like the smell and as I was combing through my hair, it felt so light, buttery and fluffy lol. I really liked how my hair felt and would definitely re-purchase this product when I have the chance.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim. I have frizzy hair that has to be flat ironed daily. I used this product and it worked GREAT! No need for the flat iron with this. Can&#x27;t use coconut oil because I have protein sensitive hair. :(  Small amount of this goes a long way! Really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells great and softens my hair beautifully. I use this once a week. Overall a good product. Good thing is that it works pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for ages.</li>
    <li> I mixed this product in with a home remedy hair moisturizer. Put a cap on and set for an hour (I have pretty dry curls). By itself, this product is not runny but also not very creamy to the touch. Like I mentioned, I mixed it with a home remedy and together it made my hair silky.</li>
    <li> Excellent deep conditioner. I have very thick, long curly hair which tends to be pretty dry. This was ultra-moisturizing and really quenched my hair. My only wish is that it came in a bigger container as I used the entire jar in 2.5 deep conditioning sessions.</li>
    <li> CJCR is an excellent moisturizing hair treatment that I used as a DC after shampooing my hair.  Although it has a very thick consistency, it distributed easily in my hair and had my curls clumping instantly.  I was able to easily detangle my hair with a comb after leaving the product on for about 5 minutes; I then twisted my hair and kept it under a plastic cap &amp; towel for 1.5 hours before rinsing with cool water.  I loved the way my hair felt afterwards but I definitely won&#x27;t  purchase this fragrance again - the Gardenia scent is too strong and I found it very unpleasant although thankfully it didn&#x27;t linger after the rinse out.  The product is also very expensive at $20 for an 8 oz jar and given my tendency to be heavy-handed,  I may only get 3 or 4 uses out of it (I used about 1/3 of the jar for one wash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to test its capabilities as a pre-poo (on dry &amp; damp hair) and as a leave-in condish and may purchase the Strawberry fragrance if I can catch a really good sale because this would be a great conditioner to use after a protein treatment or whenever my hair needs a moisture boost.</li>
    <li> I did love this product. It had a smooth, custard-like consistency, great slip, and it smelled like bananas. I used it as a moisturizing treatment, and as a leave-in on the more frizzy, kinky areas of my hair. It worked great for both, but like most Curl Junkie products (most of which are just as good as this one) I just cannot justify the price. It&#x27;s a solid product but not a miracle worker. Ultimately, there are just cheaper products out there that yield the same results. I&#x27;d love to buy this again if it goes on sale, though.</li>
    <li> Great for highly porous fine hair....I really enjoy using this product. It&#x27;s mostly natural and isn&#x27;t full of silicones...which builds up so easily on my hair.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have 2c/3a, fine hair that is not porous at all. I have struggled to find a good conditioner. This has become my &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; (I only wash my hair twice a week) conditioner. There&#x27;s just nothing else that will work. The smell, however, is hideous. Who comes up with these combinations? It&#x27;s truly awful and does linger, so be aware. The smell does subside after a few hours, but in the meantime...</li>
    <li> Came on time and wrapped well, nothing but praise there.  I tried to use this twice, but the smell was so terrible.  I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  Quite a few of the hair products for curly hair are like this, however.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  Maybe the ingredients don&#x27;t smell very good and the strong fragrance is there to cover it up.  This combination of coconut and gardenia was the worst.</li>
    <li> First, the scent. I don&#x27;t know what Gardenia-Coconut is supposed to smell like, but to me this smelled like one of those stores where you go to buy healing crystals and incense and a sage smudge. The scent is strong in the shower but mostly rinses away. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and this wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product in three different ways, so I&#x27;ll review it that way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a daily moisturizer - it worked great, but it&#x27;s too pricey for me to use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a deep conditioning treatment - it did okay. I prefer the Ouidad brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*After coloring - wooo boy this stuff was fantastic! If I buy it again it&#x27;ll be to use only after I color.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for six years on and off as a leave-in and deep conditioner. It is pricey, but very effective at providing lasting moisture to dry, highly textured hair. It is so moisturizing that I have over-conditioned with it a few times so it does not need to be used every week. I use it on freshly washed hair that is damp (t-shirt dried) and apply it warm since my hair is low porosity. The KEY is to apply it damp so that it can soak into the hair and not just sit on top. After applying, I lightly spritz my hair with warm water and apply a second layer.  A little goes a long way with this so you do not have to use much. I let it sit in my hair anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours and because it has aloe vera and shea butter in it, it serves as a great styler if you want to wear your hair out while it is deep conditioning ;-) I would recommend this to anyone with dry hair or who goes through an occasional dry spell, especially for the Winter seasons when the indoor and outdoor air can be drying. I have layered a penetrating conditioner like Giovanni Tea Tree or Sally&#x27;s GVP conditioning balm over it for the double conditioning method also called WCC method with great results.  Finally, I have paired it with Coconut Oil or a keratin protein conditioner like Camille Rose Coconut Water if my hair needs strength + moisture and it works very well like that.</li>
    <li> First time (writing a review ) long time (amazon customer). This product is a bit expensive but a quality product. The jar was a bit smaller than I expected but I got several deep condition sessions out of it. My hair is shoulder length and naturally curly now for about 20 months. Left my hair moisturized, very penetrating, great shine, nice smell (not too coconut smelling)  I&#x27;m not a fan of that overwhelming coconut smell. Same quick delivery I expect with Amazon. Product was delivered the same week (few days later) of placing the order. I plan to try another Curl Junkie product and I would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> I love all of the scents and products for my curly hair!!! Use this 3 days/week and my curls are perfect</li>
    <li> Good product not great... has slip and softens the hair temporarily. However, it gets 3 stars for the small size and the price. I will not be purchasing this again due the price and the fact Cream Nature&#x27;s Argan Hair masque do this same thing for fraction of the price. Its hair not cashmere okay?</li>
    <li> The product worked great for me. I loved the way it made my hair soft and manageable after the deep conditioning process.</li>
    <li> My hair did not feel moisturized with this conditioner. This was more a hype, and nothing else. You never know it might work for someone else.But for me it did not work.</li>
    <li> My hair hates protein and any humectant such as glycerin. I have coarse 2c wavy hair and have been battling dry hair forever. I&#x27;ve tried many, many high and low end products. This is the BEST and most consistent deep conditioner. I use it everyday because of dry climate. After using curl rehab in shower, I use Aussie leave-in and scrunch. Then I scrunch in Aussie volumizing mousse. It took me a long time to find this product combination/routine because of dry climate and protein-hating hair. But now I have shiny, bouncy, super wavy hair...best in my whole life. And I LOVE the smell of Curl Rehab. It smells like a yummy cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I leave it in and it softens my hair and keeps it soft especially after I condition with Repair Me Reconstructive Hair treatment by Curl Junkie.</li>
    <li> Slight mix up with delivery but product makes my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
    <li> It is really hard to find products that work for my naturally curly hair. My hair gets really dry and I need a heavy duty conditioner. I have tried many and this is my favorite by far. It ships and arrives fast, I have been using it for about a year now and still very happy with the product.</li>
