      <li>Its nice</li>
      <li>Then, I can&#x27;t say how effective it is, since mask is a mask</li>
      <li>Feels nice and smell amazing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this mask is perfect.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin super bright and glowing.</li>

      <li>This masque is gentle and smells great.</li>

      <li>love Eminence products.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a year and really love the smoothness and fragrance</li>
      <li>love the color, the bits of strawberry pulp, and the yoghurt-like custardy texture.</li>
      <li>Love this masque.</li>

      <li>It comes in pretty packaging and smell good</li>
      <li>Even though it feels light, it&#x27;s super hydrating and smells AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>Eminence has excellent products, hands down.  </li>
      <li>I will be using this to get a quick and refreshing pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a great daily 5 minute \\&quot;Face Food\\&quot;, that lightly refines, tones, lightly hydrates, and smoothes the skin very quickly.</li>
      <li>Leaves a smooth texture to skin and revitalizes after Polisher</li>
      <li>Good quality skin product with all natural ingredients</li>
      <li>Feels nice and smells good, but doesn&#x27;t deliver the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; results I&#x27;m used to with other products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite one and a must-have staple in my very large mask collection.</li>
      <li>It really makes the skin look healthy and fresh.</li>
      <li>, however I prefer the clear skin masque better.</li>
      <li>I made my own scrub for years, very simple.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much, I now use only Eminence as my skin care.  </li>
      <li>its effect, as for now, it&#x27;s good enough, since I am sensitive skin, this product not hurt my face...</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth after each use.</li>
      <li>So fresh and like real strawberry!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really think its worth the amount that they charge.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Eminence, and once a year, i stock up on their masques -- i buy the huge 8.4 oz professional size tubs, which are a much better cost-per-use than the dinky shallow jars.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great prep for further masks or for allowing your serums and creams to soak, as it helps shed the dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>This one is very nourishing and skin softening, very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>soothing, comforting, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>clears skin with salicylic acid, but gently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and not harsh on my skin like some of the other masks.</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh strawberries and has actual chunks of fruit in it.  </li>
      <li>This is the first masque I&#x27;ve  used that hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out or caused further problems with acne, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light AHA based mask, slightly refining (not strong as my beloved REN Glycolactic) but gentle and low acid enough to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it would take time to clear.</li>
      <li>This mask is so lush.</li>
      <li>I have a bit of oily skin, so I think I&#x27;ll alternate between the clear skin masque and this strawberry rhubarb masque, for clear, soft, age-defying skin!</li>
      <li>But I decide to use this product in the near several month!</li>
      <li>Instead, i&#x27;ll purchase it directly from my spa even if it is more expensive.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll definitely be using this a few times a week.</li>
<li> Combine a small amount on finger tips with a few drops of water and rub into face and neck until it rubs in completely.  </li>
<li> I use this 3-4 times a week, and usually follow with a hydrating mask to further add moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually shy away from organic skincare products because I equate organic -&gt; gentle -&gt; ineffective!</li>
<li> The KEY is to use a tiny amount (tip of finger) and to run your other hand under water and rub them together until the masque is thin and slippery and then to massage it into your face.  </li>
<li> I only do this with their clearish gel-based masks as they can be hard to spread, and water helps it glide evenly.</li>
<li> why give your skin less?</li>
<li> Eminence recommends you dilute their masks with a few drops of water as they are \\&quot;concentrated\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Wow, was my intuition wrong!</li>
<li> When I washed, my skin \\&quot;glowed\\&quot; and appeared to plump up, at least for the morning.</li>
<li> Sorry eminence this one did not work for me.</li>
<li> The fragrance is artificial (listed as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; on the ingredient listing)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and really love the smoothness and fragrance</li>
    <li> Its nice but I don&#x27;t really think its worth the amount that they charge. I made my own scrub for years, very simple. This doesn&#x27;t work any better. It comes in pretty packaging and smell good but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Way over priced.</li>
    <li> Eminence has excellent products, hands down.  I like this masque, however I prefer the clear skin masque better. This one is very nourishing and skin softening, very moisturizing.  I have a bit of oily skin, so I think I&#x27;ll alternate between the clear skin masque and this strawberry rhubarb masque, for clear, soft, age-defying skin!</li>
    <li> Feels nice and smells good, but doesn&#x27;t deliver the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; results I&#x27;m used to with other products.</li>
    <li> I usually shy away from organic skincare products because I equate organic -&gt; gentle -&gt; ineffective! I was given a sample at a spa in Williamsburg, VA to try. Wow, was my intuition wrong! The product smells heavenly (not perfume-y), has a good texture and dries quickly. When I washed, my skin \\&quot;glowed\\&quot; and appeared to plump up, at least for the morning. I will be using this to get a quick and refreshing pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> I truly like the way this masque feels on my face.  It is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
    <li> Love this masque.It really makes the skin look healthy and fresh.Feels nice and smell amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say give it a go.</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and prone to breakouts, so I was concerned about using a masque. This is the first masque I&#x27;ve  used that hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out or caused further problems with acne, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I&#x27;ve used a number of Eminence&#x27;s products and have yet to find one I don&#x27;t like.  They all smell terrific besides!</li>
    <li> love it after microdermabrasion, or after a peel! soothing, comforting, very moisturizing. clears skin with salicylic acid, but gently. great!</li>
    <li> This is my VERY favorite Eminence product!!!!! Skin is so hydrated , best at home facial. Try it. Great price</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Eminence, and once a year, i stock up on their masques -- i buy the huge 8.4 oz professional size tubs, which are a much better cost-per-use than the dinky shallow jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite one and a must-have staple in my very large mask collection. It&#x27;s a light AHA based mask, slightly refining (not strong as my beloved REN Glycolactic) but gentle and low acid enough to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, the bits of strawberry pulp, and the yoghurt-like custardy texture. The fragrance is artificial (listed as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; on the ingredient listing) but i don&#x27;t care --- it is delicious and heavenly, and makes the masque process so indulgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a once-a-week exfoliating peel/masque --it&#x27;s simply not strong enough, and the level of AHA is too low. But it&#x27;s a great daily 5 minute \\&quot;Face Food\\&quot;, that lightly refines, tones, lightly hydrates, and smoothes the skin very quickly. Your face just feels SO good after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great prep for further masks or for allowing your serums and creams to soak, as it helps shed the dead skin cells. I use this 3-4 times a week, and usually follow with a hydrating mask to further add moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: Eminence recommends you dilute their masks with a few drops of water as they are \\&quot;concentrated\\&quot;. I only do this with their clearish gel-based masks as they can be hard to spread, and water helps it glide evenly. But I NEVER do this with their cream-based masks --why dilute the potency? why give your skin less? I want to give my skin full-strength nourishment so with the Strawberry Rhubarb (cream-based), i bring it on full-force. No dilution necessary.</li>
    <li> This smells delicious and does the job hydrating and softening the skin.</li>
    <li> I loved eminence&#x27;s oil so I thought I would give this a try.  Well I noticed everytime I would use It I get a pimple....I tried it 4 times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.  I would get just one pimple a day or two after use.  But, it&#x27;s always the type of pimple that leaves a scar and it would take time to clear. It smells delicious wish I could eat it but, I&#x27;m throwing it away!  Sorry eminence this one did not work for me.</li>
    <li> excellent to use after microderm polisher.  Leaves a smooth texture to skin and revitalizes after Polisher</li>
    <li> This mask is delicious.  It smells like fresh strawberries and has actual chunks of fruit in it.  It leaves your skin like silk after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Eminence products.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found out you can use this product as a nighttime moisturizer.  Combine a small amount on finger tips with a few drops of water and rub into face and neck until it rubs in completely.  Wash off the next morning.  You will be amazed at how your skin feels!</li>
    <li> This masque is gentle and smells great.</li>
    <li> I like its strawberry taste! So fresh and like real strawberry!&lt;br /&gt;For its effect, as for now, it&#x27;s good enough, since I am sensitive skin, this product not hurt my face... Then, I can&#x27;t say how effective it is, since mask is a mask, it cannot change your skin magically in a short time. But I decide to use this product in the near several month! I also bought its cherry taste one, it&#x27;s also good, helps my pore!</li>
    <li> Works as was advertised,like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  The KEY is to use a tiny amount (tip of finger) and to run your other hand under water and rub them together until the masque is thin and slippery and then to massage it into your face.  Never use it alone--the directions specifically say to use water to emulsify it.  Even though it feels light, it&#x27;s super hydrating and smells AMAZING.  My skin feels great and is better hydrated than it&#x27;s ever been.  I loved this product so much, I now use only Eminence as my skin care.  And, on the advice of my esthetician, I use this masque AS MY NIGHT MOISTURIZER.  I don&#x27;t wash it off at all.</li>
    <li> Good quality skin product with all natural ingredients plus it smells sooo good. My skin feels soft and smooth after each use.</li>
    <li> This mask is so lush. Smells incredible. Feels incredible. Makes your skin super bright and glowing. Best if you use it after exfoliating and moisturize after. Love!</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products and have been using them for 9 months. I have sensitive skin and this mask is perfect. It&#x27;s refreshing and not harsh on my skin like some of the other masks. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this a few times a week. I would give it 5 stars but the protective seal seemed to have been taken off then put back on which I didn&#x27;t like. I won&#x27;t be ordering from seller again. Instead, i&#x27;ll purchase it directly from my spa even if it is more expensive.</li>
