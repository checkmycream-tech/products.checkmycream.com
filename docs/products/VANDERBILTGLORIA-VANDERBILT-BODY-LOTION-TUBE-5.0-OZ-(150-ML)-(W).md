<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this body lotion for the fragrance, but think that it is too thin.  Years ago this was a nice thick lotion that left you feeling soft and smelling great.  It&#x27;s as though they cut it with water.  I would like an explanation from someone about the difference between the old stuff and the newer.</li>
    <li> I am not so sure about the product. It does not seem to hold its fragrance. This has never been the case with it before so I am not sure what might be the issue with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Considering this product was shipped from Germany to the U.S. it arrived super fast.  This has been my favorite perfume for years and  wish I could find it in the stores again.  Please bring it back!!  I get many compliments on Vanderbilt.  I try other perfumes and nothing compares, not even the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite; she loved it. On time delivery as well</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I wish it were available in local stores like the cologne is.</li>
    <li> It has a rich smell.  Very satisfied.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Arrive in good time. I wanted this for my mother, who loves this stuff, for Christmas. This is hard to find in the US.</li>
    <li> Have evaluated this product previously. Please don&#x27;t ask again.</li>
    <li> very nice scent and my skin feels so soft</li>
    <li> I have used the body lotion and perfume for over 20 yrs. I had always used Avon skin care &amp; perfumes before. Vanderbilt lotion &amp; perfume was given to me as a gift.  The perfume has a very soft floral fragrance (which many people comment about...what are you wearing, it&#x27;s so nice) and the body lotion keeps my skin so soft, especially in the winter.  Was happy to find this at Amazon as it is hard to find in most local stores anymore.  Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> This is my MOMs all time favorite lotion, very difficult to fine but for the joy she expresses when she receive it is worth the search..</li>
    <li> Thank you. My mother&#x27;s favorite scent. She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have used Gloria Vanderbilt Lotion for years, I really love it.  When I am unable to get it I get very upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CD&#x27;s are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dr. Hook  pedal to steering wheel, I use whenever I drive my Golf cart to do shopping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> The company you do business with Rite-Choice57 did not send me the product I ordered. What they sent was over 15 years old and was rancid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very difficult getting them to send me a RMA which I finally received. I have sent to order back for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did not let me know when I would receive my refund as they do not communicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this company minus zero!!!</li>
    <li> :Love this lotion&#x27;s scents like all of Vanderbilt.  This does leave me dry at times, but I just add it to mineral oil and it works great.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this scent for 30 years; wish I could buy it in a store.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s getting hard to find and Amazon came to my rescue once again.</li>
    <li> I oredered one first and when it came i ordered another cause I like it so much.  Ive been trying to get this product for about 4 years and finally got what I wanted. thank you</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift for a friend.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied. My mother thought this was not sold in the US anymore</li>
    <li> Very little scent. I hoped for more.</li>
    <li> loved the fragrance for years!  However still waiting on 4 more bottles I ordered from you</li>
    <li> Not as good as the body lotion they use to have. A little on the thin side. and fragrance does not last as long. Better than nothing</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion. Only scent I can wear as I am allergic to all others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother-in-law, as she gives it to one of her friends every year for Christmas, but this year no stores were carrying it. It arrived perfectly on time, and it was exactly how I expected it to be. It didn&#x27;t come in the box, but you could tell it had never been opened or used. I have absolutely no complaints about the product or seller.</li>
    <li> I have only used four perfumes in my entire life (I&#x27;m over 60) and Gloria Vanderbilt Perfume and Perfumed Body Lotion Is the best of all.  I have used it for over 20 years and hope to use it another 20.  Sometimes when I pass the perfume counter at the department stores I will take their sample paper square and check it out while I&#x27;m shopping but nothing  comes close to my Gloria Vanderbilt.  Try it you just might like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irma</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I expeceted.  Ilove it</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Just not the price :(</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it&#x27;s hard to find.....</li>
    <li> I have been buying this sent for years. However, this order does not have the full strength of the perfume; not what i expected to experience..</li>
