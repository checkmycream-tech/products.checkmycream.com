    <li> I called the company Plant Therapy to check &amp; they called back right away to assure me that all their Organic essential oils are certified organic. I purchased the Organic lavender, Lemon &amp; Lemon Grass &amp; am so happy with the quality that I&#x27;ll order the rest of their organic oils as well. I use these mixed with a carrier, for shower oil, in a diffuser for aromatherapy or in my massage oils.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great product. Good value!</li>
    <li> Another great oil from Plant Therapy. Very pleased with quality, shipping and delivery.</li>
    <li> I use lemon oil as one of the ingredients in my homemade all-purpose cleaner.  It works great for cleaning bathrooms, the kitchen, and even windows!</li>
    <li> Not sure how I feel about this. Although it smelled very good. I didn&#x27;t think it was strong enough for my needs. I used it to add scent to my homemade Shea butter so I could have LESS of the Shea smell and it took the ENTIRE bottle. Needless to say my attempt to save money by making my own butters turned out to be VERY expensive since I was only able to get one use out of it. It wasn&#x27;t a big batch of the mix either. I may purchase this again and this time try using it with raw mango butter since that is said to have a less potent smell then Shea. I will say the longer my butter sat(over a few weeks) the more lemony it seemed to smell so I won&#x27;t totally count this out yet.</li>
    <li> Arrived safe and sound in a timely manner. Wonderful lemon oil and I love that it&#x27;s organic!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong choosing to buy this oil, it&#x27;s very good, very strong and the best to use for whatever you need lemon essential oil for!</li>
    <li> Look, some companies are charging 10x the price for a lesser quality product.  VERY pleasant scent and a high quality</li>
    <li> I really like this product along with the other oils I purchased.  I use them quite often.  I also shared this information with some of my friends.</li>
    <li> Used the product to treat a foot ward after reading suggestions about Lemon Oil. It took 6 weeks of religious application to the spot!  It worked! I am not a believer!!! by example! Thank you for your good product!!!</li>
    <li> This came fast and was exactly what I was looking for. Has worked wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I have looked for the organic 30ml bottle and cannot find it, please make a 30ml bottle of this stuff and you will have a forever customer.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lemons ... fresh and clean. It does brighten up my spirit, and Plant Therapy has delivered a healthy organic lemon oil I feel I can trust.  I will be buying more essential oils from this company.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is wonderful to the senses</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is and the taste is very good.  I use lemon essential oil in my water a lot and this brand is very good.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil that I use to break up lung congestion.  I place a few drops on the bottom of the feet or on the chest.  You must use a carrier oil with it, otherwise it will burn your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Organic Lemon from plant Therapy !  I wish Amazon sold the 30ml thou I use it so much I need alot more than 10ml ! But will buy again !!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat their prices for the quality.</li>
    <li> Used for making Thieves Oil...great!!!! I am impressed with the brand, the quality, the shipping, the packing...the whole shabang. As good as it gets.</li>
    <li> Amazing in a diffuser blend with organic peppermint and organic orange essential oils!  Gives a joyous feeling to rooms when diffused 5-10 minutes per hour.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my preferred Lemon Essential oil for my homemade&#x27;thieves&#x27; blend when I eliminate the use of rosemary essential oil for those with allergies to that herb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lemon oil is superior as flavoring for my favorite cream cheese pound cake and, any thin frostings or cream cheese toppings I make for carrot cake.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> Quality oil without the higher prices of others. I buy this on a regular basis and have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> I used it for cleaning. I used it for cooking.</li>
