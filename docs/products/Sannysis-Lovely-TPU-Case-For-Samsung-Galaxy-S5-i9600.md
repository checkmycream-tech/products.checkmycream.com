    <li> I love love love this case. Its cute, its makes my phone look bigger and its protective. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. I recommend this case.</li>

    <li> Feels safer than my last case, decent quality, and fits the phone well. Shipping took longer than everything I bought the same day, but it was worth it. Feels good and is super cute!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, strong case.</li>
    <li> The cutest case ever, I feel that it protects my phone too. Great price, it&#x27;s a steal. Overall happy with my purchase. Comes a little late but still happy with it. (:</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive,  but I really like it.</li>
    <li> The bumper is a tad bit hard to put on and it&#x27;s so thin so I thought I was going to break it then when I finally got it on it looks really nice but I didn&#x27;t realize that it had a protective plastic on the elephant part then if you choose to take it off its hard as heck to take off but as you get use to it it will get easier also I have dropped phone about 4 times and it protects it so it&#x27;s a good case</li>
    <li> I like the case. It was no more than $3 with free shipping. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> I like, however, it could have been just a little more sturdy. I do have to take in consideration of the price...it is really cute.</li>
    <li> The buttons for the volume make this my all time favorite phone case.</li>
    <li> The case itself is very beautiful and is not too bulky, but the only thing I&#x27;m concerned about is the snugness of the blue ring that goes on the edge?? It was awfully hard to get on and I&#x27;m sure it will be to take off but other than that everything is great! :)</li>
    <li> I think this is my favorite case out of all of the cases I&#x27;ve ever bought. very cute! And it got here way earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy phone case that seems to be holding up. I bought it back in February and it took a couple weeks before I got it and I almost forgot I had ordered it. However, the quality of the case is good. It fits my phone perfectly. The only problem is that I have to take the case off in order to charge my phone because where it is to charge the phone, I can&#x27;t get my seal undone without using a paperclip or taking off the case.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality,  says case is for a galaxy s5 and it doesn&#x27;t even fit on my s5.</li>
    <li> Protects my phone and looks so cute. Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Got it earlier than expected! I absolutely love it! Would so recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great cover for how inexpensive it is.  Snug fit and easy to hold. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s so cute. When I received it, it looked like the corner was peeling but it was just a protector for the design which I appreciated greatly. Although I love it, I only gave it 4 stars because it took a little while to arrive and I&#x27;m not sure if the design might fade... (I hope not) other than that, great product, great price.</li>
