    <li> This brand is amazing! It really makes the hair smooth and hydrated. You will notice a difference the first time. Even after styling my hair, it still felt smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best deep conditioners for your money. Buying in bulk is the best way to get more conditioner for your money.</li>
    <li> YOU MUST USE WARM WATER TO WASH THIS OUT.  Was recommended this after my Japanese straightening to help keep my hair straight. FINALLY bought it after years of wanting to, but what a mistake...  I have dyed red hair as well (not orange- but, red). So you faux-red-heads know that you can&#x27;t use warm water to wash your hair! This conditioner got stuck in my hair! It was so sticky and gross. And it made my hair feel stringy.  The second time I tried it (was determined to have it work!): After shampooing, I used warm water and a TINY bit of shampoo (again! just to make sure it came out), and it mostly came out. Faded my color with the warm water, but I was hopeful for some amazing results. It did make my hair straighter. However, again, it made it feel very stringy and tangly, more than it was before, just like last time.  I guess if you don&#x27;t have fine hair and you also have less chemically-treated hair (i.e. JUST Japanese straightening), then it may work well for you. But just remember you need warm water to get it out, so: special-color-dyed heads, beware. Also, remember it is a VERY HEAVY conditioner.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product leaves my hair sooooo soft and easily manageable</li>
    <li> I have my hair Japanese Straightened (thermal reconditioned) and this is what they recommend using.. but I use it all year!  I have never had any issues with dry hair or breakage.. everyone is constantly complimenting my hair.  I will only use this product from now on.  (I just buy this refill bag and put it into a small Gladware container in smaller amounts in my shower!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for 6 years. I think is awesome, specially after coloring. A little goes a long way. Leaves hair silky sooth.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!!!! Great for my Japanese hair straightening!</li>
    <li> Great shipping, price, and even better product.  Keep the original jar  you got it in from the hair salon and refill with this.</li>
    <li> Great deep treatment for hair. It will help your hair if it&#x27;s dyed or if you&#x27;ve had treatments. You can leave it on as a mask too and take it off later. You hair will feel soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner... You save some money by buying the refill.  Additionally, you do your part for the environment!</li>
    <li> Does the job right! I love how it makes my hair feel, especially after blow drying the hair. An absolute must have!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I need to get it in  big quantities.  It took my color treated, sun damaged, straw like hair to a new level - on first use!  A friend introduced it to me and I&#x27;ve used it ever since!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for dry, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for several years and it&#x27;s great for color treated hair.  The big refill bag seems like the way to go!</li>
    <li> this is awesome. It&#x27;s the only conditioner I know that my hair won&#x27;t get used to it. if feels like it&#x27;s the first time using it every time. It works for my Japanese blowout but I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s virgin hair and works great. Hair is soft, super shiny and not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past six years - and as the title of the review says, it is \\&quot;Awesome!\\&quot; My hair is extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using it,  I couldn&#x27;t believe how it detangled my hair - no pain, no tugging - and how silky and baby soft my hair was after it dried. (The woman who did the Japanese Straight treatment on my hair gave me a jar - and told me to use it),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, my hair was half-way down my back. Recently I cut a lot of the length away (it&#x27;s above my shoulders now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product still works as it did six years ago - and my hair feels and looks \\&quot;Awesome.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake - I had run out of the product, so I used a regular conditioner on my hair that I had in the house. I immediately looked for a salon who sold this - because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with my hair until I started using it again.)</li>
    <li> Love this conditionrr</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair very healthy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and get exact product</li>
