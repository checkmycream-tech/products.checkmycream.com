<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this as it&#x27;s hard to find tweezers that actually grab well and work. These can get those tough and fine hairs. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to love this tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job just like my $5 tweezer I got from Wal-Mart. No worse, no better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping this review goes through.  Everytime I try to submit it, nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had written a longer review....but it&#x27;s really unnecessary.  There are other slant tweezers out there that cost less money that work the same way.</li>
    <li> These work great.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers at a reasonable price.  Work just as well as tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Awesome tweezers.  Able to get the fine hairs in one tug.  Great delivery time by vendor.</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers for model building. They have the right strength and precision for my purposes. Thanks Castle Rock!</li>
    <li> This is one great and awesome item that I have ever gotten and I am glad that I got it I would never give it away. I hope I never lose it if I do I will be getting more. Even without losing it I will still be getting more for me to have extra and also be getting them as gifts. They are so strong and durable you can use them to pull out the finest hair. They are slanted too I think that telos them to work better and with them being stainless steel I don&#x27;t gave to worry about them rusting or wearing down. Thanks for such a great item.</li>
    <li> This thing grips stray hairs better than any other tweezer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The hubby ruined the old tweezers I&#x27;ve been using for years.  They&#x27;re his now.  Lol.  With these being pink, maybe he&#x27;ll leave this one alone, right?  Seriously, they work better than anything I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
    <li> Not as precise as Tweezerman, but work pretty well for the price. The title overstates the precision of these tweezers.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used--better than Tweezerman!  Love the color too.  It makes them easy to locate.</li>
    <li> The best tweezers I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever used. The tips are so well designed.</li>
    <li> No good. Very cheap. Do not waste your money..</li>
    <li> Useless! Worked one time and then won&#x27;t work again. I thought I was buying Tweezeman Tweezers, but ended up with this knock-off. I would return, however I threw the packing away.</li>
    <li> Rough edges.  The tweezer works fine, but the slanted edges are very rough, so I would not buy this again.  I actually got an email from the seller asking if I had any issues with them....they really wanted it hear.  I emailed them with my problem about the rough edges but never heard anything back.</li>
    <li> Love these little tweezers. They&#x27;re pricier compared to others, but they do the job right the first time. They make it easy to get those pesky little hairs as well. They also come with a nice case to keep them clean. Happy with this purchase and I plan to have them for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers.  They are the perfect weight to hold in your hand and the tip is good for doing all sorts of things with.  They aren&#x27;t too big and fit perfectly in my makeup bag in my purse.  I can carry them with me everywhere and I love that.  The best thing is that they are pink! Will be purchasing more sets for gifts around the holidays.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I bought these at a sale price on amazon for my daughter!  These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve had mine for months.  They work just as good today as they did brand new.  My daughter will love the color! She would sometimes take mine ams is have to find in her room.  Now she has her own that she loves!</li>
    <li> I have had wonderful tweezers - these are not it. They are not slanted enough - I don&#x27;t need a tutorial on how to use tweezers!! Am dissappointed.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very simple yet effective. Having the slanted tip really makes it easier to grab a hair, splitter or anything you may need to use tweezers for. I really like the pink shafts on them and them being lighter weight then normal tweezers makes it easier to handle them. I would recommend all to try since we use them for many different reasons .</li>
    <li> These tweezers work very well.  They are pointy enough to grab onto those unwanted hairs and pull them out the first time without having to repeat the process over and over and irritate your skin.  A wonderful set of tweezers at a fair price!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable quality - especially at the price point!!  VERY sharp tip works perfectly for precision tweezing but be careful, as these are not your typical dull tweezers.  I have used Tweezerman brand for years, and thought I would never try another brand.  But I am happy I did, as these are pretty, comfortably sized, and expertly crafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I gave these Pink stainless steel slant tweezers 5 stars because I cannot go higher . I use to pluck my eyebrows and I am COMPLETELY satisfied (more than satisfied) . One of the things I really like about these tweezers are the ARE slightly larger than ones that I have used in the past . They grip on whatever you use them on .I highly recommend these tweezers . If you have trouble holding on to small objects , these might just be the answer (EVEN IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TROUBLE HOLDING SMALL THINGS , THESE FOR LACK OF OTHER WORDS , ARE SPOT ON ) Try &amp; see what you think ......</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome! Very precise, and no squinting required.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a pair of Revlon tweezers that died after 15+ years of daily use. I loved them. They were great. I was bummed. These suck. They break the hair- they very rarely are able to pull the hair out at the root. I&#x27;m ordering another brand of tweezers to replace these.</li>
    <li> These are  effective right out of the  box... Got  them to  replace  a  pair  that I  think  have  dulled.</li>
    <li> Ok. So I&#x27;ve been using tweezers since middle school (going on 30 years)for my full brows and these are the best tweezers I have ever used. They are sharp, grab all types of hair, and have a great grip like handle. They are nothing like your typical drug store variety. They are professional grade. Try these! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Have used tweezerman&#x27;s for years and these are just as good.</li>
    <li> This  is  the  best  tweezers I ever bought</li>
    <li> With chopsticks work better</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers by mistake - had thought I was purchasing TweezerMan.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very disappointed to see I bought a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought I&#x27;d give it a try...and wow, was I surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great tweezer, pulls out all the hairs, even the ones my old one never could grab.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t cut or bruise my eyebrows or the skin around my eyes, like many tweezers do.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product - try it for yourself and see!</li>
    <li> I ordered these tweezers because of a promotion that I was offered. I intended on them being my on the go tweezers. They are ok. They aren&#x27;t my tweezermans.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, thanks!</li>
    <li> Hmmmmph. This is a hard review to write. The tweezers are great, they grab easily, they pull without slipping, they are comfortable and strong, they don&#x27;t cut hairs instead of pulling. I like them as much as my tweezerman ones which are also awesome. But I got my tweezermans on sale for the price these are at for retail, so for that, i would go with tweezerman if i was given the option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the revlon ones which are cheaper and work great too. That would be these (http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Expert-Tweezer-Slant-Tip/dp/B0000532A2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426493012&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;revlon+tweezers) I&#x27;d say they are better quality than the revlons though, so it depends on current prices. For a few dollars more I would go with these, but then for a few dollars more than these I would go with tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for nice quality slant tweezers that are up there with the big name for about 8 bucks cheaper these are a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these at a discount during a promotion in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Did not have a good experience with these tweezers. They will not grasp hair. Not sure if I got a dud pair of tweezers, but I will be looking for a replacement for these.</li>
    <li> That what I am looking for. I like the design and the color. Perfect for my travel bag when I need it and easy notice the color.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you it takes a lot for me to post a bad review. These are awful!!!  I always buy based on the reviews and generally don&#x27;t go wrong. I was so confident I bought 2.  Well there were worthless. I actually thought it might be me maybe since the angle of the tip of my previous tweezer&#x27;s was different I thought it may be related to how I was using it. One of my daughters took the second pair and despite her saying at first that they were good she later agreed that they did not work at all. They are probably as good as what you would get in a relatively cheap kit that comes with the nail clippers, scissors etc!  So disappointed, and buy the time if figured it out I had thrown out all the packaging so didn&#x27;t even bother to try to return.......stay away!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. The ends line up perfectly and always get the exact eyebrow hair every time. (I hated when I would accidently pull out the wrong hairs with other tweezers). These are perfect and cute!</li>
    <li> Not appreciably better than less costly try tweezers . guess I&#x27;ll have to go the big bucks</li>
    <li> These are dangerous!  The slants are rough and thick and no very graceful. If you&#x27;re used to using Anastasia brand tweezers these things are like using a hammer to pluck your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Beautiful , easy to find, love the case &amp; the grip</li>
    <li> These are a good, bright color that helps them from getting lost, as tweezers tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is similar to the ubiquitous Tweezerman tweezers. I have those as well. They are both very good, but these work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Tweezerman will resharpen their tweezers. But, honestly, who does that? Have you ever sent in a pair of tweezers to be resharpened? I guess if I were a professional, and used them all day, every day, that would be worthwhile. But for the average consumer, this just feels like a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these, and would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2015</li>
    <li> I bought 3 and gave 2 to family. The tips remain sharp to extract the ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t pluck. That may be a sin, but I don&#x27;t. What I do need tweezers for is my first-aid kit. Someone in our family always has a splinter, ingrown hair, or stitches. The tweezers which come in first-aid kits are unattractive and inaccurate. This tweezer is stylish and precise. I love its design. I love that it closes evenly. The tips even exhibit special gripper pads to help pull that errant hair or stitch. I am very impressed by the sturdy construction and expect to be using these tweezers for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(No human was harmed in the creation of this review, unless you count taking out my own stitches. I promise that it hurt much less than when the nurse takes them out.)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my step daughter.  I didn&#x27;t know what to buy her. Anyway she was looking for a good tweezers. Well, she told me that she is really impressed with this tweezers. She loves the tweezers and that is all that matters.</li>
    <li> Great prodcut.  I found these tweezers easy to use even with older fingers and they really work.  I have some issues with some coarser type hairs that other tweezers would not take out every easily.  These worked.  I didn&#x27;t find the issue with hair breakage either as others have noted.  Good purchase.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Had I known how wonderful this product is, I definitely would not have spent as much time being frustrated over drugstore purchased tweezers.  Tiny brow hairs do not present even the slightest challenge for this tool.  No, I don&#x27;t own stock in the company, I am just a very happy purchaser!</li>
    <li> Out of the package they don&#x27;t work. Can&#x27;t get them to grab even the thickest or longest of hairs.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Probably the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Typed in the Amazon search engine for Tweezerman Tweezers, the brand I LOVE!  These came up on the list, and I had already bought one pair of pink Tweezermans at Amazon, thought these were the same item.....they are NOT!  I guess it was my mistake for not reading the description more carefully, and they are listed with all the other Tweezerman tweezers.  Hope they are decent for my needs, but they should not be listed with the real Tweezerman products.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the great reviews I read for these tweezers, because, I mean, really... how good can tweezers really be?? Imagine my surprise when I received them and found them to be REALLY NICE. The quality is far superior to any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. I plan to buy another pair for my daughter.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are excellent quality and easy to use.  They came in a little pink case which is easy to slip into my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the tweezers are very precise and sharp.  I don&#x27;t have to try many times to pull out a little hair from my eyebrow :) !! Works right on target.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> They work great and are sharp... I would have given it 5 stars but the company I purchased from sent me dozens of emails asking for reviews, which was totally annoying.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me in spite of good reviews. I&#x27;m still looking for precise eyebrow tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have great gripping power and the slip case for them is very convenient for carrying them in a purse or makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Awuful; don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> these are made very well.  clamp strong and well aligned.  and I can find them in the drawer very quickly.  the only problem may be when my granddaughter the pink person tries to borrow them</li>
    <li> The tips are perfect, sharp and smooth. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> These tweezers are being returned.  The tips are poorly finished and don&#x27;t grab hairs very well.  Perhaps I received a flawed pair, as other reviewers seem happy.  It is back to Tweezerman for me.  What a difference!  I do want to acknowledge, however, that service from Castle Rock was excellent.  The tweezers arrived quickly and my complaint was addressed immediately with a refund, even before I put the tweezers in the mail.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.  I really needed a good tweezer, so I am happy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought these accidentally thinking they were tweezerman.  They look very similar but don&#x27;t work nearly as well. Save your money and buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> sharp and functional.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful tweezers.  I do agree with some of the other comments.  If you are not careful the hair might break before you can remove them because they are very sharp.</li>
    <li> They work well. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Love the tweezer Thank you!</li>
    <li> I needed a good pare of Tweezers so i thought i would give these a try. And i loved the color because my husband will not be taking them. LOL These tweezers are wonderful. Very nice stainless steel. Good grip on them. Very easy to clean. Love the bright color so that they are easy to find. Will buy again love them.</li>
    <li> These just don&#x27;t close well enough to actually grab hair to tweeze  :(  The metal is too flexible.  The flexibility makes it easy to pinch closed, but not firm enough to grasp hair, fine or coarse. I don&#x27;t know if the tips are sharp enough or calibrated or if it&#x27;s overall design. I feel like picky Goldilocks because some other tweezers can be too stiff and difficult to pinch closed.    It&#x27;s too bad because they do come with a nice little case for them and they&#x27;re packaged with an offer to enter and win $50 and a 15% coupon - that I didn&#x27;t do of course. It took very little time to see that these just don&#x27;t work.  It may be that I got a bad pair or a cheap knock off, I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s a cute presentation and I do love things like this, but only if the main purchase does what&#x27;s supposed to.  I don&#x27;t mind paying $12 for tweezers and I&#x27;d rather have $12 worth of tool, than carrying case I wouldn&#x27;t use because they go straight into my makeup bag.  I may go back to my old standby Revlon slant tips for $4 and pay for sharpening.  I just love the convenience of Amazon quick shipping, so I ordered these.  I&#x27;m going to initiate a return as soon as I submit this review.  I will come back and update.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Perfect for the really fine hairs regular tweezers just can&#x27;t grip. Light weight and ergonomically correct. At a great price with excellent follow up from a interested and genile staff. Pick up a set you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> That is the best tweezer I have ever had!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are not very good at all. I am unsure how they have such a high rating. They are thick at the end and do not grasp fine hair or slivers etc. Disappointing considering product description.</li>
    <li> Best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve had yet. I love the grip and precision it has, it makes using them super easy!</li>
    <li> These work like a charm</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic in buying a tweezer offline but I am glad I did. I was actually very surprised and happy that my initial doubts about it was proved wrong. This tweezers really works great, it actually works better than my drugstore tweezers I purchased at Walgreens. I purchased the most expensive one which is right around the price of this product and it ended up wearing out quick.(no grabbing of hair, tweezers getting dull) This tweezer worked soo well on my eyebrows that it got even my most stubborn of hair. Even the ingrown hairs, I was able to pluck them out with no ease. I am very happy with these and glad they work well and feel durable too. I love the pink color of it very feminine.</li>
    <li> Very good tweezers.  Hope they stay aligned and sharp.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous tweezers and the price is great!  I have given them as gifts and I keep one in the car, my purse and the bathrooms!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a women&#x27;s health therapist/coach and women love good tweezers!</li>
    <li> I bought these in November and have been using them exclusively since......I very much like how easy they are to hold and use, either with the tip sharp &amp; pointed or turned so it can grasp an easier-to-pluck hair.  I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I liked these tweezers until I discovered that the mysterious pink stains that were starting to appear on my bathroom countertop were caused by the paint bleeding when the tweezers were set down on a damp or wet spot, or if a few drops of water were splashed them while washing one&#x27;s hands, for example. In a bathroom such wetness is a common scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would not be so great a problem if I were able to wipe them off; but I am unable to remove these stains from my countertop. (you may have better luck depending on the surface). I tested my suspicion by setting these tweezers down on a piece of white cardboard and then sprinkling some water on them. The next morning: pink stains on the cardboard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I see it everytime I look at the countertop.</li>
    <li> I am tweezer picky. Five years ago, I lost my 20 year old pair of amazing tweezers. For plucking, there wasn&#x27;t a better pair in existence. They gripped hair perfectly and effortlessly and we&#x27;re just he perfect angle to trap your unwanted hair the first time every time. The day those tweezers were lost, we went to three stores and came home with 7 pairs of highly priced and highly recommended pairs of tweezers. None could replace my missing pair. I settled on 1 pair as being good enough until I could find the ultimate replacement. So suffice it to say, I was skeptical. I don&#x27;t think any pair of tweezers no matter how amazing they are could ever truly rival my lost tweezers mostly because they&#x27;ve been built up so high on a hindsight pedestal but these are a great replacement and I recommend.</li>
    <li> not as great as my Tweezerman</li>
    <li> Good, but Tweezerman are better.</li>
    <li> LOVE these tweezers! Over the years I have used several brands and several types of tweezers to pluck the &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; and stubborn hairs on my eyebrows. These tweezers got out even the smallest, toughest hairs, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt as much as some of the other tweezers I used. I am very excited I got these tweezers and plan to use only these in the future for my stubborn grown in hairs. I bet they would also be great to use when removing splinters as well. A must have in the medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> So let me be honest with you.. and myself. As I have gotten older I have been getting these really tough hairs on my chin. I know they are whiskers but I will just call them thick. They annoy me cause they stick out and grow long and i have been through tweezer after tweezer to pull these hairs. Most don&#x27;t grip the short hair and if it does it takes a couple pulls to get it out. I was excited to try these and was saving one pesky hair for the arrival of my new tweezers. It just gripped it and out it came. I was shocked honestly. This exact precision made me go to town with the few others that bother me in the early stages of growth. Then I got to work on my eyebrows and the few strays hairs that pop up. I have to say I LOVE THESE TWEEZERS. I told my husband &amp;#34;DON&#x27;T TOUCH&amp;#34; these are mine and he can have those others that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I misplace my tweezerman tweezers.  . . .I have owned many tweezerman for years and love them! I can clearly state  this tweezer is nothing that it states! I received it today and is dull and cannot tweeze anything..  . .what a disappointment! Especially when the ad carries on as if it is the best you can buy?  It is getting sent back to Amazon and I ordered tweezerman again.  Next time I see an ad for a product on Amazon that looks to good to be true .. .  . .it mostly likely is??? So, don&#x27;t get sucked in as I did. I reordered my tweezerman tweezer that  I love.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe the other reviews on this tweezer are people that know the company. This is my own personal opinion .. ...  I don&#x27;t think the reviews are legit . . . . .. . .just sayin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  . .when I posted this review . . .I was the first review ever posted on this tweezer at the time. . . .and I did not like the tweezer at all and sent it back. I noticed the reviews that are on here today.  . . . if you check their previous orders most of the people have the same product reviews.  . .how can that be??? WHAT? What does that tell you?.  . . .looks fishy to me. Since I posted a negative review everyday a new review goes up.  . .check and look at their previous products they have reviewed. Something tells me they are giving the tweezer out for free for a review. Doesn&#x27;t seem kosher to me at all? This is just my opionion?</li>
    <li> Dont buy them they all say they afe great but with one or two uses they start to loose the ability to do its job. They are worst the. Dollar ones i have bought before!</li>
    <li> What can I say? They are tweezers it gets the job done!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great but pinches skin easily</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers for myself and loved them so I bought them for my daughter and daughter in law and they really liked them too!</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and I use these tweezers on my client.its very good quality. The edges are slighly sharp but with time as you sanitize &amp; clean it by submerging in barbacide antibacterial liquid the sharpness will go away. I am very happy with my purchase. I was using Tweezerman tweezers earlier and those gt misplaced. Now i use these tweezers and these work jst fine on my clients.</li>
    <li> After ALL the many tweezers ive gone through because they wont actually grab any hairs, these worked AMAZING!!! The thin end helps you get one hair at a time or a bunch, which works really great when you only have a few stray eyebrow hairs and dont want to pluck out 10 that are actually in place. I would highly recommend these to anyone, they work fantastic! Ive also purchased other items from this company - the quality cant be beat and the price is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re tweezers...and they work</li>
    <li> Seriously, theses are the BEST.&lt;br /&gt; What would have taken me 25 minutes with fairly good tweezers, took  only 5 minutes with these tweezers. I know they&#x27;re a bit pricey, but I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers.They are sharp and find the smallest of hairs and splinters. I work with glass and have no problem getting the sharp shards of glass out. To top it off they are easy to find in the drawer.</li>
    <li> High quality and great construction!</li>
    <li> Ranks right up there with the well-known (expensive) brand recommended by all the beauty magazines!</li>
    <li> These are the tweezers I have been searching for. Grips the hair with no sliding and pulls it out at the root without cutting the hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brand...and apparently &amp;#34;others&amp;#34; in my household do also - as mine keep disappearing!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great. Super fine and easy to use. My ONLY teeny complaint is that they are so sharp that sometimes if you aren&#x27;t careful, they cut the hair before you have a chance to get a grip and pull. I have had this happen with tweezerman tweezers too. I just had to retrain myself. Now they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Lost my $20 tweezers so I went with these and after a week they seem to be just as good.</li>
    <li> These are expensive, but they&#x27;re the best tweezers I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  They&#x27;re the only ones which will grip a hair so fine you can&#x27;t even see it, but can still feel it.  I&#x27;m protecting these!</li>
    <li> An excellent product, almost surgical quality, easy to use</li>
    <li> Good tweezers, very happy with them!</li>
    <li> Do not buy. It cut me on the first use. This is the worst tweezer.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, these tweezers have a nice wide slanted edge for grabbing small hairs or slivers.  The tips also have a good texture to them to help hold onto fine hairs while plucking.</li>
    <li> I am loving these pink tweezers!  I was excited to get these for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is Green and black.  Simply put on the box is &amp;#34;Best Tweezers&amp;#34;.  Believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are strong, even tips, made from surgical steel and so easy to clean.  They get out the thick hair but can also get the smallest of hairs too.  I have to hide them or my daughter will get them.  Then I&#x27;d never see them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this product.  So happy I was chosen to review.</li>
    <li> One essential tool in keeping a woman&#x27;s face more attractive is a great pair of tweezers. I love these stainless steel tweezers and they work really great for plucking, shaping my eyebrows and getting rid of unwanted facial hairs. These are defiantly professional grade tweezers and are very strong and sturdy.These hair tweezers have a very precise and sharp tip. They are great for getting new hairs as well as coarse hairs too. These are certainly so easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a discounted price, however all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> these tweezers are awesome they get every little hair and every thick hair. love them they are my favorite tweezers now.</li>
    <li> I think these are great tweezers for getting splinters out of fingers. I was looking for a strong pair of tweezers to grip and pull out those annoying hairs us older ladies get around our mouth. These tweezers are so sharp they actually cut the hair so there is nothing to grip!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of facial hair and this is the best tweezer for the price that I have ever found.</li>
    <li> These tweezers get the job done better than most. They are strong, sharp, and firm. The color stands out and is great. I highly recommend these. Worth the money, and will last for a good long time.</li>
    <li> Bought these on an impulse. I have thick beard growth and am always having to dig out ingrown hairs. Got then today and I can easily say these are the BEST tweezers I have. Even though they are pink. Granted, I did get these at a reduced promotional price so I could evaluate them but these are better than the $25 tweezers I got from a local beauty supply. They are easy to manipulate and grip well.</li>
    <li> The worst tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. They do not grip hair and you end up pinching skin. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician. I am always on the look out for good tweezers and have paid top prices for quality tweezers in the past. These are hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve only used these to tweeze hair and I can tell you they are very precise. Whether you&#x27;re working on a client or working on your own brows, you want to be as accurate as possible. The worse hairs are those baby fine or short ones that are hard to grab. (You know what I&#x27;m talking about!) Well, these grab those. The hair is pulled out to the root which is very important as it will take longer for the hair to grow back. And being able to grab those very fine hairs makes a world of difference. And my favorite, these tweezers are able to grab those super short hairs that have barely broken the skin. I can only imagine how amazing they will be to get splinters out too. I highly recommend these tweezers. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> They are tweezers and do what tweezers do. They are so sharp they sometimes cut the hair that I am trying to remove.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.  As I have gotten older, I have found that I have these little hairs that are growing under my chin.  I absolute dislike this part of growing older.  I do not like them growing and I needed a way to get them out.  I decided plucking would be the best way, since I usually only had one did think that was worth a trip to the dermatologist.  I had tried other tweezers  and they were not strong enough to pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Castle Rock tweezers at very strong and pull the hair out with no problem.  They do not pick my skin like some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these twizzzers. It has helped in keeping that pesky little hairs from hanging around&lt;br /&gt;  I am glad I w as picked to be the one to test this product and give information to them to help make this product the best product possible.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many negative reviews, but I feel compelled to do so in the case of these tweezers. They are completely useless for their intended purpose, i.e. to remove hair. They might pinch your finger, or enable you to manipulate a piece of paper, but for the purpose of providing a secure grip on errant hair, they are as useful as a pair of salad tongs. Don&#x27;t even bother with these, my wife has made fun of me for 2 weeks now because I ordered the most useless pair of tweezers in the world, and her 15 year old stainless steel ones outperform these by a mile. Time to get the Tweezermans resharpened.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to replace a few drugstore tweezers that no longer gripped.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference with these.  The first time I used them, I was amazed.  These gripped the finest hairs effortlessly.  I used to struggle with the drugstore ones that never gripped like these.  An added plus is that they&#x27;re easy to find in my medicine cabinet.  Love these!</li>
    <li> These have been great.  I thought I had some decent tweezers before, but these are incredible.  They grip hairs really well.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between my old ones and these.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are not any better than the cheap ones you can pick up at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Calling all Tweezerman lovers!&lt;br /&gt;I. LOVE. THESE. TWEEZERS. I had recently lost my Tweezerman tweezers and was pretty upset about it. All the other tweezers in my house (Revlon, CVS brand, some other random pair) just didn&#x27;t get the job done like those dang tweezers. Tweezerman is not a cheap brand, especially when you&#x27;re paying for something as small as tweezers, but quality really does add up in my book. To purchase the same mini tweezers I had had previously from Tweezerman on Amazon, it was going to cost around $11.50, but what I didn&#x27;t like about that is that I couldn&#x27;t choose the color of the tweezers, I was just going to be sent one of three color options and it&#x27;d be a surprise when I opened the package. (I know color doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it does to me!) I stumbled upon these tweezers in my search and they had awesome reviews and were compared to Tweezerman. They seriously are AWESOME. They&#x27;re just like my old tweezers that I loved so dearly - except these are full-sized, came with a little tweezer holder, and were just short of $12 - so really, a great, great deal. You will not go wrong in purchasing these bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! Also - this company has great customer service. I was sent a thank you and updates on my tweezers by Castle Rock and was urged to contact them if I had any questions, concerns, etc. The emails were personalized and sincere, and that&#x27;s hard to come by these days!</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me. I sent them back.</li>
    <li> worst tweezers ever!!! cant get a single hair!!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers grip very tiny hairs very well. The ends are like tiny little grippers. If you have hair, they will get it no matter how small it is. I was impressed with these tweezers. They feel strong and sturdy too. I liked the pink color because that is unusual for tweezers. These are great for shaping my eyebrows. They also do a good job at getting splinters out. The ends are sharp and pointed just right for hair removal. They look nice and are lightweight, as well. I bought this product with discount and I am very happy with it. I highly recommend these tweezers for getting those tiny, fine, little hairs on your face or for ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They are nice and sturdy. They grab even the smallest piece of hair. I love the bright pink color. Every hair I want removed they do it without any issue. Plus I used them to remove a splinter out of my sons foot and they worked great. It was a very small piece of wood but it grabbed it and in one pull it was out. I never cared for slanted tweezers however these have won me over! I receive a this product at a reduced rate in order to give my honest review no other compensation has been given.</li>
    <li> This tweezers became one of my favorite beauty items to carry in my everyday purse.&lt;br /&gt;It pulls off without cutting the hair, BUT have had a very few pinch since is a bit too sharp for the skin, it hurts a bit. Hot pink is one of my favorite colors and does not chip.&lt;br /&gt;I received item for reviewing purposes only.</li>
    <li> Does not work! Could not get one hair plucked!</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers! I love the color and the sleek feel. They make it very easy to grip and grab the hair with ease. These are my new favorite and go to pair. You can not beat the value for the price.</li>
    <li> It seems like every pair of tweezers I buy are weak and don&#x27;t work well so, when I ordered these I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I was pleasently surprised though. These tweezers are durable, stainless steel, and they work great.  All us women know that as we get older we tend to get those few pesky hairs on our chin and we always need to fix our brows and, every mom knows that kids always seem to be getting splinters and these work great when dealing with these issues and more. I have to say, the color is pretty as well. I recommend that every household buys at least one pair of these tweezers. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These are great have a lovely pink color to them and makes them easy to stand out and able to find since I am always loosing my tweezers. These are high quality and super durable. They have a great tip point to easily pluck the finest smallest hairs that are barely breaking the surface. They are light weight look great and all around handy. They stick to my magnet strip of makeup tools perfectly. I received these as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> Best non-surgical tweezers!Metal is not flimsy and the blades when squeezed are completely alligned, i.e., no over-hangs or gaps. They are strong enough to use on hairs that even have some moisture or lotion on them. And this review is from a daughter who inherited her father&#x27;s &amp;#34;uni-brow&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how these tweezers have such good reviews. As soon as I took them out of the package, I noticed that they were really thick. Based on that, it was no surprise that they didn&#x27;t grab the hairs. I tried the on both thin and thick hair around my eyebrows and nothing happened. It didn&#x27;t pull the hair because it didn&#x27;t even grip them. The tweezers are pretty sharp, but that doesn&#x27;t help if they can&#x27;t hold onto a hair. I decided to return them immediately.</li>
    <li> good !!!Fast shipping, thank you.</li>
    <li> What an excellent tool!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not as good as other a little more expensive tweezers. I didn&#x27;t receive the book on tweezing as stated. They asked me to review the pillow? that I hadn&#x27;t purchased. Overall, not the best experience. I will return to the other brand as the carton the tweezers arrived in was crushed due to a flimsy padded envelope. Back to the old, tried and true tweezers with a case and all inserts as promised.</li>
</ol>
