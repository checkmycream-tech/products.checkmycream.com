      <li>headbands and bows are super affordable as are the rest of the hair accessories in their shop</li>
      <li>But they look pretty!</li>
      <li>She is always marching her own drum and thinking outside the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;She is very much an independent girl with a mind of her own.</li>
      <li>Colors are vibrant and headband is comfortable.</li>
      <li>When new hair comes in, they don&#x27;t fit in her ponytail and fall in her face.</li>
      <li>So cute and adorable for my little one!</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>My five-year-old daughter Paig absolutely loves hair accessories!</li>
      <li>Pretty colors though.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also pretty flexible and we haven&#x27;t snapped one yet.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>But, we have had them for a few months, and I consider them to be a good value.</li>
      <li>I love that these come in such a lovely (and wide) range of colors, and that you can attach any HipGirl hairclip(s) to them to change up the look every day!</li>

      <li>Only problem is they easily unravel.</li>

      <li>If you know a little girl that loves hair accessories like mine does, these would make a really cute stocking stuffer!stand out enough to be noticed but don&#x27;t get in her way.</li>
      <li>and I wanted a variety pack that was simple, not too wide, and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>My 3.5 year old wears one of these headbands to preschool almost every day.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>My daughter has such fun planning out the various combinations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My toddler has incredibly long hair and a natural side part so she constantly has to pull her hair back.  When new hair comes in, they don&#x27;t fit in her ponytail and fall in her face. We use headbands a lot and I wanted a variety pack that was simple, not too wide, and comfortable.  These fit the bill.  Great variety, good price, and they seem to be good quality thus far.  You can also insert a bow through the ribbon wrapping.  My daughter has not complained about the spot behind her ears hurting that can sometimes happen with headbands after all day wear.  All in all I recommend these!</li>
    <li> Out of the 5 headbands that my daughter has used so far 3 have had the ribbon come loose and start unraveling during the first use.  I don&#x27;t think they are glued properly.  I plan on reinforcing the glue on the remaining ones to try to prevent that from happening.  The colors are nice though.</li>
    <li> Love these! I have a 3 year old who&#x27;s obsessed with headbands. These are amazing. Great price, fantastic fit, don&#x27;t pinch her head. And every color so we can match each outfit. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more! Just buy them!!!!</li>
    <li> My five-year-old daughter Paig absolutely loves hair accessories! Every day after she gets dressed she comes and tells me what the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; hair accessory will be for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is very much an independent girl with a mind of her own. I have basically stopped shopping for her because she never likes anything that I picked out. She only likes it if it was her idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got these headbands from HipGirl Boutique I was actually sad. I thought they were super cute so of course I assumed she would hate them. She actually found them on my desk and opened them herself and the next thing I know she is walking around wearing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Did you buy these for me mom? I love them!&amp;#34; Well hallelujah, we finally agree on something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These headbands are adorable and really well-made. They are nice and thick with the material wrapped well around them. I have had them for over a month and she wears them all the time and none of them have unraveled at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the patterns and lines and that the edges of the ribbon were used to make a cute design! Genius! They stay on really well and are perfectly fitted without hurting or pinching like some headbands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you can coordinate and up with the matching Pinwheel hair bows that they make. I thought that Paige put this together herself one day when I saw her wearing a bow on the headband and then when I went to write this review I saw that it was actually designed to go that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige, however, where is it going the opposite direction than is designed to go. But that is my individualist girl! She is always marching her own drum and thinking outside the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a way she can express herself and look so cute doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pinwheel bows can also be worn by themselves and definitely stand alone without the headbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bows are the perfect size for Paige at 3.5&amp;#34; wide. They stand out enough to be noticed but don&#x27;t get in her way. They are also of great quality and very well made. I have seen zero wear and tear in a month and that&#x27;s usually enough time to tell with hair accessories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headbands and bows are super affordable as are the rest of the hair accessories in their shop and they are such great quality that I will be buying from HipGirl from now on.

    <li> Cute and cheap.  My 3.5 year old wears one of these headbands to preschool almost every day.  The colors are cute.  They keep her hair out of her face.  She did snap one while playing with it.  But, we have had them for a few months, and I consider them to be a good value.</li>
    <li> I wear headbands a lot to match my scarfs at work to cover my tattoo&#x27;s. Most would think these headbands are just for kids, but honestly they look great and fit my head just fine! Will order from again, very cheap, and great quality! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great variety. I used these as a craft item.  We sewed on felt and buttons as well as sewn flowers. They&#x27;ve stayed secure for daily wear.</li>
    <li> Love these hairbands - very well made. Versatile with great color selection.  Also great&lt;br /&gt;coordinates available to go with these! Glad I found these.</li>

    <li> These are such pretty, high-quality hairbands for a steal!! They rival a high-end hairband I bought for my daughter that cost $12 (for just one). I love that these come in such a lovely (and wide) range of colors, and that you can attach any HipGirl hairclip(s) to them to change up the look every day! My daughter has such fun planning out the various combinations.</li>
    <li> These headbands are very durable. I bought them for my two daughters and they absolutely love them. They came on time and I don&#x27;t think it is over priced. It is a bargain. Will definitely order more.</li>

    <li> Very nice colors and hope they hold up well without the ribbon sliding. Hope they don&#x27;t cause headaches like the headbands years ago!</li>
    <li> Kids loved these brightly colored headbands........I myself use one to hold my hair back when washing my face. Great price great value!</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> Love it and well made. Goes great with clip hair bows</li>
    <li> These unravel easily. Pretty colors though.</li>
