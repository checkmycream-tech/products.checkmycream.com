      <li>This is a good buffer that really makes your nails shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these before, and have been happy with them, so it was nice to find it available on Amazon without having to buy it as part of the larger kit often sold in shopping malls.</li>
      <li>You do have to be cautious with the silk side because it can tear and scrape easily if you catch your nail on it</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>This one is a GREAT price and does the same shiny buffing that I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I wish it would last longer, but it&#x27;s really nice to have all of these options when filing my nails!</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>They will make your nails look amazing, hands soft.</li>
      <li>but he said it was really nice and his nails were soft and shinny.</li>
      <li>so watch how fast you are going and make sure that the tip of your nail does not scratch the surface of the buffer.</li>
      <li>A great product well worth the minimal monetary investment...</li>
      <li>I would recommend this buffer to have in your quick fix arsenal.</li>
      <li>and it keeps his nails super shiny.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone that does not like the smell of nail polish but love the lustrous shine on their nails.</li>
      <li>but it was pretty cheap, so</li>
      <li>After getting attacked in the mall by the people running the DSC stand, getting my nail shined up and really really urged to buy 3 boxes of their product, I bought this instead!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other buffers; and this particular buffer gives me the best shine, thus far.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take much scrubbing to get the desired effect and your nails won&#x27;t look good until you polish them with the white part</li>
      <li>The blue side buffs away ridges and pits in the nail (like a very very fine sand paper)</li>
      <li>The process makes my nails so pretty.</li>
      <li>Will be going back to website for more.</li>
      <li>and they arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as was described on website.</li>
      <li>This nail buffer works very well!</li>
      <li>I need another one, but I used it plenty and it worked very well!</li>
      <li>I bought him one from wal-mart at some point and you can really tell the difference, the deep sea buffer is much better than all the others.</li>
      <li>At first i used this buffer 1-2 times per week but my nails got so strong that i only use it now once a month.</li>
      <li>but your nails are soft and smooth and stay fairly shiny for at least a week.</li>
      <li>The silk (white) side scratches easily</li>
      <li>This  a good product to reduce a dull look on fingernails/toenails.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>and I hope that it lasts, it is healthier than wearing nail polish, as your nails are still absorbing whatever is put on them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to replace mine as I&#x27;ve worn this one out using it so much.  </li>
      <li>Nor does it have the instructions printed on the buffer like the real DSC buffers.</li>
      <li>but how can you really tell?).</li>
      <li>Just make sure not continuously go over the same nail at a time, it is a file and will file away the entire nail.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how highly polished this make my nails appear.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied with the outcome using the Manicure Nail Buffer from the Dead Sea.</li>
      <li>I bought this nail buffer back in september and while it leaves a nice shine to my nail; the buffer does not last long.</li>
      <li>The cuticle oil is real, but beware of generic buffers being sold as the real thing.</li>
      <li>It make my nails look like I am wearing a clear coat nail polish!</li>
      <li>It looks as if you are wearing a clear coat nail polish.</li>
      <li>My nails were as shiny as if they had clear polish on -</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the same type and none of them compared to the one I purchased at the mall for WAY too much $!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned a VIVO Per Lei manicure set in the past that included the buffer and the cuticle oil and did really enjoy it.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before, and have been happy with them, so it was nice to find it available on Amazon without having to buy it as part of the larger kit often sold in shopping malls. It&#x27;s great for smoothing and buffing my nails.</li>
    <li> still in the trying stage of using this item. so review is only on atrial test did like item when used at mall</li>
    <li> As good as I bought from shopping mall, but the one I bought from mall cost me $29...This one is amazing, my nail is shining now~~</li>
    <li> This  a good product to reduce a dull look on fingernails/toenails.  It gives the effect of looking like nail polish was painted on without nail polish paint.  A great product well worth the minimal monetary investment...</li>
    <li> Tried a similar product at a Mall Kiosk and was impressed.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well but sufficient.  However, it&#x27;s pricey compared to another product at Walgreens that does just as well for $3.99.  Shipper sent the product immediately and it was received within days.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a kit back when we were dating that was in 2008, it is now 2012. I still have my buffer and use it about 2 times a month. It works great. I use to have a bad habit biting my nails, but since I have this I strive to let my nails grow just so i can use it. The blue side buffs away ridges and pits in the nail (like a very very fine sand paper), the maroon side makes them smoother and the white with are on both sides and on the ends shine the nails. It looks as if you are wearing a clear coat nail polish. When i got my kit it came with a hand lotion and a cuticle oil that softens the cuticles for when you scrap them or push them back off the nail. The tube of cuticle oil lasts forever for it only takes a drop to do two or three fingers. I highly recommend this item to anyone that does not like the smell of nail polish but love the lustrous shine on their nails. Just make sure not continuously go over the same nail at a time, it is a file and will file away the entire nail.</li>
    <li> I Love this kit.  I don&#x27;t even need a manicure when I use this.  The process makes my nails so pretty.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT as described. It does not have the DSC logo Imprinted on it. Nor does it have the instructions printed on the buffer like the real DSC buffers. The cuticle oil is real, but beware of generic buffers being sold as the real thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, my nails are hard as a rock, and they keep growing and growing non stop. At first i used this buffer 1-2 times per week but my nails got so strong that i only use it now once a month. This is definitely worth the price! Dont buy it at the mall though, too expensive there.</li>
    <li> I googled &#x27;Deep Sea Cosmetics&#x27; and was given several websites to explore.  The sale price of the item was certainly a drawing card for me at $5.00 ea., as it turned out, it was a good choice.  I ordered three and they arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as was described on website. These items are a home manicurists dream. It is a four sided rectangle with two grades for filing and one is a buffer. The fourth side which has the Logo on it, can be used as a buffer as well. In about 15 minutes, you have beautiful glossy nails, looking like a professianol did them for you! This item is truly superb. I am extremely satisfied with the outcome using the Manicure Nail Buffer from the Dead Sea.</li>
    <li> Nice buffer. I bought it for a friend so I did not use yet but he said it was really nice and his nails were soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful. Highly recommend them. They will make your nails look amazing, hands soft. Everyone in the family uses them. One recommendation, dont over use the buffer.</li>
    <li> I love these things and use it often. It really doesn&#x27;t take much scrubbing to get the desired effect and your nails won&#x27;t look good until you polish them with the white part so you have to finish all three steps. Just follow the directions which are extremely simple. I usually scrub for just a few seconds on the blue side, a few seconds on the red side, and then I polish with the white side and my nails turn out shiny every time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! I have tried several of the same type and none of them compared to the one I purchased at the mall for WAY too much $! This one is a GREAT price and does the same shiny buffing that I was looking for! It arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> happy with the product and I hope that it lasts, it is healthier than wearing nail polish, as your nails are still absorbing whatever is put on them</li>
    <li> I saw this at the mall in a kit like they show here. They sell these kits at those kiosks where they try and grab you while you are shopping. Believe me, the price they try and get you to pay is way overpriced. This buffer really gives your nails a great, glossy, shine. It looks like you just got a manicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to replace mine as I&#x27;ve worn this one out using it so much.  It has done wonders for my nails.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Very happy with the shine achieved, I no longer have to polish my nails. Gotta love that!</li>
    <li> This nail buffer works very well! My nails were as shiny as if they had clear polish on - this lasted a few days. I&#x27;ve only used it about 4-5x, so I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity yet..but it was pretty cheap, so I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how highly polished this make my nails appear. It make my nails look like I am wearing a clear coat nail polish!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this nail buffer, he uses it weekly and it keeps his nails super shiny.  I bought him one from wal-mart at some point and you can really tell the difference, the deep sea buffer is much better than all the others.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail buffer back in september and while it leaves a nice shine to my nail; the buffer does not last long. The silk (white) side scratches easily so watch how fast you are going and make sure that the tip of your nail does not scratch the surface of the buffer. Overall, best buffer ever. I&#x27;ve tried other buffers; and this particular buffer gives me the best shine, thus far.</li>
    <li> I bought it two months ago and its now very dull. I need another one, but I used it plenty and it worked very well! Buying again.</li>
    <li> After getting attacked in the mall by the people running the DSC stand, getting my nail shined up and really really urged to buy 3 boxes of their product, I bought this instead!!  I&#x27;ve owned a VIVO Per Lei manicure set in the past that included the buffer and the cuticle oil and did really enjoy it.  I personally thought this nail buffer shined brighter then the VIVO buffer.  You do have to be cautious with the silk side because it can tear and scrape easily if you catch your nail on it but your nails are soft and smooth and stay fairly shiny for at least a week.</li>
    <li> I wish it would last longer, but it&#x27;s really nice to have all of these options when filing my nails!</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. My Bride loves it!! Will be going back to website for more.</li>
    <li> I love the buffer - it makes my nails so shiny, and seems like it&#x27;s helping make them stronger (but how can you really tell?). Even better, though, is the seller. I ordered the wrong item from them and requested a cancellation through Amazon. It was granted by SA Products almost immediately and they even sent me an email confirmation letting me know they&#x27;d cancelled it. So thank you! Plus, free shipping from a non Prime vendor is great.</li>
    <li> I love the price on this item compared to kiosk prices in the malls.  It smooths my nail beds nicely and leaves a great shine that lasts several days (depending on amount of housework/dishes I&#x27;m doing!!!).  Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a good buffer that really makes your nails shine. I would recommend this buffer to have in your quick fix arsenal.</li>
