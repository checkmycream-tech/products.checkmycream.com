      <li>This product used to be an eyelash growing product and worked great.  </li>
      <li>So, if you see old reviews saying it was awesome, it WAS awesome, but not anymore.</li>

      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what a really good product is.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I had used Revitalash and it worked amazing.</li>
      <li>this is worthwhile.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>and my eyelashes instead of growing they started falling out , will not buy it again for sure</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Then I use their mascara on top of that</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it for beautiful eyelashes.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>I had been using Revitalash or Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner for years.  </li>
      <li>I notice that Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner is again available in August 2014.  </li>
      <li>after several weeks  did not result in any enhanced results of any kind!</li>
      <li>the original revitalash product.  </li>
      <li>Used the original Revitalash way back when and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It seemed the first month like maybe it would maintain what beautiful lashes and brows my Revitalash Advanced conditioner had previously grown.  </li>
      <li>then when the old formula was no longer available i switched to Latisse, which also gave me good results - that is until it started making my eyes red.  </li>
      <li>have used Revitalaah in the past with great</li>
      <li>lashes are nice and long.</li>
      <li>It works well and is easy to use and reminds me of the old revitalash product I used to use.</li>
      <li>My lashes are super straight</li>
      <li>I have ordered the revitalash in the past, and found it to be exceptional.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a month now and have not seen much change in my eye lashed.</li>
      <li>I have used Rivitalash in the past and was very pleased with my results.</li>
      <li>a friend really likes the results she is getting from Revitabrow.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lashes so much fuller and longer.</li>
      <li>First off, the order came quickly and was properly packaged.  </li>
      <li>It has long lasting effects and contribute to get amazing Eyelash.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient that was in it that made your lashes grow has been banned by the FDA, or was under review, or something like that, from what I understood of what they were saying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner that I just ordered through Amazon is the same or better formula than it was in the past.  </li>
      <li>She highly recommends this product for its benefits.</li>
      <li>How i miss the old Revitalash!!  </li>
      <li>I was expierencing brow and lash fallout and revitalash gave me long, full lashes in about 1 week.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;nouriche&amp;#34; is a new name</li>
      <li>I bought this product a few years ago and it worked amazing back then!</li>
      <li>I used this before, and my eyelashes got VERY long, so long they were touching my eyebrows when I&#x27;d look up.</li>
      <li>I notice a big difference when I use this product consistently.</li>
      <li>They changed the ingredients too because after about 2 weeks of using this my eyelashes started to fall out and are actually shorter due to becoming brittle.  </li>
      <li>I thought this product would be comparable, but thus far, have not noticed any difference in my lashes</li>
      <li>Works quickly and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes as other similar products do.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t use anything for a long time and then thought i would give the new formulated Revitalash a try.  </li>
      <li>Unless I see big changes or you go back to the old way I&#x27;m looking for something else.</li>
      <li>I was already using revitalash; this apparently is the updated version-so like it equally well.</li>
      <li>Long story short, I want to look effortlessly stunning as I bat my long, thick lashes that aren&#x27;t glued on.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews of Nouriche but did not believe them because I have always had much luck with the previous Revitalash products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, when I stopped using the product the other ares have gone back to normal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Revitalash for years and it works great!!!  I can no longer find that product, and this seemed to be a &amp;#34;remake&amp;#34; of Revitalash.  This product does not work at ALL!!!!  Do not waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The supplier provided item in a prompt and efficient manner.  They get FIVE stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned as when searching for Revitalish which I&#x27;ve used, couldn&#x27;t find that product and was switched to Nouriche. I saw that it was same company &amp;#34;Athena Cosmetics&amp;#34; &amp; assumed they had renamed product and it was indeed Revitalash. I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems that other reviewers have commented about but do notice that my eyes are burning after applying product whereby Revitalish never did.  If Revitalash is indeed Nouriche, could they not just say so??? Nouriche formerly known as Revitalash.</li>
    <li> Exellent product. Works quickly and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes as other similar products do. I totally recommend it for beautiful eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Terrible product! I used it  for a few months before I lost my hair to chemo and did not see a difference  ... I decided to try it again now that my lashes have grown back and after two months my lashes are falling out again!</li>
    <li> I wish there was a way to have negative stars here. I had used Revitalash and it worked amazing. But then, when I couldn&#x27;t find it, I researched and discovered it was because Latisse sued Alergan (the makers of Revitalash) because of their packaging so they had to change the name. I assumed, wrongly, that it would be the same product but just a different name.  I was wrong! They changed the ingredients too because after about 2 weeks of using this my eyelashes started to fall out and are actually shorter due to becoming brittle.  This is not Revitalash! Not even close.  Now, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what a really good product is. I welcome reviewer input.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are falling out since I began using Nouriche Eyelash Conditioner. I&#x27;ve used other eyelash conditioner products for several years since I had cancer and have not had this problem until using Nouriche.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the revitalash in the past, and found it to be exceptional.  I thought this product would be comparable, but thus far, have not noticed any difference in my lashes what so ever.  I will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her Revitalash. She highly recommends this product for its benefits. Just buy them this is worthwhile. It has long lasting effects and contribute to get amazing Eyelash.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of Nouriche but did not believe them because I have always had much luck with the previous Revitalash products.&lt;br /&gt;I should have believed them because now part of my eyelashes have also broken off.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy a Revitalash product again.</li>
    <li> Used the original Revitalash way back when and loved it.  had quick and dramatic results.  then when the old formula was no longer available i switched to Latisse, which also gave me good results - that is until it started making my eyes red.  didn&#x27;t use anything for a long time and then thought i would give the new formulated Revitalash a try.  a friend really likes the results she is getting from Revitabrow.  so it has been 4 wks now and perhaps i am being impatient, but no change in my lashes yet.  i&#x27;ll keep using it for now and hope for some good results.  How i miss the old Revitalash!!  sigh.</li>
    <li> I Love Revitalash!!! It makes my lashes so much fuller and longer. Then I use their mascara on top of that and it&#x27;s amazing. I also use their eyeliner. It goes on so smooth and creamy. I love their products!!!</li>
    <li> Long story short, I want to look effortlessly stunning as I bat my long, thick lashes that aren&#x27;t glued on.  I used Revitalash about 4 yrs ago and LOVED it.  Then I got this and couldn&#x27;t figure out what went wrong!  I did some research and it seems the makers of Latisse sued/stopped them from using some ingredient, making Latisse the only product like this that I know has the results I&#x27;m looking for.  I am now using Latisse.</li>
    <li> I was already using revitalash; this apparently is the updated version-so like it equally well. lashes are nice and long.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised.  It works well and is easy to use and reminds me of the old revitalash product I used to use.</li>
    <li> I have used Rivitalash in the past and was very pleased with my results. &amp;#34;nouriche&amp;#34; is a new name so I&#x27;m thinking it might be a different formular. I have been using this product for over a month now and have not seen much change in my eye lashed. Not pleased at all</li>
    <li> Awsome product!!!!! I was expierencing brow and lash fallout and revitalash gave me long, full lashes in about 1 week. Very impressive!!!!!!!!! Wish I could say the same for revitabrow.</li>
    <li> I have used thids product once a day for the past 45 days.  I have experienced no growth of any kind.  Would not recommend purchase of this product.  Instead, check with friends who use lash growing products and ask what they are using.  Online searches can be misleding... your friends results are not.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed.  I bought this product a few years ago and it worked amazing back then! I&#x27;m not sure what has happened here. Did you guys change your formula? I saw no change what so ever while using Revitalash this time. I will not purchase again:-(</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the regular Revitalash that I always used to buy, so I bought this one instead.  IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  No darkening of my eyelashes, no thickening, and no lengthening.  This is NOT Revitalash.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  This is a crappy product.  I have used it for 3.5 months and have noticed a REVERSAL of the great effects I used to get with Revitalash.  Don&#x27;t go for generics, guys!  Once again, proven not to work.  I wasted almost a $100 for nothing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My lashes are super straight and I have to have them permed.  This product has made them grow longer, so the perm lasts a lot longer.  I was afraid to try it for a long time because I have allergies and can only wear a few brands of eyeliner and mascara, but this product caused no reactions.  The seller also provided great service.</li>
    <li> This is not Revitalash, buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Revitalaah in the past with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This after several weeks  did not result in any enhanced results of any kind!</li>
    <li> Love. I notice a big difference when I use this product consistently.</li>
    <li> did not work at all and my eyelashes instead of growing they started falling out , will not buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> I have used this product, regularly, several weeks &amp; have seen no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen no change although I&#x27;ve been using it every day.</li>
    <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t use it properly, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes. I used Latisse before and had a dramatic difference in lash thickness and length. However, Latisse left a purple coloring on my lash lid.</li>
    <li> I used this before, and my eyelashes got VERY long, so long they were touching my eyebrows when I&#x27;d look up. Loved it. Then, when I tried to get another bottle, I started seeing information about the FDA getting involved regarding the active ingredient, and so called Revitalash. The main ingredient that was in it that made your lashes grow has been banned by the FDA, or was under review, or something like that, from what I understood of what they were saying. This is NOT the same stuff that everyone was raving about. So, if you see old reviews saying it was awesome, it WAS awesome, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> I had been using Revitalash or Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner for years.  It then became unavailable for quite awhile for whatever reason.  So, I decided to try this Nouriche by Athena product from Feb 2014 through August 2014.  It seemed the first month like maybe it would maintain what beautiful lashes and brows my Revitalash Advanced conditioner had previously grown.  However, the condition of my lashes and brows continued to deteriorate to the point of falling out after 6 months of using the Nouriche product.  I notice that Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner is again available in August 2014.  It&#x27;s twice the price as Nouriche, but it worked wonders for several years.  I&#x27;m hoping that the Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner that I just ordered through Amazon is the same or better formula than it was in the past.  It will need to be in order to repair the current state of my lashes and brows.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t order Nouriche again at any price.  I had big hopes for it, but the product did not do what it advertises.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference and I have been using it for a month.  Not impressed at all with this product.</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering the Revitalash and Nouriche is not the same at all.</li>
    <li> Will not be buying this again I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, but since they have changed the name it&#x27;s not the same. My eyelashes are not growing longer like they did before and they break off. Unless I see big changes or you go back to the old way I&#x27;m looking for something else.</li>
    <li> So dishonest.  This product used to be an eyelash growing product and worked great.  This &amp;#34;eye Conditioner does not have the same ingredients. It does nothing and my eyelashes continue to fall out and be thin as they were prior to&lt;br /&gt;using the original revitalash product.  It was so misleading and no one will take responsibility for it.</li>
    <li> First off, the order came quickly and was properly packaged.  My issue is not with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The product made my eyelashes thick.  It also worked on other areas of my body where it was not being applied.  I started to get ingrown hairs and small cysts.  I threw the product away.  Out the money with no way to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, when I stopped using the product the other ares have gone back to normal.</li>
</ol>
