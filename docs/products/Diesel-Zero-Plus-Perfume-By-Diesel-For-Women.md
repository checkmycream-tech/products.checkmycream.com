      <li>THE PRICE WAS INCREDIBLE ... 4 STARS BECAUSE YOU PUT THE BOX AND EXTERNAL PACKAGE</li>
      <li>I recieved it very quickly after purchasing.</li>
      <li>It has strong smell</li>
      <li>never purchase these kind of items without trying them out first.</li>
      <li>Is like a combination of soft and sweet smell, that stays for the rest of the day, great price too.</li>
      <li>Diesel Zero Plus that is fabulous as well.</li>
      <li>and fortunately the scent isn&#x27;t a biohazard.  </li>
      <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>

      <li>I wear it for work, when I don&#x27;t want to use up more more expensive scents, but still want to smell sweet.</li>
      <li>I never wanted to pay the 60 or 70 bucks for something I didn&#x27;t really need.  </li>

    <li> This perfume is affordable and has a nice, spicy, cinnamon scent. I wear it for work, when I don&#x27;t want to use up more more expensive scents, but still want to smell sweet. Very nice!</li>
    <li> This is not the perfume for me. I bought it without knowing what it smelled like. Mainly, because of the inexpensive price Amazon was selling it for. (which smells that way too, CHEAP!) It has a cinnamon scent or notes and wears off too quickly. I will not buy this perfume again. I&#x27;ll give it away...which I did! : )</li>
    <li> los perfumes que he adquirido no me parecen que sean los originales, sobre todo el amarige de givenchi, la fragancia es totalmente diferente a los que he usado y comprado en otras tiendas. no estoy conforme con los perfumes.</li>
    <li> im truly impressed with this cologne i have a always been a fan of diesel products i could not believe that this cologne cost that price compared to what they are selling it for in retail stores amazon is now my place to purchase cologne</li>
    <li> El perfume es de calidad Diesel Zero Plus Femenino de Diesel para las mujeres. Eau de Parfum Spray 2.5, lo recomiendo.</li>
    <li> Good aroma. Although the weather in my city does not favor its aroma lasts has good duration in its smell. I arrive at the indicated time without delays and most importantly, safe.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a decent smell to it, and it arrived to me very quickly as well. I do wish that it had an actual lid to it as it would be easier to store.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know much about this perfume but I ordered it anyway. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it and it&#x27;s not a heavy scent, it smells clean and fresh. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I had a gift card to amazon and had never bought anything from the site before.  I am very impressed of the variety of great things that are much cheaper than some other sites.  I came across the diesel perfume and read the reviews, it sounded great and I wanted to try something new. I recieved it very quickly after purchasing. This perfume smells awesome and definetly something perfect for end of summer and fall. I will be purchasing this product again when I run it. I get soo many complements!</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. I love the way it smells and it was super fast getting to me. LOVE IT. Am I ordering it again.....AND IS.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS EXELLENT THE PRICE WAS INCREDIBLE ... 4 STARS BECAUSE YOU PUT THE BOX AND EXTERNAL PACKAGE ARRIVED DAMAGED.&lt;br /&gt;BUT THE BOTTLE AND PRODUCT IS THE BEST ... INCREDIBLE PERFUM&lt;br /&gt;A GOOD BUY AND GOOD SERVICE&lt;br /&gt;THANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRODUCTS ...</li>
    <li> I used it once and it gave me headache. It has strong smell and I did not like it at all. I wish I could return it but looks like we cant return after opening. Lesson learnt....never purchase these kind of items without trying them out first.</li>
    <li> I always used to wear perfume but then I ran out of everything I had. Burberry, amor amor, angel.. and then I never really wore any anymore.  I never wanted to pay the 60 or 70 bucks for something I didn&#x27;t really need.  I was browsing perfume the other day and came across Diesel which was ridiculously cheap.  I love Diesel because basically all of my sneakers are Diesel.  I ordered it and it&#x27;s pretty good. It smells like one of Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s fragrances. I was expecting it to smell different but I still like it.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. I bought it not knowing what the scent would be like and it is great. my sister wants one after smelling this. Great Price! Great Product! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with these perfumes. They ARE NOT the original scents!! Even the packaging they are in are OLD, SCRATCHED, STICKY cases...the bottle it&#x27;s self is sticky and the DIESEL saying comes right off. I am trying to find out how to return them but there option to return back to seller!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this Diesel Zero Plus Feminine By Diesel For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Oz.. The packaging IS A OLD, SCRATCHED, STICKY AND DURTY case! It is a first time I get something from Amazon that come in a dirty box and the cologne melted the silver finish on the pump.</li>
    <li> I like this scent, and the price is right. The scent is clean and subtle, and feminine without being OVERLY sweet and sensual.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a nice lingering scent. I have gotten several compliments since wearing it. I am very picky when it comes to scents and I have to say I was impressed with this one. I would defintely buy again.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> How much can you say about a perfume?    Firstly, I love the scent of this perfume.  It&#x27;s sweet, floral, with a tiny tiny hint of spice and drives me crazy (in a good way).  The bottle has a great atomizer and gives a fine mist spray every time.  Amazon has the best deal on this that I have seen, even better than Marshall&#x27;s/TJMaxx if you get free shipping.    I bought this for my wife for Christmas but when it came, the bottle was leaking out the top of the bottle.  I alerted Amazon and they immediately sent me another bottle which arrived very quickly, in perfect condition, and in PLENTY of time for Christmas Day.  I did not even have to return the damaged one, just threw it away.      Thanks Diesel for putting out such a great product.  Never discontinue it.  Thanks Amazon for great service every time.    Btw, there is a men&#x27;s version of Diesel Zero Plus that is fabulous as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife we actually live in Colombia. This product arrived in perfect conditions, the perfum really smells great, i like it when she wears it.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to purchase this perfume, as I saw many mixed reviews all over the Internet. I was very pleasantly surprised at how wearable &amp; enjoyable it really was for me. It smells so different from every other perfume I own or have ever smelled before, but in a good way. It&#x27;s not super sweet or clingy as many perfumes can be, &amp; it is not floral to me at all. Though it is not listed in the scent notes anywhere online, I smell coconut in this perfume very strongly, mixed with cinnamon &amp; other spices. Although it is actually an eau de toilette, it does have descent lasting power, at least on my skin. I will most likey purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> It is such an assualt on the nostril, if you know what it already smell like and you like it then more power to u. But if you don&#x27;t and you get it because it just sounds like a good deal for the price, then you should seriously reconsider. I also  got the male version for my husband and he hates it as well. It has a very unpleasant alcoloh smell, no real scent.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES. I GET COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME I WEAR IT. TREAT YOURSELF TO DIESEL ZERO PLUS.</li>
    <li> is a sweet fragrance but delicious, I love wear it when I go to work, maybe it&#x27;s my skin but it stay for a whole day!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem, I got it even before , completely satisfied  I would buy it here the next time</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite. The product worths its price. The only negative opinion from me about it could be that it took me a week to have the perfume and the shipping was unreasonably high.</li>
    <li> good perfume, reminds me of when I used to put it on every day for years. I thought it was out of commerce, but gladly amazon have it.</li>
    <li> I love perfume and seeing this was such a good price I decided to order without ever trying it first in a store.  First, my husband loved the packaging - he thought the biohazard design was very cool and fortunately the scent isn&#x27;t a biohazard.  I like the scent, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite. To me it smells like cinnamon, but  much more complex and sensual. My husband also likes the smell.  The reason for the low score is mainly because the scent has no staying power.   But value for money, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. Good price-product deal! Definitely would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice.</li>
    <li> great smell. Affordable price. No problems with the bottle. The case it comes in is nothing to write home about the overall product is great.</li>
    <li> The perfume this one very damaged. This one in very poor condition, I do not work for my, very bad the delivery</li>
    <li> TThe price it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragance and bottle. I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s without box.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I will recomend to my friends and paratentals.</li>
    <li> i am happy for my buy! thanks, every things it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;i wish visit your products next time. see you!</li>
    <li> definitly a knock off or something. the paint on the bottle was chipping and it smelled bad. not the diesel im used to</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me and it sucks.The smell is awful and got a bad headache once I smelled it.Yuckkkkkkkkk</li>
    <li> i ordered a female and received a male perfume. I&#x27;m very disappointed because this item was intended  for a gift.</li>
    <li> it has a nice, smooth floral scent. I love that is not expensive.Will buy it again whe I run out of it.</li>
    <li> strange strong smell that just doesnt fit.  how would anyone even consider making this ?  close to horrible.  giving this as a gift is almost ofensive.</li>
    <li> Es una buena eleccion para regalar a una mujer,tiene mejor olor que la de hombre, es dulce, fuerte y fresca.</li>
    <li> First smelled this when I worked for TJMAXX few years ago always loved the smell it stays with you doesn&#x27;t wear off easily like other perfumes I have.Its a strong smell only need 2 sprays it should last you.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend to anyone! I bought it because it had a good price, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it! I can never wear it, it smells so bad!!!</li>
    <li> tiene un olor fascinante, ideal para la mujeres que le agraden los olores asi como a coco, recomiendo al vendedor, puntual con la entrega.</li>
    <li> the packaging and design is excellent. what I expected and meets loa offer made. I arrive on time. happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Muy buenas cumplen con todo lo ofrecido por el proveedor, manejan buen tiempo de entrega, muy buen servicio y calidad.</li>
    <li> Nice scent...so well appreciated.Loved the package...different and attractive. However, the box it came in seemed slightly damaged and had no identifying marks.</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume for years and thought it was out of production.  When I found it on Amazon I was so happy, I ordered it right away.  This is NOT what I used to wear by any stretch.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s counterfeit or has gone bad, but this perfume is terrible.</li>
    <li> El cliente cumplió con la entrega del producto a tiempo, por lo cual he quedado satisfecho para poder optar o tomar en cuenta para una próxima compra. gracias........</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister and she likes the smell! I was worried in case it might be a fake parfume but i didnt have a bad experience. It has spicy notes, suitable for winter time.</li>
    <li> Is like a combination of soft and sweet smell, that stays for the rest of the day, great price too.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. I love the way it smells and it was super fast getting to me. LOVE IT. Am I ordering it again.....AND again.</li>
