### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Ultreo was the best toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my purchase, and the amount of money I saved.</li>
      <li>But hey Amazon just has wonderful prices on these brush heads.</li>
      <li>these brushes and amazon has a perfect price for them</li>
      <li>This is Philips&#x27; best brush head yet.</li>
      <li>Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is Philips&#x27; best brush head to date.</li>
      <li>This tooth brush head is the best ever</li>
      <li>And this is a great price.</li>
      <li>it felt great.</li>
      <li>Great product/[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>If you have the sonicare toothbrush you&#x27;ve already invested in your teeth, these brushes are great and you pay for it.</li>
      <li>But it works great.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, dentist says teeth are staying much better.</li>
      <li>This brush makes an excellent product even better.  </li>
      <li>Sonicare has come up with another remarkable way to help me with my struggle against gum disease.  </li>
      <li>The replacement heads fit, and work perfect.</li>
      <li>I feel this is quite a accomplishment as I loved my Ultreo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good assist for people with periodontal problems.</li>
      <li>The price was also a good value.</li>
      <li>They have been around for years and are a good investment.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with them.  </li>
      <li>It fits just right and is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>No matter what you use, you still need to break out the floss to keep your teeth healthy!</li>
      <li>love how it feels on my teeth and gums!</li>
      <li>This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes.</li>
      <li>I love the sonic care toothbrush period.</li>
      <li>Also, be sure you use a toothpaste that makes lots of foam.  </li>
      <li>but I might be able to purchase some from Amazon...which I did.  </li>
      <li>Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth feeling any cleaner, nor did it seem to be getting in between my teeth any better, as they&#x27;d claimed.</li>
      <li>but it sure makes dental cleaning easier</li>
      <li>I see no evidence, however, that it cleans any better.</li>
      <li>, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth.</li>
      <li>I love the Phillips Sonicare System, my teeth have nevered felt so clean!  </li>
      <li>I checked several sites before making a purchase on these Sonicare Brush Heads,  found the best deal with free shipping on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For me saving money is more important than shipping time.  </li>
      <li>I really try to keep my teeth in good shape.</li>
      <li>Glad I made the switch, and highly recommend them to anyone interested in superior oral hygiene!</li>
      <li>Clean...very very clean and smooth</li>
      <li>These are what I would consider to be the best brush heads for the Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve used however; it would appear that Phillips is phasing these out for other models.</li>
      <li>these brush heads are the best.they feel great.nothing can clean better than</li>
      <li>But I was able to sell my extra brushes on eBay for a very tidy sum.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>These brush heads arrived so quickly!  </li>
      <li>I think they forgot to design in a boss or lip or whatever to hold the color band securely.</li>
      <li>I understand it&#x27;s important to take care of our teeth, but this brush lasted 2 1/2 yrs.</li>
      <li>I had used the original brush head and needed to try the new brush heads that had recently came out and found them on Amanzon at the best prices.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t feel any difference with this and the original.</li>
      <li>which does not occur with the original style heads unless they are overdue for replacement.  </li>
      <li>(original unit, plus replacement heads).</li>
      <li>My mouth and gums felt exceptionally clean.</li>
      <li>I noticed no difference in how clean my teeth felt or looked.  </li>
      <li>I found the Hydro clean brush heads work</li>
      <li>I got them for my daughter to help keep her braces clean.  </li>
      <li>I bought these brush heads at a local store &amp; loved them, but then couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
      <li>It brushes just as good though with the two paddles in the middle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m feeling thrifty, and my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
      <li>Still... they are the only brush head I buy, because they&#x27;re just that good.</li>
      <li>Next I bought the Sonicare, it was quite good.</li>
      <li>I agree that you shouldn&#x27;t think this replaces flossing, but it sure feels like it does more than the standard brush.</li>
      <li>While I can&#x27;t really say I felt water and toothpaste being directed between my teeth, the HydroGuides definitely feel great along my gums.    </li>
      <li>I did not expect much improvement with the HydroClean brush head and was very pleasantly surprised to find it to be significantly superior to the ProResults brush head.</li>
      <li>it cleans out the gum a lot better then normal brush</li>
      <li>What I did notice was that it seems to splatter toothpaste all over more than the normal brush heads.</li>
      <li>I was able to find these replacement heads on Amazon which saved me spending a lot of money on a new tooth brush.</li>
      <li>From the first time you use the HydroClean you can feel a difference!</li>
      <li>But when I got the new HydroClean brush heads, I realized they were almost as good as my old Ultreo.</li>
      <li>well it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>these are well worth trying out.</li>
      <li>After using it I noticed it was much better than than my original one and will definitely keep using it.</li>
      <li>I love the toothbrush because it cleans better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>These HydroClean Brush Heads really do clean better than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
      <li>I completely recommend the Philips Sonicare Hydro Clean tooth brush heads to anyone wanting a fresh feeling mouth!</li>
      <li>My most recent model is the Flexcare.</li>
      <li>I bought twice as many for the price my local stores charge...</li>
      <li>and I have to say the the first time brushing</li>
      <li>I believe the HydroClean head does a better job getting between the teeth than the standard Sonicare head.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the regular toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>In fact, mine were halfway worn after the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using a Sonicare since Philips released their first model.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that amazon has these, just one came with my handle along with two standard heads.</li>
      <li>use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000.</li>
      <li>Well this should be pretty self explanitory since they are toothbrush heads.</li>
      <li>The smaller profile is much better at cleaning hard-to-reach places.</li>
      <li>Cleaner, fresher, smoother teeth that last a lot longer because you seem to be removing more plaque from your teeth with each use.</li>
      <li>Yes online shopping has spoiled me haha!</li>
      <li>If you can still find them, they are a good initial method of cleaning your teeth prior to flossing.</li>
      <li>Compared to my regular replacement heads, these heads feel much firmer and more stimulating to the gum.  </li>
      <li>However, when I used it, I didn&#x27;t any positive effects of the \\&quot;hydroclean\\&quot; design.  </li>
      <li>The only ones I found while out shopping which fit the Healthy White, were the HydroClean brush heads.</li>
      <li>...I can&#x27;t tell the difference as far as the claim that it \\&quot;directs fluids between teeth\\&quot; but it does clean my teeth very well.  </li>
      <li>That foam is certainly pushing bacteria from their unreachable pockets between teeth.  </li>
      <li>After getting our new Healthy White SoniCare, we needed another brush head.</li>
      <li>The heads are fine, but following is my review of the brush itself:  </li>
      <li>The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots.</li>
      <li>so for me, directing water between my teeth probably doesn&#x27;t do much except</li>
      <li>They also snap more firmly to my brush than do my regular heads and run more quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are harder than Sonicare&#x27;s regular brushes and harder than I prefer.  I noticed no difference in how clean my teeth felt or looked.  I floss regularly and I don&#x27;t think directing a flow of water can do the same job of removing debris, so for me, directing water between my teeth probably doesn&#x27;t do much except make it easier to accidentally splatter.  I also missed the inner rows of brushes that the rubber paddles replace and I know I felt the difference.  Unless I see some hard evidence to the contrary, I&#x27;ll continue to suspect this is just a marketing gimmick.  I&#x27;ll stick with the regular brushes.</li>
    <li> The paddles push toothpaste foam between your teeth.  If you brush behind your teeth while looking in the mirror, you can see the foam bubbling out between your teeth.  Brushing the front of your teeth, you can feel the foam flowing out behind your teeth with your tongue.  Move the brush very slowly along the gum line.  Rapid movements upset the flow and are  counterproductive.  Also, be sure you use a toothpaste that makes lots of foam.  Push the foam back to the brush with your tongue so the foam can cycle through again.      The war against gum disease is microbial.  That foam is certainly pushing bacteria from their unreachable pockets between teeth.  You can see it working in the mirror.  I&#x27;ve had no bleeding or soreness anywhere in my gums since I started using the Hydroclean.  Sonicare has come up with another remarkable way to help me with my struggle against gum disease.  This time it&#x27;s not the brush, it&#x27;s the brush head!</li>
    <li> I had used the original brush head and needed to try the new brush heads that had recently came out and found them on Amanzon at the best prices.  After using it I noticed it was much better than than my original one and will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I thought the concept behind these heads was interesting &amp; it cost about the same as a pack of the regular brush heads (non-HydroClean), so I bought them. I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth feeling any cleaner, nor did it seem to be getting in between my teeth any better, as they&#x27;d claimed. What I did notice was that it seems to splatter toothpaste all over more than the normal brush heads. I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for years &amp; am accustomed to keeping my lips so that I don&#x27;t get sprayed by spit &amp; paste while brushing, which is par for the course when using an electric toothbrush. So I&#x27;m used to this &amp; don&#x27;t normally make a mess.  But with the HydroClean brush, I couldn&#x27;t keep from getting some toothpaste splattered on my shirt &amp; on the mirror. Now I have at least 2 shirts with stains from the whitening ingredients in toothpaste.  I will now be switching back to the normal Sonicare brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that the HydroClean brushes (so far) don&#x27;t come in the compact size. And you can&#x27;t use the color ID rings that come with the toothbrush, which could be a problem for households who share the toothbrush base.</li>
    <li> I just received the pack today and I have to say the the first time brushing it felt great. I&#x27;m not sure that it was because I hadn&#x27;t had a new brush on it for a while but the old one was not getting it clean (the bigger one my brush came with). But it works great. Clean...very very clean and smooth I would recommend these as there&#x27;s not too much difference in the price between the 3 different models. Using a FlexCare+.</li>
    <li> it cleans out the gum a lot better then normal brush but u have to follow the instruction and tilt the bristles to your gum and let the toothbrush do its job. People don&#x27;t read instructions and is sawing their teeth not cleaning their gum line</li>
    <li> The heads are fine, but following is my review of the brush itself:  It was a good brush while it worked, but entirely too expensive. I understand it&#x27;s important to take care of our teeth, but this brush lasted 2 1/2 yrs. and cost about $400. (original unit, plus replacement heads). I&#x27;m now looking at powered brushes for under $20. that can be tossed when they eventually fail. I figure at that price I can get 20+ yrs. out of them for $400.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review an item until I receive it.  Since this is substantially overdue, I&#x27;ll have to wait untill it comes to review this again.</li>
    <li> Compared to my regular replacement heads, these heads feel much firmer and more stimulating to the gum.  They also snap more firmly to my brush than do my regular heads and run more quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose between the two, I&#x27;d choose my regular head first.  Because, however, I&#x27;ve already bought these and they may have some beneficial effects the regular heads lack, I&#x27;ve chosen to alternate the heads.  I use one head to clean my teeth with baking soda, then floss, then use the other head to brush with toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this head for two months.  It only took a couple of days to get used to the stiffness and I wouldn&#x27;t even notice it if I wasn&#x27;t alternating the heads.  I see no evidence, however, that it cleans any better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that amazon has these, just one came with my handle along with two standard heads. I used the standard first and just switched it out with the hydro... love how it feels on my teeth and gums! And this is a great price. I normally get the replacement heads at costco but they only have the standards. I agree that you shouldn&#x27;t think this replaces flossing, but it sure feels like it does more than the standard brush.</li>
    <li> Works with [[ASIN:B002CVTVW8 Philips Sonicare HX6003/80 HydroClean Brush Heads, (3-Pack)]] Rechargeable Toothbrush, however, the multicolor plastic rings that came with the toothbrush do not attach to these heads. So if multiple people are using the replacements some other method of distingushing the owner will be necessary.  I like the cleaning and forcing of water through the spaces in the teeth.</li>
    <li> This is useless. Still have to floss, no difference. Besides, those \\&quot;specially designed paddles\\&quot; hit teeth much harder and more painful than bristles. I did not notice any direction of fluids between teeth. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This is Philips&#x27; best brush head yet. The smaller profile is much better at cleaning hard-to-reach places. While I can&#x27;t really say I felt water and toothpaste being directed between my teeth, the HydroGuides definitely feel great along my gums.    To the previous reviewer: of course you still have to floss! The product description never claims you don&#x27;t have to floss; it says \\&quot;...get closer to the benefits of flossing\\&quot;. There&#x27;s a difference between directing toothpaste and water between teeth - as this product claims, and actually cleaning beneath the gum-line, which can only be accomplished by flossing.</li>
    <li> These work great if you have a small mouth or trouble getting to your back teeth.</li>
    <li> these brush heads are the best.they feel great.nothing can clean better than these brushes and amazon has a perfect price for them you cant find a lower price.thanks amazon!!!</li>
    <li> There are two reasons for my 2 star review. First, the brush itself is too firm. It is not at all soft. The ADA recommends brushing with a soft toothbrush. I assume they manufactured it this way to make up for my second reason. Second, the brush head has had the center bristles removed to add the gimmicky rubber channels meant to direct the water/toothpaste between teeth. While I do feel it moving the toothpaste toward my teeth when I brush, I would much rather have bristles in contact with the tooth surface. Afterall, the idea of brushing your teeth is to physically brush away the build up of plaque and tartar. Without the normal number of bristles, I don&#x27;t feel I get the same results.</li>
    <li> Not sure if others are better or not, but we really like them.  Price was cheaper than other heads too.</li>
    <li> This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes. It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean&#x27;s bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I&#x27;m a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums. Hard to find, but works very well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that nothing takes the place of flossing. No matter what you use, you still need to break out the floss to keep your teeth healthy!</li>
    <li> I really try to keep my teeth in good shape. This brush seems to get into places the regular brush doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is a ridiculous product.  My partner and I share the sonicare.  But, for these replacemments, all the brushes are the same color so there&#x27;s no way to know whose brush is whose.</li>
    <li> The primary difference between these HydroClean heads and a full-size SoniCare head is that Philips has replaced all of the bristles in the center with two little rubber flaps.  If my own experience is any indication, it&#x27;s a poor trade-off.  Within just a couple weeks of switching to this new head, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of buildup on my teeth... which does not occur with the original style heads unless they are overdue for replacement.  I&#x27;m switching back!</li>
    <li> After getting our new Healthy White SoniCare, we needed another brush head. The only ones I found while out shopping which fit the Healthy White, were the HydroClean brush heads. I don&#x27;t care for these at all, since there is a thin row of bristles on the outsides. They are also scratchy on the gums. I much prefer the ProResults brush heads and would order online if need be (just to avoid the HydroClean type).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in 10 years since using Sonicare. These new heads work the same, but I am skeptical of eliminating my flossing routine.</li>
    <li> ...I can&#x27;t tell the difference as far as the claim that it \\&quot;directs fluids between teeth\\&quot; but it does clean my teeth very well.  The only problem I have with these replacement heads is that the color bands don&#x27;t fit on the base of the brush head like it does on the original so it slides around on the base unit. NOT cool!!  I think they forgot to design in a boss or lip or whatever to hold the color band securely.</li>
    <li> These HydroClean Brush Heads really do clean better than the standard Philips Sonicare brush heads.  They are also less bulky, making it easier to reach those hard-to-reach places.  Glad I made the switch, and highly recommend them to anyone interested in superior oral hygiene!</li>
    <li> I love the sonic care toothbrush period. Yet the hype for this brush head was short lived for me. I just don&#x27;t feel any difference with this and the original. It brushes just as good though with the two paddles in the middle it almost feels like I&#x27;m missing some important scrubbing power on my teeth. I floss like normal with Crest Glide comfort plus, so the need to have a brush that \\&quot;flosses\\&quot; is not really needed. But hey Amazon just has wonderful prices on these brush heads. There is no reason at all to buy any of the sonic care heads in a retail store. Yes online shopping has spoiled me haha!</li>
    <li> If you have the sonicare toothbrush you&#x27;ve already invested in your teeth, these brushes are great and you pay for it. Just wish they werent so expensive and that they lasted longer. Still... they are the only brush head I buy, because they&#x27;re just that good.</li>
    <li> I checked several sites before making a purchase on these Sonicare Brush Heads,  found the best deal with free shipping on Amazon. BUT shipping was very slow.  For me saving money is more important than shipping time.  Will buy from again if prices are still low.</li>
    <li> I found the Hydro clean brush heads work WELL!  I am very satisfied with them.  I love the Phillips Sonicare System, my teeth have nevered felt so clean!  I would suggest this toothbrush and the brush heads of your choice to anyone!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other 5 star reviewers. This is Philips&#x27; best brush head to date. I have been using a Sonicare since Philips released their first model. My most recent model is the Flexcare. Philips sent me a HydroClean brush head to try out. I had been using the ProResults brush head and I had found it to be a big improvement over prior models, primarily because of its smaller size. I did not expect much improvement with the HydroClean brush head and was very pleasantly surprised to find it to be significantly superior to the ProResults brush head. My mouth and gums felt exceptionally clean. As to the issue that it is not a substitute for flossing, if you think that the purpose of flossing is to merely remove food particles from between your teeth, you need to discuss flossing with your dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> The Ultreo was the best toothbrush I have ever had. But it had a bad failing, the rechargeable batteries in the handle were of poor quality and not replaceable. During Ultreo&#x27;s short life, they sent me three replacement handles. When the company failed, i bought a bunch of replacement brushes. But the handle soon failed again. But I was able to sell my extra brushes on eBay for a very tidy sum. Next I bought the Sonicare, it was quite good. But when I got the new HydroClean brush heads, I realized they were almost as good as my old Ultreo. I feel this is quite a accomplishment as I loved my Ultreo. Ultreo is now back in business, but I will stick with my Sonicare and HydroClean brush heads.</li>
    <li> These hydro-clean toothbrush heads are a no-brainer. Much cheaper than the pro-results heads, and also designed to help replace flossing by targeting space between teeth. I saved half on these from Amazon</li>
    <li> This brush makes an excellent product even better.  Really reaches the area at the gum line.  You should check it out.</li>
    <li> Their is nothing wrong with the way that the brush heads worked, they were not very soft, which is the type of brush head that I was looking for, if you are looking for soft brush heads these are not it, but if you want medium brush heads these will work fine for you I&#x27;m sure. That is the reason for the 4 star review.</li>
    <li> These were hard to find as they appear to be discontinued.  I got them for my daughter to help keep her braces clean.  Work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Well this should be pretty self explanitory since they are toothbrush heads. However I could no longer find heads or a new tooth brush to replace the sonic care brush I already owned. I was able to find these replacement heads on Amazon which saved me spending a lot of money on a new tooth brush. The replacement heads fit, and work perfect. Very happy with my purchase, and the amount of money I saved.</li>
    <li> These brush heads arrived so quickly!  I bought twice as many for the price my local stores charge...that&#x27;s if you can even FIND them.  I&#x27;m feeling thrifty, and my teeth feel super clean.  Great product/[[ASIN:B002CVTVW8 Philips Sonicare HX6003/80 HydroClean Brush Heads, (3-Pack)]]</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Sonicare for about 10 years.  In April, I needed to order some replacements heads for my unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Since there are a limited number of brushes it seems as if they are stronger and often cut into my gums.  I have had this happen numerous times on all three in the package.  Also - it seems as the \\&quot;blue bristles\\&quot; change color rather quick.  In fact, mine were halfway worn after the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend that you stick with basic replacement head.  They have been around for years and are a good investment.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these new fangled brush heads just to see what they were all about... The center \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; seemed to be doing its job of directing water and toothpaste between my teeth, but it felt like it was a tad too long and hard, causing some discomfort on the gums.  Maybe just something to get used to... However, comparing side by side the new heads and the old brush heads, I still prefer the feeling of the old ones.</li>
    <li> These are what I would consider to be the best brush heads for the Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve used however; it would appear that Phillips is phasing these out for other models. If you can still find them, they are a good initial method of cleaning your teeth prior to flossing.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush, hoping it would perform as stated.  However, when I used it, I didn&#x27;t any positive effects of the \\&quot;hydroclean\\&quot; design.  What I did notice was this:    -It was hard to brush my teeth with that annoying rubber thing sticking out   -The bristles themselves were firmer than the ProResults brush heads   -There were less bristles because of the rubber in the middle  -No noticeable \\&quot;directing of fluids\\&quot; between my teeth.     Think about it:  The only way this would work is if there was a large amount of water rushing between your teeth.  Firstly, when I brush my teeth, I don&#x27;t have very much fluid in my mouth, only a minimal amount of toothpaste.  Secondly, this brush head is only capable of weakly directing the fluids at your teeth.  If you want the results described by this brush head, buy a Waterpik instead.  As for me, I would rather have bristles cleaning between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! This tooth brush head is the best ever and I don&#x27;t think I would go back to a standard tooth brush head again. From the first time you use the HydroClean you can feel a difference! Cleaner, fresher, smoother teeth that last a lot longer because you seem to be removing more plaque from your teeth with each use. I completely recommend the Philips Sonicare Hydro Clean tooth brush heads to anyone wanting a fresh feeling mouth!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, dentist says teeth are staying much better.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush because it cleans better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought it on a whim and then couldn&#x27;t find the replacemnt brush for it until I thought about looking for it on Amazon. I looked and there it was. It fits just right and is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> i like the hydro brush it is better than flossing or water pic not really but it sure makes dental cleaning easier</li>
    <li> These were a refill for the Sonicare toothbrush that I use.  This style is difficult to find locally.  The price was also a good value.</li>
    <li> I believe the HydroClean head does a better job getting between the teeth than the standard Sonicare head.  It&#x27;s a good assist for people with periodontal problems.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Sonicare toothbrush head with one of these about a month ago. Works fine. Not loose like some reviewers have said about bargain-brand clones. Still a bit pricey, but if it cleans my teeth well it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well these brush heads push the saliva through the spaces around your teeth.  Much better than the regular toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought these brush heads at a local store &amp; loved them, but then couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  I called Philips &amp; was told that they stopped manufacturing them about a year ago but I might be able to purchase some from Amazon...which I did.  I bought several packages - they are worth the money!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference between the results of this brush vs the regular ones. I bought these cheaper and they did just as well.</li>
    <li> I never really cared for these brush heads.  Its really just personal preference, there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with them.  I just prefer the regular brush head or the diamond one.</li>
