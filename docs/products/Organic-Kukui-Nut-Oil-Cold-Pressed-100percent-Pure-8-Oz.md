      <li>So, as the title says: this is good stuff, but it&#x27;s not the best Kukui Oil readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has not proven itself to be all that impressive so far</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great  - really.  </li>

      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not scented.  </li>
      <li>and I use it in so many places.  </li>
      <li>The refinement process has dulled the effectiveness of Dr. Adorable&#x27;s product somewhat.  </li>
      <li>Love the oil.  </li>
      <li>The Body Butter helps spread the oil more evenly, but I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The refinement process has dulled the effectiveness of Dr. Adorable&#x27;s product somewhat.  </li>
      <li>It was better than I thought it  would be as a skin softener.  </li>
      <li>Dr. Adorable&#x27;s Organic Kukui Oil is refined.  </li>

      <li>Dr. Adorable&#x27;s kukui oil has some distinct advantages to it, with only a few disadvantages when compared to what I consider the best bottled product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>kukui oil is the color of toasted almond and has a distinctly nut-like scent.  </li>
      <li>Every product we have purchased from Dr. Adorable has been delivered early, exceeds expectations, order after order.  </li>

      <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and makes it soft.</li>
      <li>: This is pure oil.</li>

      <li>/&gt;But first, let&#x27;s clear something up:  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and actually is unscented.</li>

      <li>If you&#x27;re scent sensitive but want to use Kukui Nut Oil, this is the one you want.  </li>
      <li>The reason I just gave it a 4-star is because my cuticles are dry which causes my nails to be brittle but the oil does not seem to soak into my cuticles/hands unless I have showered first.</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin, I highly recommend it, (and even if you don&#x27;t).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used kukui oil straight from the presser, as well as two other brands of kukui oil.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fells and smells like Kukui Nut Oil, so for all purposes it appears to be as advertised.  Excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> I put this on my hands and arms before I go to bed. Just a little goes a long way and it is all natural as compared to hand lotions that are filled with carcinogenics. The next day I can still feel it softening my skin. This was recommended by &amp;#34;The Peoples Chemist&amp;#34; Shane.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from Sean, The People&#x27;s Chemist.  He recommended it i an email.  At first I just used it by itself, but then I decided to mix it with some Wei East body butter - now THAT&#x27;S an awesome combination.  The Body Butter helps spread the oil more evenly, but I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  If you have dry skin, I highly recommend it, (and even if you don&#x27;t).  It moisturizes and softens and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It&#x27;s great  - really.  I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Use it right after shower and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day. Absorbs quickly and actually is unscented.</li>
    <li> wow this product is pure and great, leaves my skin smooth as silk, no smell goes along way when aplied</li>
    <li> This oil is not only soothing but does not have a perfume smell. Loving it so far and if it prevents skin cancer even better</li>
    <li> This is the only skin product i will ever use again. Fully recommended.</li>
    <li> Has not proven itself to be all that impressive so far</li>
    <li> this stuff did not protect me from getting burned while I was on vacation in Pensacola Beach, Florida as stated in a recommendation I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about 3 weeks and cannot tell any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it on my arms, face and neck for a while longer to see if makes&lt;br /&gt;any difference in time.</li>
    <li> It feels great on my face and the improvement is noticeable. My acne (@44yo) is gone,red, rough patches are gone.</li>
    <li> So, as the title says: this is good stuff, but it&#x27;s not the best Kukui Oil readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used kukui oil straight from the presser, as well as two other brands of kukui oil.

Cold pressed or not, it&#x27;s clearly refined.  How do I know?&lt;br /&gt;  1. It is much lighter in color than &#x27;fresh from the cold press&#x27;, and&lt;br /&gt;  2. There is nearly no scent to this oil&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Fresh&#x27; kukui oil is the color of toasted almond and has a distinctly nut-like scent.  You can&#x27;t get &amp;#34;clearer and less-scented&amp;#34; unless you&#x27;re either cutting the oil or refining it.  And since the bottle says &amp;#34;refined&amp;#34; we&#x27;ll go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... uses.&lt;br /&gt;As a sufferer of mild eczema, man with a beard, tender of lime trees, beach walker, and lover of cats, I can easily say, that for myself:&lt;br /&gt;Kukui Oil is particularly useful in treating:&lt;br /&gt;  Mild eczema (relieves pain and soothes pink inflamed skin)&lt;br /&gt;  Coarse &amp; unruly hair (use as a leave-in conditioner; apply oil then brush to work in)&lt;br /&gt;  Scratches and minor abrasions (apply a drop or two to finger tips and work into scratches &amp; scuffs)&lt;br /&gt;  Sunburn (apply directly to sunburned areas and gently work into skin)&lt;br /&gt;  Razor burn, rough skin, chapped skin (apply a few drops to hands and work into affected areas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the above apply to Dr. Adorable&#x27;s Organic Kukui Nut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is pure oil. It will help treating sunburn but is useless as sunscreen.  Nowhere on the bottle does it give you an SPF rating; therefore it is NOT sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As oils go, kukui oil is pretty thin.  It will run EVERYWHERE, so resist the urge to remove the cap.  This goes for all kukui oil and is not brand specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the blah-blah-blah out of the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;re scent sensitive but want to use Kukui Nut Oil, this is the one you want.

    <li> Every product we have purchased from Dr. Adorable has been delivered early, exceeds expectations, order after order.  This is no exception.  We have been mixing our own oils for some time now for oil skin cleansing with various mixtures.  We have never had a bad product or bad service from Dr. Adorable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to think much of health comes from oils.  This is great on the skin and on the hail.  You only need a minute quantity.  Makes your skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I like the oil very much to use after a shower. The reason I just gave it a 4-star is because my cuticles are dry which causes my nails to be brittle but the oil does not seem to soak into my cuticles/hands unless I have showered first. I would like to apply the oil and and on during the day to help with this problem but my hands remain oily for too long and I am afraid of transfering the oil to my clothing, etc.</li>
    <li> Love the oil.  It is not greasy.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and makes it soft. It helps heal 2 yr. old granddaughter&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;excema.  Also helps to heal cuts and bruises on the skin.  I gave it a 4 star rating because it is listed as being &amp;quot;refined&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;which entails a heating process, instead of &amp;quot;cold pressed&amp;quot;  which does not use heat, as advertised.  Overall, I&#x27;d buy it&lt;br /&gt;again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s not scented.  I&#x27;m working on healing hands of psoriasis. I&#x27;m also using as a night oil treatment for eyes.</li>
    <li> It was better than I thought it  would be as a skin softener.  It turned out to a skin rejuvenator!</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I&#x27;ve ever used, wonderful and I use it in so many places.  100% Pure is top quality, no greasy lingering feeling and works wonders on any open areas of skin.  I believe it heals my skin sores quicker.  Using on face and it is wonderful, before my makeup, you would think makeup slides right off but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m getting low on this product and will be ordering soon.  WONDERFUL OIL</li>
    <li> I love this &amp; I put it in my hair rinse. My gray hair looks &amp; manages completely different now.</li>
    <li> Thought I would use this, but haven&#x27;t really touched it. The bottle is not really very convenient and I&#x27;m not sure I like the slight smell of it.</li>
