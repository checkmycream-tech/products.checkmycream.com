<li> I shopped around at other websites including overstock, macy&#x27;s, and Calvin Klein but amazon</li>
<li> It is not too heavy for everyday use.  </li>
<li> something I usually wear in the winter months.  </li>
<li> Have used this fragrance for at least 10 years, and have continual complememts.</li>
<li> The perfume alone is expensive, but in the trio pack, you can&#x27;t beat the value.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I got the package that they had swapped out the small bottle for a bottle of Obsession Night perfume.  </li>
<li> In 20 years, this is the 1st bad transaction I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
<li> and I am dearly disappointed,</li>

    <li> I have used obsession for more than 25 years and I thought when I turned 50 everyone said I would have to change since your body chemistry changes over time thank the heavens I did not have that problem and to this day I get compliments on how great I smell not overpowering just nice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars because there was an initial problem with the ordering process (seller&#x27;s side, not amazon), however, once I got the product, it was really great.  Packaged well, quicker delivery than I expected, and the product was exactly what I&#x27;d ordered with no substitutions.  As for the product itself, Obsession is one of the best scents in the world with a vibrant mix that is great for day and night.  Others will tell you it&#x27;s a day-time fragrance, but it is truly for all times.  Very romantic smell and is particularly fabulous when you shower first with a fruity or citrus based body wash (like grapefruit, mango or orange spice).    This is one I use constantly and it still lasted 2 months.  Great price and totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This set is a more economical choice than the individual items sold elsewhere.  All three bottles cost about the same (a little less, a little more in some cases) than just one of the bottles sold individually.  I recommend this set for anyone looking to purchase Obsession Eau De Parfum spray.</li>
    <li> Have used this fragrance for at least 10 years, and have continual complememts. Some people have even told me it smell somewhat like baby powder.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Macy&#x27;s has the exact product and it cost $30.00 more at their store. So this a also a great price.</li>
    <li> sent old perfume....called friend at Macys, tried to track barcode listed on box set to see of age, perfume was so old it was un-trackable by bar code</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit because I needed the small travel size bottle of perfume in addition to the large.  I was very disappointed when I got the package that they had swapped out the small bottle for a bottle of Obsession Night perfume.  This is clearly not what the picture or written description states that it will be.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as what you buy in the store (sitting in the warehouse awhile?), but it works for me because Obsession is a strong fragrance,something I usually wear in the winter months.  I can wear this all year long.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the quality of and how fast I received my product and how wonderful amazon.com is.</li>
    <li> I order this set so I could get the mini. Like another reviewer I got the Obsession Nights Mini instead of the original Obsession. I contacted the seller and they emailed me that was what I ordered but I could ship the Nights back and they would ship the original. I came here to double check the product detail. In the picture of this product is the original Obession mini. There is another set for $51.50 that has the Nights mini. So I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay shipping to get the correct item! Shame on Amazon for dealing with this vendor!</li>
    <li> I think all women love this perfume. I love it, gives me nostalgia every time I smell it. Get it, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> Obsession is my favorite perfume. I shopped around at other websites including overstock, macy&#x27;s, and Calvin Klein but amazon had the best price. If you have never tried this perfume or if you are looking fir a new fragrance for a loved one - this is it</li>
    <li> This item was at a great price. Obsession is a scent that can always be counted on. The box it comes in is beautiful and sparkly which makes for a great gift.</li>
    <li> This was a great set and a much much cheaper then in the store.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been around for years.  That tells you something.  It is not too heavy for everyday use.  It has been my favorite for over forty years.  I&#x27;ve tried other, but always return to Obsession.  Was a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed Obsession for many years and this lovely set didn&#x27;t let me down.  It still smells great!</li>
    <li> I received this item on a timely basis but there was no cologne in either cologne bottle and no lotion in the lotion bottle. All 3 bottles were melted to the inside of the box and the box reeked of \\&quot;Obsession\\&quot; so I wound up paying $60 for nothing and received no refund.  I would not recommend buy from this buyer. In 20 years, this is the 1st bad transaction I&#x27;ve ever had and I am dearly disappointed,</li>
    <li> What an awesome deal!  I saved about $20.00 by shopping here on Amazon.  It is the original product and smells awesome as ever!  I will definitely check here first before ever buying in a department store again!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and like the body lotion.  The small bottle is great for travel. The perfume alone is expensive, but in the trio pack, you can&#x27;t beat the value.  The problems is - this trio is no longer available at a reasonable cost.  The manufacturer no longer packages this trio and you can&#x27;t purchase the body lotion separately.</li>
