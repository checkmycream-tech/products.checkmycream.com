<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used many many products like this but I have to say this is by far my favorite. It makes my face feel so soft and gives it a glow. It has a light refreshing scent and it is not greasy. My faces feels silky and smooth. This will def be my go to morning and nice face moisturizer!</li>
    <li> My skin has been dry and flaky lately, specially around the nose area.  And the have develloped crows lines around my eyes.  After using thise cream for just one week, I noticed that my eyes have become brighter, and the dark cicles has became lighter.  Also, my skin looks younder and brighter.</li>
    <li> Love it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth , leaving fine lines and wrinkles behind.  Loved it !</li>
    <li> I put this on before I go to bed and I have noticed no Crows Feet, and still no crows feet after 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone, I&#x27;m a man that still doesn&#x27;t mean I have to walk around with wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;and crows feet, My girl friend likes it also.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer...my mom is currently using it with me and she also loves it.......it leaves the skin very smooth and is not at all greasy which we both love.</li>
    <li> It smells good and seems to be working. I&#x27;m a firm believer in Retinol and it&#x27;s definitely doing what it&#x27;s suppose to, I can feel my skin getting tighter</li>
    <li> Works well as a isturizer for someone with dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles. I will update my review if I see better results.</li>
    <li> This comes in a big 2 oz bottle with a pump top.  It is a creamy white cream with very little odor.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling very moisturized (one of the main ingerdients is aloe).  It does not leave my face sticky or tacky at all.  It did not cause any redness or burning either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with retinol products...MAKE SURE YOU WEAR SUNSCREEN! Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun so make sure you put on sunscreen even if your not going to be outside for long.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a week. My skin feels firmer.</li>
    <li> Retinol has made a huge difference in my skin. Wrinkles aren&#x27;t noticeable because of my dry skin anymore. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week now. Very excited about this product. It is light and not greasy and my skin feels softer. It is a wonderful nighttime moisturizer. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and it seems to work as well as any of the other expensive products out there. I have using in in combination with the face cream. I can feel it tightening the skin under and around my eyes when I first apply it. It has a warming feeling for a few minutes then goes away. I will keep using it and see how it does over the long run. It will last quite a while as I only use a little at a time.</li>
    <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this, the scent was light and the feeling/look was luminous. My skin felt softer and firmer. I apply this once in the morning since it is light and absorbs quickly and I use another in the evening.  I like the bottle and the airless pump. There is no burning or irritation. It is a great daily face moisturizer and I love that there is added retinol and hyaluronic acid. After all that is the key to getting younger skin. This is something I look for in a facial product. I am not getting any younger.</li>
    <li> Received product within a few days of ordering.  Have used it consistently for 2 weeks....like how it makes my face feel,very light. May see slight improvement, but am hoping with longer use the lines on either side if my mouth become less prominent.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This anti aging cream is so much more than a wrinkle eraser. It makes your skin so soft and evens the tones out great. I have been using for about 2 wks and am so impressed by the results. The puffy dark circles under my eyes are going away and I look so much more alert then usual. My skin seems to be glowing almost like that skin you get when you have a baby and they say your skin just glows or shines. I am so happy with this cream I wish I had before and after pics because I&#x27;ve even had compliments on how much fresher my face looks. I would highly recommend this anti aging cream to all who want to turn back a few years.</li>
    <li> In the very short time (1 week) that I have used this product, my skin looks and feels amazing.  The lines my around my eyes, forehead and mouth areas have softened and my skin has a healthy glow.  I am 57 years old and would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve the quality and appearance of their skin.</li>
    <li> I always try to get the trendiest most recent facial products and believe me this will not fail loving it.</li>
    <li> Anti-Aging face cream is a soft and light moisturizer which absorbs easily into face.  I use after the serum and the two together supplements each other. As good as they describe.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and so far so good! It has a light nice scent and the bottle is very pretty!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  The next morning after the first night that I tried it, I could already see a difference!!  I have good skin to begin with, but I have always struggled with dark circles due to severe allergies and thin skin.  This has almost completely eradicated my dark circles.  I was really curious to see how well this really worked so my husband actually tried it on only half of his face and wow, what a difference.  He is still trying to even things out now, because the difference is so noticeable.  I recommended this product to my mom and I am amazed at how much of a difference it has made to her skin!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, definitely give this stuff a try!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream - works well !</li>
    <li> Made me face really dry..........don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love love this product. I have been using for a little over a week and my face feels amazing. Definitely recommend this product. Thank you for this awesome deal.</li>
    <li> This cream is Wonderful!  I can truly see a difference is the short time I&#x27;ve used it.  The best part is the compliments.</li>
    <li> I tried the cream on half my face to see how it works. The side where I used it was plumper and softer looking. There was a noticeable difference between the two sides. The skin was also much softer to the touch. A  little goes a long way but I would definitely purchase more when I finish it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Everything you need in one bottle.  My face feels so moisturized and stays soft feeling through the day.  Using the pump is much better than a jar.  There is less waste and it stays fresher.  Glad I found this.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on easily, soaks in quickly instead of just sitting on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes..  Has a light pleasant smell that dissapates quickly.  I can feel my skin tightening but my skin still looks moisturized.  Only been using about a week so look forward to seeing how it does in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my skin a lot..I have older skin ...it is softer,&lt;br /&gt;seems to be helping with fine lines and keeping it hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love that this Anti aging cream has RETINOL - it is the next best thing to plastic surgery.  It&#x27;s the best non evasive product out there to remove fine lines and lesson wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Works faster than other creams. Results in a week. Yes I could see clearer skin in a week. I suggest that if you have not found the right cream keep trying and see what works for you. I don&#x27;t  think it should take two or four weeks to see some results</li>
    <li> I do not see any noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month and have not seen a difference in the lines on my forehead or laugh lines around my mouth</li>
    <li> I am so happy, i just received my face cream and i am in love! I have spent years, ton of money and time trying to find something to help me with my increasing wrinkles. As soon as i put this cream on felt like my skin was tighter and healthier. it wasnt greasy like alot of other creams and it felt like the Retinol Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid made a difference right away. I am excited to try more products Ove Beauty products</li>
    <li> Odorless and light. Perfect for oily sensitive skin like mine. I clean my face and use this nightly.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, I like to indulge my skin in lots of moisturizing and preventative aging creams so that when I&#x27;m in my 40s and 50s, my skin is more elastic and looks fresh. Unfortunately I&#x27;m already starting to have problems with puffy eyes and dark circles/bags, so I decided to pick this up along with some vitamin C serum. What I love about this retinol cream is that my skin drinks it up. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sit on the surface. I appreciate the *quality* ingredients (vitamins C, E and A, aloe..) and it makes my skin nice and soft. This is perfect to use on a clean face.. at night before bed, or in the morning before you apply makeup. Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a week, but I&#x27;ve been consistent and I can tell my skin is so much smoother. Winter is pretty harsh on my skin, but now that I&#x27;m using this consistently I am not even using a moisturizer - I apply pretty liberally before bed.</li>
    <li> This is a great face cream, pleasant scent, easy to use and absorbs well into my face with out leaving a sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> Ok..haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. Dissapointed after the supposed high reviews.</li>
    <li> Pretty good at moisturizing.  Haven&#x27;t seen any changes in lines or wrinkles though, but have only been using it about a week so it may take longer to notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this. My fine line and wrinkles are seriously diminishing. This is making me so excited. I also apply to my neck. My skin feels so good. This is a must have product. I&#x27;m only 42 and will continue with this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i needed for my skin</li>
    <li> I already see a difference..when at 44 you get carded to buy Alcohol you know something is different. Not to mention how good my face feels... A lot of creams give me issues with my sensitive skin... I have had no issues with this one... and WOW --carded at 44... Love it</li>
    <li> I loved this cream from the minute i started using it. Its texture and fragrance is really good. And its very mild on the skin. Once applied you wont know as its not sticky at all. I can feel fresh for hours and my skin feels smoother too. A very good product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a week but it seems to be helping</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product a week, but I swear I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I&#x27;m not very familiar with products like this. After being offered this at a promotional discount I figured it would be dumb to pass it up. After a couple of weeks of using this, I&#x27;m only disappointed it took me this long to use it. It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on easy, and feels great. Would recommend a thousand times.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face moisturized.  Have only been using a couple days and no bad side effects.</li>
    <li> This cream is luxurious feeling as you apply.  It goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs quickly.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I am already noticing a softening of the wrinkles near my eyes.  I really like this cream and I will be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks now and the texture of my skin (face) improved significantly. My wife told me several times how smooth and youthful my face looks. The wrinkles on my forehead also reduced conspicuously. Another plus (for me at least) is the fact that this product does not leave any messy streaks of greasy (shiny) residue on my face, while at the same time my skin looks fresh and silky. I am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and feels good on the face.  I put it on under my makeup, and it works well.  Also, very lightly scented.  Feels very fresh.  I recommend this product to males and females.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she said she loves it so far. It came on time, it looked like it was supposed to. It will take more time to tell, but this product already looks better than competitors.</li>
    <li> Good cream. Probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Does not have a smell at all. Goes on smooth and gives very speedy results. I was looking for a product to increases glow and moisturize without clogging pores. This was great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Who ever said getting old was the &amp;#34; GOLDEN YEARS&amp;#34; just lied to us to make us feel better about the inevitable. You get dry skin, wrinkles, loss of tissue volume around the mouth and eyes, and loss of elasticity in the skin. I&#x27;m way too young for that however it is a reality.&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try Ove&#x27;s &amp;#34;Beauty Anti-Aging Face Cream&amp;#34; and I immediately recognized a change. The cream glides on your skin and feels light, refreshing, that does not leave a greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and a small bit goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t burn, itch, or cause any redness on my face. The results are quite noticeable and from the first use I could feel my skin was softer and had more moisture. Since I use this every day I have seen a reduction in wrinkles. I received a discount on this product in exchange I am giving my honest feedback of this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller, perfect item!</li>
    <li> Great product to stop the signs of aging in its tracks. I love this product and would recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Non- irritating and really penetrates the skin nicely. So far I have been most satisfied!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with all my orders!&lt;br /&gt;Came on time too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. I have been playing with different brands and types of anti aging creams hoping that I would see some changes in my skin, and honestly, had not really seen much. With this cream, I can not only see results but I can feel them too. I use this in combination with a Vitamin C serum and an eye cream, and I am really feeling the difference. My skin feels firmer, without feeling stretched. I can see an increase in hydration, and my eyes look more awake. A little goes a long way, which is nice, because this will last me a while. Even without snagging a promotional price, this is a good deal for a great cream. The bottle is attractive, and looks nice on the shelf, the instructions were easy to follow and the cream feels great after application. There is a refreshing tingle you feel from Hylauronic acid, but it is not unpleasant at all. Very happy with this product and plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smooth &amp; non drying to face, i love the feeling as i apply the product. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> They are nice to have. It does really work well with my skin and I do not get any redness and reaction from it...none. I am glad that I get this one that does not cause my skin go crazy.....</li>
    <li> I put this cream every night.  It makes my face very smooth.  In just few days of using, I can already notice that the the dryness of my face is lessening.  I will definitely buy this item and recommend it to friends...</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer few times and I personally do not like the way it gets applied to your skin. It is not smooth enough to get absorbed into skin quickly. Rather it stays on your face like wall primer for awhile. Also, when I finally rubbed it into my skin, I applied foundation on top . Unfortunately cream crumbled and didn&#x27;t blend with makeup.</li>
    <li> Works well, not too heavy. Not sure I&#x27;m seeing any big difference in my fine lines, but is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> With ingredience of both Retinal and Hyaluronic Acid I expected this to be good but was really unprepared for just what a powerhouse product this was. It just took a couple days and I could see a glowing skin and a definite tightening. I was especially pleased with the tightening on my neck. It didnt make it perfect but it sure made it smoother and tighter. Better than any of th eother many products I have bought. I will be a repeat user of this for sure.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizing cream. The retinol has done wonders for the lines on my forehead. This cream leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks later my husband said &amp;#34;whatever you are doing to your face keep doing it. My friends are telling me how good my makeup looks...I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s gotta be Ove!</li>
    <li> Feels good.  I do not see any change yet but then I am elderly.  Might try another product soon.</li>
    <li> Really recommend it! Miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I feel like I can already see some firmness after just a couple of uses. Good, reasonable anti shining cream is so hard to find.</li>
    <li> Just trying different things.  Works well, but will try something else next.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Works better than anything I have tried in the last 50 years.  I will most definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the best recommendation I can give. She buys uses all kinds moisturizer/anti aging creams; low to high priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product too. I never used or paid much attention to facial cosmetics but after a month I do notice that my complexion feels and looks smoother. Or is it that I am spending more attention to washing and moisturizing which I never did (moisturize) before?</li>
    <li> Great product. It works suprisingly well. It has reduced the appearance of some brown spots and at the same time it firms up the skin. It is a light lotion that is almost weightless.I put it on at night and wear a sunscreen in the morning. I have recommended this lotion to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> I am ALWAYS hesitant to try new skin products if they aren&#x27;t for controlling acne. My skin has always been a constant mess of breakouts, white heads, black heads, probably even had a purple zit a few times. So when trying this product I was pleasantly surprised that I did not experience any breakouts! (Which is a challenge as it&#x27;s the summer and I&#x27;m sweating constantly!) So this will NOT CLOG YOUR PORES! Definitely works well with oily skin types. Now, on to the good stuff - anti-wrinkles! For what I lack in clear skin genes, I make up for in young looking skin (I guess the acne helps me look younger). Many people already think I&#x27;m a teenager, but I&#x27;m in my late 20s. This product may not be the most impactful for people so young. Though with everyone my age wanting to be out in the sun, this is a great product to start reversing some of that sun damage! I&#x27;m hoping that this will help with some of those &#x27;sun spots&#x27; that I may develop as a I get older. Prevention now is super important! The cream doesn&#x27;t smell, and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s easy to apply - why wouldn&#x27;t someone try this? Price point is great too. I was glad to review when asked after I saw this opportunity available. I usually have to go to department stores for eye cream of this quality (my mother does!). I will be bringing some over for my MIL and I will probably be her favorite daughter in law soon!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Light but lasting.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m a skin product snob.  I can&#x27;t help it.  I have fair and sensitive skin, and I spend WAY more money than I should on the big name spa products sold at the spa I go to, in an effort to keep my face safe from irritants.  So, when I was offered the opportunity to try this Anti-Aging/Anti-Wrinkle Face Cream, at a discount, to provide the seller with an honest review about their product, I was skeptical.  Then I saw the words Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid and I became downright nervous.  But, I liked the sound of the company, and decided (after a good look at the fine lines staring back at me in the mirror) to give this company and this product a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I was immediately struck by how large the bottle was (2 full ounces) and by how professional the packaging looked.  I was tempted to write a review just on that, but instead, I went into my bathroom, took some serious inventory of my signs of aging (yes, I took photos, but no...they are not seeing the light of day), I washed my face and put it on.  I waited for burning or tingling, but all I felt was this nice, calming sensation...like I had just lotioned my face.  None of the products I normally use (including serums and moisturizers) felt that good going on.  I kept checking for redness, but there was none.  The next morning, my face still had that moisturized, smooth feeling (and still had fine lines), but there was no redness, no breakouts (another thing that happens with my skin if I use the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; product) and no signs of any irritation at all.  So, my review continued...and every evening for four days, I washed my face and put on the skin cream (that was it...not 5 layers of facial products...just one cream on a clean face).  I am writing this on Day 5 (though I had initially planned to do a 7 day trial before writing my review) because today, the pictures of the lines on my face were noticeably different from Day 1.  Something happened, and those little lines by my outsides of my smile disappeared, my under-eye wrinkles (which I got instead of crows feet, I guess) became less visible, and the deep lines that run across my forehead were almost invisible.  But, maybe even more surprising to me, I never got a hint of irritation...or breakout...or anything.  Just skin that feels less dry than it has in years and a reflection in the mirror with a few less lines.  That&#x27;s enough to make me a believer in the product.  I didn&#x27;t need the extra two days to know that this cream is the real deal, even for my sensitive (snobby) skin.  I know that not every product works for everyone the same way, but if you are considering a change or are not totally thrilled with what you are getting out of your current facial products (no matter how much money you spent on them), I would definitely give this product a try.y my outsides of my smile disappeared, my under-eye wrinkles (which I got instead of crows feet, I guess) became less visible, and the deep lines that run across my forehead were almost invisible.

    <li> This goes on super smooth and is not greasy feeling when dry. I like how it makes my skin soft</li>
    <li> Non greasy, I gave this to my mom and she loves it. Minimize her wrinkles appearance and looking a bit younger</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. This is my second bottle. My face looks noticeably better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this at night.  I am very happy with this cream  I am in my late 30&#x27;s and still have more problems with breakouts than aging,  SO obvioulsy I was concerned about it making my skin worse.  Even though its thick and rich,it doesn&#x27;t appear to clog my pores.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks.  I think my breakouts have even been a little better.  I recieved this as part of a promotion but this review is my own.</li>
    <li> I am loving my Ove&#x27; Beauty anti aging face lotion! I have very sensitive skin so I was cautious while starting to use this product. But I have been presently surprised! I have had no irritation and my skin is feeling great! This cream goes on smooth and does not leave me feeling greasy, I especially love that during these summer months! It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, win/win!! I love that I am stoping wrinkles before they even start!! From the sleek bottle, easy pump head, and quality product this is a  a definite 5 star!! Thank you for offering this to me during a promotion!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  There is no burning or drying of my skin like I have experienced with other aging creams.  The results have been amazing!</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference with the fine lines and wrinkles.  LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. Since I have started using it I have noticed a big change in the wrinkles around my eyes and it makes my skin feel and look so much better. It is not oily and has a nice light scent to it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my aunt as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I applied it, was side tracked and went back and put on a second application of the Anti Aging Cream. I forgot I put on the first one because it was so light weight until my son pointed out to me that was the second time I put the cream on my face. Thank You! Amazing product! Light weight... perfect!</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth....even more effective when paired with a cellulite massage brush!</li>
    <li> I received my Ove&#x27; Beauty Anti Aging/Anti Wrinkle Cream today.  Comes in a nice pump bottle which makes it very easy to use.  You place it on your face each night and looking forward to seeing the results.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  This will leave you skin so soft.  I used it and saw the glow instantly.  It left my skin smooth and just glowing.  I put it on before bed and when I woke it was still soft and moisturized.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  It smells good too.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for good results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night for a little over a week, and it is pretty good stuff.  I have noticed a slight change in the fine lines around my eyes and the slight creases in my forehead.  I am 36, so I have moderate signs of aging.  No product is a &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34;, nothing will take the place of botox or plastic surgery, let&#x27;s be realistic here....but as for a lotion, this gets high marks in my book since it isn&#x27;t horribly expensive.</li>
    <li> My mom is using this, she loves that it is not oily like some creams. It goes on smooth and she recommends it if you want smooth and oily free results.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I’ve tried this cream and I’m very impressed. It absorbs really well and has a light scent, which I like.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and within a few days my skin was noticeably softer. I have also seen improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth in the short time I have using this product. For anyone looking for an effective anti-aging cream I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> i am really pleasantly surprised with the results of this cream, i have sensitive skin so i have trouble finding these type of creams that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. so far everything is looking beautiful! my fine lines are disappearing, my skin looks smoother and firmer. i really like the way it feels puttin it on and it absorbs quickly too, smells really great!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product after using it for 3 days, my skin already feels tighter and smoother! i will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every evening for awhile now and I love it! It goes on smooth and has a very light, fresh scent. I have noticed my skin feels tighter and softer since I have been using it!  The quantity is great, and the dispenser gives just enough for an application! I will be sure to reorder and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a anti aging cream!</li>
    <li> Very light feeling, light scent and you will get your monies worth. All it takes is one pump and you will have enough for your whole face :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! The seller was awesome! Will purchase again. Leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My skin looks flawless! This product does not irritate the skin. I received this very fast.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well as a night cream.  I supplement this into my nightly regiment and even after a few days I can see results.</li>
    <li> Nice cream. No scent that I can smell. Not greasy. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it makes a difference in my skin&#x27;s apperance. I&#x27;ll update in the future.</li>
    <li> Leaves Skin Feeling Soft and Supple, Would Definitely Recommend To My Friends</li>
    <li> I love this face cream!  I have sensitive skin and was more than pleased with the results.  It goes on smoothly and feels luxurious.  Most importantly my skin looks fantastic, healthy and radiant.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This face cream seems working....keep trying...</li>
    <li> Great product! Seen good results so far.</li>
    <li> The product is light. A small dab goes on smoothly, covers well and never feels greasy. My skin feels softer already after a few weeks of use. I have sensitive skin that has not been aggravated in the slightest bit by this product.</li>
    <li> Great face cream! I bought this for my mom as a gift, &amp; she says she loves it! She really feels its helping her skin.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! I don&#x27;t believe any anti-age produce before until starting to use this cream. After 3 weeks trial, the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are less than before. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product - I like how it absorbs well and very easy to apply on face. It leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard dermalogica fan but I don&#x27;t love any of their moisturizers, I was contemplating a vitamin c serum when I found this! This replaces 2 moisturizers I was layering at night! I&#x27;ll definitely be trying the rest of this line! Huge difference after 2 nights!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used very little of this product and I like it.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else says it&#x27;s a great cream and it&#x27;s an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got hold of a generous discount coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it as a gift to a friend who had heard me talk about other Ove products and really wanted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does she really like it, but I didn&#x27;t even have to ask whether or not she was using it, because when I saw her after two weeks, it was obvious that either she&#x27;d fallen in love, or something pretty great was happening with her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She looks much healthier, and sort of younger. Her skin looks smooth and not-dry, and her skin tone is more even and far less red that it was before she started using it. It&#x27;s been over a month now, and her face continues to look better and fresher. She said she feels like it plumps up her skin and keeps moisture in it. Wrinkles are smoother and pores are tighter.&lt;br /&gt;The lines around her lips are less pronounced and her lipstick stays on and looks better.  Her &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are now more like &amp;#34;light laugh lines&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy, and I&#x27;m happy for her.</li>
    <li> This cream is very nice &amp; i have already noticed the difference on my face.</li>
    <li> Make skin feel awesome</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I feel rejuvenated. Have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> So far (1week) I am very impressed. Hopefully the wrinkles are disappearing &amp; it&#x27;s not just old age eyesight.</li>
    <li> Received my Ove Beauty anti aging face cream and from the first time using it could feel a difference in the way my skin felt several hours later.  Will upgrade my review after using this product for several weeks  By the way, 63 yrs young and had many years of outdoor exposure so this product will be put to the test!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes your face feel so hydrated and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have only had this 3 days. Don&#x27;t know yet how it works.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product with a light fresh fragrance that I don&#x27;t mind, and I&#x27;m not a fan of scented products usually. It also doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin, other products that are scented always bother my skin but I really like this.</li>
    <li> Another beauty! Not only do I love this product but I love this brand. This is the 2nd item I&#x27;ve purchased from Ove&#x27;. Exceptional... is all I can say. Worth every penny.  It works immediately but even better over time. A brand like no other but bargain priced for the quality it is. My new FAV!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! I use to never worry about my skin, but as I&#x27;m getting older I have been looking for something and I believe I have found it!  It makes my skin feel young and smooth! It absorbs quickly into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a great feeling! If you are worried about wrinkles or fine lines I highly recommend you get this product!</li>
    <li> This cream works nicely. Does as advertised, will order again</li>
    <li> I have not been using it long enough to make a determination yet.  However, I do believe that I am seeing some tightness in my skin.  I am very pleased so far.  I am using it twice a day.  I will update this review as I go along!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom. She&#x27;s tried so many products but only a couple of them makes her happy and this is one of them. I (she) definitely recommends this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> great packaging. I love the look of this bottle.  the shipping was fast and it helps with my oily face dilemma .  one very satisfy customer.  Would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
    <li> I really love this retinol and hyaluronic product because it works great for me. Those two ingredients are great for anti-aging. Before this product, I had to buy a retinol cream and then a hyaluronic acid. I was really shocked that they have a product with both of those ingredients in it. Nowadays I just use this instead of two separate products and it even simplify my beauty routine down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks.  First - it has a pleasant smell!  That alone would keep me using it.  Not too perfumy.  It quickly was absorbed into my skin and did not leave a greasy feeling at all.  I usually wash my face two times a day. Morning when I wake up and before bed.  This has given my skin a softer look and a kind of glow. I will order this product again.  Love love love that its not greasy!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the results of this night time miracle cream. My &amp;#34;turkey neck waddle&amp;#34; is no longer the first thing I see in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream, but I love it.  It makes my skin feel so much better and I&#x27;m excited about the results so far.  It&#x27;s by far the best of this type I&#x27;ve used.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using Ove Beauty products, they have a wonderful fresh, light scent and work great on my sensitive skin. Retinol has been used for years to reduce to appearance of lines and wrinkles and Hyaluronic Acid nourishes and replenishes the moisture of your skin. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Ove Beauty products and always enjoyed them. I started to use this anti aging cream and I am hooked! I have noticed a change in my oh so aging face. Wrinkles are not as distinct and the dark circles are gone! My skin is sensitive and I am picky about what I use. I have a had full of facial product I use and this is now part of my handful of products I will keep using. I also love how it does not leave a nasty greasy residue.</li>
    <li> the most important thing about moisturizer is feel fresh, make the skin plump, and feel smooth not greasy. well this have all that, it make it favorable to use it then feeling like chore. I really like the way it feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent creme. My daughter and I have been using it. The smell alone is fantastic! Goes on smooth, skin drinks it right in. My face feels soft &amp; moisturized. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is not an immediate result kind of thing. I bought this for my mom to use on crows feet , and within two-three days there was obvious improvement. THe cream is not oily or sticky, it feels like top quality lotion. I&#x27;d use this product to aid with my wrinkles if i had any!</li>
    <li> I am using this cream every night, it is very smooth in the face.. I notice that it also lessen the dryness of my face.  I will definitely buy this again and recommend it to friends....</li>
    <li> The Ove Beauty Anti Aging Face Cream comes in a nice sized container and dispenses just the right amount of product needed for application.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but I&#x27;m pleased to say that I still want to keep using it.  It goes on smoothly, does not leave any sort of sticky feeling on my skin.  I&#x27;m using it every other day to avoid any kind of drying out of my skin.  The scent is minimal.  I&#x27;m a fan!  My skin feels great and it&#x27;s doing a great job of keeping it moisturized and not greasy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites! I cant wait to try other products by them.  My face feels so soft and hydrated. A natural glow on a daily basis now. Dont know what I was missing until I found this!</li>
    <li> I am really in love with this Anti Aging Serum. I have been using it daily now for a few weeks and I think I can see some results! My skin seems firmer almost. The packaging is beautiful and the quality of the product is comparable to high end department store products. I love it alot. - Amy</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders for my skin.  It comes in a great dispensing container.  It works well for acne prone skin with fine lines.  I use it after I wash  my face at night.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It goes on smooth, and does not leave a greasy feeling on your face. It does not have a strong smell to it also, which is a plus. The pump put&#x27;s out just enough so you are not wasting product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It smells good and I noticed the next day that my crows feet were disappearing. I have been using it morning and night so that might be why but I see that the fine lines I have been lessening.  It also keep my skin very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have a youthful glow to this Anti Aging cream. My face feels super soft. I have sensitive skin and I am happy to report no problems at all using this awesome product. I can tell a difference in how my face looks and feels. My mother even asked if I had a facial done! This is a great product and a great value. it would make a great gift for your girlfriends. I am going to buy more of this, I can&#x27;t stop touching my soft face.It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling either. This really is one of the better creams I have purchased in a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream.  It has a light pleasant scent and nice consistency.  It goes on easily and is absorbed quickly.  I can see that the fine lines of my face look much better already after less than a week.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants better skin!</li>
    <li> This really is a great lotion overall. It has a great texture and is absolutely a non-greasy formula that doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on my skin. I definitely feel like it moisturizes well, too, as it really does seem as though my skin is softer after application of this product. I took off a star, though, because I don&#x27;t immediately feel like it&#x27;s working. I don&#x27;t get the sensation of tightness I get from other similar products. I&#x27;ve tried multiple other anti aging products that really give me the immediate sensation that the product is living up to its promise, but I just don&#x27;t feel that way with this little product. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a deal breaker or anything, but I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item but i really love it ...the ingredients inside like retinol and hyaluronic works very well on me. I m not too much old but before this product i start to feel my face changing and I was really shocked just after one week and also i like to use this instead of two separate products and it even simplify my beauty routine. Now i recommend this cream to all my friends and i really hope they will be as satisfy as me !!!</li>
    <li> Seeing visible results after just 3 days.  My skin is badly sun damaged and these spots are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely pleased.</li>
    <li> Suspicious reviews??? I bought this based on the star rating (4.8/5) and just tried it on. I can&#x27;t yet really review if it works, but can say that a little does go a long way as others have mentioned, it leaves no greasy feeling, and my face feels like it&#x27;s tightening as if I had a peel mask on. There&#x27;s no scent that I can notice or any irritation. For the price it was worth a shot in my opinion, but just be cautious on some of the reviews as they end with the same &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; statement, with some written in grammatical error...&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived quickly in a Manila padded envelope.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working quickly...hope it continues</li>
    <li> I only purchased this product a few days ago. So I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any results this fast. I was pleasantly surprised when I did. My face is so much smoother and firmer. And I even see a few fine lines disappearing. This is definitely a great product and worth trying!!!</li>
    <li> Being a Florida native and living in Florida all my life, I have years of  sun-damaged skin. Sun-damage has wreaked havoc on my skin with giving me some fine lines forming around my eyes, some wrinkles on my forehead and some all over discoloration.  This moisturizer with hyaluronic acid is like reversing the effects of the sun damage on my face. I have been using it for a few weeks and on a daily basis. It has reduced the appearance of my wrinkles and lines on my face. It is easy to use; just apply to your face and neck after you wash it in the evening before bed. It says to allow 30-60 days to reach the full effect, but I can see results already, and I know with continued use I will see more and more improvement.</li>
    <li> My skin is much softer and healthier feeling.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you the benefits...I have to use it for a month or two to really give a good review.  At this moment it seems nice, not oily, absorbs in the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  Great price, excellent product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s really great. I heard from my mom that her dermatologist recommended that her night cream should contain Retinol. Naturally, being a skin care nut, I had to get my hands on some. Not only does it it help skin cell turnover but keeps skin looking flawless. It&#x27;s basically vitamin A and many, many, women swear by it. Ans the earlier you start incorporating it into your skin care regimen the better your skin will look down the road. This product not only has all the benefits of Retinol but Hylaronic Acid which is another amazing product. Best of two worlds in one container. You can&#x27;t beat that. One thing to remember is to use SPF during the day when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts:(Paula&#x27;sChoice.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an antioxidant, and thus can interrupt the free-radical damage process that causes skin to look and act older. This action helps prevent wrinkling and increases collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is effective at managing acne and eczema, as well as improving discolorations and wrinkles from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these benefits are why retinol helps your skin look and act younger! In total, retinol can help more than 100 skin issues. It is a true superstar for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with retinol&#x27;s proven anti-aging benefits, topical application can also improve pore function and, in time, pore size! It cannot change the pore size you have due to genetics, but it can reduce the size of pores that have enlarged due to clogging or sun damage.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this and wants to buy more before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Easy use. It seems to cleaning my pores from grease and making my face shine.</li>
    <li> I love this Anti Aging Cream!  I have used a couple items from Ove&#x27; and this cream is just as good a quality as the others that I have received.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the bottle itself looks like it is a high end product and it is bigger than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first washed my face and dried it.  Then I put a small amount in my hand and rubbed it into my face and on my neck.  It has a pleasant smell to it and leaves my face super soft.  As i have gotten older, skin care is becoming more of a priority for me, and this product is going to be part of my normal skin care regimen.  I look forward to the long term results from having used this.</li>
    <li> Had been waiting on this to use with my derma roller. According to my research, the ingredients in this are the best for Anti-aging. So I cherish this products. It&#x27;s never too early in life to start using these products. You are worth having great skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I have been using it for a while and my face looks more vibrant and feels smoother than before, I also really love how this has a pump! It gives out just the right amount and is not messy like most creams.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever used. I don&#x27;t know how I have never used retinol before. Is it the lotion or the retinol?? I don&#x27;t care! Either way its amazing!! It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make me look all greasy. And another thing…other lotions make my pores MORE visible. This one doesn&#x27;t. I HATE the greasy look!! Women think because their skin is shiny, it makes them look young and refreshed. It just makes you look greasy!  This leaves no greasy residue. Also, some lotions leave a film that you can literally wipe off with your bare hands. This moisturizer penetrates your skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top ready to be rubbed off. You can even put makeup on right on top of it. I use my Vitamin C serum, then the lotion, them makeup. I am Greek and Italian, so the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes has always bothered me. I slowly see that going away! And especially my crow&#x27;s feet! One day I looked in the mirror like WOW I look like a new person! LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I am 36 and keep getting more and more compliments about how young I look! Feels great! So exciting!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using it for just a week and already see a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles on my face. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft! I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try after reading all the positive reviews. So far I love this product! I have sensitive skin so must be careful about what I use on it. This lotion goes on smoothly, without being greasy. No fragrances or dyes to irritate sensitive skin. I really like the applicator which allows you to pump out the desired product while keeping the rest of it unexposed to air. Makes my skin feel very soft and this minimized the appearance of fine lines very quickly. I have only used this a few times so far, so time will tell about the long term results. A small amount of product goes a long way, don&#x27;t overdo it. Goes on great underneath make-up after allowing it to absorb for a few minutes. It&#x27;s also affordable. This product is just as good if not better than products I have tried that were three/four times the price.  It is not greasy and has a matte finish on the skin. Being a middle aged woman, shiny, greasy products only accentuate wrinkles! To wrap it up, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this product. I will submit an update to this review after using it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Great product for very mature skin.</li>
    <li> Decent enough product for the price. I work in the industry and am exposed to many different skincare lines. There really is nothing that compares to fillers and Botox, but if you don&#x27;t want to take that route, this face cream will definitely help with fine lines.</li>
    <li> Like this very much. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see results, but love the way my face and neck feel.</li>
    <li> My face is really sensitive so I have been looking for a product that doesn&#x27;t cause more problems and actually helps with my aging skin. It&#x27;s actually a hard thing to find. I had been somewhat pleased with this product. It doesn&#x27;t cause a breakout but with my sensitive skin and the 0.5% of retinol, it will dry a little more than I like but I think with the other moisturizer (coconut oil) I use in between really helps. It takes time for your skin to become acclimated to a new product. I personally would not use it three times a day but I have sensitive skin. I have freckles and it has helped the discoloration of my skin from around the bottom of my nose and under the eyes to the cheek area. This is a plus because I have cosmetically cover that usually and don&#x27;t as much now. Hopefully I will have better even better news in a month. I did receive a coupon code to give my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin.  It did turn my face red the first time but it was temporary and hasn&#x27;t done it since.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product so am unable to say how well it will work. I was looking for a face cream that would keep my face moisturized without feeling greasy. So far I can say that this product meets my expectations. I like the feel of my skin after applying the cream. I am in my 60s so don&#x27;t know if it will reverse the wrinkles I have but that would be a nice plus though it is not my expectation. If that happens I will be sure to sing this product&#x27;s praises. Just wish I had found this cream a few years ago.</li>
    <li> What a scam!! I was really naive for buying this product based on these fake reviews!!!</li>
    <li> Good price, good product and good service.</li>
    <li> Feel dry on my face...</li>
    <li> I look years younger already!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work OK. I still look old.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference already in my skin. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I just tried this face cream in the last week and I really like it! It has a very faint pleasant smell and it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my eyes like most of the retinol creams.&lt;br /&gt;My skin appearance is much better when I use it, too. Definately will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product! This does wonders for the lines on my forehead, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes I had to take a closer look after a couple of days while using it I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change of those lines on my forehead. They are almost gone they became smooth I am loving this look, please keep up the good work of producing great products for our skin.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS EVERY DAY UNDER MY MAKEUP.  IT ABSORBS QUICKLY AND IT ISN&#x27;T GREASY.  I GOT THIS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW, BUT HAD I KNOWN THAT IT WORKED THIS WELL, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT ANYWAY.  THIS IS EVERYTHING I AM LOOKING FOR IN A FACE CREAM.  I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN USING IT LONG, BUT I CAN SEE MY FINE LINES FADING.</li>
    <li> Very good for sensitive skin and has left my face feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love trying new beauty products and creams so I was very excited to be offered this cream at a promotional price to review honestly.  I have used it for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s honestly not my personal favorite cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;*  It&#x27;s heavy feeling.  I feel it when I use it.  It&#x27;s a thick cream and for this reason I only use it at night.  I can feel it on my face for a long time.  Maybe that&#x27;s a positive for it moisturizing longer?&lt;br /&gt;*  It&#x27;s basically odorless, but there is a faint smell that is likely the retinol that I&#x27;m not fond of.  I like the retinol so I can definitely deal with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I really like:&lt;br /&gt;*  The volume.  Typically creams with these ingredients come in oversized bottles with 1 oz. or less.  This one has 2 oz!  I really like that.&lt;br /&gt;*  The pump locks.  I love that the pump for the cream locks.  I have hear that you should always keep any product with retinol tightly sealed to keep it working properly and this product does that.&lt;br /&gt;*  Overlooking the heaviness of the cream I can feel my skin tightening.  I like that in an anti-aging cream!  It feels like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will finish using the entire bottle.  Will I order it again?  I am still undecided.</li>
    <li> One of the best Face cream that I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> As soon as you place the cream on your face you feel it instantly tighten. I have seen my face more vibrant and young looking.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily after using it, it just feels fresh. I use this daily and noticed that my skin feels smoother and over all just looks healthy. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or age spots yet, BUT i believe with using this  product daily, before I get wrinkles will help in minimizing or preventing them as I get older.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. I love it a great product. It makes so much difference in my face. I am older with wrinles and it makes me feel and look at least 5 years younger when I use it.</li>
    <li> Recently I saw few lines under my eyes and I was thinking of getting a good anti wrinkle cream. This cream is as good as any other expensive branded cream.  I can see quite a difference, the fine lines are a bit milder now. I have just used the product for about 5 days. Will have to update again some time later but so far so good. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for fine lines, wrinkles and black bags underneath the eyes. I am using it twice a day. I have noticed great difference on my skin. I look more fresh, young and enjoying flawless skin. I think every woman should have it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!! I have extremely oily,sensitive skin,and this product seems to work well for me! Plumps up the fine lines a little,soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Cream goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film, I can feel my skin tightening daily, such a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice...that&#x27;s what your skin is going to feel like when you use Ove Beauty with retinol and hyaluronic acid!  I feel younger just because it is making my face look &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> So far I really enjoy this product! It smells good and doesnt leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. Ive only been using it for about a week so I cant say how effective it is, but so far my face feels smoother and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried it and it is wonderful.  I think I found my new Retinol cream!</li>
