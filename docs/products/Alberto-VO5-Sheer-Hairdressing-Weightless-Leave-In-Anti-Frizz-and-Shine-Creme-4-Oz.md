<li> Ok makes the hair a little hard does not last that long put it on at night in the morning</li>
<li> I have tried several other similar products but none compare to this one!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lifesaver especially in the winter when your hair gets &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; due to indoor dry heat.</li>
<li> If I forget to apply it I can feel the difference immediately in my hair when I start to blow dry and style.</li>
<li> One has to select hairdressing to suit one&#x27;s hair: Mine is naturally platinum-white and thick and very coarse.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t dream of using any other product.    </li>
<li> also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or gummy like a lot of other products do.</li>
<li> this is lighter and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
<li> down to Food Lion whenever i needed some.</li>
<li> I bought this because I color my hair and it tends to get dull and frizzy at times when I flat iron it.  </li>
<li> perks up my hair and one of the few things out there that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.</li>
<li> guess I am spoiled by my usual 2-day prime deliveries.</li>
<li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> Not the least bit greasy.  </li>
<li> but i was frankly drawn toward the familiarity of the product name and kept buying it because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without unnecessary extras.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>

    <li> Could not find product in local store, great deal with a 25% more bonus, 5 OZ.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Back to Basics smoothing elixir, which is out of production.  Decided to give this a try.  It works almost as well for me and doesn&#x27;t flake if I use too much.  Best of all, it&#x27;s easier to find!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It keeps my hair looking nice and not greasy.  Completely takes out any yellow that I may have.</li>
    <li> Between my hair being (naturally) a bit dry and going gray, keeping it looking shiny and taming the fly-aways has been a struggle. Unlike the original VO5 hairdressing (which is more like light vaseline) this is lighter and does not weigh my hair down. It is not the ideal product for my needs, but I am still experimenting. The only downside to this stuff is how challenging it is to find. I look everywhere and the only place I could order it was here on Amazon. It took quite a while to arrive . . . guess I am spoiled by my usual 2-day prime deliveries.</li>
    <li> Even my hair dresser asked what I do for my hair to have such a healthy shine!  Wouldn&#x27;t dream of using any other product.    Prompt service.  I always shop Amazon first.</li>
    <li> I use this product to relax my hear.  My hair feels smooth and soft.  I leave a bit on and I love how I look.</li>
    <li> I only wish it was sold in stores.  It is the best product for straightening frizzy hair. It also leaves some moisture in the hair.  I won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad. He loves it and says it keeps his hair bright white and shiny.  No yellowing.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver especially in the winter when your hair gets &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; due to indoor dry heat.</li>
    <li> It lays on the hair instead of being absorbed.  I expected a creme as the package calls itself, to be totally absorbed.  It also has a scent that I don&#x27;t find pleasant</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Smoothes hair without that oily feeling. I would recommend it to anyone with frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can not find anywhere in my town.&lt;br /&gt;Husband used mine and wondered why didn&#x27;t last long. I hide it now.</li>
    <li> I have more salt than pepper and it can be very dry.  This product tames my white hair and really makes it shine!!  It actually glistens under the lights and sun!!  My hair is short and only a dime size amount is plenty!!  Not the least bit greasy.  I have tried several other similar products but none compare to this one!  I have used it for years.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I have used this product. For several years now. It continues to give my hair good body without a sticky feel</li>
    <li> One has to select hairdressing to suit one&#x27;s hair: Mine is naturally platinum-white and thick and very coarse. This hair dressing is perfect for that type of hair; it gives it body and shine and manageability. Love it.</li>

Just the tiniest dab of Alberto VO5 Sheer Hairdressing after shampooing smoothes my hair, makes styling easier and adds a nice shine.  While I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair I find this to be one of my favorite hair care products. If I forget to apply it I can feel the difference immediately in my hair when I start to blow dry and style. Time for a dab of VO5!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I color my hair and it tends to get dull and frizzy at times when I flat iron it.  This product seemed to help my hair straighten easier, but I felt my hair to become MORE dry after using it</li>

    <li> Vo5 Anti-Frizz &amp; Shine is the best product ever for my little girl&#x27;s curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives it such a vibrant shine and tames frizz all throughout the day. I really&lt;br /&gt;hate that the nearby stores no longer carry it. I could always jump in my car and&lt;br /&gt;drive down to Food Lion whenever i needed some. I&#x27;m grateful for a chance to order&lt;br /&gt;this product from Amazon.com. For all the moms with curly-haired daughters I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend Vo5 Anti-Frizz &amp; Shine.</li>
    <li> I ordered VO5, sheer on line through Amazon because It wasn&#x27;t available any where else that I could find. I have used it for many months and find it particularly great on my hair.  It leaves my hair with a shiny glow and is easy to use on newly washed and damp hair or on dry hair.  I do not understand why it is no longer available locally.</li>
    <li> perks up my hair and one of the few things out there that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction. i don&#x27;t need plants and perfumy smells in my hair. i have short hair and need leave in conditioner to give it a bit of body and shape without making my eyes tear or making me sneeze. probably not the original formula from my childhood, but i was frankly drawn toward the familiarity of the product name and kept buying it because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without unnecessary extras. also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or gummy like a lot of other products do. it&#x27;s better to use just a little and rub it in. if you use a big glob- it can leave hair  bit sticky.</li>
