      <li>, I think it smells great</li>
      <li>I love the perfume, this is one of the best smelling perfumes I have ever smelled in my life..</li>
      <li>but it is a pleasant one you can wear almost any where.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>service was great and got the product as promised, the price was not bad rither!</li>
      <li>Arrived soon which was nice</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>Good price though &amp; will continue to wear it &amp; order more.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice, but not what I</li>
      <li>but afterwards it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>Love the price.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and those around me always asked me what is was</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming when 1st applied</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
      <li>Will order more soon.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Good price and fast shipping</li>
      <li>The perfume was great in size and portability, they must have altered the scent though because it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as it had in the past</li>
      <li>However it fades away fairly quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not to powerful to wear to work.  </li>
      <li>Outspoken is not anywhere near the \\&quot;winter\\&quot; category, and I&#x27;d really say it&#x27;s more suited for day time as well.</li>
      <li>and it also shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>you just cant put much on wish they would of sent a bigger bottle tho it would of been nice</li>
      <li>, I will be buying a bigger bottle love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit it, I wanted the free Super Saver shipping, so I added a tiny bottle of Outspoken by Fergie to my order.</li>
      <li>I had heard such strong opinions about it, that I was really just curious.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It turns out to be a very wearable tuberose based scent, not \\&quot;outspoken\\&quot; really, and the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; in the scent winds up smelling just like soap on me, it&#x27;s not a racy daring</li>
      <li>It has an average staying power, but at Avon&#x27;s prices, I&#x27;m not terribly concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see that so many people had such strong opinions of this scent, both good and bad.</li>
      <li>though it was gonna be a fruity but sensual type of smell, it&#x27;s sort of sensual but smells like something for an older crowd (I&#x27;m 18 by the way).</li>
      <li>Going back to my other fave Avon scent Rare Gold,not similar in scent but is also warm and inviting as this one</li>
      <li>This perfume light and simple and actually stays with you through out the day.</li>
      <li>You do have to spray it more than one time though, as it loses it&#x27;s scent in a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>The scent last a long time and the first day I wore it</li>

    <li> Gave it my friend as a small gift. It&#x27;s great for the purse whenever you want to fish it out and spritz some on when you&#x27;re on the go!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume in an avon magazine and figured I would find it on amazon for less. I did find it, I think it smells great and it also shipped super fast. I will be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells wonderful, I will be buying a bigger bottle love it no complaints here, item arrived on time very happy with this product, yes I would recommend</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. It came in with no damages and was as described. Will order more soon.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Love the price. However it fades away fairly quick. But for the price, you can reapply ☺️</li>
    <li> I like the Fergie Outpsoken scent. It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming when 1st applied but afterwards it&#x27;s nice. Arrived soon which was nice but the bottle was very small.</li>
    <li> Will last you all day and re-apply if you want a stronger scent on your skin to last up to the next day.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this perfume!!!</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this scent and those around me always asked me what is was</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, I wanted the free Super Saver shipping, so I added a tiny bottle of Outspoken by Fergie to my order. I had heard such strong opinions about it, that I was really just curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out to be a very wearable tuberose based scent, not \\&quot;outspoken\\&quot; really, and the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; in the scent winds up smelling just like soap on me, it&#x27;s not a racy daring scent- but it is a pleasant one you can wear almost any where. I was surprised to see that so many people had such strong opinions of this scent, both good and bad. It has an average staying power, but at Avon&#x27;s prices, I&#x27;m not terribly concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a Spring or Summer scent- Outspoken is not anywhere near the \\&quot;winter\\&quot; category, and I&#x27;d really say it&#x27;s more suited for day time as well.</li>
    <li> I wish this hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.Going back to my other fave Avon scent Rare Gold,not similar in scent but is also warm and inviting as this one</li>
    <li> This perfume light and simple and actually stays with you through out the day. Love it! I&#x27;m actually looking for a bigger bottle to buy.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd year I have been buying outspoken n it&#x27;s because the smell is beautiful</li>
    <li> service was great and got the product as promised, the price was not bad rither! Great job, I would definately recommend</li>
    <li> I love the perfume, this is one of the best smelling perfumes I have ever smelled in my life.. I will definifely be buying this again</li>
    <li> I read a lot of rave reviews about this perfume, I like Fergie and I like perfume, so I decided to give it a try. It smelled nice, but not what I though it would be, I though it was gonna be a fruity but sensual type of smell, it&#x27;s sort of sensual but smells like something for an older crowd (I&#x27;m 18 by the way). Also, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I sprayed it on and the smell lingered for only about 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> The perfume was great in size and portability, they must have altered the scent though because it doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as it had in the past</li>
    <li> I liked it you just cant put much on wish they would of sent a bigger bottle tho it would of been nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this spray a few times now &amp; really like it.  It&#x27;s not to powerful to wear to work.  You do have to spray it more than one time though, as it loses it&#x27;s scent in a couple of hours.  Good price though &amp; will continue to wear it &amp; order more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small enough to carry in your purse with you. The scent last a long time and the first day I wore it I received compliments.</li>
