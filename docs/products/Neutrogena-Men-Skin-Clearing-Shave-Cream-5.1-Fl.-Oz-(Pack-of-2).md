      <li>It gives a good shave too, though I prefer using Kiehl at home.</li>

      <li>Good ole Gillette - one of the oldest names in the shaving business.  </li>

      <li>kind of expensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The absolute best shave you can get.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent shaving cream for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I really like this - and it smells incredible.</li>
      <li>This so far has been the best I have found.</li>
      <li>He said it&#x27;s by far the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used.  </li>
      <li>this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>First off this is great stuff.</li>
      <li>It lubricates well, does not have a strong smell, and is by far the best shave cream I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>works fine, but I recommend it to be used with the Neutrogena face scrub, then you can apply this cream, which will give you a good smooth shaving</li>
      <li>it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably continue buying this stuff because it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than any competing product.</li>
      <li>For 40 years I&#x27;ve raved about how great Estee Lauder&#x27;s \\&quot;Absolute Comfort Shave</li>
      <li>My husband does love this stuff though.</li>
      <li>I have used many gels and foams over the years with my Panasonic wet-dry shaver.</li>
      <li>I have tried most of the better shave cream brands and have not seen any benefit, at all.</li>
      <li>If you miss a spot, you will need to apply more before retracing your path with the blade.  </li>
      <li>If this was $2, it would be okay.</li>
      <li>this one is so much better.</li>
      <li>Blade lubrication is awesome, with the ability to shave against the grain and repeat strokes to get every last stubble without putting on more.  </li>
      <li>Glad I can find it here.</li>
      <li>I get much better results with this shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Let me say why I love this product.</li>
      <li>I pair it with Nivea&#x27;s Replenishing Post-Shave Balm, which helps even more.</li>
      <li>and you tell me which is the better product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product have been buying for many years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many shave creams over the years (Im 57 btw).  </li>
      <li>More will work, but not any better</li>
      <li>Many who try this don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love and now I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>People that think this is suppposed to lather up need to know the product better.</li>
      <li>That combination has solved my problems better than I hoped.  </li>
      <li>Okay for traveling</li>
      <li>I think it provides a better shaving experience than any of the foams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>so I can go back to the gel which is the best.</li>
      <li>I get this for my barber, it is his favorite shave cream</li>
      <li>I use a safety razor, which is admittedly more aggressive than a disposable razor.</li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>
      <li>Although the thickness of the product was described accurately, it does not soften my beard adequately for a good shave.</li>
      <li>Pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes there are some pretty good promotions.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it is very good at protecting and moisturizing your face, and with the right amount provides you with a very close shave.</li>
      <li>Gives me a nice smooth clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much but provides great protection for his skin to get a clean shave.</li>
      <li>maybe the more lather the more you have to clean your razer.  </li>
      <li>They really have made a good product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good, very inexpensive shave gel that gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>easy</li>
      <li>but that is more from being shaved clean than the cream.  </li>
      <li>it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it comes off really easy as well.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy on my face is helped to keep me from breaking out after a shave</li>
      <li>This product had good reviews and the price was decent.</li>
      <li>love the cool menthol after</li>
      <li>This is the first shaving cream of any kind I have purchased since 1984.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, the best shaving cream</li>
      <li>Its a great product specially for people that has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is a fine shave cream</li>
      <li>I bought a two-pack of this since it was cheap and gave it a shot.</li>
      <li>Instead, it goes on as a smooth cream.  </li>
      <li>It allows the razor to glide smoothly over beard stubble</li>
      <li>Spread lightly AFTER washing face with soap and water, even if you&#x27;re just stepped out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I went back to using Gillette Proglide Gel and experienced no problems.</li>
      <li>It prevents breakouts, and I get a close comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I tend to break out primarily when &amp; where I shave.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great skin feels so fresh after use !!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before I commit to buying anything.  This shave cream got really good reviews so I decided to make it a stocking stuffer for my husband at Christmas.  He said it&#x27;s by far the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, it provides a nice slick surface for shaving and helps to provide a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used many gels and foams over the years with my Panasonic wet-dry shaver. I get much better results with this shaving cream. My skin is noticeably smoother after shaving. It doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of lather, so it never quite seems like I have enough on, but I must, because it works :-)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, and he has told me.............  After placing a dime size amount in palm, I rubbed my hands together and applied to my face thinking that this was not going to work well, as it did not foam or suds up like regular shave cream, I was wrong!  It places a soapy residue on your face, which is easy to shave off, leaving the skin smooth, in addition, no razor burn, and the few \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; I have had on my face are gone.  I will definitely continue to buy this product now that I have found it.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time using prime really like that! I&#x27;ve use this shave cream for quite some time and really like it, it&#x27;s easy on my face is helped to keep me from breaking out after a shave</li>
    <li> This product will definitely get the job done...the only problem I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. You never really know when you have too much or too little on your face...definitely great for people with thin hair. I have thick hair and would not use this product again.</li>
    <li> Although the thickness of the product was described accurately, it does not soften my beard adequately for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does not provide with the lather that we all are used to. BUT the shaving is smooth and the blade is literally gliding down the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I have to make less shaving moves (if compared to my regular Gillette Shaving Gel ([[ASIN:B001E95HJU The Gillette Series Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]] ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just finished my first tube of Neutrogena and switched back to Gillette Gel. The first thing I noticed is that I got a dry feeling on the face skin after shaving. When I was shaving with Neutrogena, I didn&#x27;t have this feeling. I am definitely going back to Target for more Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I use this product to shave 100% of the time. Does it work? Not really sure because I use the treatments after I shave.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;m a female but I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use regular shave gel/cream without getting tiny bumps all over my legs.  I have used this for the past week to shave and I am happy to report no bumps after shaving.  The only thing I dislike about this is that it isn&#x27;t as creamy as I would like, which can make it difficult to cover all areas of my legs without using a lot. I usually end up using around 10mL (1/3) ounce of it for each leg.  I still use sensitive disposable razors to decrease chance of bacteria on my razors so both are a great combination for my skin.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave cream. It doesn&#x27;t take much but provides great protection for his skin to get a clean shave. Although he has oily skin, he also has sensitive skin and this keeps his skin free of irritation and breakouts.</li>
    <li> Only shaving solution that keeps my skin hydrated and without nicks. Been using this for 8-10 years.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin smooth and clear!</li>
    <li> I probably will not purchase this product again. I need to use to much when shaving and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Great for the new young shaver.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the sensitive skin version of Neutrogena&#x27;s product and found that to cause more razor burn than this product.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is light and the texture is always smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Applying a dime sized amount of cream will give me a good close shave without bumps, nicks or irritation.</li>
    <li> Sure, this is a step up from the inexpensive shaving foams but there are better products at this pricepoint, such as Cremo or Proraso. The scent is moderate (not mild but not overpowering either) and is kind of like an inexpensive cologne. I really don&#x27;t like the scent. Creams don&#x27;t lather but I get much more use from far less product with others. With this one, I feel like I have to apply a significant amount to get a worthy shave. I haven&#x27;t notice any breakouts or ingrown hair but I also take extremely good care of my skin. I&#x27;d suggest passing on this product.</li>
    <li> After searching years for a shaving combination, I have settled on this cream and a Fusion razor.  Many who try this don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;.  Instead, it goes on as a smooth cream.  However, I think this is part of the success because you are rubbing it into the beard.  It has a nice slight menthol tinge and upon rising leaves a nice smooth layer where I rarely need an after product.  BTW, this is superior to their Sensitive Skin product.</li>
    <li> I have relatively sensitive skin that dries easily, very thick beard, and sometimes get pimples/ingrown hairs. I have tried numerous foams, gels, creams from different brands and different price ranges. This so far has been the best I have found. It protects my face from drying and burning from shaving. It prevents breakouts, and I get a close comfortable shave. I have tried the neutrogena sensitive skin version, and, ironically, that one make my skin burn when shaving. I just wish this one was easier to find. fewer and fewer places are carrying this.</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the better shave cream brands and have not seen any benefit, at all. The cream sticks like crazy to your hands and you need a large amount of the cream in order to get a comfortable shave, at least in my opinion. I still find the Edge gel to be the easiest to use and give a really comfortable shave with a small about and certainly easier to clean up afterwards.</li>
    <li> It doesnt feel as soothing as many other competitors. I&#x27;ve had much better resutls (closer shaves) and smoother sensations with the natural ingredient brands (Body Shop, Bath &amp; Body Works, Kiss my Face).</li>
    <li> After switching to DE shaving a couple of months ago, I have been trying different products to get that comfortable shave. This product fits the bill for me.</li>
    <li> Let me say why I love this product. Its very smooth when shaving and its not as foamy and messy as shaving gel or foam cream. Literally you take a small amount rub and after a min clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Great product have been buying for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Not expensive. Does not need a lot to use to get a great  shave.  Great price for a product that actually does what it suppose to do.</li>
    <li> This is a CREAM (&#x3D; not a foam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product (2 pack) without paying attention to the fact that is a cream and not a foam. Although it was a bit odd at the beginning, I now really like using the cream. You can easily see and shape your facial hair. Which is something I have a hard time doing with my face covered in foam.</li>
    <li> Okay for traveling but I found that slippery gels like Schick (in particular) seem to lubricate a little better and give me a more comfortable shave. I tend to shave only several times a week so perhaps if I used this daily I might have had a different experience. It comes down to personal preference, I guess, in terms of how often you shave, how heavy your beard is and how close a shave you want..</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like it, i preffer the foam or gel, i need a lot of the product for one shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream</li>
    <li> The lather is weak when compared to similarly priced creams (i.e. Every Man Jack). On the face, the shaving cream feels like a mixture of gel and cream. Lastly, the cheap fragrance is terrible. These companies should either use natural scents (from shaving ingredients) or leave the fragrance out entirely. Men don&#x27;t shave to smell good. If we want to wear cologne, we&#x27;ll splash on some Issey or JPG and call it a day.</li>
    <li> This feels like soap. I hate it and  trying to use it up soon so I can go back to the gel which is the best. I would not recommend this at at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using foam based shaving creams for years, but tried this out wanting to minimize razor irritation. I think it provides a better shaving experience than any of the foams I&#x27;ve used. I can tell that my skin is less irritated afterward.</li>
    <li> What is this?  Clear shave creme that reminds me of the shave creme you would get at a Howard Johnson if you forgot your creme at home or you were fortunate enough for TSA to take this from you at security check.  My only thought can be that these are leftovers from a failed Neutrogena product test.</li>
    <li> I have used several premium creams from Jack Black, Zirh, and Anthony Logisitics and this cream is almost as good as any of them at a fraction of the price. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it&#x27;s not as good as JB Shave Lube, which is my current favorite. If you are new to shave creams or &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;, this does not lather, rather it gives a smooth, slippery surface for your razor to glide over your skin and cut beard closely plus it&#x27;s clear so you can see what you&#x27;re doing. I use with a Mach 3 razor, so I can&#x27;t speak for effectiveness with a safety or straight razor.</li>
    <li> I always had problems with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shaving cream/lotion.  It wasn&#x27;t the right tool for the job.  This is.  I use this along with neutrogenas triple protect face lotion (SPF 20).  That combination has solved my problems better than I hoped.  Before finding these, I thought I was just going to have to live with shaving products that left me a mess, so to speak.  My skin isn&#x27;t perfect (moderate problems, not severe), and it still doesn&#x27;t react well to daily shaving, among other things, but the improvement has been vast.  They really have made a good product.  The end result of using this (and the triple protect) has been a  much &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; appearance in terms of razor bumps/irritation, general tone, &amp;#34;cleanliness&amp;#34; (breakouts, etc.)., and everything else they advertise.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream worked great ! I normally have to shave multiple times under my chin to get all the stubble. I shaved under my chin, on my neck at least 4 times to get a close shave with this product. And had very little irritation what so ever. I did not actually follow the instructions either. I squeeze out about a quarter size drop in a bowl like the instructions say to do. But then I used my omega boar brush to apply it to my face. I was able to do 3 passes and touchup  with the amount used and still had some left on my brush. NO! This stuff does not foam up ! it&#x27;s a cream ! But it worked very well for me. I have no need to spend a ridiculous amount of money on the other over priced creams. For less than $5 a tube this is going to stay on my counter !&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. all I can figure is, People are mad because they spent $10 to $25 on shave cream .And other people are pleased with this product for $5. OR, its the competition , trying to make you think it&#x27;s no good ! I will continue to try other product&#x27;s, but I think this particular one is going to be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> My Norelco razor allows for wet or dry use and for many years I simply used it dry and followed up with Neutrogena&#x27;s post-shave balm. That formula worked well, but my face did still feel irritated for a bit after shaving. I bought a two-pack of this since it was cheap and gave it a shot. My overall impression after a week is that it does indeed reduce irritation and has largely eliminated the need for a post-shave balm, but the product is rather messy and difficult to completely rinse out of the razor. I really have to hold the head under hot water for a good 30 seconds to get all of this stuff out. If I don&#x27;t, it dries and makes the movable heads stick. Still, I will probably keep using this.</li>
    <li> I squeeze this into a 3 oz tube from REI for TSA compliant travel.  It is just the right consistency for this purpose and one tube of that can last me over 2 weeks on the road.  It gives a good shave too, though I prefer using Kiehl at home.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  It seems like every time I try a new product, I find that it is even better than the previous one I tried.  Well, the buck stops here.  Hands down, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is gentle on my skin, and it does not dry it out (yet not at all greasy).&lt;br /&gt;2. Results in an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;3. Helps with keeping my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;4. Smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a Con:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a lotion type cream might get some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only shaving cream product I will ever use.  I&#x27;m spoiled now.  Keep an eye out for sales here on Amazon.  Sometimes there are some pretty good promotions.  Regardless, for me, this product is permanently on my Subscribe and Save list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/23/2015:  I am still using this shave cream and I would not use anything else.  It keeps razor burn and razor bumps to a minimum.  It also keep my skin from getting dried out.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower with a classic safety razor with Feather brand razors.&lt;br /&gt;Of all shave creams I have tried this is by far the best.  I had a problem with razor burn with other types of shave creams, whether it be some crap in a can or Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this and all of my burning issues are gone.  I apply it (by hand) at the end of my shower and shave.  I have fewer nicks and no burning.  There is a slight cool sensation after I shave but that is more from being shaved clean than the cream.  It lubricates well, does not have a strong smell, and is by far the best shave cream I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product better than the other drug store brands he has used in the past.</li>
    <li> For years I had problems traveling by air, because I wouldn&#x27;t take an aerosol can of shaving cream on a plane.  I had to buy some, using only a small amount, or shave using something else - hair conditioner works pretty well.  I often wished there was a shaving cream infused wiping cloth you could activate with water.  Then I discovered this product, and began using it on my trips.  I discovered that I prefer it to shaving cream because there isn&#x27;t a large amount of foam on your face and it&#x27;s easier to see where you&#x27;re shaving.  Also, this product never causes any problems with my skin.  It&#x27;s the greatest. UPDATE:  I have now tried 2 other non-aerosol shave creams (now there seem to be more products than before).  One is Gillette Body and the other is Edge.  I have written reviews of both of those now, and Neutrogena remains 5 star and the best of the 3.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave cream. I&#x27;m not into their new one for sensitive skin...this one is so much better. no ingrown hairs! love the cool menthol after</li>
    <li> If this was $2, it would be okay. But it is the price as products that are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versus a foam, it cuts down on some razor irritation when used properly...remember, the creams really do NOT foam/expand and so you have to use enough to cover your face. You also want to work it in a little bit prior to shaving, on a wet face, as this stuff is often reluctant to make contact with skin, and will often only make contact with your whiskers...and then that results in a &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation. It also has an odd scent...not necessarily a bad one, but different from most. It also seems to clog pores, as when I use it I tend to get minor breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is that this product isn&#x27;t priced accordingly to its performance. Vanicream&#x27;s shaving cream, which is 10-fold better as it cuts down on shaving irritation, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts/allergic reactions, and is designed by a company that is dedicated to providing products for people with severe skin disorders, is not all that much more. Like many Neutrogena products, it is a middle of the road skin care product that is better than most products you see in a drugstore, but far from the best of its respective class. I&#x27;d personally advise spending a little more on a product of higher quality.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream of any kind I have purchased since 1984.  (Seriously).  For the last 28 years, I have used soap and water and been pretty happy.  I recently bought a DE razor and thought I&#x27;d buy shaving cream for the heck of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t been paying attention to the other reviews:  this stuff is a cream.  It&#x27;s not foamy. Not at all.  Not in the least.  If you&#x27;re looking for foamy, then you&#x27;ll be unhappy w/this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the foam issue, do you remember Brylcreem? \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya?\\&quot; (If you don&#x27;t remember, search \\&quot;Brylcreem TV Commercial 1950s\\&quot; on youtube.)  Same thing here.  Get the face warmed up w/hot water (the real key to a good shave in my view), put a spot of the stuff in your palm, and rub it onto the beard.  Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff works.  My face isn&#x27;t dried out, as it probably has been for the last 28 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d encourage you to at least try it if you&#x27;re interested.  It&#x27;s not much of a commitment -- it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to be stuck making payments on a new 1974 Chevy Vega for three years. (Seach youtube for that if I&#x27;ve lost you again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Nice name...Neutrogena. Paul Harvey used to give their hand creme air time. This shave cream is pure junk. No lather,poor shave. The guys who are using this have never tried a REAL shave cream like Ingram, or Taylor of old Bond street. What this is good for? Pre shave. Put it on before you shave then apply a hot towel. Scrub face and then apply some real shave cream with a badger brush. Other than this method do not waste your money on Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaving cream for sensitive skin. Only need to use a small amount. Non-comedogenic. Works very good with a wet-dry shaver. Very satisfied with the product. Neutrogena makes a good line of products for men. This pairs great with their post shave lotion.</li>
    <li> Like this product, provides clean, no drag shave, few if any nicks.</li>
    <li> In my experience, this product is a great cleanser, but not as good a shaving cream. No matter how I prepared my face (washed, even right out of the shower), I had problems with skin cuts in a bumpy area around my chin. I use a safety razor, which is admittedly more aggressive than a disposable razor. I went back to using Gillette Proglide Gel and experienced no problems. As always, YMMV.</li>
    <li> works fine, but I recommend it to be used with the Neutrogena face scrub, then you can apply this cream, which will give you a good smooth shaving</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this stuff. Indeed, it&#x27;s the best shaving cream ever. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Each bottle lasts me several months.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product.  Gives me a nice smooth clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the original Neutrogena Shave Cream.  The &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; sensitive skin version is a much inferior product to this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and try the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; version, you will be back..</li>
    <li> Its a great product specially for people that has sensitive skin. With this product you can shave dialy. After shave your skin will be more soft and fresh</li>
    <li> I used to always just use plain soap to shave with.  I started using this product and i got a much closer shave with less pull and burn.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This i part of my daily regimen and it is hard to find in the drugstores on a regular basis.  Glad I can find it here.</li>
    <li> Background: 20 years of experience shaving this face in over a dozen countries from an outdoor sink in the jungle, to out of a cup in a desert, to five star hotels in Asian capitals, to locker rooms in big name gyms in North American urban jungles.&lt;br /&gt;I like a great shave, so I&#x27;m willing to try different shave gels or creams to get the smoothest shave with the least irritation.  I placed the Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream up against three contenders.  I looked at a couple of characteristics - Lather and feel on skin, scent, blade lubrication, and harshness/drying effect on the skin.  I&#x27;ll comment on the container and why that matters, and lastly, I&#x27;ll comment on value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00596VEP0 Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream, 5.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]: Smooth feel and low lather - not foamy, with a slight tingle from an oil of some type (mint?/menthol?).  Clean but gentle scent - not overpowering.  Blade lubrication is awesome, with the ability to shave against the grain and repeat strokes to get every last stubble without putting on more.  This one leaves my face less dry than the others and was a big selling point.  Comes in a synthetic tube, which is smaller than a can, flexible, and doesn&#x27;t freeze and explode if left in a gym bag in your car in winter, and you know when you&#x27;re running out.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the second place contender, but it lasts a long time and the benefits outweigh the cost in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002L03N74 C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 5.2 Oz.]]: A CLOSE SECOND place - Smooth and silky feeling cream on the skin, very cooling (strong) with eucalyptus oil, and some lather.  A sophisticated masculine and slightly herbal scent, definitely not a teen-aged pop smell.  Blade lubrication is really good, even against the grain, and I am able to go back over missed spots a second or third time without reapplying more.  The ONLY downside to this product is that it leaves my skin pretty dry.  Comes in a metallic toothpaste-like tube, compact and easy to carry on a plane or toss in a gym bag - doesn&#x27;t freeze and make a mess as explained above, and you know how much you have left.  This is an expensive shave cream, but again, it lasts a long time and has a lot of benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00A0J08H6 Axe Shave Gel, Chilled, 7 Ounce]]: A more distant third place - smooth and foaming gel, cooling and soothing feel (uses menthol) with a more active/sporty/youthful but definitely clean smell.  Blade lubrication and skin drying effects are where Axe fell short.  If you miss a spot, you will need to apply more before retracing your path with the blade.  The gel also left my face quite dry, but not as dry as the last contender.  The container is aerosol, solid and aluminum - which means it won&#x27;t leave a rust-ring on your counter or in your shower/tub like the steel of our last contender.  The aerosol aspect means it&#x27;s not going in your carry-on luggage, and it will make a mess if you let it freeze in your gym bag in your car.  You also don&#x27;t know exactly when you&#x27;re going to run out.  Value wise, it&#x27;s about half the price of the first two competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000530MS The Gillette Series Shave Gel, Ultra Protection, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]]: Forth out of four.  Good ole Gillette - one of the oldest names in the shaving business.  I used it as a teen-ager and was issued it in the U.S. military.  It&#x27;s a good, very inexpensive shave gel that gets the job done.  It has a smooth gel feel and a simple, clean but sporty scent.  It is the least effective blade lubricant of the four competitors listed here.  It severely dries out my skin and necessitates applying lotion after shaving.  Lastly, the container is aerosol and will make a mess if it freezes, and is made of steel, which rusts and can leave a brown-red ring in your shower/tub or counter if left wet.  Value wise, it is the cheapest of these products, but it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, spend a few extra dollars for a high quality shave cream like this one!, spend a few extra dollars for a high quality shave cream like this one!</li>
    <li> In my humble opinion, this is the best shaving cream out there.  It produces no foam whatsoever but manages to stick like soap to your skin. I find that normal shaving cream with foam are not well suited for cartridge shavers because the \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; strip pretty much removes the foam before the blades come into contact with the hair.  This isn&#x27;t a problem with brand as there&#x27;s no foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero razor burns since I&#x27;ve started using this, hence the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this stuff is pretty expensive.  You need to put a fair amount of cream for it to be effective.  The tube itself lasts about 20-25 shaves (not to mention it seems to be half-filled with air when you buy it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably continue buying this stuff because it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than any competing product.</li>
    <li> It really caught me off guard the first time I used this. It&#x27;s not shaving cream in the way that you usually think of it. It&#x27;s a very creamy soap that you can easily use way too much of. If you use more than a tiny dab, you&#x27;ll miss a lot of hair because you&#x27;ll just be scraping lotion off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is very good at protecting and moisturizing your face, and with the right amount provides you with a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I get this for my barber, it is his favorite shave cream and it really is an awesome product.  Refreshing, soothing, and keeps your skin looking soft.</li>
    <li> The absolute best shave you can get.</li>
    <li> I used to use exclusively \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; shave cream which is considerably more expensive, but I find that it&#x27;s a bit hard to work with, as it&#x27;s very thick. This is a much thinner product, but I never get any razor burn, it allows for the hairs to be shaven easily, and it leaves my face feeling very smooth. This is quite a feat given my Mediterranean heritage which produces a crazy thick beard! I follow up with the Neutrogena after shave, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. These are lightly fragranced which is the only dislike I have, but it has never caused a problem with my skin. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I&#x27;ve used a variety over the last 65 years, from the cheapest to the most expensive (Lab Series) and fround Neutrogena is a bargain even if a little higher than most.  You use less!.Care must be taken in the application:  do NOT spread thick as you would pressurized shaving cream.  Too much Neutrogena and your razor blades will clog and do a poor job of shaving.  Spread lightly AFTER washing face with soap and water, even if you&#x27;re just stepped out of the shower.  A soften beard shaves with assist ease in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Great product...I&#x27;d recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many shave creams over the years (Im 57 btw).  I love the Neutrogena face scrubs, but this item is nowhere near the quality of their other products.  In fact, I would rate this as one of the worst shaving products I have ever used.  I challenge anyone reading this to compare this to KISS MY FACE or even Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Then look in the mirror and you tell me which is the better product.  Exactly.  I really wanted to like Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream, but I found it to be a very poor product. I still will use the other Neutrogena products- just not their shave cream.</li>
    <li> My old shave product is no longer made so I was forced to try something new. This product had good reviews and the price was decent. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6mo now and have no complaints. At first I was worried because the cream is thin and I thought I would need a lot but in turns out you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no complaints - give it a try if you are debating on it.</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream I can use without breaking out in razor burn.  They seem to only sell the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; variety in stores now, which is a shame because--contrary to what I initially thought--&amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t refer to shaving sensitivity, but to sensitivity to whatever chemicals make this original work so well.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have an allergy, definitely use this original version.  I pair it with Nivea&#x27;s Replenishing Post-Shave Balm, which helps even more.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Have been using this product for over 7 years and will never go back to any foaming shave creams or gels! Goes on smooth and cuts close with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Even though it says you don&#x27;t need a lather, this shaving cream is sort of weak sauce in terms of lubricating your skin.  It does do a nice job of brightening my complexion though.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use. has less mess. and it comes off really easy as well. i have been using this product for 3 years now.</li>
    <li> It smells soooo good.  But, it doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;lather&#x27; that much.  Not that it needs to ... and ... maybe the more lather the more you have to clean your razer.  So, not really a bad thing - probably.  Anyways, I really like this - and it smells incredible.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 star b/c it keeps me from getting zits. I tend to break out primarily when &amp; where I shave. I can use this stuff in the shower with either a straight edge razor or my electric razor. The active ingredient, Salicylic Acid, helps prevent new acne as well as to help clear up existing zits by reducing inflammation &amp; redness of existing zits. It unclogs pores &amp; while I&#x27;m not yet old enough to be concerned with wrinkles or fine lines, apparently the Salicylic Acid also helps fight the signs of aging, too. I&#x27;ve recommended this stuff to my friends&#x27; teenage son who wasn&#x27;t shaving for the same reason.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving cream that I&#x27;ve tried (including most of the natural, organic, etc) that prevents ingrown hairs.  And no ugly scent.</li>
    <li> This really does work, and is so much better than shaving cream.  It has much less mess and gives a much better shave.  It does not lather.  It is not supposed to. Some of the other reviewers do not understand this.  Yes, it is more expensive than traditional shaving cream but a little goes a long way.  You only need a dimes worth on your hands.  I believe it will come out to the same price, because a tube of this will go much further than a can of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream but am not convinced its any better than the standard shaving gels or foams. It is a bit faster to apply this over the foam/gel.</li>
    <li> This shave cream provides a close shave for my face and helps prevent the odd breakout caused by acne! Great!</li>
    <li> I love their products in general, but this really is terrible stuff... it is like that took some other product they could not sell, and jammed it into a tube and called in shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is the only shave cream my husband will use. He does not have an acne problem and we credit this product for that. He uses several other products in the men&#x27;s neutrogena line.</li>
    <li> one of best product, i ever choose neutrogena, quality, cost, does not need advertisment, recommend with close eyes anyother word</li>
    <li> Cant speak to the Skin Clearing aspect, but the cream itself is not very lubricating for the blade.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it really does help keep his skin smooth and clear.  Glad that I can order several tubes at a time on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all the men who have sensitive skin. I usually break out with a rash with other products, but not with this product. This price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find where I live with the exception of the sensitive formula, so I was very excited to find it on Amazon at a great price too. My boyfriend has used this for years on his face and says it is the only thing he&#x27;s found that gets the shave so close and loves his skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Hands down, my favorite shaving gel/cream. I have been using this product on and off for 3 years now, and whenever I use it, razor bumps and burn become a rarity. One thing I love about it is that a bottle lasts forever -- a similar sized bottle of shaving cream would be gone in a month, whereas this 5oz bottle easily lasts 3 or 4. It&#x27;s almost as if the less you use, the better it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that Neutrogena advertises it as &amp;#34;skin clearing.&amp;#34; I have occasional light acne, and this does not make a difference at all -- it doesn&#x27;t prevent it and it doesn&#x27;t neutralize it. Other than that, great product and I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain it&#x27;s shave cream,  it works.  Also has medication to help with pimples.</li>
    <li> First off this is great stuff. It works far better than anything I have ever used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to re-earn how to shave with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a month and I am just adjusting to using so little of the&lt;br /&gt;shave cream. (A little dab will do you!) Use the least amount that you can get to drop&lt;br /&gt;out of the container. More will work, but not any better and if you use too much it will&lt;br /&gt;not even work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this as you would use a soap if you were trying to get a blueberry stain out of&lt;br /&gt;a white shirt. (Rub it in thoroughly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you put a dab in your hand then you put your hands together and rub them once or&lt;br /&gt;twice to spread it out on your hands. Then you rub it in, rub it in, rub it in! (To your face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do this, you will then see your whiskers right through the thin layer of shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;This makes it easy to actually see what needs shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave cream seems to stick to the whiskers until you wash it off thoroughly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used way too much and it took me a month to adjust. (I don&#x27;t know if you can&lt;br /&gt;actually use too little.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can find this type of product I will use it. (There are cheaper creams that come in&lt;br /&gt;the same container and cost less.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of price, this is great stuff!</li>
    <li> Meets expectations.  Neutrogena is the only save cream I use.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when looking for a tube shave cream product that could be shipped to a military APO/FPO address.  For those who may not know what I am referring to, in aerosol spray cans, the propellant is simply a pressurized gas but not allowed by the USPS for inclusion in shipments to APO/FPO locations due to being transported in unpressurized cargo planes where it is subject to bursting.  As for the product, if you&#x27;re accustomed to using shaving cream, gel, or brush shaving for that matter, this may take a little getting use to,  It doesn&#x27;t lather in the traditional sense.  I would describe it almost (not quite) as a shaving oil that provides a thin lubricant where applied.  It allows the razor to glide smoothly over beard stubble and I think it is easier to \\&quot;knock out\\&quot; the razor build up between strokes with this product.  By this I mean the used shaving product and cut hairs that get between the blades of the razor after a stroke or two has been made across the face.  Or for you ladies reading this, it&#x27;s the reason behind the \\&quot;tap tap tap\\&quot; sound your husband makes in the bathroom in the morning from tapping his razor against the side of the sink to clear it out.  I like the light fragrance and the fact that I can&#x27;t smell it myself 30 minutes later.  If there&#x27;s one down side for me it&#x27;s that with traditional shaving products that lather up I can see where I&#x27;ve been with the razor but with this stuff it&#x27;s almost translucent so I have had to retrain myself a bit and develop more of a ritual of always starting my shave in the same place.  Anyway, this is a fine shave cream and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
    <li> easy and it works great</li>
    <li> BIG Fan of Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Product, like that it goes on the face translucent and you can see where you are shaving.</li>
    <li> This cream is a huge step up from traditional foams and gels.  After application, this creme is [nearly] clear, so you can see exactly where you&#x27;re shaving.  Most other shaving products don&#x27;t offer this.  Also you don&#x27;t have to use much...a little goes a long way (which also helps in being able to see what you&#x27;re doing).  As a result these bottle will last for months (3-4 months for me).</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works great on my skin.  I have no issues with it and would buy it again. Like other reviews have said you don&#x27;t need a lot just a small amount can cover a good portion of your face and makes for smoother shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Just as expected from Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> For 40 years I&#x27;ve raved about how great Estee Lauder&#x27;s \\&quot;Absolute Comfort Shave Cream\\&quot; has been. However, last year I noticed that the numbing ingredient (benzocaine) wasn&#x27;t as numbing, and that the shave cream was being watered down. To add insult to injury. my 40 years of loyalty to the product was rewarded with a 600% increase in price - from $4.50 for 8 ounces in 1968 to $27.50 for a watered down 8 ounces in 2012. I returned the last tub that I bought, and found Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream on Amazon, and bought two tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really think it would do as good a job, but not only does it live up to its own description, I actually use less to get the same soothing effect and close shave. It takes very little to create a smooth surface for a blade to glide over, and it leaves a clean, soap-free face afterwards. I don&#x27;t understand all the things about no bumps, and no ingrown hairs. Never had them except with an electric. All I know is that I&#x27;ve found a fantastic replacement for a favorite that does nothing now but disappoints and breaks the bank at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and shave daily. This is the bes shave cream I have ever used. When you finish shaving your face feels soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This to me is the best shaving product I have used.  Where I live we don&#x27;t have much of a choice unless I want to go to Wal-Mart which I stay away from like the plague.  I have very sensative skin and have no issues with burn/bumps.  People that think this is suppposed to lather up need to know the product better.</li>
    <li> I first started using this product as a more affordable substitute for Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube. I immediately fell in love and now I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> You get two bottles of this when you order it, so if you use subscribe and save it will add up quick. I looked under the sink one day and I think we had 10 bottles! Make sure and put it on every other month. My husband does love this stuff though. He has gone through all kinds of shaving cr&amp;egrave;mes and this is the only one he will buy now. This keeps him from getting those crazy razor bumps on his face, keeps his skin moisturized and smooth, and it smells great!</li>
