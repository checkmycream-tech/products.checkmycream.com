      <li>Love this cuticle pusher so much that I bought another one for my mother who also raves about it.</li>
      <li>Works great; I like how it&#x27;s so much easier to clean than the wooden ones.</li>
      <li>This cuticle pusher by Majestic Bombay was the very first stainless steel one that I have ever used, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly too.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Really like the ends, but the shaft is too skinny to hold comfortably.</li>
      <li>(I did this after using a cuticle oil first and rubbing it in).  </li>
      <li>as my granddaughter borrowed the first one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only $6.99 on Amazon, which truly is within most everyone&#x27;s reach.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it should do.</li>
      <li>really enjoyed this product and will definitely keep it in my nail tool kit.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as deacribed and was promptly delivered.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>This tool is very useful and professional.</li>

      <li>Very high quality tool.  </li>
      <li>I really like this tool</li>
      <li>Cleans under the nails very well.</li>
      <li>Made of stainless steel</li>
      <li>Product as described, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>With this one being made from stainless steel, I save money because I can keep reusing it over and over.</li>
      <li>Thanks Bombay.</li>
      <li>Very handy for dealing with my ucky old fungused thick toenails.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t live without my pretty nails...</li>
      <li>A simple, straightforward transaction.  </li>
      <li>Use the opposite end to clean under and around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very professional tool!</li>
      <li>The curved end works great at getting under my nails and no parts of this cuticle pusher ever scratched me or felt uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Nothing cheap about it.&lt;br /&gt;Works as expected.</li>
      <li>Majestic Bombay - Professional Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher and Nail cleaner tool.  </li>
      <li>Not sure what the screwdriver like end is for but the other end cleans and scrapes great.</li>
      <li>The problem I had with wooden cuticle pushers was that they would last for maybe 4 uses before they were pretty much ready to be thrown away.</li>
      <li>Looks professional.</li>
      <li>The stainless steel construction of this cuticle pusher/ nail tool means that it&#x27;s a tool that should last for years to come, without the worry of rusting.  </li>
      <li>So, we received this item a day early.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for offering such a quality product.</li>
      <li>This is much better than a lot of similar tools I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>Having used this tool for a couple of months now, it is obvious that it is of a high quality.</li>
      <li>my tools are always to blunt or not small enough!</li>
      <li>The quality of this product is similar to professional surgical instruments I work with.</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s extremely affordable!  </li>
      <li>Now, since this is my first time trying a product like this, I can&#x27;t compare it to other similar tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job, and is worth the small amount of money.</li>

    <li> Really like the ends, but the shaft is too skinny to hold comfortably.</li>
    <li> Great product. This cuticle pusher is great, it is made very sturdy and I know it will last a lifetime. I would recommend it to anyone looking for one to add to their manicure set.</li>
    <li> Cleans under the nails very well. Made of stainless steel so there is no give and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it like you do with wooden nail cleaners.</li>
    <li> What I needed to help with a nice manicure</li>
    <li> Having used this tool for a couple of months now, it is obvious that it is of a high quality. I have used several products by Majestic Bombay, and I have never been disappointed. While other brands are only getting more expensive while reducing their quality, this company has been raising the bar while maintaining solid value for the money. I would definitely recommend!</li>

    <li> Flat end too thick, not shown is picture.</li>
    <li> This tool is very useful and professional. It looks good and works. I would recommend it to others! Thank you.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. I like it</li>

I also am really bad at making a schedule and so I could forget to do it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this product and will definitely keep it in my nail tool kit.  If you are going to use a product like this, I would definitely suggest using this with a cuticle oil, or Virgin Argan Oil to help to prepare your skin prior to using the cuticle pusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly impressed with this product and definitely recommend it, if you are currently searching for a good nail tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for testing and review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions stated here, are my own!</li>
    <li> Quality made, perfect for taking care of my nails.</li>
    <li> This tool is fab! I ordered it to use for when I do my manicure and pedicures at the salon. The lady who does this for me is a nightmare to please...my tools are always to blunt or not small enough! I decided to do my research and get everything she uses as I hate feeling like the tools may not be cleaned properly...after searching for a nail cleaner like hers (she uses a real sharp one) I took a risk and got this! She was super pleased with it...said it cleans well and isn&#x27;t too sharp so doesn&#x27;t cause pain! Bargain I&#x27;d say!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and strong, this cuticle pusher is perfect for getting those pesky cuticles out of the way!</li>
    <li> Look no more...This is the best tool period...Thank you so much for offering such a quality product.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it should do. The flatter edge is great for pushing back my cuticles and does it very easily. It is way easier than using a wooden pusher. The curved end works great at getting under my nails and no parts of this cuticle pusher ever scratched me or felt uncomfortable. It cleans very easily also. This is much better than a lot of similar tools I have used in the past. While I received a discounted/complimentary product for testing purposes all opinions are completely my own, honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> A simple, straightforward transaction.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> Improve your mani-pedi with this indispensable tool.</li>
    <li> I had to grind the squared end because of burrs.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, and is worth the small amount of money.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as deacribed and was promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be 100% honest! I HATE doing my own nails! If you know me in non-internet life you know that pre-lil&#x27;princess, I was the nail snob! Never, ever touched my own nails. I left my fingers looking glam to a professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if any of you have kiddos, you know that it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep your set of nails looking glam between all the diaper changing &amp; sippy cup washing -_- your nails, regardless of the polish, finish etc, they are going to chip, crack, basically a bunch of horribleness is going to happen, regardless of how careful you are! That&#x27;s when tools like this handy thing come in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a nail snob lol....I just can&#x27;t live without my pretty nails...but unless I wanna live at my nail techs chair, I&#x27;ve learned that having good touch-up tools has come in handy! Now if something chips, crack, needs to be touched up, I can do it myself between nail salon visits! I can have fabulous nails &amp; keep my salon visits to two times a month, regardless of what happens to my nails from mommyhood! Recommend this tool to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> Very professional tool!</li>
    <li> I bought this tool along with some others to do my own gel manicures and I have to say this tool is great quality! I would purchase again for sure!</li>
    <li> The edges are smooth and effectively get the gunk out from under my nails. Have to get another one. as my granddaughter borrowed the first one.</li>
    <li> I love my product! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Received quickly &amp; works perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome tool for cuticles!</li>
    <li> I am currently in the process of growing out my nails, and I have been wanting to find a good cuticle pusher that would help me keep my nails looking great, and improve the appearance of manicures. I have used plastic and wood cuticle pushers in the past, but I never really got the results I wanted. This cuticle pusher by Majestic Bombay was the very first stainless steel one that I have ever used, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is simple. Use the pusher side to push back your cuticles. Use the opposite end to clean under and around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is made from stainless steel, it gives me great results. The problem I had with wooden cuticle pushers was that they would last for maybe 4 uses before they were pretty much ready to be thrown away. Thus I&#x27;d have to keep buying more. With this one being made from stainless steel, I save money because I can keep reusing it over and over. It doesn&#x27;t lose its form, or fall apart. Overall I am just happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Majestic Bombay - Professional Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher and Nail cleaner tool.  I love the fact that the cleaner part is cupped.  It does a good job of cleaning under my finger nails.</li>
    <li> The flat edge was chipped on one side.  Still works I just have to be extra careful with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and delivery</li>
    <li> Product as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this cuticle pusher so much that I bought another one for my mother who also raves about it. It gets my cuticles so clean that I don&#x27;t need to use a cuticle trimmer anymore, which tends to cause hang nails and cuts. It was shipped quickly too. Highly recommended!! Don&#x27;t pay double for the brand name one!</li>
    <li> Great service, great product!</li>
