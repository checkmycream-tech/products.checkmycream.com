    <li> Cute but way too small</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shower and don&#x27;t want to wash my hair.  It looks cute.  I usually have the water blasting around my face.  A little water does get through to my hair, but not that much.  I highly recommend this shower cap over others.  The plastic is not flimsy and does wrap around your head tight.</li>
    <li> Very cute and a little old fashioned. I love wearing it on &amp;#34;hair-wash&amp;#34; day!</li>

    <li> This is an adorable head cap. I have mid length hair and petitie head and this covers well but not any excess room and it is not lined. Perhaps my error in reading desription. For anyone not needing lining this is great. For super long hair or larger heads I would keep looking. It is super cute. It&#x27;s great as a cap for my to use at night or to use when washing face, facial and so on…….</li>
