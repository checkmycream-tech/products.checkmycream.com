    <li> very nice i love it  !!!!!</li>
    <li> Took forever to get these but they are the typical nail tip</li>
    <li> Served the purpose intended for.</li>
    <li> I bought these nails for my daughter not knowing how they were going to look once she applied them on. It turned out really nice and  she was satisfied with the outcome. I received it earlier than expected. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These nails are great for fashion nails. They make it nice to decorate with darker colors, don&#x27;t have to paint twice.</li>
    <li> Great a couple are bent</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like how they lay on the nail bed</li>
    <li> These tips are garbage. They broke in half the second I tried gluing them to my nails. They were cheap but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product when you could go to Sallys and get black tips for just a couple dollars more.</li>

    <li> I was thinking i spent less than five dollars on something and thought it would be cheap but not at all these nails are not super cheap. Look wonderful!!! !!</li>
    <li> Very cheap. You get what you pay for. I mean i dont work out of a salon so wasnt expecting salon quality but still not worth even at home</li>
    <li> These nails are great but you need to file them to your size of the you back finger so they attach other than that they are great</li>
    <li> Took a chance on a new color, didn&#x27;t turn out well. Looked super ghetto. Not to mention, the color on the bottom side of the nail got on everything (white pants didn&#x27;t take it well).</li>
    <li> They come exactly as advertised. They are of great length, color and I like how they come with their own glue. I cant wait to try them out. Very cost efficient</li>
    <li> The glue it comes with isn&#x27;t very trusty, the nails would come of easy and leave a black stain on my nails! I Recommend do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> Very slippery to put on, the color bleeds, but they look nice if you can get them on.</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage, looks ghetto, came a month and a half later, totally not worth buying.</li>
    <li> nice product but you definitely have to work with them, file them down to fit your nails etc. you cant just throw them on. over all they are cheap, easy and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also***** BUY NAIL GLUE****** they don&#x27;t come with it.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all end up giving them to my little sister to play with.</li>
