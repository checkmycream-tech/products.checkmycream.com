      <li>Pravana is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice colour while it lasts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to successfully take my hair color &#x27;to the edge&#x27;.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect when it&#x27;s new and it makes me feel like a mermaid :)</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I love this color</li>
      <li>I also would suggest using a brush to put on the color to make sure it is even.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color.</li>
      <li>I love you pravana.</li>
      <li>The heat opens your cuticle and better absorbs color.</li>
      <li>My lightened before the blue was applied, and the color looks perfect.</li>
      <li>I am constantly touching it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Pravana.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I get SO many compliments.</li>
      <li>and I love the product.</li>
      <li>It is more of a turquoise which is so not what I ordered at all.</li>
      <li>I LOVE pravana colors.</li>
      <li>thats for sure love it</li>
      <li>If I like the color when I wash it out, I&#x27;ll order another tube because I&#x27;m sure it will need evening out.</li>
      <li>but, it looked fantastic</li>
      <li>this is a gorgeous color but be sure to get your hair to the lightest color possible and also use a sulfate free shampoo to wash your hair.</li>
      <li>It looked pretty good up until the first wash.</li>
      <li>i dont find any change of my hair color after i clean my hair</li>
      <li>Still a cool look though.</li>
      <li>nice light blue color</li>
      <li>Better off using cheap hair spray color you get at the party store and not waste your money on this stuff.</li>
      <li>It fades fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it faded so quickly.</li>
      <li>I got them done professionally, and then I&#x27;ve been touching them up myself.</li>
      <li>I did everything right that I could tell, including not using heat to set the dye, since I was told that it makes Pravana fade faster if you do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sitting in my hair right now,</li>
      <li>Turned out so pretty, this is one color I will get again</li>
      <li>It is very cartoony and fun.  </li>
      <li>so you can do awesome complicated color melts or shapes and not worry about the dyes running together.</li>
      <li>I read the positive reviews Pravana products had.</li>
      <li>, I bleached it again to put the Pravana Blissful Blue and Vivid Violet over top.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is very temporary, go for this dye.</li>
      <li>so, I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>This is her normal color she consistently dyes it.</li>
      <li>but ONLY if you have very light hair or bleach hair to nearly white first.</li>
      <li>In the photo, I used the Blissful Blue for the top of my head, for the ends I used PRAVANA Vivids Blue.</li>
      <li>it is vibrant not subtle</li>
      <li>The first week of having the color in my hair, it was very vibrant and pretty; after that, the color started coming out and by the SECOND WEEK was completely gone from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is normal with pastel dyes.</li>
      <li>My motto: life is too short and I like having fun.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stay as long as I wanted, but it was very pretty</li>
      <li>That was fading to a green pretty quickly so</li>
      <li>I have been using their vivid colors for about 10 years now.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try a pravana pastel as I&#x27;ve had great success with pravana vivids, but this product is terrible.</li>
      <li>More of a dark blue than what was pictured.</li>
      <li>does fade quickly if you aren&#x27;t careful with washing</li>
      <li>But that could also be because my hair didn&#x27;t start off a pure white color.</li>
      <li>With this, I completely ran out, had to cut open the tube and start harvesting every drop, and had to comb through my hair to get my whole head covered.  </li>
      <li>If your hair is bleached completely platinum/white it will be the color shown on the box, but if it&#x27;s still yellow/blonde it will come out as teal like my hair, which was my desired outcome.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, the color was almost completely gone after 4 washes or so.</li>
      <li>old grandmother of four.</li>
      <li>and still it has completely faded out within a week.</li>
      <li>I know blues are the most fugitive, but I expected a little better than that, especially since this brand has a reputation for being very long lasting.</li>
      <li>not enough for a decent amount of hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not sure if it is because of the color being so light, but like I said before, I have used Pravana Violet and that lasted almost 5 months without having to re-dye...</li>
      <li>Even with only washing my hair 2x per week w/ sulfate free shampoo, and applying a Nexus color protector before and after, the blue doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>my hair is naturally dark brown, i bleached to a yellow tone, then applied the light blue.</li>
      <li>After following careful directions- &amp; even leaving the product in longer than the recommended time was, it completely washed out the first shampoo.</li>
      <li>Pretty, but the color just didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>reason I gave the product only 3 stars is because, even following the manufacturer recommendations and the advice of a professional colorist, the color nearly disappeared completely in just one washing.</li>
      <li>whereas this color lasted barely 2-3 weeks.</li>

<li> We didn&#x27;t attain the platinum / white base with the bleaching and applied the light blue over slightly golden hair.  </li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> If you do use this, make sure to lighten your hair to at least an 11, if not lighter!!!</li>
<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how it turns out or how long it stays.  </li>
<li> I lightened my hair before hand, but the color didn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
<li> so I had a really open cuticle, and I left the product on for at least two hours, way longer than the directions indicate.</li>
<li> Even if you prelighten until your hair is absolutely white, this color will never look the way it looks in promotional photos and it will wash out within a few washes.</li>
<li> It immediately faded to blue wash over seafoam green.</li>
<li> The product is less messy than over unnatural hair dyes and actually smells</li>
<li> Always bleach before you use this or any other extreme color.</li>
<li> Other products by this company have stayed in my hair longer (I&#x27;ve used the purple as well)</li>
<li> I had bleached my hair previously and put Ion Colorbrights Azure on it.</li>
<li> Product I receive was half the weight advertised-</li>
<li> I have used the Vivids green and it stayed for over a month before I bleached it out.  </li>
<li> I got the green vividx color, I used about 2/3 of a tube.  </li>
<li> It goes on unevenly, even when porosity is not an issue.</li>
<li> It still had green undertones from the Colorbrights</li>
<li> Unfortunately it washes out after only a few days.</li>
<li> Very little amount of dye.</li>
<li> I use shampoos from Lush, wash under cold water, the works</li>
<li> Was not satisfied with it at all.</li>
<li> I have short/medium thick hair.  </li>
<li> REally disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After following careful directions- &amp; even leaving the product in longer than the recommended time was, it completely washed out the first shampoo. Better off using cheap hair spray color you get at the party store and not waste your money on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Product tube arrived damaged with blue paste all over the inside of the packing envelope.</li>
    <li> Create color but not a lot of color and it didn&#x27;t last very long. I haven&#x27;t repurchased and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice colour while it lasts. It fades away within a week, even with me not washing my hair every day. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very little amount of dye. not enough for a decent amount of hair. color did not come through what so ever</li>
    <li> i didnt get same color  its blue but different one</li>
    <li> works well but ONLY if you have very light hair or bleach hair to nearly white first. my hair is naturally dark brown, i bleached to a yellow tone, then applied the light blue. the result was more of a seafoam but still beautiful. does fade quickly if you aren&#x27;t careful with washing but this is normal with pastel dyes.</li>
    <li> I love this color and I love the product.</li>
    <li> Product I receive was half the weight advertised- product washed out within two weeks, even though it was advertised as permanent salon quality hair color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE pravana colors. It didn&#x27;t stay as long as I wanted, but it was very pretty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m debating whether to give this a second try. I used three tubes, which still wasn&#x27;t quite enough to fully soak my hair all the way to the ends. Before dyeing, I bleached my hair and shampooed without conditioning so I had a really open cuticle, and I left the product on for at least two hours, way longer than the directions indicate. Nevertheless, the color was almost completely gone after 4 washes or so. I know blues are the most fugitive, but I expected a little better than that, especially since this brand has a reputation for being very long lasting. It was a very nice color, while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Color was gorgeous-for about a week. REally disappointing.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a friend. This is her normal color she consistently dyes it. Bought from amazon for the great price.</li>
    <li> I have bought Pravana brand dye before but have never used the pastels. Was not satisfied with it at all. The first week of having the color in my hair, it was very vibrant and pretty; after that, the color started coming out and by the SECOND WEEK was completely gone from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is because of the color being so light, but like I said before, I have used Pravana Violet and that lasted almost 5 months without having to re-dye...whereas this color lasted barely 2-3 weeks. I will continue to use Pravana since it is permanent dye, just won&#x27;t use the Pastels version.</li>
    <li> Pretty, but the color just didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Turned out so pretty, this is one color I will get again it is vibrant not subtle thats for sure love it</li>
    <li> Package got to my house promptly and I opened it up to use on my hair. I had bleached my hair previously and put Ion Colorbrights Azure on it. That was fading to a green pretty quickly so, I bleached it again to put the Pravana Blissful Blue and Vivid Violet over top. It still had green undertones from the Colorbrights but, it looked fantastic so, I didn&#x27;t really care. It looked pretty good up until the first wash. It immediately faded to blue wash over seafoam green. I did everything right that I could tell, including not using heat to set the dye, since I was told that it makes Pravana fade faster if you do. I use shampoos from Lush, wash under cold water, the works and still it has completely faded out within a week. If you&#x27;re looking for something that is very temporary, go for this dye.</li>
    <li> this is a gorgeous color but be sure to get your hair to the lightest color possible and also use a sulfate free shampoo to wash your hair.</li>
    <li> I love you pravana. These semi permanent colors don&#x27;t run when you rinse.them so you can do awesome complicated color melts or shapes and not worry about the dyes running together.</li>
    <li> I lightened my hair before hand, but the color didn&#x27;t stay very long. I also would suggest using a brush to put on the color to make sure it is even.</li>
    <li> The color only lasted 3 shampoos.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sitting in my hair right now, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it turns out or how long it stays.  I will update soon.  Pravana is amazing.  I have used the Vivids green and it stayed for over a month before I bleached it out.  The product is less messy than over unnatural hair dyes and actually smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;When I got the green vividx color, I used about 2/3 of a tube.  I have short/medium thick hair.  With this, I completely ran out, had to cut open the tube and start harvesting every drop, and had to comb through my hair to get my whole head covered.  If I like the color when I wash it out, I&#x27;ll order another tube because I&#x27;m sure it will need evening out.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars. I was so excited to try a pravana pastel as I&#x27;ve had great success with pravana vivids, but this product is terrible. Even if you prelighten until your hair is absolutely white, this color will never look the way it looks in promotional photos and it will wash out within a few washes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had ombre blue tips since March. I got them done professionally, and then I&#x27;ve been touching them up myself. The color starts with the pastel blue then blends into a darker one. I absolutely love the color. My lightened before the blue was applied, and the color looks perfect. The problem is it doesn&#x27;t last. It fades fairly quickly. Even with only washing my hair 2x per week w/ sulfate free shampoo, and applying a Nexus color protector before and after, the blue doesn&#x27;t last long. I am constantly touching it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I get SO many compliments. The color is perfect when it&#x27;s new and it makes me feel like a mermaid :)</li>
    <li> I JUST finished the process of applying Pravana Pastel blue. I&#x27;m excited to successfully take my hair color &#x27;to the edge&#x27;. My motto: life is too short and I like having fun. I read the positive reviews Pravana products had. It sealed the deal for me to make the purchase. I used a highlighting cap and pulled out the desired amount of hair to color. This technique kept my skin from staining. I&#x27;m a 62 yr. old grandmother of four. I&#x27;m living the good life! I would have given five stars, but I haven&#x27;t even walked out of the house, yet. I say GO FOR IT!&lt;br /&gt;Laurel V.  Central Oregon</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t attain the platinum / white base with the bleaching and applied the light blue over slightly golden hair.  We achieved the desired color and it did look beautiful.  We also used it on extensions and got great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave the product only 3 stars is because, even following the manufacturer recommendations and the advice of a professional colorist, the color nearly disappeared completely in just one washing.</li>
    <li> I love Pravana. I&#x27;ve used everything from their lighteners to their color. I have been using their vivid colors for about 10 years now. For those that don&#x27;t know they trick you need to put your desired amount of hair into foils and APPLY HEAT. The heat opens your cuticle and better absorbs color.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I will definitely be purchasing this line again for my next colors</li>
    <li> i dont find any change of my hair color after i clean my hair</li>
    <li> Great color. Lasts a long time. I love this brand. Always bleach before you use this or any other extreme color. It will last longer.</li>
    <li> nice light blue color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I hate this stuff! It goes on unevenly, even when porosity is not an issue. If you do use this, make sure to lighten your hair to at least an 11, if not lighter!!!</li>
    <li> It was neon blue when I received it, not a pastel blue</li>
    <li> More of a dark blue than what was pictured. But that could also be because my hair didn&#x27;t start off a pure white color. Still a cool look though. Unfortunately it washes out after only a few days. I don&#x27;t even wash my hair every day so I don&#x27;t know how it faded so quickly. Other products by this company have stayed in my hair longer (I&#x27;ve used the purple as well) but this just doesn&#x27;t stick!</li>
    <li> Bleached my daughter&#x27;s hair white and applied this and another pravana color...everyone comments she has the best haircolor in school.  It is very cartoony and fun.  Great results!  Did not damage hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even turn my hair blue. It is more of a turquoise which is so not what I ordered at all.</li>
    <li> If your hair is bleached completely platinum/white it will be the color shown on the box, but if it&#x27;s still yellow/blonde it will come out as teal like my hair, which was my desired outcome. In the photo, I used the Blissful Blue for the top of my head, for the ends I used PRAVANA Vivids Blue.</li>
