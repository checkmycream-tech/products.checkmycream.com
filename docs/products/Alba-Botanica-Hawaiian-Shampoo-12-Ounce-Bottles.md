### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent job Alba Botanica!</li>
      <li>I feel it gives my hair the perfect balance of softness, volume, and weightlessness without being dying.</li>
      <li>This hair wash was great!</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, too.</li>
      <li>Topped it off with the moisturizing coconut conditioner (which also has an incredible smell).</li>
      <li>smells great but dries hair out if you use too often</li>
      <li>Plus, it makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
      <li>Great product- used it for about a year now on both myself &amp; my 2 children.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is great, also.</li>
      <li>While paraben free, Alba does contain lauryl/ laureth sulfates!!!</li>
      <li>The smell is also amazing!</li>
      <li>Love this product and it smells great!</li>
      <li>Works so well, smells great and cruelty free!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos, but it smells great.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need any more volume!</li>
      <li>They love the smell!</li>
      <li>love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>To start, this product smell AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Otherwise: smells nice, does add a bit of body.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I have used the product before and liked it.</li>
      <li>Very pleased and will buy more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I still recommend people make sure the company hasn&#x27;t changed their product from when they posted the picture and ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon,  please make sure that you are advertising what people will get---the Hain company should be admonished for changing product without telling people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PostScript:  </li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>For all the raves of Alba, I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>So I keep having to apply more to feel like all of my hair has shampoo on it.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of the mango.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t even be able to finish the bottle I purchased.  </li>
      <li>I have tried more shampoo/conditioner sets than I can count and they have all been meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Okay.  </li>
      <li>Alba works much better.</li>
      <li>Oh yes, I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I agree with the reviewers that love the fragrance but not the lack of lather.</li>
      <li>Nice tropical scent...leaves my hair clean with no build up.</li>
      <li>My hair feels full, soft, and smells great.</li>
      <li>Gave my fine hair lots of texture and volume.</li>
      <li>(I shop cruelty free)</li>
      <li>If I skip the conditioner, my hair still comes out smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>oh mighty</li>
      <li>In my quest for finding a sulfate free shampoo, I stumbled across this one.</li>
      <li>Safe for the environment and no questionable chemicals on my skin.</li>
      <li>Love that there are no scary chemical foaming agents, though.</li>
      <li>Feels rich when shampooing hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and I&#x27;m not usually a fan of mango.  </li>
      <li>I love mangos, and the brand promised volume, so I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; After one wash, I really don&#x27;t want to try it again.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to help my hair ace more body.</li>
      <li>This smells good but left my hair with tangles and feeling coated.</li>
      <li>Not a bad shampoo, but that&#x27;s all it is...</li>
      <li>but it still comes out pretty easy.</li>
      <li>Plus is it&#x27;s pretty easy to rinse out.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, it&#x27;s not harsh, doesn&#x27;t dry out the scalp and smells great.</li>
      <li>This means I am going through the bottle rather quickly.</li>
      <li>This was my first attempt at a sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>Scent is great, but little lather.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how great it was until I ran out of my everyday shampoo and replaced that with something else that was in my closet.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s well worth it because my hair is not frizzy anymore</li>
      <li>but I won&#x27;t be bothered to return the item because I am completely out of shampoo and can&#x27;t afford to buy more while I wait for a refund.</li>
      <li>animal testing, no artificial colors, no sulfates, and the bottle is made with 100% recycled materials.</li>
      <li>I had no trouble getting suds, as many others have commented---</li>
      <li>Even though I only used it once, after I lather it up, I rinsed the lather out and while I was rinsing, my hair felt very smooth and rich in texture.</li>
      <li>have pretty fine, straight, oily hair.</li>
      <li>highly recommend for those with finnicky, fine hair types.</li>
      <li>My hair felt clean and ready to go.</li>
      <li>The lather is not as good as a traditional shampoo, but it is better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather is probably a good things, less chemicals.</li>
      <li>It does take more work than traditional shampoo/conditioner</li>
      <li>this is my first sulfate-free shampoo...</li>
      <li>I am \\&quot;older\\&quot; (over 50) with long hair and it never looked  better.</li>
      <li>well in the morning my hair is good, but by afternoon/evening I am oily and flat when I use traditional shampoo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottle I got is somewhat different labeling, and there are TWICE as many ingredients, including two alcohols and many other ingredients(non-herbal) which I won&#x27;t bother to even look up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have short hair, so I am still able to get it clean enough.</li>
      <li>I have only tried the bottles that are labeled \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; and as far as those ones go, i love it!</li>
      <li>Very enriching and relaxing.</li>
      <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather unless you use a lot of it.</li>
      <li>I really dislike this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other reviewers, I had no issues with getting the product distributed despite the lack of sulfates that many are used to in order to achieve that foamy shampoo experience.</li>
      <li>I only washed once doing this and still got squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I was only using it once a week as a special treat.</li>
      <li>shampoo is amazing, Hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down by chemicals or stuff that&#x27;s in other brands, scent is very refreshing yet subtle, hair just smells clean after drying, not like I dumped a bottle of perfume on my head.</li>
      <li>One wash with the Alba and my hair is clean, soft, shiny, healthy looking, and the slight wave is back.</li>
      <li>It did make my &#x27;leave in condition color vibrant and is very, very soft and sort of bouncy.  </li>
      <li>I received the product, it was a new and improved formula called \\&quot;Body Builder Mango Shampoo\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I had known about Alba revamping their product line, I would&#x27;ve picked one of the new varieties that is for moisture or color</li>
      <li>Nice, subtle scent.</li>
      <li>but my hair was still very soft after blow drying.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time recently.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used the standard store shampoos and wasn&#x27;t sold on all the natural products, however after becoming pregnant a second time and being concerned about the contents in conventional cleansing products, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
      <li>and so far it has...</li>
      <li>with lather at least I know the product is being evenly distributed and I don&#x27;t use more than what I need.</li>
      <li>I would expect no lather from an all natural product, but reading the ingredients there should be no reasons for lack of lather.</li>
      <li>and I like the emphasis on &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients.</li>
      <li>The plumeria lathers up nicely without this frustrating problem.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and oily skin, so my hair gets oily quickly and I have to wash it at least every other day.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get as oily as fast as it used to, so I now only need to really wash my hair every other day</li>
      <li>and, when I blow dry it, I can get as much body as I want.  </li>
      <li>Too bad because it smells great</li>
      <li>I follow up with another alba conditioner and sometimes just barely rinse it out.</li>
      <li>Your hair has to be absolutely sopping wet for there to be any lather,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy the mango again unless the lather formula improved. Your hair has to be absolutely sopping wet for there to be any lather, not just wet, so it becomes a dance of getting the shampoo on your hair as you&#x27;re underneath the spray but without it washing away before you can lather it in. If there&#x27;s no lather, my scalp feels weighed down the next day. The plumeria lathers up nicely without this frustrating problem. Otherwise: smells nice, does add a bit of body.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I ran out of my regular shampoo and didn&#x27;t feel like going to another store to get it. It feels like I&#x27;m putting shower gel on my hair. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather unless you use a lot of it. This means I am going through the bottle rather quickly. It is also hard to incorporate this shampoo into my hair.  In other words, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it spreads out evenly.  So I keep having to apply more to feel like all of my hair has shampoo on it.  My husband feels the same way about this shampoo and he has short hair.  I end up washing my hair 2 times during one shower.  I don&#x27;t normally have to do that with other shampoo.  My hair does not have extra body and I have to wash my hair the next day or it looks greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have used the product before and liked it. I wanted a moisturizing shampoo for the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, it was a new and improved formula called \\&quot;Body Builder Mango Shampoo\\&quot;. I already have extremely thick hair and I don&#x27;t need any more volume! And the list of ingredients is completely different than the one I&#x27;ve used previously which is listed here. The formula I received even includes alcohol, which is going to do the opposite of moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had known about Alba revamping their product line, I would&#x27;ve picked one of the new varieties that is for moisture or color-protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed but I won&#x27;t be bothered to return the item because I am completely out of shampoo and can&#x27;t afford to buy more while I wait for a refund.</li>
    <li> This hair wash was great! Even though I only used it once, after I lather it up, I rinsed the lather out and while I was rinsing, my hair felt very smooth and rich in texture. It didn&#x27;t feel like it would usually feel after I shampoo with my other shampoo. I love the smell of the mango. Very enriching and relaxing.My hair felt clean and ready to go. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo hoping that it would lather up well and so far it has... I just use about 1 tablespoon... it has worked out well.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at a sulfate free shampoo and I LOVE IT.  I have fine/oily-ish hair... well in the morning my hair is good, but by afternoon/evening I am oily and flat when I use traditional shampoo.  On the other hand, this shampoo gave my hair extra body and the oiliness was prevented for a longer period of time.  I actually feel like I can shampoo my hair less often for the first time in my life.  The lather is not as good as a traditional shampoo, but it is better than I expected.  The scent is nice and I&#x27;m not usually a fan of mango.  I plan to keep buying this product and I would recommend it!  The reason that I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I feel like I have a lack of products to compare this to... this is my first sulfate-free shampoo... I used to use Pantene, Garnier, Herbal Ess, etc...</li>
    <li> #1 This has no lather. I know lather isn&#x27;t what is cleaning your hair, but with lather at least I know the product is being evenly distributed and I don&#x27;t use more than what I need. #2 This smells good but left my hair with tangles and feeling coated. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> It does not lather as well as some shampoos, leaves my hair feeling oily but then I may have purchased the wrong shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewers that love the fragrance but not the lack of lather. Love that there are no scary chemical foaming agents, though. I have short hair, so I am still able to get it clean enough. It does feel like it strips my hair a bit. I follow up with another alba conditioner and sometimes just barely rinse it out. I really like the other alba products.</li>
    <li> My husband is a brain cancer survivor with left over itchy skin after over two years of chemo. Using regular shampoo made the itch worse on his head and beard. Alba works much better. I am \\&quot;older\\&quot; (over 50) with long hair and it never looked  better. We use the Alba conditioner also.</li>
    <li> Okay.  I&#x27;ve always used the standard store shampoos and wasn&#x27;t sold on all the natural products, however after becoming pregnant a second time and being concerned about the contents in conventional cleansing products, I decided to give this a try.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get as oily as fast as it used to, so I now only need to really wash my hair every other day (I still wash every day though) and it feels cleaner than it ever did with regular shampoos.  Love this product and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I did not purchase this product from Amazon. I did buy it from Target and used the shampoo with the Coconut Conditioner. I purchased this product to use as a &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo. After months of using Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, I had noticeable product buildup. To start, this product smell AMAZING. Unlike other reviewers, I had no issues with getting the product distributed despite the lack of sulfates that many are used to in order to achieve that foamy shampoo experience. I have very thick hair and learned to use just a small amount of sulfate free shampoo at a time and distribute it throughout my hair starting at the top, part my hair in the middle and then apply underneath at the bottom. Topped it off with the moisturizing coconut conditioner (which also has an incredible smell). I didn&#x27;t feel like the conditioner was as moisturizing as the Moroccan Oil but my hair was still very soft after blow drying. Again, I did not buy this product to achieve volume (I have plenty already) but man oh mighty, if volume is what you want, this is your product. My hair feels full, soft, and smells great. I will buy again. Minus one star because I feel like my hair is a little frizzy after using this product, even after applying It&#x27;s a 10 spray and Frizz-Ease serum.</li>
    <li> I really dislike this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well and makes my hair very dry, feeling like it was stripped of moisture. I won&#x27;t even be able to finish the bottle I purchased.  I have somewhat oily hair that needs to be washed daily.  This was just too harsh.  Too bad because it smells great and I like the emphasis on &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is terrible!  Thought I would try because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of typically chemicals but it is very watery thin and does not lather up.  It also leaves my hair feeling heavy and greasy.  If I scratch my scalp I get a white almost paste/gel substance under my nails.  This is going the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and oily skin, so my hair gets oily quickly and I have to wash it at least every other day. Someone with the same hair type will know what a pain it can be to find the right shampoo, hair is limp, gets greasy even faster, gets totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is amazing, Hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down by chemicals or stuff that&#x27;s in other brands, scent is very refreshing yet subtle, hair just smells clean after drying, not like I dumped a bottle of perfume on my head. My hair is shiny now because it&#x27;s healthy not because some ingredients leaves residue after rinsing to create a fake shine. And my hair now has volume without being dry or frizzy, something I actually didn&#x27;t think my hair was capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for those with finnicky, fine hair types. The conditioner is great, also.</li>
    <li> Works so well, smells great and cruelty free!! What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Safe for the environment and no questionable chemicals on my skin. Plus, it makes my hair look and feel great. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> smells great but dries hair out if you use too often</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in this. For all the raves of Alba, I was expecting more. Scent is great, but little lather. I would expect no lather from an all natural product, but reading the ingredients there should be no reasons for lack of lather. While paraben free, Alba does contain lauryl/ laureth sulfates!!! And this is supposed to make you lather? Unfortunately, I will be returning.    I was also concerned that Alba didn&#x27;t put the Leaping Bunny symbol on this packaging, although I know they are a member (I shop cruelty free)</li>
    <li> Nice tropical scent...leaves my hair clean with no build up.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use shampoos with sulfates. I have tried more shampoo/conditioner sets than I can count and they have all been meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine, straight, oily hair. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny, soft and I only have to wash my hair every other day with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Plus is it&#x27;s pretty easy to rinse out. Some sulfate free shampoos are impossible to rinse out of my hair. It does take more work than traditional shampoo/conditioner but it still comes out pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Note: the shampoo I got is a little different than what is pictured here. That is why my title is so specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo! I was only using it once a week as a special treat. I didn&#x27;t realize how great it was until I ran out of my everyday shampoo and replaced that with something else that was in my closet. It dried out my hair and left it lifeless. One wash with the Alba and my hair is clean, soft, shiny, healthy looking, and the slight wave is back. Oh yes, I love the scent. To me, it smells like oranges. This is now #1 on my very short list of shampoo favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No animal testing, no artificial colors, no sulfates, and the bottle is made with 100% recycled materials. Excellent job Alba Botanica!</li>
    <li> Great product- used it for about a year now on both myself &amp; my 2 children. They love the smell!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos, but it smells great. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather is probably a good things, less chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have only tried the bottles that are labeled \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; and as far as those ones go, i love it! I feel it gives my hair the perfect balance of softness, volume, and weightlessness without being dying. The smell is also amazing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to help my hair ace more body. Not a bad shampoo, but that&#x27;s all it is... A shampoo.</li>
    <li> I find that I need to wash my hair once with a small amount of this shampoo and then immediately rewash to get a full lather.  However, it&#x27;s well worth it because my hair is not frizzy anymore and, when I blow dry it, I can get as much body as I want.  If I skip the conditioner, my hair still comes out smooth and shiny.  Smells wonderful, too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on info on site, which included picture and ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I got is somewhat different labeling, and there are TWICE as many ingredients, including two alcohols and many other ingredients(non-herbal) which I won&#x27;t bother to even look up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon,  please make sure that you are advertising what people will get---the Hain company should be admonished for changing product without telling people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PostScript:  The amount involved is so small that I have decided to keep product.  I used it for the first time recently.  I had no trouble getting suds, as many others have commented---the suds are the toxins, people---all you have to do is some vigourous scrubbing when you apply the shampoo and then spread it around.  I only washed once doing this and still got squeaky clean.  It did make my &#x27;leave in condition color vibrant and is very, very soft and sort of bouncy.  Like I said, this is just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I still recommend people make sure the company hasn&#x27;t changed their product from when they posted the picture and ingredients.</li>
    <li> In my quest for finding a sulfate free shampoo, I stumbled across this one. I love mangos, and the brand promised volume, so I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; After one wash, I really don&#x27;t want to try it again. It left my hair very dry and tangled. Not worth a second wash.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, it&#x27;s not harsh, doesn&#x27;t dry out the scalp and smells great. What else can one say about shampoo?</li>
    <li> This review is for Alba Botanicals Body Builder Mango hair wash. Nice, subtle scent. Feels rich when shampooing hair. Gave my fine hair lots of texture and volume. Very pleased and will buy more.</li>
