<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Remember the Picopay tooth brush of the 50&#x27;s? This tooth brush incorporates that principal and messages your gums as you brush your teeth. My son gave me this tooth bush as a gift for Christmas and I have used it for a year. My dentist says my gums look healthier. They feel less sensitive too. So, I put this tooth brush on subscribe and save and will receive one regularly.</li>
    <li> ... or a better toothbrush, and the World will beat a path to your door. Was it Henry Thoreau who offered that tidbit of wisdom? Okay, but what would make for a better toothbrush? This one has five different sorts of bristles, all in different colors, plus little nubbins and grip treads, and the whole dang thing looks like the kind of gaudy oversized basketball shoes worn by fifteen-year-old &#x27;hubcap collectors&#x27; in Queens. In fact, the only reason I bought it was so that no one, in a bathroom shared with a crowd of people, would snatch it by mistake. I&#x27;m squeamish about sharing a toothbrush even with my wife, let alone others ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and the weird part is that I like the way my mouth feels after brushing with this dental equivalent of an old-time jukebox! Clean, fresh, and stimulated! A better toothbrush! Whoda thunkit?</li>
    <li> Favorite toothbrush. I have this on subscribe and save so that I remember to swap it out every month.</li>
    <li> They are amazing!  Really cleans the teeth and keeps the plaque under control.  I can&#x27;t afford dental care so I depend upon good teeth products for daily care.  This toothbrush, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon:  would be nice to have the option to buy in 1, 2, and 4 count, in MEDIUM as well as soft bristle.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say. It&#x27;s good for what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for. Comes in nice package and fast shipping with Prime. Gotta keep changing it like what the dentist says. ;)</li>
    <li> I love the way it works. Perfect size and cleans very nicely. I am very pleased with the toothbrush .</li>
    <li> I could clean my SIG with this thing. The thing has scrapers on the side and raised area in the centers which make it feel like chinese women are pushing back you cuticals, LOL. It has a whole series of bumpy things that look like Elenor Tomlinson&#x27;s rubber party dress to message your cheeks, from the inside! LOL Trust me it takes some getting used too, and I swear I always think of her...</li>
    <li> I received my toothbrush free from Smiley 360 and it works very fine. The handle grip was very strong as soon as i hold it. I am super glad I got a chance to try it out. It brush my teeth very well. Thank you very much for Smiley 360!.</li>
    <li> I like having this available on S&amp;S. Its like a reminder to replace my toothbrush, just like I did with my car engine and cabin filters. When they show up in the mail, its time to replace. All in all, its a good brush, by a known manufacture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric brushes but for some reason I just prefer the gold ol fashioned manual hand powered brush :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways so I needed a replacement toothbrush and my friend recommended me to get the Prohealth (yes friends talk about toothbrushes lolol) Went to my local walgreens picked it up for about $7.50 with tax For 1. IT was life changing I&#x27;m a daily flosser so my teeth usually don&#x27;t have plaque buildup. I used the brush and I didn&#x27;t even need to floss it did such a good job of removing stuck plaque that I might just have to start flossing Every other day. So when I finally replaced it I had to go on Amazon to see and boom they had for only $4.02. Best manual brush out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</li>
    <li> I got this free for my feedback from smiley360 and i love how clean and fresh this tooth brush makes my mouth feel. I would reccomend this to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> very surprised how well this brush actually worked the different levels of the bristols really reached hard to reach places and spaces between the teeth this will be my new brush that I will use very impressed</li>
    <li> I loves this Oral-B Prohealth All-In-One Toothbrush!! It gets behind my very back teeth pulling out grub I cant see. My mouth feels super clean and my teeth are so smooth and bright after just one brush! Its like an after the dentist brush!!</li>
    <li> Seriously my favorite toothbrush I have ever bought. I only buy manual toothbrushes and this is perfect. Nice grip, large bristles for coverage and the tongue cleaner should be a must have on any toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush for free from smiley360 to try as part of their ProHealth mission.  This is a good toothbrush. Its long head reaches well to the back of my mouth, its different sized bristles give a noticeably better clean in between teeth.  I would give it 5 stars, but I really rather my electrical oral-B with the small round spinning head and would not switch it permanently for this brush.  But, as far as manual toothbrushes go, this is a great one!</li>
    <li> it is okay but the problem is i am an firm toothbrush user so i use reach it is the only brand that has firm, and soft toothbrushes seem not to work very well for me i don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are being cleaned with soft toothbrush, but this toothbrush does feel good in your hands while brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I have tried several different types of toothbrushes from stiff to soft. But this one is the best. I am so glad that I was given the chance to try it out through Smiley360.com. It is a part of their Crest Pro-Health Mission. The brush cleaned my teeth extremely well. The bristles alternate on the brush, so it gives you an over all clean. It&#x27;s even great for those of us who have teeth that are close together. The bristles are soft, so they are very gentle on my gums. Even though I did receive it for free through the Smiley360.com program, the opinion and review is 100% of my own.</li>
    <li> Received this toothbrush from a mission I completed on smiley 360.  This is a great brush.  Reaches hard to reach places in my mouth. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One toothbrush free. The CrissCross® bristles, which are angled at 16° clean my teeth good.  The tongue massager feels good on my tongue.  The plastic gum massagers on the sides, I am ambivalent about, but my teeth do feel cleaner when I use this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is so soft it is easy to use</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Smiley 360 it is great I didn&#x27;t know it was also for sensitive teeth it cleans your teeth and leaves your moth so fresh I would teii anyone to use this</li>
    <li> Love the Products very much!!!</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush for free from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Being a heavy coffee drinker I am especially happy about the way this toothbrush removes surface stains. I also like it because it is bigger than normal toothbrushes and it makes your whole mouth feel really clean. I will definitely be purchasing it in the future!!</li>
    <li> : While I got this product for free from Smiley,it&#x27;s certainly a keeper in my book. It&#x27;s advertised as an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; product and it really is! Normally my routine is to floss, then use a gum stimulator, finally get out my toothbrush to brush. With this product I&#x27;m able to use it for everything. While I still floss, I can use this amazing toothbrush for my gums and  to clean my tongue and cheeks.I have a very small mouth and this toothbrush fits without gagging me the way some others do. It&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m providing extra protection against tartar and cavities.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothbrush! It cleans so well and leaves my teeth feeling amazing! I highly recommend this toothbrush. I did receive this brush free from Smiley 360! I am so grateful that I did. I will continue to buy this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is one of the best I have ever used. It feels comfortable in my mouth while doing an amazing job cleaning my teeth. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, it is a great all round toothbrush</li>
    <li> Worked great and did the job well. My teeth are clean and white.</li>
    <li> seems to automatically brush your teeth, leave your teeth feeling clean.Thank you @mysmiley360 for this free sample &amp; keeping my smile healthy</li>
    <li> I am a Smiley360 member and received this product for free to review. I think this toothbrush does a good job of getting your teeth clean. It has more features than a standard toothbrush which I like. I still prefer a toothbrush that is electronic, but for a regular toothbrush I would buy this one.</li>
    <li> While this isn&#x27;t my favorite toothbrush I&#x27;ve had in the last four months, it&#x27;s not bad. I would recommend trying it to see if you like it before discounting it on my review because I said it wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I got this as a freebie in the mail to post a review about so the opinion in this is definitely mine!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free through smiley360, however my opinion is my own. This brush left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. The bristles are soft, and very gentle on the gums. Also, the quality of the grip was great, my hand never slipped. This really is a great product!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I received this toothbrush at no charge, but the opinions are my own. I&#x27;ve used the toothbrush for about three weeks now and it is very comfortable to use. I thought to start with that it was a bit large but as time goes by I realize it&#x27;s just the right size and my mouth looks and feels really clean after using.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I have tried several different types of toothbrushes from stiff to soft. But this one is the best.

    <li> This toothbrush keeps my teeth looking sparkly and white! I like the rubber bits around the outside, they are gentle on my gums</li>
    <li> After getting an Oral-B Prohealth  Toothbrush for free in exchange for giving an honest review of the product, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that sometimes the best things in life really are free.  Having used a battery operated toothbrush in the past, I was skeptical about reverting back to a manual one but it was definitely a good move.  The Oral-B Prohealth and it&#x27;s unique design reaches all of the areas of your teeth leaving them super-clean.  I have found a new toothbrush - anyone want to buy my old battery-powered one ?!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this toothbrush thru Smiley 360 and boy was I pleasantly surprised when I tried it! It really made my teeth feel super smooth and what a plus to have a tongue brush as well! I sure am glad I had the opportunity to try this brush as I will be buying this in the future for myself and my Hubby. These opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush it makes your mouth feel fresh and clean while making your teeth white I am a member of smiley 360 and I received this toothbrush free it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to review. All opinions are honest and 100% my own. I found the Oral-B ProHealth brush to be a great manual toothbrush. I typically use a electric toothbrush because it does a better job at getting my teeth clean. However I felt this toothbrush cleaned my teeth extremely well. The bristles are soft and alternate back and forth creating a more comfortable and over all better clean.  I will definitely keep a couple pro health toothbrushes on hand for company, as a spare and for traveling. I loved the Oral-B ProHealth Toothbrush - wowzers what a great clean!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It gets the hard to reach plaque and germs with ease, and its not too hard and not too soft. It really is worth it. To anyone out there who reads this, buy this toothbrush. It gets the job done well</li>
    <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is, hands down, one of the best manual toothbrushes that I have had the pleasure of reviewing. Comfortable grip, scrubs the grime off your teeth and stimulates your gums without that sore feeling after, and gives you that overall fresh-from-the-dentist feel that lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Never been disappointed with Oral-B. Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Will buy again ... in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best toothbrush I have ever used. My mouth and teeth are sparkly clean and that makes me very happy!!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Crest Pro Health toothbrush in the mail and after using it for the first time I can feel the enamel on my teeth without the worry of over brushing causing my gums to bleed as I did in the past with other brands of toothbrushes not thinking I was cleaning my teeth well enough.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this toothbrush, the tooth paste also is great leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  This is a fabulous toothbrush.  The brush head is much bigger than a standard toothbrush.  The various lengths of the bristles and the larger size of the brush provides for a more thorough cleaning.  The bullt in tongue cleaner is nice to use also.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental visit to see if they notice any improvements!  This is a definite keeper!</li>
    <li> I received crest pro health toothpaste free for the purpose of my review my opinions are my own great clean feeling teeth after using crest pro health</li>
    <li> Good price and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of toothbrushes, but this one is the best by far. The bristles get in between my teeth well without irritating my gums. It makes me feel more confident about my smile and not worry about my breath. Although I received this product for free thorough the Smiley 360 program, this opinion is 100% my own. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> my mouth feels like it just got cleaned at the dentist after i use this! and it&#x27;s so much nicer than those electric toothbrushes that make your whole head buzz when you brush.</li>
    <li> First toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased in years that feels like it is really cleaning everywhere. Between teeth, along the gum line, even the cheeks gets scrubbed. This toothbrush seems to do it all. I replace my brush every three months with automatic shipping from here and when my last brush was discontinued, I switched to this one. I am so glad I did. It is just &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; enough to feel like it is breaking apart any plaque on your teeth and the bristles are designed to cover all angles, ensuring they get into those hard to reach spaces between teeth. Will this alleviate the need to floss or rinse? No - but it will make the job easier, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a toothbrush that feels like it is doing the job - give this Oral-B a chance. It is called an All-In-One for a reason. It does it all. Brushes, scrubs, and scrapes. Excellent design.</li>
    <li> I received my tooth brush for free from Smiley 360 to try and I think it is great. This brush makes your mouth feel so much cleaner than an ordinary brush does. It cleans between the teeth and does an excellent job at the gum line. I think it is close to how you feel after a dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought that something so inexpensive could make such a difference?</li>
    <li> Dreams do come true. I received a free Oral-B Prohealth All-in-One toothbrush, SMiley 360 sent this to me free and all I have to do is give my honest feedback of this product. MYSELF AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, MY COLLEGE BOUND DAUGHTER LOVED IT.  I talked to my daughter&#x27;s friends, heading off to college.I  told the girls how great this new brush is.  Since my daughter liked them so much, i bought each of them one for college.</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush for free courtesy of Smiley360 and am providing feedback after using this product for some time now. I&#x27;ve been rather Impressed with the Oral-B toothbrush. The handle had a nice firm grip and Is comfortable to hold when using. It doesn&#x27;t have that slippery feel as some brands do. The bristles feel rather strong as they brush against your teeth and you can feel them cleaning as you brush. I really like the different sizes in bristle lengths as I feel they clean my teeth much more effectively. Which has been mush more invigorating then other brands of toothbrushes I have tried or used. It&#x27;s a sturdy product that has held up after numerous brushings, unlike others brands I&#x27;ve tried and would fall apart after only a few uses. I&#x27;ve been very pleased using this toothbrush and It has become the only brand I will ever use. Forget those other brands and stick with Oral-B. Your mouth and teeth will thank you for It.</li>
    <li> I received Crest ProHealth Toothpaste for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I found this toothpaste to be great tasting and gritty at the start of brushing my teeth, however the flavor and grittiness wore out quickly.  I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll be buying this product in the future, as I like my mouth to feel fresh after I brush, but just didn&#x27;t after brushing my teeth with this product.</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush free from a Smiley360 mission. I really liked the rubber bristles on the sides &amp; felt like they did help massage my gums. I normally use an electric toothbrush, but took this along on vacation &amp; think it worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had received a smaller brush size, because I have a small mouth &amp; the medium size was a little large.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I tried this new toothbrush and I immediately fell in love with it!  I could not believe how the brush fit right on the edges of my teeth and gave me such good cleaning power and cleaner teeth than I could ever remember getting before.  I will always use this brush.  I feel it cleans and freshens my mouth better than any other I have ever used.  thank you Oral B!  My thanks to Smiley360 for the free toothbrush they gave me to try.</li>
    <li> First, I would like to say that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions stated are 100% my own. I am a Braun power toothbrush user but I have to say that I really do love this toothbrush...I decided to take it on vacation with us because I didn&#x27;t want bring the Braun I now find myself wondering if I really if I want to use the Braun anymore...the feeling on my gums is unlike anything I have ever felt before...now what would really great is if they made a power version of this toothbrush:)</li>
    <li> I receved this product free for the purpose of my review.  Great feel, not to hard or to soft, easy on the gums.</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I tried this toothbrush and found it to be very good and felt that it left my teeth cleaner than my previous brush.</li>
    <li> Price was good, delivery was great. This type is no longer offered in the stores, and glad I found them here. While the price is a bit high for a good brush (I don&#x27;t spend more than 1.50 ea), these last longer, and I preferred these bristles, and bristle configuration.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush... the head is very large, allowing for coverage of a LOT of tooth.  The bristles are firm enough to give a scrubbing feeling, without mashing against your teeth and gums, and without irritating them.  The grip is textured, so it is easy on the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat - the handle is very thick, and if you use a narrow holder for your toothbrush, this may not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in a manual toothbrush, this is one of the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice strong and not so hard to hurt clean the theet the way I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used in the desert have to put it in the back pack or shower pack nice and soft and yet strong to help me feel a clean mouth...</li>
    <li> just as described. would buy more of these for sure. shipped as described. no problem with this</li>
    <li> Works well. My teeth feel great after brushing with this product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I had the opportunity to try the new Pro-Health Oral-B Toothbrush that I received free by being a Smiley360 member.  I really liked how the brush had rubber &amp; regular bristles on the brush, and felt it did a better job than my normal toothbrush removing plaque.  I have periodontal disease and want to do all I can to stop it&#x27;s progression.  I felt the bristles reached deep into my problem areas and will help prevent further damage.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> The oral b pro health tooth brush has been one of my favorite so far that I have tried. The handle makes it easy to grip and hold onto while brushing my teeth yet also easy to get to the hard to reach areas of my mouth, mainly in the back. The bristles were nice and gentle yet not super soft where you felt like your teeth weren&#x27;t being cleaned. Since I started using this toothbrush a few weeks ago I have felt as if my mouth and teeth have both felt cleaner. I give this a thumbs up! I received this toothbrush free for the purpose of my review. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> The shipment on this was fast and the item was exactly as expected.  I was putting together a travel kit for my husband, and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get this.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush! For a manual tooth brush, it really does a great job on the teeth and gums. I go with the soft bristles, I like it best. All Pro-Health products are the best. Thanks to Smiley360 I got a free sample of my favorite Oral B Pro-Health to use. This brand has always been my first choice.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush helps to get in between your teeth. It keeps your mouth clean and fresh!!  I love this toothbrush and will be replacing the rest of the family&#x27;s toothbrushes with Oral B Prohealth all in one toothbrushes</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush for free from smiley360 to try as part of their ProHealth mission. This is a good toothbrush. Its long head reaches well to the back of my mouth, its different sized bristles give a noticeably better clean in between teeth. But, as far as manual toothbrushes go, this is a great one!</li>
    <li> I received my toothbrush free from Smiley 360 and I am super glad I got a chance to try it out. The handle fits perfectly in my hand. Great grip. Also like the way it cleans. The medium bristles work great on my teeth and gums. Very easy but effective on my sensitive gums.  Definitely recommend this toothbrush and will purchase again. Thanks Smiley 360!</li>
    <li> What a great toothbrush!  After receiving my free sample of Oral B Prohealth All in One Toothbrush, I was amazed at the difference in how clean my mouth felt after brushing compared to my old toothbrush.  I really feel that this got under my gum line and in between my teeth much better than other comparable products.</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush from Smiley.  The bristles are not too small and I like the different textures of bristle.  Good grip, good size, good product.  This will be the one that makes the Christmas stockings this year.  Great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My favorite manual toothbrush! I have always brought manual toothbrushes and so far this tops all that there is out there, I no longer buy any other brands.</li>
    <li> While this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my previous brush, I feel like it gives my teeth that fresh, clean feeling you look for. Of course, the toothbrush would be nothing without a delicious, minty fresh toothpaste so I always pair my toothbrush with a paste that really gets my teeth clean and my breath fresh. I would recommend this brush for anyone looking to try a simple, yet efficient toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not rocket science. That being said, it&#x27;s better than anything you&#x27;d pay $1.00 for, but not exactly one of those automatice Sonic ones. Try it, like it, repeat.    I received this toothbrush at no cost to review it for Smiley360 and Crest Pro-Health. The review is my own words and thoughts.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I liked the different length of bristles and the little nibs on this brush. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Oral-B toothbrush.  It was the perfect size and the bristles reached every nook and crany to get a very clean feeling.  Would definitely recommend this product.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Received a free toothbrush for my honest opinion on Oral B Prohealth all in one medium toothbrush. My number one concern with tooth brushes is that some say soft or medium but are still really hard on my teeth and gums. Doesn&#x27;t make for a very good experience. But this oral b tooth brush definitely fits the bill... it is gentle but yet stiff enough to get the job done. It feels like it massages my gums while brushing my teeth and makes me feel like I have a beautiful white smile. I used it with the crest pro health whitening tooth paste and I feel like my smile has gotten a little brighter and I know my mouth feels alot cleaner.</li>
    <li> I recieved The Oral-B Prohealth All on one toothbrush from Smiley 360 Free! I am So Pleased with it! It Cleans Super Great!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush for free from Smiley360 to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this toothbrush. At first it feels a little different because of the position of the bristles, but the clean effect is very nice. This toothbrush gets right in there to give a really good brushing without being harsh or too hard or too soft. It really is just right. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> The packaging was normal. It was not eye catching. The bristles were soft and left everything clean. The head is angled to fit inside my mouth and between my cheeks. My teeth felt very clean and slick. You still have to floss though. I received this free product to try. All opinions are100% my own.</li>
    <li> loved it. made my teeth feel so clean!!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I have tried several different types of toothbrushes from stiff to soft. But this one is the best. I am so glad that I was given the chance to try it out through Smiley360.com. It is a part of their Crest Pro-Health Mission. The brush cleaned my teeth extremely well. The bristles alternate on the brush, so it gives you an over all clean. It&#x27;s even great for those of us who have teeth that are close together. The bristles are soft, so they are very gentle on my gums. Even though I did receive it for free through the Smiley360.com program, the opinion and review is 100% of my own.The bristles are not too small and I like the different textures of bristle. Good grip, good size, good product. This will be the one that makes the Christmas stockings this year. Great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I generally use only Sonicare but love this one on travels.  It is easy to hold and just the right amount of firmness.</li>
    <li> I accidentally purchased [[ASIN:B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]] and was in toothbrush hell. I already brush my teeth three times a day, but Colgate plunged me into dentistry purgatory and I could not get my teeth to feel clean. I was brushing my teeth constantly. On our way home from the movies today I had Mr. MVP stop at the drugstore so I could buy a new toothbrush, which after some research we discovered was also the same toothbrush we have been using for the last ten years: the Oral-B toothbrush. I love this toothbrush. It works. My teeth feel clean. My mouth is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The all in one comes with soft bristles, but I prefer the medium. It&#x27;s a no nonsense, simple, effective toothbrush. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is very gentle on my teeth and gums which usually bleed with even a super soft bristle.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through Smiley360.  I love this toothbrush.  It makes my teeth feel so clean and it reaches in between the gums where food likes to hide.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and chunky, which makes it durable. I really like the tonge scrubber on the back too.</li>
    <li> I hate this toothbrush lol I learned I dont like the plastic bits they dont do anythig for teeth have to brush them twice to truly feel like my teeth are clean and forget aboutthe tongue scraper talk about painful jeez I prefer a regular bristle brush</li>
</ol>
