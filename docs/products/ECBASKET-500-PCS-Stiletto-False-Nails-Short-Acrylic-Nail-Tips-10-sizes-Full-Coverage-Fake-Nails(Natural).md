      <li>LOVE THESE&lt;</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s a tip; glue the under side of the nail to a toothpick and paint the nails BEFORE you put them on; this makes them look professionally done and totally flawless, because you won&#x27;t flood your cuticle with polish or worry about dissolving the nail with acetone clean up.</li>
      <li>They are easy to polish and have a nice smooth finish.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have nail glue surprisingly, so I glued a couple to some cardboard with hot glue.</li>
      <li>They are consistent in size and shape from one to another (for each size) and there is a good selection.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to fix it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Only issue I have is that alot of the nails dont quit fit my nails perfectly</li>
      <li>I have been wearing them for a week so far and they are holding up great.</li>
      <li>these are such good nails !</li>

    <li> Perfect! Very durable! Photo is straight from the box, no shaping needed! Purchased from Nails Gaga!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Exactly what I was looking for. Will purchase again. Great Serive</li>
    <li> these are such good nails ! They are strong and look very nice. They go over the entire nail bed too. I really love them and you get such a good amount of nails for the price. This was the only seller that told these nails already shaped. I recommend completely.</li>
    <li> I love this nails!!! They are perfect! Delivery was fast!!</li>
    <li> Not for myself,  for my wife, she had no complaints,  matter of fact she was excited to have them.</li>
    <li> I wish the 0 sized nails where a lot larger but otherwise i love the nails.</li>
    <li> These nails are incredible. I got them lightening fast and they are spectacular quality; very easy to use and shape and look so beautiful! Here&#x27;s a tip; glue the under side of the nail to a toothpick and paint the nails BEFORE you put them on; this makes them look professionally done and totally flawless, because you won&#x27;t flood your cuticle with polish or worry about dissolving the nail with acetone clean up. PLUS you can use your dominant hand ;) Then when they are dry, pop them off the toothpick and glue them on your natural nails! SUCH gorgeous nails. Definitely would recommend the set and seller. Excellent price, excellent follow up, excellent everything.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted , as seen on picture , Cant wait to use them ! Ã°Å¸â€™â€¦</li>
    <li> Popped open a soda can with ones of these lovelies! I&#x27;ve brought tons and tons of false nail tips before, from the highest to the lowest priced, some were nice quality others were just meh. And these are amazing, high quality nail tips. I don&#x27;t normally wear false tips a lot but I do wear them often enough. I like these mostly because I don&#x27;t have to sit down, take my precious time shaping out my own nails which sometimes takes me over a good hour (sometimes more) mostly because I want them to be as identical as possible, sometimes I skip the whole process and just apply false hawk talons or just plain talons. These talons/talone come already shaped which is lovely and are not too pointy or not dangerously pointed (or over dramatic). They come in a nice little case and each size of nail is separated from the rest in its own little cubicle, it didn&#x27;t come in a little baggy all sizes mixed up together like other nails which is what I don&#x27;t like and is a real pain.I just have to find which one fits and if it doesn&#x27;t fit completely to my nail bed (width wise) then I file it down a little, yes, they do stand up to a little filing. They also can be filed down into a more &#x27;square&#x27; tip or &#x27;round&#x27; tip, if you so desire (Bonus!).&lt;br /&gt;These are also not entirely flat, they&#x27;re slightly curved which is good because I don&#x27;t have flat nail beds, so these nail tips contoured to my nail beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what every nail tech/lover wants to know: Yes, they&#x27;re white as in white not off white. They also fit comfortably. They are a great length but can be filed down if it is too long for your taste (but they are not &#x27;too the extreme&#x27; long). And they do not break easily. They&#x27;re pretty flexible ( I had flattened one with a small boulder to test its flexibility and the nail had flattened without breaking into pieces) . Easy to paint nail polish over and under, and the nail polish is easy to remove from these talons.  You can paint just like how you normally paint your own natural nails (tested a few types of nail art on them and they can be treated as if they were my own nails). I can do my nail art on these and remove the nail art /nail polish from them later without destroying the nail tip itself. And what I love most about these high quality nails is that they don&#x27;t turn gloppy and all gooey when you&#x27;re removing them by soaking them in a little acetone. The glue is what get dissolves not these nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying these nails out for about two and a half weeks and they do stand up to everyday things. Even when I apply a little pressure to the tips. And yes, you can use them for acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;Stands up to a little filing, easily painted, easy to create nail art on, easily removed and is sturdy enough to stand up to everyday things, what more can a nail lover/ tech asks for?ls (tested a few types of nail art on them and they can be treated as if they were my own nails).

    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin, weak nails no matter what supplements or strengthening products I tried. But I have always envied the look of longer nails. These were the first false nails that I applied myself and I found the process a lot easier than expected! The nails are a bit more flexible at the base to make them fit better. I filed mine down a little just because I wanted them a little shorter and a little rounder I am in love with the results and have had many compliments. I have had them on of four days and they look great! One popped off, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was an error in the way I applied the glue and I was able to fix it very quickly. Great full-cover nails, I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Love,love,love these. They are perfect!  Beautifully shaped and not too long.</li>
    <li> This is such a great package!!!!! Love that i can return to doing nails!</li>
    <li> These arrived today I have been waiting for them with bated breath lol , I must say they came very quickly , the quality deserves a 10 star rating , I am not a drag queen , nor a transgender , I am a man who loves nail  , I have used many , none compare to these ,  the fit , the feel , do your self a favor and get them , I work with horses , pigs , chicken , ducks 17 dogs , I do a number with nails , these are so strong  and truly natural looking!!!! Love love love will be getting many more</li>
    <li> These nails are awesome! Exactly what I was looking for. Just had to file down the edges at some of the tips a bit to smooth out but they fit great. Color went on perfectly smooth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried false nails in years but I thought perhaps they&#x27;d improved since the 1980s so I agreed to test these out.  I have pretty small hands and fingernails so I couldn&#x27;t use all the sizes.  However, I do think this set represents a nice selection of sizes and should work for a lot of people.  I will run out of #6 first because it is best for both my index and ring fingers.  I use #2 for my thumb and #5 for my middle finger.  #9 is just about right for my smallest finger.  But there are several larger and plenty of intermediate sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are a little flat and these were rounded just a touch more than my nails.  However, I used some adhesive pads (thick and somewhat gel-like) and those allowed me to fill in the gaps and still get a good fit.  So if the shape of your nails is a little off, get the adhesive pads or some glue that can go on thick and these will still work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all of these had perfect tips -- nothing that needed to be filed down.  I was happy about that.  (I have some other false nails that I have had to file.)  These are full nails, not just tips, which works better for me, especially because of the shape of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These took polish quite well.  I tried several different kinds from different price ranges -- a Julep creme, a Maybelline glitter, and a Zoya pixie dust.  All polishes stuck.  (I don&#x27;t have any topcoats, base coats, etc. specifically designed for acrylic nails.  All mine are for natural nails but they worked on these.)  I painted the false nails on wax paper prior to applying; that way, I could use my dominant hand for all of them.  They ended up looking better as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were a bit too long for me to keep on for a long time (I have to type a lot both for hobbies and work).  But they were strong and sturdy and stayed on well until I decided to remove them.  The tips are a bit pointed.  If I were to buy more false nails on my own, I would definitely go with this brand because of my excellent experience.  (I&#x27;d probably try a more rounded shape and slightly shorter length, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.rand because of my excellent experience.

    <li> Took less than a week for them to arrive. Nice packaging. The nails are very sturdy and the perfect length! I would definitely recommend these. Well worth the price! 😊</li>
    <li> These are great nails. They are already shaped perfectly, you just need to apply and paint them. I have been wearing them for a week so far and they are holding up great. They are very strong and durable. They have a natural look, they curve over my nail bed and fit perfectly. These are actually the length I like, but if you like them shorter or less pointy they are easy to file down. They hold nail polish well, it applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t chip. I only needed 1-2 coats of polish. I definitely will purchase these when my sample runs out. I received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE&lt;br /&gt;these are a great look with a matte coat and a shiny strip&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I really love these! I have never used this shape of false nails before, though I have shaped my natural nails into stilettos in the past. I really love the fact that these cover the entire nail beds, instead of just the tips. They look very natural when they are on, nobody could tell that I had done them myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to shape them at all, and they were the perfect length for me right out of the box. However, if you prefer them to be a bit shorter, they could be filed down easily. They stayed on for me and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with them popping off. They are easy to polish and have a nice smooth finish. I received some to review, and absolutely love them. I will be placing another order when these run out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Will buy again....eventually.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Exactly what I ordered based on picture. I received it super fast. I definitely recommend these nails and this buyer to anyone looking for a quality poduct. Going to order again and again.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c3ab36139c794a4681b8b29a0ec82ec1]] I am doing a play where I need long nails. So, these are going to do the trick. I cannot grown mine, and can not abide acrylics. This lets me have nails for the performances, but not all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
    <li> Love these nails! This was my first time using stiletto nails and they turned out great. I cut mine down for a more practical look (although I did love the longer look). I cut diagonally along each side of the nail and filed down...really easy.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Sally beauty supply nail glue, brush on.  Nails lasts at least a week...really impressed.</li>
    <li> The nails arrived earlier than expected which was great. The only complaint i really have is that the nails i recieved were clear and not a white ish color like the other customers that had purchased these. Even though i got clear ones instead of white ones. They&#x27;re easy to paint over and are so far very durable. Overall i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> By 3 days in they start breaking</li>
    <li> They did take a while to arrive but once they got here I was extremely pleased with this product. I love them so much they&#x27;re a full nail which is what I was looking for. They&#x27;re not TOO long, I can still use my phone. Just all around great.</li>
    <li> Really great pack of nails. I was a bit apprehensive because I have a wide nail bed but they fit well! No cutting required just a little filing and you&#x27;re good to go! I didn&#x27;t buy their glue because I honestly don&#x27;t know how well it will work...so I used Krazy glue (idk if that was wise lol) but it did the job</li>
    <li> I got my package 8 days after ordering, honestly i think thats very good timing. Everything that was advertise was correct, As you can see in the photos. Im very pleased with the out come of the shape and the fact its a little longer than your nail. They arnt to thick to where it would be an issue but arnt thin to were they out snap either, kinda in the middle. I didnt have to file them to much, just a little on the top due to there being a bit of rough edges. Also used some 100% acetone to get them off and it worked perfectly. I highly recommend this product by the seller if you are looking at these types of fake nails.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love these nails. sturdy, great length, and the case is an added bonus. it came packaged in an amazon prime box and wrapped in buble wrap through ups. 😉😍 will order again.</li>
    <li> Love them! Came in so quickly and they are perfectly shaped. Only have to file a small part at the tip and they are ready to use! Wish they were a little longer but it doesn&#x27;t hurt for me to have them a little shorter.</li>
    <li> Too large for small nails😩...</li>
    <li> Love em!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got these nails fast,next day..I&#x27;m never the type to write reviews but I&#x27;m in love with these nails..they are very durable and the shape is the best..,had them on so far for almost a week and not one has fallen off...will be reordering.i will be polishing soon...:)</li>
    <li> I love these so much. they fit perfectly and are better than when I get them done at the salon!</li>
    <li> As I type this review, I&#x27;ve been wearing these nails for a full week without a single one breaking off or chipping. They are a lot longer than I usually like but I&#x27;m in love with them. People keep asking wherw i got them done and can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re press ons! Good variety of sizes and they&#x27;re very well made. I did file the tips just a little to make them less sharp. I should get at least 25 manicures from this box alone, but will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> These exceeded my expectations! I have abnormally small nails plus I have a bad habit of chewing on them. This nail set has a huge variety of sizes to accommodate any nail. This set does not come with any glue or adhesive, but you can get great nail glue at most stores for around $2. I was surprised how sturdy they are. They are very long and sharp, so they take a little getting used to. You can also file them a bit if you need to. I wear them everyday, but they would make excellent claws for Halloween as well!</li>
    <li> Flimsy! Lasted less than a day! Fit was off as well. A waste of my time and money! Seller was fast and merchandise arrived packaged well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! They took about a month to get to me, but it was well worth it. They are the perfect length (I type and use my hands a lot at work, so the length is practical). They&#x27;re also super thin so it looks like your natural nail. I like my talons to be dangerously pointy and these are a bit more rounded for my liking,  but a few quick swipes with the filer and I was good. Will definitely be ordering again when I&#x27;m running low. Just wish they were eligible for Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: use a brush-on nail glue so your nail is fully coated. This makes the tips stay on longer. I&#x27;m going on a week now and that doesn&#x27;t normally happen with press-ons!</li>
    <li> Loved these nails. Fit perfectly and are great quality. Absolutely love the shape. And I&#x27;ve even cut and filled them and they don&#x27;t split like other nails Ive purchased in the past. Will definintly be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Honestly this product is probably some of the best acrylic nails I have tried. I do drag for a living, and having nails that will stand up against a lot is crucial. They&#x27;ll take a lot of wear and tear without snapping, but have just enough pliability to form to your nail comfortably. Since buying this set, I&#x27;ve used no other type of nail &amp; always recommend them to fellow performers when asked about my nails.  Thoroughly satisfied with the product and the shipping time!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the beautiful hands of my mother and grandmother, I was blessed with decent looking nails that grow well on their own.&lt;br /&gt;I keep them long, and shaped halfway between an almond and a stiletto shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, always the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One will break, usually a middle finger that hits the keyboard once too often.&lt;br /&gt;I love that these are preshaped  in exactly the same way as my own nails.  I can glue one on and they blend well enough to pass while my nail grows back.&lt;br /&gt;The professional nail technician will appreciate the wide range of sizes for all of their clients. People such as myself like the ease of use and natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review.

    <li> I adore these!!!! Simply just adore them! They&#x27;re the highest quality I have personally used. They can be shaped, and filed if you choose to do that. They allow polish to go on very well. Nor are they thin, or flimsy. I haven&#x27;t tried them with gel polish, but I imagine they would work for that too. I didn&#x27;t have nail glue surprisingly, so I glued a couple to some cardboard with hot glue. (Bad Idea now that I did it.) but, I did test them out, with some polishes, and nail art. I found that the only two that don&#x27;t fit my fingers are 9 and 0, which are the ones I glued to the cardboard. 0, was too big, and, would require a lot of shaping to get right. and 9 was too skinny. The point starts right after my natural nail bed, too and curves into a soft not sharp point. They have a natural in-curve to like your real nails would, if you filed them that way. They really are natural and I am sure they are comfortable, I will test that when I get some nail glue. This isn&#x27;t my normal shape, but I find I like to try new things, so I am excited to get them on and try them out, that way too! They feel great just pressing them to see if they fit, and its nice because I can file them shorter to wear to work. since we can&#x27;t have acrylics! These are some of the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided. (Please Ignore my bad attempts at nail art. Im still learning!)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I have very petite fingers and it&#x27;s described as wide I thought it would not fit. But I took the risk and the smaller sizes are just right for me. Also because of the nail shape the extra wide nail bed coverage is a must. This is how they look straight out the box no filing. I ordered from nail gaga and got them quickly.</li>
    <li> I am extremely please with my purchase! They are incredibly gorgeous!!!!!!! They actually look like your natural nail to be perfectly honest with you</li>
    <li> Great! Has many different sizes for anyone&#x27;s nails and come in a nice case! I got them a week after they were ordered.</li>
    <li> I received this in exchange for this review.  I LOVE THIS ITEM.  Its a box of plastic tips, and they are in every common/popular size. They are consistent in size and shape from one to another (for each size) and there is a good selection.  They glue on, and fill with acrylic and look perfect--if you are patient and take your time, you will get the hang of it.  You need to get some glue, and some acrylic filler, a few nail files, and buffing stick.  Then--you can have 50$ french tips for the cost of a cup of coffee.</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on the pictures others shared, I am going to guess mine came from a different manufacturer.  The nails I received were a lot longer!  They also had a small thin piece of plastic at the tip, most likely from where they were separated which had to be filed off.  I filed that off, but also filed these down to a more reasonable length.  They are easy to file and shape, but also seem very durable.  I used KISS nail glue for mine.</li>
    <li> Ecbasket Hot 500 Pcs 10 Sizes Natural Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These look very nice when you get them on and paint them they are not too long or too short. They were easy to apply and doodle on with polish and the polish dried very quick.  I am lucky enough to have received this item at a discount for my honest review and I am so glad I did</li>
    <li> Loved these nails! Having to create your own stiletto nails can be pretty difficult for the average person so when these came in the mail pre cut and shaped I was so happy! Doesn&#x27;t come with nail glue or a file but the nails are amazing! Love them so much!</li>
    <li> I did have an issue with the SIZE 0 being too small, but managed to fix it.</li>
    <li> Love them! They&#x27;re a little long but they file easily! They look great and I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> I actually received mine 2 weeks sooner than estimated. The nails look great and are perfect for my wider than average nail bed - usually hit or miss for me when I purchase online. The thumbs are normally too small - especially in kits I get from overseas.  I also got a free gift - stickers for painting on french tips! Overall I am very happy with this product and will order again (despite being spoiled on shipping by Prime!)</li>
    <li> Got it and so far it looks good. Good quality nails and its shaped perfectly.  Only issue I have is that alot of the nails dont quit fit my nails perfectly but I can work around that.  Other than that, it came in the nice see through case as seen in the picture.  Also, another thing I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised about is that my expected delivery (from Etopsell) was suppose to be over a month away, but I ended up getting it 9 DAYS after I ordered it.  WOW service and I may order some more. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;m in love with these nails! I finally tried them on and I am just purely amazed how beautiful they look and I hardly had to do any filing. Because of that, I changed my remove from 4 star to 5 star.  I also uploaded pictures.</li>
