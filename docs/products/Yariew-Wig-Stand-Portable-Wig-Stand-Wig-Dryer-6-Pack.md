<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have the normal wig stands, saw these and decided to give them a try.  They are fantastic. Light weight and sturdy, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Good seller. Product great, as described. Good ship time</li>
    <li> These wig stands are made of a rubber type plastic not thin plastic which surprised me and I washed wigs that were in a drawer for 21 years and placed them on the stands to dry, and they were dry this morning.  They were very easy to snap together and since I have six wigs I&#x27;m glad I purchased these over metal stands.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and sturdy, way better than the foam heads.  Packaging is not in English, but they provide pictures of how to put the stands together.  They work great. I will probably buy another set sometime soon.</li>
    <li> Got here much faster than expect. Will make great hat rack</li>
    <li> they work great! i just need to order more now:) my wig collection is getting to big:)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these affordable and functional wig stands.  They were very easy to put together, and are great for displaying my wigs!</li>
    <li> As flimsy as they look, these wig stands hold up quit well.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived pretty quick. I ordered them two days ago and they came in today,&lt;br /&gt;Come with exactly 6 stands.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> I usually pay $7 EACH for these stands.  These were much more inexpensive and better quality.  And they came FAST.</li>
    <li> These are very lightweight, easy to put together or take apart, &amp; if you&#x27;re looking for a simple/inexpensive wig stand solution, they will probably fit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You can&#x27;t easily style wigs on these unless you do some movie magic to keep the wig on the stand &amp; the stand on the table (or whatever).</li>
    <li> This is a really great wig stand. I am very pleased with them and I have purchased many that break jusy putting them together!!</li>
    <li> The wig holder is good, the only problem is that it took me a little bit to get one of them together but once i did one it was easier to do the rest of them :P&lt;br /&gt;i just hold they will hold my long wigs that im getting soon, because that was the whole reason why i got the stands..&lt;br /&gt;anyway, the stands are good</li>
    <li> These are AWESOME. Replacing foam heads forever!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase, because most of my wigs are short or medium length. If I had a number of large wigs, I would have been displeased because these wig stands seem to tip quite easily if much weight is added. They did go together easily, but I felt as though it would be quite easy to break them if you were not gentle. That said, 6 wig stands for $9 with free shipping is basically a steal, so I&#x27;m glad I snagged them for my shorter wigs.</li>
    <li> Great product, easily stored. The only complaint I have is that it tips over easily.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together and holds my wigs perfectly</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Decent, affordable, not beautifully designed but does the trick, and highly portable.</li>
    <li> Great for my husband&#x27;s hairpieces.</li>
    <li> So much better than foam heads! Great for travel and storage. Get them! You won&#x27;t regret it and your wigs will look better.</li>
    <li> I used these as hat stands on the top shelf of my closet and they worked perfectly. . . they also worked as &#x27;Portals&#x27; in a 24 hours play festival so, with a little creativity they are very versatile. ;-)</li>
    <li> We were looking for something that would look good on a shelf to display vintage hats. While these might not have the punch of a full wig head, they&#x27;re an inexpensive option and work quite well.</li>
    <li> They arrived promptly, and although they had to be put together, within a minute or two I had a routine down and was able to put 12 together quickly. Beware a wife with lots of hats.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. It popped together easily and i was able to use it while giving my wig a shampoo</li>
    <li> These are amazing. We have a lot of wigs for our performing arts studio. These are easy to assemble, they hold all sizes of wigs and are stable.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose just fine for hats and a wig.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy at all, falls over easily.</li>
    <li> Not much stability here.  Needs to stand quite alone and have to hold stand to get wig off.  Top piece doesn&#x27;t want to stay on.  However, for a cheap wig stand it works.  Serves its purpose, keep wig clear, clean, etc.</li>
    <li> Not to cheap material wise, but it has helped to keep me from packing my wigs flat. These let the wigs fall naturally so they retain their shape better. a GREAT investment for cosplayers.</li>
    <li> works great for my new collection of wigs.</li>
    <li> they are really light and dont hold up wigs with long hair very well.</li>
    <li> Good product to hold my wigs collection. But one of 6 pcs packed was broken in shipping. That is the reason I put 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These got here right on time and are perfect for my shorter wigs, i have all six of them chillin on a shelf looking fabulous. They were simple to put together, and hold up rather nicely, i will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Just started using wigs and I love these stands.</li>
    <li> these were perfect for displaying the hats I make.  I love that when I am teaching a class they fold down flat for transport and then go together fast.</li>
    <li> These are great alternatives for the more expensive wig heads.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect low cost way for me to display all my wigs. and they&#x27;re great for packing!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a couple of wigs (obviously) and they arrived quickly. I was surprised that the plastic was thicker, and not the type of plastic that cracks or breaks in half if it&#x27;s slightly bent. They were super easy to put together, all the pieces were smooth and fit perfectly together, and most importantly they all sit evenly at the base. This was a great price for six.</li>
    <li> They do the job but it&#x27;s a little early to tell if they will workout long term.  So far - so good!</li>
    <li> These wig stands are excellent!  They are light and compact for storage.  I recommend these stands.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have had resorted to owning numerous wigs due to alopecia and these stands are great storage option. Doesnt eat space while not in use. What&#x27;s more, set up is a breeze and it works perfectly. Far better than a styrofoam head, that&#x27;s a fact</li>
    <li> Very useful for drying wigs or storing wigs when not in use.  Light weight and collapsible.  Easy to set up and great price.</li>
    <li> fantastic for the price, just the same as the other plastic stands ive got but less expensive!</li>
    <li> Good quality plastic use for well made stands. These snap together and don&#x27;t fall apart with a wig or hat on top. Makes a good drying stand after shampooing. Not so good for styling. a full manequin head is really needed for that. Stands steady in a flat surface with a wig attached. Recommend.</li>
    <li> They are just cheap pieces of plastic that snaps together. Didn&#x27;t expect any thing more. Even though they are only plastic the are pretty sturdy, and kind of oval shaped.</li>
    <li> I love these stands, they don&#x27;t hold long heavy wigs well but they are useful and good deal for good product.</li>
    <li> I like these stands but disappointed that 1 of the 6 was missing a part. Not worth hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> These stands arrived really quickly. I am very happy with the timing. These stands come in a six-pack and are much better to keep and dry your wigs on than the styrofoam ones. They don&#x27;t fall over so easily. This is my second time ordering these stands because I have a lot of wigs.</li>
    <li> Instead of black I received white. Oh well, it still works despite being the wrong color, so no harm done.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do. No complaints</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and were well packed and look pretty sturdy for a bunch of plastic hoops. My wigs fit on them easily, so i would recommend these.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do.  Easy to travel with and allow your wigs to air dry properly. Nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> I was paying up to $7 a each for these then thought I hit the jack pot when I found these.</li>
    <li> It was delivered pretty quick, easy to put together, &amp; I&#x27;m going to buy some more, but one had the same two pieces &amp; doesn&#x27;t  work. The top falls off easily and it it falls off every time I take a wig off, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in these especially because I spent a lot of money and got a lot of them! &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This is great! The only downside to this is that it tips over if you have wigs that has long hair...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM!!!! I had a lot of wigs, resting on old broken lamps. These were easy to assemble, came extremly quick too!! a lot sooner than it said. but i love them!! they dont fall over, keeps a nice head shape to the wig, and they look very professinal. No problems at all. They&#x27;re not good for styling but As a cosplayer, i hightly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> as a traveling model I love these. I don&#x27;t have enough room in my suitcase for Styrofoam heads, but these lie flat and take up very little space so I can shape my wigs when I arrive at shoots or hotels. very easy to put together and take apart and they hold the wigs very nicely.</li>
    <li> These are great for drying on &amp;#34;wig wash day&amp;#34;  They are not really sturdy, but they work well.  They are also nice for travel, as they fold flat.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> these are totally perfect for wigs, hats, etc, easy to put together and fairly sturdy for how lightweight they are, great price, i love em</li>
    <li> They work. They&#x27;re not fancy, or sturdy but there are six of them. For this price I&#x27;d buy again. Boom.</li>
    <li> I wear wigs everyday. I had been having trouble getting them hung up since most hooks wouldn&#x27;t do. These stands, solved my problem perfectly. I can put my wigs on them when I am not wearing them, when I have washed them and they need to dry. These are just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great price and sturdier than any I have bought in the past. Excellent base, easy to put together and hold together better than others. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and durable for my many cosplay wigs.  They stand up without wobbling over and can take the weight of my heaviest wigs.</li>
    <li> I cosplay and this is perfect for me to use at cons</li>
    <li> Prefect for wig storage.  My wigs now maintain their shape and do not get as tangled.</li>
    <li> These are simple, light-weight, easy to use wig stands. They fold flat in case you need to travel with a wig. They also work for most hats.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would need 6 wig stands, but I quickly realized I like to keep a about 3 wigs ready, and I needed 1 stand to place my wig on at night, 1 to dry another with, and 1 stand available for travel.&lt;br /&gt;These are also easy to put together, don&#x27;t tip over and the plastic seems to heavy duty enough to last. You obviously cannot style your wig on these as the stands won&#x27;t keep it from slipping off if you tried, however for keeping a wig at hand, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly one of those purchases that you did not know you needed until you got it.</li>
    <li> They are convenient to have, but they tip over a lot, which can be annoying. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them if you have a lot of long wigs, like I do.</li>
    <li> I have a number of different wigs now that I&#x27;ve lost my hair to chemo so I bought these stands to store them without the hair getting knotted or frizzed. These are perfect for that job. The stands are a bit too light weight to use for stying the wigs...I need to switch to a sturdier foam head for that...but to just store or dry a wig, these work like a charm. So easy to assemble, and they take up nearly no space when disassembled it&#x27;ll be easy to tuck them away once I don&#x27;t need to keeps wigs at the ready anymore. Great product!</li>
    <li> theyre really light and they fall over easily but otherwise a great product</li>
    <li> They are a good value.  I bought this type instead of the styrofoam because they can be taken apart in less than a minute for packing in case I don&#x27;t need them all open, or for a trip.  The styrofoam take up a lot of space if they are sitting empty or being packing in luggage.  I find that they tip over more easily than the styrofoam type though, and they provide a little less support under the wig because there is just a plastic frame rather than a solid structure.</li>
    <li> Great wig stands. Keep my wigs just like when I first rec&#x27;d them Great portable wig stands and for keeping them nice</li>
    <li> Wig heads get expensive when the only need is to keep your wigs from lying flat! These do the job!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  I would highly recommend purchasing this merchandise for the price.  It&#x27;s not expensive when you get six in a pack.</li>
    <li> The wig stands are easy to assemble and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  They can be taken apart and small enough to take with you while traveling.  I love it and I am ordering some for Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> I paid $13 for 6 wig stands, as described and I received 1, 1 bloody wig stand. I am NOT happy at all.</li>
    <li> We built a rack and displayed knitted hats with matching scraves wrapped around the bottom the wig stands.. It was very professional. They are very easy to assemble and disassemble., folds flat and easy to store.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and sturdy....will buy more</li>
    <li> These are a little flimsy and unbalanced, but they work well for my wig collection. My longer wigs, of course, wind up with the hair just piled around the bottom of these. I&#x27;ll likely invest into some taller stands for those as I don&#x27;t care to have them bunched up like that (which is just a personal preference and not reflective of the product itself). Assembly was easy and intuitive even though the package instructions were confusing drawings.</li>
    <li> Nice product....very lightweight.  The wig stands are easy to put together but they are very light weight and easily tip over.</li>
    <li> Received as described.  Good product for a good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Extremely handy and sturdy. Great stuff the old lady loved em and need to purchase more. Thx you guys . Lol</li>
    <li> These are very handy, easy to assemble and firm enough to hold even a heavy wig.  Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Anyone who cosplays I highly suggest own these. They hold even the heaviest ponytail wigs and long length wigs. They&#x27;re plastic and lightweight and super easy to take apart and put together. Saves room in suitcases and really easy to take to cons and travel with!!</li>
    <li> Stand is very portable.</li>
    <li> Filsbey... Somewhat easy to chip but they work.</li>
    <li> I used 3 of these for my theatrical wigs during a production.  They were handy since they fold up and are easy to pack away.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Seemed okay for the price, broke two trying to put them together. For the price it seems okay we use them for wigs.</li>
    <li> For the purposes of a place to keep your wig, it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s especially great for air drying but if you&#x27;re going to put it on the stand fresh out of the water, keep it in the sink until it&#x27;s not as heavy anymore. As sturdy as these can be, they have their moments where they can be kind of weeble wobbly lol For styling, I&#x27;d suggest an actual mannequin head because again...weeble wobble. Other than that, very simple design and does exactly what it is supposed to. No complaints :-)</li>
    <li> I ordered these wig stands because lately I&#x27;ve been ordering a lot of wigs and the foam heads I was buying were expensive. These are inexpensive, sturdy, and you get 6 of them! Good quality and easy to put together. A tad flimsy but they&#x27;re just for holding up my wigs! For less than $15? Yes, please! Also, they&#x27;re good to use when styling wigs as well and they dismantle easily for storage.</li>
    <li> Cheap wig stands that can be packed up with out taking up a lot of room. Not bad.</li>
    <li> There were no instructions on how to snap the 3 pieces together, but if you can&#x27;t figure out a 3 piece puzzle... Anyway, they hold short hair wigs and hats as long as you keep the center of gravity mostly centered. I plan on painting them white, hot going some LEDs in and covering with cheese cloth for Halloween ghosts. A few of the small clips were broken off of the small ring, but I don&#x27;t see that as being too much of an issue for my purposes. I&#x27;m going to see how my decorating goes and if I like the look, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> Got these for my youngest. The are perfect - helps hold the shape of the wigs and allows for them to air out also.</li>
    <li> I love these, they work great for hats, veils as well as wigs. They are much easier to transport than Styrofoam heads.</li>
    <li> Just what the maker says. Simple, yet fairly durable. It works quite well to not only display the wig, but also is open enough to use as a final stage dryer. Would recommend this to anyone over a styrofoam head to keep the wig aired out between uses.</li>
    <li> this is great for hair. It works better than buying a head to hold the hair on. It came in a pack of 6 and that is great. the price was great. for 1 it&#x27;s a lot more. They came in good condition and the delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Teresa</li>
    <li> The stands are easy to put together and sturdy. Great value being a pack of six. Does not scratch my furniture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent price for the quantity</li>
    <li> Really like these wig stands! They are better than the foam heads and allow the wig to breathe. They assemble and disassemble quickly making them great for travel. Great purchase</li>
    <li> I had the old fashioned styrofoam heads from years ago, but these are so much better because the wigs can dry out easily after washing and air out between washings! These are sturdy, hold all my wigs well - long and short! Because I love wigs so much after several hair coloring (mis)adventures I&#x27;m sticking to these. I&#x27;ve used up 6 already, just about time for another batch! :) These are worth it.</li>
    <li> Good price holding up well to use.  Nothing to heavy used on them yet . Display well and fold flat for great storage in small places.</li>
    <li> I cosplay regularly and have multiple wigs that I don&#x27;t like to stuff in bags. Since I don&#x27;t need to style them, just display them and let them air out, these wig stands are ideal. They display the wigs wonderfully and are surprisingly sturdy for plastic. They shouldn&#x27;t be used for trying to style a wig, but definitely great for displaying/drying/airing out a wig.</li>
    <li> These wig stands are simple and work.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for lace-fronts because they might distort, over time, the lace front, but for other wigs they work great.  They come in three pieces.  You simply turn the two big pieces diagonal to each other and then snap them together, and then snap  the circle on top of them.  They support wigs well and work for what they&#x27;re made for just fine.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because between myself and my daughter we have a lot of wigs for cosplay.  They are fantastic and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but they work fine. May require adding weight to the bottoms to prevent them tipping over with longer/heavier wigs.</li>
    <li> Works great. Thank very much!!</li>
    <li> they ok... didnt know what to exspect. theyre really flimsy and somtime the top part comes off blah blah blah</li>
    <li> These stands are ok. I was hoping to use them while traveling to cons to style our wigs. The biggest problem with them is that they slide across the table and tip over :( I am going to try to put some type of rubberized feet on them. Maybe I can figure out a way to clamp it to the edge of a table, that would be useful! It is nice that they fold down for travel.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly! These stands assemble and break down easily for travel. The top ring does come off on occasion but a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> great deal for the price, easy to set up, stands up well, easy to store, easy to pack ! !</li>
    <li> Not quite as sturdy as I had hoped, but easy to put together and they work well.  If you have longer hair wigs, you may need to wrap the hair around the bottom.</li>
    <li> Man they got delivered to me like the very Next day.  Now I am able to proudly display all of my wigs. It&#x27;s easy to put together and doesn&#x27;t scare me with the other style wig mannequin like faces when I go in that room. Thankssss</li>
    <li> I knit hats and scarves, and wanted something to use to display them.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The price is right too.  I didn&#x27;t want a styrofoam head to display the hats and scarves (I think they are kind of creepy), and they are more than I wanted to spend.  These come un-assembled but are very easy to put together and they lay pretty flat when you want to store them.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together, very portable. An excellent wig stand for someone who only needs one once in a while or someone who needs them all the time. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> About the only thing good I can say about this is that it folds away flat when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Work amazing well. The wigs dont fall off them easily</li>
    <li> I bought these wig stands to display hand knit hats in my little shop. They work great! The stands hardly show when the hats are put on them, yet fill out the hats so they show well.</li>
    <li> Daughter does costume play and these were perfect to store her wigs</li>
    <li> It keeps my wigs nice and neat in my closet.</li>
    <li> These stands are great, very light weight, easily to assemble, and serves the purpose it is intended for.  Good purchase...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, they met my expectations to be used as a hat rack for a dinner center piece.</li>
    <li> Takes a minute to figure out connection (pictures only), but simple to put together and surprisingly sturdy.  Can easily take down to pack flat if needed.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Too Tall for our storage cabinet</li>
    <li> Great product.  The plastic is thicker than what I thought it would be,  so that awesome.  I only a short wig and mask on it for now.  I gave four stars because I&#x27;m not sure how it will work with a Long wig.</li>
    <li> Love these forms.  It is a lot easier to put a wig on it than on a Styrofoam head.  It is open and after you wash your wig it is so much easier to dry it on this form than on the Styrofoam one.  It won&#x27;t stretch it out and dries so  much faster!  They are very light weight, but they dont fall over easily.  Easy to put together and takes up less room than the heads.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Plastic black wig stand. They are pretty easy to put together and stand up really well. It was what I needed to keep my wigs from getting crushed. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> So simple to put together! Plastic is thick and sturdy,  holding up my supet heavy wig just fine. GREAT deal for 6 stands, and easy to assemble, disassemble,  and reassemble quickly! Love these! They are also great for letting yoyr wig dry after washing since they let the air get under the cap.</li>
    <li> Great stands, which I think might be even longer than the one in the picture! Great price too. Have not had a problem using them for a few months now. I recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;***Note: These were about 14$ when I bought them. Now they are much more expensive, and I don&#x27;t find that to be a very good deal anymore.</li>
    <li> I guess they work in a pinch but they break really easy.  There are 3 pieces of plastic for each one and they pop out all the time.  The work ok for holding a wig (As long as it isn&#x27;t big and heavy) but don&#x27;t expect to be able to style on it.</li>
    <li> Previously, I had been using styrofoam heads to store my wigs. I didn&#x27;t realize how unnecessarily bulky they were until I received these portable stands. The stands are easy to assemble, and easy to break down for storage. The wigs sit on them as nicely as they would on a styrofoam head -- and the price was great!</li>
    <li> These wig stands work just fine. Hair lost due to Chemo treatment-TOUGH. Seeing all my daughter&#x27;s crazy colored wigs lined up on their display stands-IT HELPS, I don&#x27;t know why, it just does. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a super affordable pack of wig stands that work well in my closet with my collection of wigs.</li>
    <li> Excellent Wig Stands. They definitely served their purpose. Easy to set up, carry around and dismantle. I really love them.</li>
    <li> These are amazing for storing wigs, to keep them in form, without having to have the Styrofoam heads, which are bulky and take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I will be able to easily travel with these. They snap together and apart very easily.</li>
    <li> The six packs come in one package. You have to put it together; it&#x27;s not hard. It&#x27;s very self explanatory. They are a little thin...so don&#x27;t bend it too much when you are putting it together. The stand could hold shoulder-length (and slightly longer) wigs. The reason why I do not like it very much is because of the &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34; on the ring that goes on top of the two fish-shaped parts. The one I ordered had at least one broken ring on each of them. Only one was in great shape. (Look out for them, if you plan to buy the wig stands!) It will work, but I thought it was supposed to be in great condition; it was &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34; And you might want to put &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; on the ends or something. If you put a wig on a stand and try to turn it around (to look at the back of the wig) it will fall over. Anyway, good wig stand. Just be cautious.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more wig stands. Thanks</li>
    <li> These arrived intact and work as advertised. I would purchase from this vender again and would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> It falls apart to easily. I&#x27;m tired of always putting it back together.</li>
    <li> OMG the directions were all in asian symbols! I assume Chinese. Picture directions were worthless as well. Good news is that it is pretty self explanatory on how to fit three pieces together. Plastic pieces but held up nicely. We used 4 for my daughters wig collection and one for a heavy wide brim derby day hat. Little wobbly on the heavy hat but works well for the price.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that they dry the wig quicker...I would not have given this product 3 stars.  The traditional stands are still better because the keep the shape of the wig.</li>
    <li> I needed an inexpensive way to control more than 20 wigs for our high school production of Tarzan.  These are smaller than the traditional foam wig stands and less expensive.  After the show, I was able to pack them flat for future use - a plus.</li>
    <li> Use all the time for my hat n hair wigs holds n place while combing or stlyeing. want too buy more.great for me to use</li>
    <li> These are perfect. The plastic is sturdy but still a bit flexible. They shipped in 2 days when I was told 5-7 days. Would definitely order again if I buy more wigs.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stand up very well, don&#x27;t easily snap into place but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Does not come with assembly directions I am going to see how they hold up and tell you later.</li>
    <li> Product works really well, very sturdy! Comes with six for six separate wigs. They come in separate bags where you have to build them yourself (which is fairly easy). Otherwise it does come with pictured directions on how to make them. They&#x27;re also fairly tall which is great for longer wigs. Ive seen wig stands sit really low and for some reason that bothered me. Guess it&#x27;s just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars, because one of my stands is missing an essential piece. (A round ring that holds the wig) So I technically got only 5 which is annoying.</li>
    <li> I actually really like these stands.  They&#x27;re cheap, easy to put together, and serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> These black wig stands are high quality and have been a great find for me.  I have already bought 48 of them, and none of them has been defective.  Not only are they are easy to assemble, but they cost a lot less, and look much classier than the Styrofoam heads that I was using.</li>
    <li> These work well and are a good value. Easy to put together for the most part. And relatively stable for plastic.</li>
    <li> I actually use these as hat holders.  I make hats for babies on up to adults and these are perfect!  I can adjust them enough to make them hold a small hat or use it full size for the larger hats.  I also like that they come in a 6 pack so I can display multiple hats at once.  Got them for a great price too.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay together very well but they do there job</li>
    <li> Simple wig stands, and very easy to set up! You just slide the pieces together.</li>
    <li> These stands are a good cheaper option to a wig head. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like were the Chinese instructions (not that they&#x27;re needed much)</li>
    <li> The are very light weight and fold up for storage.  The hold the wig with no issues.  Very pleased.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good price for the set.  They work well, I have no complaints.  I actually like them better than what the store sold.</li>
    <li> The wig stands are just great! They are easy to set up and hold my wigs perfectly. They are just as pictured so if you have a longer wig than the Hot Fashion Medium Long Hair Wig Chestnut Color with Oblique Bangs Women WIG Girls Hair WIG, they&#x27;ll be laying on the surface where the stand is standing. They arrived by the expected arrival date and I recommend to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> These pieces are better then I expected because, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price.  They hold my knitted hats and show a scarf wrapped around the bottom nicely with out much chance of being tipped over.</li>
    <li> These work well and are easy to set up, take down and reassemble. Paid 8 dollars for one locally, but then found this offer of 6 for 10 dollars. would defiantly buy here again.</li>
    <li> Pros: Inexpensive, easy to assemble, portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No English instructions, flimsy, prone to falling with long wigs, useless for styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m rating these a three is because they&#x27;re so inexpensive. You really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, I noticed there weren&#x27;t any assembly instructions. There&#x27;s a pictorial on the side with instructions written in Korean(?). It&#x27;s fairly easy to figure out how to put them together if you look at what the end product is supposed to be. The plastic is cheap and thin, so be careful while assembling them so you don&#x27;t accidentally snap one, since you do have to apply a bit of pressure to get them to snap into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried taking one apart, so I don&#x27;t know how easy it is, but they do disassemble to flat pieces and would be very easy to store or pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY DO NOT SUPPORT LONG WIGS! AT ALL! EVEN SLIGHTLY! They fall over instantly, without even a moment of false hope that it miiiiight stay up. Considering that all but one of my wigs are longer than shoulder length, they&#x27;re pretty much useless to me. I&#x27;ll probably glue the bottoms to blocks of heavy wood (lumber scraps are really cheap and easy to find around my city) to solve the tipping problem, but that will negate their portability completely. And because they tip so easy, you can&#x27;t use them to brush out or style your wigs without holding the base still (and one handed styling is pretty much impossible), because the force of the brush running through the wig pulls it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: These are good if you have a lot of short wigs you need forms for. If you have anything longer than chin-to-shoulder length, PASS.</li>
    <li> they work really good</li>
    <li> I just started wearing wigs (tired of doing my hair) and needed wig stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned these are flimsy and fall over very very easily.  I ended up hot gluing marbles to them to give them weight, and a little decor, and that solved the problem.</li>
    <li> Works, worth the price</li>
    <li> It came a day earlier than expected and it was awesome! it was very simple to assemble and my wigs rested nicely on the wig stands. for six of these the price is very cheap and i will definitely be buying these again in the future :D</li>
    <li> I use the product to hold hats.  I have previously purchased in black . Tried to buy more. Got pink. Have returned. Don&#x27;t know how credits, shipping costs, and resend will work out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for storing my vintage hats!</li>
    <li> Excellent, easy to put together</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was tired of just tossing my cosplay wigs on the closet shelf. I have a very short curly wig and a long straight haired wig right now on the stands.They are really easy to put together. The directions aren&#x27;t in English, but honestly you shouldn&#x27;t need them anyway. They just snap together and it&#x27;s common sense once you get them out of the package and look at the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I used them for my short wig as well as my long wig. As long as you put the stand where the longer wigs aren&#x27;t hanging off the edge of a shelf (i.e.; gravity) they will work for any length. I have a long wig on them with the rest laid out flat behind it and the stand isn&#x27;t toppling over. It does the job it was meant to do, nothing fancy, but definitely handy for traveling with the wigs. For the price though, I wouldn&#x27;t trade them for anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It holds my wigs and hats very nicely, even my long wigs.  They take up a bit less room then the styrafoam heads.  I ordered two sets and will order another one and some for my daughter.  They sit higher then styrafoam heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has wigs or hats.</li>
    <li> These are cheap but okay.  They move around if you press to hard on them.  Serve the purpose and space savers.  Don&#x27;t need anymore.</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed for a craft fair! Arrived in plenty of time.</li>
    <li> These are great! The hold your wigs shape without taking up a lot of space, when you don&#x27;t need them. I highly recommend these for anyone that is concerned about space.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They were exactly what I was looking for. They aren&#x27;t anything fancy, but for the cost I didn&#x27;t expect anything fancy. They are plastic and comes in two pieces that you fit together. I have numerous styled wigs on them and they all fit very nicely on the wig stands. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and put together. When they are not in use, they come apart and can lay in drawer without taking up to much space.</li>
    <li> I need to order more . Love these . Keeps my wigs organized</li>
    <li> very easy to put together will order more</li>
    <li> My daughter says &amp;#34;they are the bomb&amp;#34;. How can I complain with that!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the wig stands. I used them for a hat and heel event to hold the hats on so they were great to use.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, are as described and do the job.  They were a &#x27;flat&#x27; package, but assembled easily and are stable enough to use for wigs and hats.  As would be expected, they will &#x27;tip&#x27; if shoved but are stable overall.  Very pleased with both purchase and seller</li>
    <li> These wig stands are very sturdy and get the job done perfectly. They help me keep my wigs organized and from getting messed up. A great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set, cost, quality, amount.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of space to spare for a bunch of wig heads. These are wonderful and perfect for drying my wigs after a wash. I love that they collapse.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together but don&#x27;t expect this to be a replacement for a foam wig head. This product is good for storing wigs and drying them but NOT styling. They slip off because you can&#x27;t pin them down. Even when in storage if you bump the head of the shelf with the head the wig will fall off. I would buy again for storage but would go with a Styrofoam wig head for styling needs and wigs that need securing.</li>
    <li> Works well and it is cheap!</li>
    <li> They do not balance well with longer wigs. You get what you pay for. It does work good with shorter wig but it still falls over easily.</li>
    <li> I have looking for affortable wig stands for a long time.  These fit the bill .  Glad I foujnd them</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and these stands are awesome for packing. Once my trip is over, I can easily store my wigs and the stands lay flat again</li>
    <li> Wonderful and utterly portable and excellent price!  They break down in a jiffy and travel flat.</li>
    <li> Good, but not great. I wish the stands were a little more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Wig heads take up a lot of room but these wig stands work for conserving space. Really good purchase. I appreciate that the company saw that I only got 1 &amp; cared enough to send the other 5, when they found out.</li>
    <li> Perfect size compact and sturdy</li>
    <li> great product for displaying hats on at shows easy to pack and travel with and very inexpensive. I love these!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sending her different wigs from Japan &amp; she needed more stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved these, she said that shes never seen any like this before; the setup was easy and it was a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;I will def order again if she has a wig overload!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for wigs, keeps them sturdy, does not tip over, and easy to assemble.  Will definitely be purschasing more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I live in a small apartment, I don&#x27;t have to room for the wig heads. These work well in drying and storing away flat. they are fairly solid when standing had are easy to put together.</li>
    <li> I have a four month old who decided to grab hold of one I had put together right out of the package just to see how they looked. He then did his baby hulk smash with it and unlike others I&#x27;ve seen it didn&#x27;t just fall apart. The ring around the top makes them sturdier if you&#x27;re styling a wig on it. I&#x27;ve seen some with just the two sides and no top ring and they&#x27;re pretty useless. Love these.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very long to put together and it stays put and holds up the wigs just fine. I put mine up pretty high with 120cm wigs and it doesn&#x27;t want to stay since it&#x27;s so heavy. It&#x27;ll tilt to which ever side has most hair and falls over but I just balanced it out and made it work. Each stand was in their separate bag. When I got it though I got 5 1/2 instead of 6. My fifth one didn&#x27;t have a ring but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
    <li> Fairly sturdy, easy to put together and really inexpensive. We use it to hold our Mickey ears from Disney.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy these were cheap. I went to put my wig on the stand and the first thing it did was slide off -_- not happy. you have to place your wig on the stand just right or it ends up falling right off the stand. I ended up putting a towel on the stand to give it more grip to hold my wig on. It will work for now, but I mainly wanted this so I could put my wig on it while trying to style it. Not sure if that will work out, but it does display it nicely.</li>
    <li> MUCH STURDIER THAN THEY LOOK. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to figure out how they are put together, but well worth the price!</li>
    <li> They tip over, but for the price, they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> Love love love these portable wig stands. I have been telling all of my friends about them. They are very easy to set up and break down. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> I really like these wig stands because they snap together quickly,, are affordable, and you can style. wash to dry, or trim your wig on this stand.  Great product storing all my wigs!</li>
    <li> These are great for keeping your wigs on. As someone who cosplays, they are a great way to keep your styled wigs looking good and not being squished.</li>
    <li> These are currently in use as display stands for our top hats and they look very sharp.  Quite easy to put together and they seem fairly durable.</li>
    <li> Great for storing my collection of hats. I love how they allow air flow around the hat. Storage is easy as they fold up flat.</li>
    <li> thank you for making something I can use that breaks down for my craft shows.  I Have already gotten several questions from friends wanting to know where I got them.  Awesome.....</li>
    <li> I own so many hair accessories.  I have spent a small fortune purchasing more costly wig stands that did not last long.  I like these because the material is much more pliable and it is only two pieces per stand not the 3 or 4 as some of the others.  These are sturdy enough to how a damp wig and even hold it while you are using a blow drying (low heat setting) to fluff up the hairs of a new wigs.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. These wig stands are much better quality than others I have purchased. They are tall enough for mid-length wigs and sturdier. They can be quickly taken apart for travel. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that these stands are narrower than the traditional Styrofoam heads so I can fit more wigs on a shelf. They&#x27;re fairly sturdy and won&#x27;t come apart easily. Definitely better for drying wigs also. I love them.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews about not using these for longer-haired wigs.  The aside, these are cheap and GREAT for the medium-length wigs that I have!  I have a couple masks that I store on these as well and they work great.  I will end up purchasing another pack of 6 at some point.</li>
    <li> I bought this 6-pack for my daughter who does amateur acting and has a lot of wigs. Product arrived quickly, well packaged, and perfect for her needs. Now she can store each wig properly, instead of them lying in  a heap in her room. Each stand is very light weight, so it is easy to transport the wig and the stand together when she goes off to her shows. They also stand up well, in spite of being light weight. And the price is perfect, really low for so many stands!</li>
    <li> These are amazing and work for all my wigs. :)</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that these come six to a pack and are less expensive.  These are average size and are great for airing out/drying wigs.  They could be a bit sturdier, though, as they come apart at the top--I wish they would snap together.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic but does the job</li>
    <li> I use these to organize my wigs, winter hats, caps and turbans.</li>
    <li> These fall over REALLY easily, however, they are cheap, and they work alright for short wigs.</li>
    <li> I like these.  The face stands creep me out so these are great and work well as I am drying my hair.  I would definitely buy more if needed.</li>
    <li> I will have a total of 10 wigs soon and this really helps me keep my wigs from getting thrown around. my wigs are long and I thought would weigh down and knock over the stands but they&#x27;re pretty stable.</li>
    <li> The stands came three days earlier than expected, I was surprised at the speed they were delivered at. It&#x27;s easily assembled despite the assembly instructions not being in English. They&#x27;re very strudy and my sister is overjoyed to finally have a place to put all her wigs. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these when the need arises.</li>
    <li> This set is so nice if you are starting a wig collection. It will keep them propped up, but don&#x27;t expect to be able to style your wig. This is merely a placeholder. This is a great buy for anyone trying to organize wigs.</li>
    <li> Five of the wig stands had the same cut pieces.  So was unable to use them at all.. Other than that they was ok</li>
    <li> I got these wig stands because after some research I decided that they were a bit sturdier than foam and more portable. They aren&#x27;t as stable as a foam head, however once everything is popped into place you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling apart on you. They are a bit difficult to weight so that they don&#x27;t fall over but for me it wasn&#x27;t really a problem once you got used to it and I think that this would be the case for any wig stand. They aren&#x27;t very tall though so for my long wigs I placed them on a shelf so the hair could fall naturally. Would buy again! Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Yes. They do the job and are as described. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Each wig stand came individually wrapped, and packed flat. They were easy to assemble, and can be disassembled quickly for traveling or conventions. These lightweight plastic stands work wonderfully for displaying hats as well.</li>
    <li> The racks arrived rather quickly.  2 days. They are larger (longer) than expected....but that&#x27;s good. They are very sturdy for the price. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Came within 2 days as promised with prime. Opened to find 6 indivually wrapped dismantled wigstands with instructions. unfortunately the instructions were in Korean and Chinese Mandarin. Good news is I knew enough Japanese kanji and am not an idiot so once I figured out which one was the &amp;#34;bottom one&amp;#34; and which one was the &amp;#34;Top&amp;#34; It was pretty easy to put together. My wigs fit just fine on them and they don&#x27;t feel fragile or easily worn. good buy and definite good bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> They are easy to assemble and fairly sturdy, though i could see some potential balance issues. Better keep these someplace away from pets, or on really flat high surfaces. If you have longer wigs, I would suggest going to an actual foam head and using a plunger to mount them on--these are kinda short. They still do the trick.</li>
    <li> They were of good quality plastic and every easy to assemble. It was a great helop in organizing my closet. They&#x27;re all lined up, wearing my hats, along the top shelf.</li>
    <li> they are wonderful to display hats too...</li>
    <li> What I&#x27;m really going to use these for is the craft fair. I have been crocheting hats and was looking for a way to display them.  Click, click and there they are.  And they are very stable. Caft fair here we come.....all six stands will be used for the table display.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate a full 5 stars because like so many other people have mentioned, one of the stands had the circle deal missing that holds it together.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why they sold 6 in a pack but after they arrived I saw why. Although they are very flemsy looking they get the job done. The first one was difficult to put together as the instructions are in another language and the pictures aren&#x27;t clear. But once you get the first one done - the rest are easy.</li>
    <li> great for all my many different wigs weights love them need to order more don&#x27;t need none of those creepy faces hanging around one is great but i owen 10 + wigs and I  don&#x27;t want 10 faces and 20 eyes starring back at me when i sleep :)</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Just as described. They&#x27;re very portable and light. Easy to put together. Great deal. I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> Took a while since it&#x27;s from China but product was exactly as described. Works well and as expected. Good price.</li>
    <li> Living in AZ, I have a large collection of sun hats.  When stacked on the closet shelf, they get bent and out of shape.  Using the wig stands they are much better.  Stands are a bit &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; and sometimes come apart when moved, but still work when reassembled.</li>
    <li> Very easy for my daughter to put up and take down when she takes her wigs to conventions she did have the polystyrene heads but they were bulky and always fell over so when she saw these she asked me to get them for her and they work really well they havent fallen over yet so that is good many thanks</li>
    <li> I will most definitely be ordering these again (I kind of have a wig obsession). These arrived on time and packed with care. They are all lightweight, easy to pack, and great for everyday use, but also great to travel to conventions with. The only problem they have is that sometimes they fall over when a wig is on it a certain way, but you just have to take it off, turn the stand a different direction, and replace the wig on it. I&#x27;ve been using this kind for about a year and it&#x27;s maintained even my heaviest&#x27; wig&#x27;s shape. And if you are new to wig stands I&#x27;d like to point out that I&#x27;ve stepped on these before without breaking them (oops), so they&#x27;re pretty durable for me at least.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not the sturdiest of wig stands. I have a lot of wigs so wanted something inexpensive. Does the job but for heavier wigs they seem to fall easily if slightly moved.</li>
    <li> This product will prove quite useful when the time comes to wash my wig.  It will also prove useful if and when I get more wigs.  My only recommendation would be to have instructions in English printed on the packages.  The illustrations are helpful, but words would be more helpful as I was cautions at first about bending the plastic pieces to fit them together properly.</li>
    <li> This six pack of stands was ideal for me. They are easy to set up and are sturdier than I had expected. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I love this things. I had a bunch of wigs bought for me for Christmas and I didn&#x27;t have stands for any of them, but I don&#x27;t like laying my wigs flat. So these came in handy for me at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can be flimsy but they are great for traveling since they can fold back up. They also aren&#x27;t very useful if you need to style or do maintenance to your wigs since you can&#x27;t easly clip the wig into place. But otherwise they are great for me!</li>
    <li> I love them No I had my way collection altogether on my stand the cool thing about these is you can put them in different directions however you want it is awesome!</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy and can easily hold shorter wigs, I have yet to use these with a heavier or longer wig but I am confident that it will hold the wigs well.</li>
    <li> These always work well for me.</li>
    <li> A little easy to turn over, but functional and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, very affordable and easy to put together!</li>
    <li> These wig stands work perfect for displaying my crocheted and knitted hats. I do craft fairs. The less bulk to haul around the better.&lt;br /&gt;I can even display childrens hats.</li>
    <li> These were presents for my mom and she adores them! She bought three expensive metal ones at the wig shop and liked them just fine until she saw these. f&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stands are super sturdy but still very light weight. Because of the plastic material they are not top heavy like her metal ones. The thicker supports also put less stress on the inner weave of the wigs. They can be disassembled at any time for storage or to take with you on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting them together was soooo easy! The instructions were unfortunately in a language I could neither identify nor read which caused my mother some consternation but I honestly didn&#x27;t even look at them - I just snapped the two pieces together and voila!</li>
    <li> Very easy to put together/simple to figure out. They seem sturdy and they hold even heavy wigs very well. I love the way it&#x27;s set up because they allow me to put my pony-tail clips on, hooking to two of the &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; of the stand. Very pleased, though the package they came in was a little busted up and had tears in the box, but that didn&#x27;t effect the product at all.</li>
    <li> These are some of the first wig stands I have ever owned. I am surprised how nice these are for how little I paid for them. They will be great to pack in to my suitcase for the con.</li>
    <li> The seemed well made and sturdy, legs are a little off so it rocks some but might ne how i snaped them together</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical because the pack of 6 stands were so inexpensive.  I thought they might be flimsy and unsteady.  I am happy  to say these wigs stands are sturdy.  Each stand comes in its own plastic, and they store easily.  They are also really easy to click together and easy to collapse.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. I love the price &amp; I love the fact that each stand was individually wrapped. I am considering giving a few out for a gift to my daughter who purchases wigs online often!</li>
    <li> Love Them! Love Them! Love Them! They&#x27;re easy to put together. My wigs fit nicely on them. And they are so many for a good price. :)</li>
    <li> item as described. arrived promptly. time will tell about the durability.</li>
    <li> These are way too flimsy. .. They can&#x27;t hold long wigs up.. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this type of stand again.</li>
    <li> I had to get these stands because my poor wigs were taking a beating being piled up all over my counter and in my closet. Honestly they make a world of difference for my wigs and they are a lot more stable than they look. I honestly plan on buying more as my wig collection grows. Easy to assemble and honestly, really quite sturdy. I saw some of the reviews and was worried it was going to be brittle plastic but they aren&#x27;t. They also work well for long wigs as I have a 36 inch one and it works perfectly, no anchoring needed.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for all of those! Love it so much wow wow great value and worth for what you pay</li>
    <li> Easily tumbled but for price, is acceptable quality.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, and it fits the wigs ferret to a tee. Nice that I can get it in different colors.</li>
    <li> They arrived in a timely fashion and are of good quality</li>
    <li> Love it...packs very well.</li>
    <li> They are just what I needed. I received these faster than expected!!</li>
    <li> Very nice, easy to setup and use.</li>
    <li> Some of the circular parts that attach to the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of the stand arrived broken. They still fit via tension, the parts are made even, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still able to use them. Average at best.</li>
    <li> Works like a wig dryer-stand-thing for after you wash the wig and as a storage device. Super easy to build and shipment/ delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I have cancer and have about 15 different types of wigs in varying lengths that I wear. for my first 3 wigs I used the traditional wig heads but soon realized that they took up a lot of space and cost a bit of money. I decided to give these a try and I am pleasantly surprised. The cost was very affordable and I received 6 of them. They are collapsible which is a great plus as well, so when they are not in use I just fold them down and store them in my closet on the shelf. I have several long haired wigs so when using them for those I just sit the stand on the edge of the counter so the long hair can fall down the back for easy styling. If you are looking to use these to store long haired wigs I would not recommend it since they are not tall your hair can get messed up. I recommend storing your hair in the net and the original packaging that it came with when not in use and just use this for styling and or washing.</li>
    <li> These are easy to set up and stand on their own ,, my wigs are kept neat and i am pleased with this product, it was a great buy !</li>
    <li> Practically and useful. Easy to put away because of their design.  They work way easier then having big Styrofoam heads that are not  easy to store like the collapsible wig stand</li>
    <li> Came crazy fast, and was exactly as described! :) Very happy with my purchase.  They work great for all my wigs, even my long ones.</li>
    <li> Product was Spot On and has been great for our stage wigs. Order arrived amazingly quick which was perfect. Thank for the awesome service and product!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for -- but for the price, they do the trick.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Very good for storing and/or drying your wig on.</li>
    <li> These are super simple to put together if you just take a moment to look at them - it becomes quickly apparent just how they are meant to snap in place. (My boyfriend wanted to start putting them together as soon as I mentioned the instructions were in Chinese. We each picked one up and had them completed around the same time, though I beat him by a few seconds. ;) ) They work very well for my high-quality wigs! My only critique is that the bases could be a little heavier. Seems a couple of the heavier wigs might topple over if not positioned right. Not a deal-breaker though.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great--exactly as described.  They are steady and hold a wig well.  Good price--happy with jpurchase.</li>
    <li> Product is sturdy and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Be gentle putting it together-you don&#x27;t want the pieces to snap/break.</li>
    <li> sturdy and a great size!</li>
    <li> I have cancer and having chemo made me loose my hair so had to buy some wigs and wanted a variety.  So I went out and bought a few and found these great wig stands, they are light weight and fold flat for traveling!!!  Great price for a six pack! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive way to store your wigs, then these wig stands are an absolute must have!</li>
    <li> These stands are so light that even short wigs pull them over. .They are difficult to put the wigs on and they  cannot remain upright with long haired wigs.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and affordable. They fit the bill for holding my sister&#x27;s wigs safely and securely. When she has more wigs, I will order another set of stands!</li>
    <li> Work great and easy to assemble. I have a bunch of wigs so I intend to buy more. Best for short to mid-length wigs.</li>
    <li> Good buy, does the trick.</li>
    <li> A little more narrow than I had hoped for but these stands are sturdy and a great value.</li>
    <li> It came a day late. But they are so cool. Exactly what I needed for my wigs. I&#x27;ll be getting more wigs and now I have stands for them all. They are very sturdy and fit in my shelf.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried because these were so cheap for 6 stands but they are wonderful. They are simple to snap together and take apart. They even hold my heavier wigs and do not topple over. Great deal!</li>
    <li> The wig stands work well for displaying wigs, however don&#x27;t try styling or brushing your wig on the stand, it is very wobbly and tips over with very little pressure.  But it is a great travel stand.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t for styling in the least. If you want to style a wig you need a foam head and a foam head stand (the ones that are attached to a flat table end work well). You need to pin the wig to the head in order to keep it on. Since these have no place to pin, these obviously weren&#x27;t made to style. They are perfect for keeping your wigs from harm. When drying the wig, it&#x27;d be a good idea to place a towel underneath and away from any thing that is damaged by water. Perfect product for a great price!</li>
    <li> very ade for my needsquate</li>
    <li> Loved it...!!!! Timely manner...looks Great under my wigs.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT! They are portable and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> like that you can take them traveling  Using them to display hats as well I will get more when needed</li>
    <li> These work great for my wigs.</li>
    <li> For the most part. Its cheap, but you get what you pay for. Having to move wigs off the floor is a plus though.</li>
    <li> Not bad a little flimsy, but it works well!</li>
    <li> Great for holding my wigs, without the awkward faces staring at me. And plus, it&#x27;s great for a cosplayer on the move! Comes apart easier and easy to take with you when you need it.</li>
    <li> These wig stands are great. Just what I needed. Easy to put together and use.</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered it. Easy to assemble and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Great bargain for 6 stands. Don&#x27;t bother with styrofoam head!</li>
    <li> Great price for the product</li>
    <li> Out of 12 stands. Two stands did not work because the stand parts were wrong.</li>
    <li> Works well for what I need it for. Fairly sturdy, but they can tip over while brushing if your not holding it. Kinda makes the sides harder to brush, since the edges hit the brush easily. But they are really good for displaying your wigs or just holding them up and keeping them styles when you aren&#x27;t using them.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Cheapest price on amazon or ebay. Standard wig stand, stable, black shiny plastic, ring clips in place. I have 18 so far displaying my wigs. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and is so much better than the white wig heads that everyone gets. If you have a longer wig it tends to me a little more difficult but not impossible.</li>
    <li> I used these to display my crocheted hats at a craft show.  Looked so nice to get some up off the table, and they fold flat for storage.  Considering buying more.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I travel a lot and it&#x27;s been great to have something to put my wigs on. It&#x27;s sturdy and breaks down easy enough to pack away in my carry on.</li>
    <li> This is a great stand.  It does require assembly, but it is very easy to put together.  The wig stand is very versatile, and can be used for hats as well.  I use mine to display my wigs as well as my hats.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are great for people who have a few wigs they own.  If your wear wigs all the time, you might want something a little more durable.</li>
    <li> Sturdy product, however, not good for use with good quality wigs made of full lace or soft cap construction. Finish is not smooth, easily snags and catches items</li>
    <li> These wig stands are great, cost efficent and space savors. on complaints here, i am happy with my purchase and ordered another set!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve seen these wig stands... alllll over amazon... but I got 6 of them for the lowest price ever imaginable.  Prompt service, speedy delivery.  I love them as they fold FLAT for my suitcase for travel!</li>
    <li> I use these heads to dry my hair pieces and I was thrilled to find that there are six heads. They are easy to snap together and take apart.</li>
    <li> Do just what they say.  Though if attempting to set a heavy wig on one you will need to stabilize it.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and surprisingly sturdy.</li>
    <li> Sturdier than I thought they were be, given they&#x27;re plastic but the wigs don&#x27;t topple over so it&#x27;s perfect!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use for my display of hats, thank you. It will do the job I was looking for.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used yet, but it will work for my project</li>
</ol>
