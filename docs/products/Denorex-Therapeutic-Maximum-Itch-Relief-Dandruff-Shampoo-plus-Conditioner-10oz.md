      <li>very fresh and good shampoo</li>
      <li>this stuff is strong!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that it had been reformulated, but it still works for me and works better for than T-Gel.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>Have used this for many years..</li>
      <li>Works better the some shampoos , depending on your condition you need to see a DR.</li>
      <li>It just works better.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo...</li>
      <li>There was a problem with shipping (not vendor&#x27;s fault) but the vendor cleared it up and rectified the situation very quickly upon notification.</li>
      <li>Works just fine and will continue to buy.</li>
      <li>Why isn&#x27;t it available in a 3-ounce size?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure you will convert...</li>
      <li>It lathers up very nicely and you won&#x27;t need to use a conditioner even unless yo have very long hair.</li>
      <li>Thought it was a good product till I read the back of the bottle</li>
      <li>In any case, it&#x27;s the most highly concentrated coal tar shampoo I&#x27;ve found over the years.  </li>

      <li>WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE!!!</li>
      <li>Removed my sever dandruff in just a few uses, however the smell is a bit strong &amp; can be overwhelming.</li>
      <li>my favorite shampoo, the only one that clear my dandruff and stop flaking.</li>
      <li>This item w conditioner combined is the way to go for those w open lesions, so that a non-medicated conditioner doesn&#x27;t have to be used, losing that clean</li>
      <li>Highly recommend both the product and vendor.</li>
      <li>Wish the price would not keep increasing, but was able to get free shipping due to large order of multiple other items.</li>
      <li>The new formulation is different, and comments that it is less effective make sense, since the amount of coal tar has been reduced about 30% and the amount of alcohol reduced by about the same percentage.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure that you don&#x27;t buy the formulation with the red band on the lower half of the box.  </li>
      <li>- didn&#x27;t know you are supposed to without consulting a doctor - so far,</li>
      <li>maybe it was old?</li>
      <li>I preferred the old 2.5% coal tar formula to this one.  </li>
      <li>No other shampoo equals that for me.</li>
      <li>it was the same name and label as bought in the store, but didn&#x27;t feel the same, and had no conditioner as far as i could tell.  </li>

<li> This newly licensed product contains less product per bottle (10 oz vs. 12 oz before), yet costs the same price as the 12 oz.</li>
<li> blow dry my hair, then apply leave-in conditioner lotion to the hair only, trying to avoid the scalp.</li>
<li> Despite a large know-it-all state wanting to get rid of Coal Tar shampoos and making this product somewhat hard to find, this product is what works for me.</li>
<li> It does not completely resolve the scalp itch problem.</li>
<li> Those type of shampoos get rid of the dead skin cells, but don&#x27;t help healing as far as I can tell.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unilever, applying typical Dutch business acumen, brought back the original formulation of Noxema and regained the loyal Noxema customer base that CP had alienated.</li>
<li> Its customers DID notice and within a short time the decision had such a dire effect on CP&#x27;s bottom line that it was forced to sell itself to Unilever, who bought its entire product line.&lt;br</li>
<li> The current licensee mentions that it has a new additive, Mentar, which is meaningless, since both ingredients that make up Mentar, coal tar and menthol, were in the previous formulation.</li>
<li> The TSA limits travelers to a 3.4 ounce (100ml) bottle or less (by volume) in carry-on luggage.</li>
<li> The product seems watery and less viscous than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Cheesebrough-Ponds made a similar decision to change the formulation of its time-honored flagship product, Noxema, a few years ago, by removing key ingredients and providing less product per container, thinking its customer base wouldn&#x27;t notice.</li>
<li> A friend of mine had a bad case of adult cradle cap.</li>
<li> At least I do not run around scratching all day and pulling out hair with flakes attached.</li>
<li> Otherwise I itch and feel uncomfortable with little relief.  </li>
<li> I purchased the shampoo simply because I wanted a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; but was disappointed when their was none.</li>
<li> but I think their &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; advertising is false.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s brown with a bad smell and it did not stop the itching.</li>
<li> Worthless, IMHO.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t actually hate the product</li>
<li> Sweat is very bad for the scalp breakouts, but using the denorex stops my itching.  </li>

    <li> Thought it was a good product till I read the back of the bottle and it said WARNING: contains known cancer causing chemicals!</li>
    <li> WORKS WONDERS!!! I ONLY NEED TO WASH MY HAIR EVERY 2 WEEKS, AS OPPOSED TO EVERY WEEK! GREAT PRODUCT! WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE!!! -MT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Denorex for year&#x27;s!! Excellent Product!! My dandruff problem always goes away!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for dandruff and itching and I have tried them all..</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had a bad case of adult cradle cap. This Denorex got almost all of it after two days and two shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for dandruff or cradle cap.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for . It tingles to let you know it&#x27;s working .</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years..great product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I would prefer to have the Denorex that is without the conditioner.  It just works better.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for mild scalp eczema.  I usually only need to use it once or twice to get rid of a flare up.  Otherwise I itch and feel uncomfortable with little relief.  Sweat is very bad for the scalp breakouts, but using the denorex stops my itching.  It also seems to reduce flakiness.  It lathers up very nicely and you won&#x27;t need to use a conditioner even unless yo have very long hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually hate the product but I think their &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; advertising is false.  I purchased the shampoo simply because I wanted a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; but was disappointed when their was none.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. The shampoo/condition itself is excellent and does what it claims to do. However, I travel. A 12 oz. bottle is too unwieldy. The TSA limits travelers to a 3.4 ounce (100ml) bottle or less (by volume) in carry-on luggage. Why isn&#x27;t it available in a 3-ounce size? There is a 4-ounce size (for some reason), but Amazon (for some reason) doesn&#x27;t sell it eligible for Amazon Prime.  For those reasons, I have to downgrade my review by two stars, for the size/packaging and shipping problems.</li>
    <li> very fresh and good shampoo</li>
    <li> Works better the some shampoos , depending on your condition you need to see a DR.</li>
    <li> Works great for my son</li>
    <li> 1. I have seborrheic dermatitis and have been using this product for years.  It is the only thing that has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t realize that it had been reformulated, but it still works for me and works better for than T-Gel.&lt;br /&gt;3. I use it daily - didn&#x27;t know you are supposed to without consulting a doctor - so far, no problems that I know of (I wish I could blame my increasing baldness on it, but I don&#x27;t think so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure that you don&#x27;t buy the formulation with the red band on the lower half of the box.  It has salicylic acid. Worthless, IMHO.  Those type of shampoos get rid of the dead skin cells, but don&#x27;t help healing as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo...I do however use a separate conditioner after it...It truly stops 97% of my scalp Psoriasis...It can be used 2X a week...if you have&#x27;nt tried it, you should...I&#x27;m pretty sure you will convert...</li>
    <li> I have a stubborn scalp itch, and tried 8 things before getting to something that worked.</li>
    <li> I have severe psoriasis since 1967. This helps my scalp but I have to wash every othr day to keep the &amp;#34;bloom&amp;#34; to start all over my scalp again. At least I do not run around scratching all day and pulling out hair with flakes attached. No other shampoo equals that for me.</li>
    <li> Despite a large know-it-all state wanting to get rid of Coal Tar shampoos and making this product somewhat hard to find, this product is what works for me. I&#x27;ve used it for 20 years. No itching, no flakes. Get it while you can.</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo, the only one that clear my dandruff and stop flaking.</li>
    <li> I preferred the old 2.5% coal tar formula to this one.  There is a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - does the job!</li>
    <li> Great wonderful product, really works!</li>
    <li> The product is not the same as it was when Benckiser manufactured it, before that company pulled it off the market. This newly licensed product contains less product per bottle (10 oz vs. 12 oz before), yet costs the same price as the 12 oz. product throughout the USA. The current licensee mentions that it has a new additive, Mentar, which is meaningless, since both ingredients that make up Mentar, coal tar and menthol, were in the previous formulation. The new formulation is different, and comments that it is less effective make sense, since the amount of coal tar has been reduced about 30% and the amount of alcohol reduced by about the same percentage. The product seems watery and less viscous than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheesebrough-Ponds made a similar decision to change the formulation of its time-honored flagship product, Noxema, a few years ago, by removing key ingredients and providing less product per container, thinking its customer base wouldn&#x27;t notice. Its customers DID notice and within a short time the decision had such a dire effect on CP&#x27;s bottom line that it was forced to sell itself to Unilever, who bought its entire product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unilever, applying typical Dutch business acumen, brought back the original formulation of Noxema and regained the loyal Noxema customer base that CP had alienated.</li>
    <li> this stuff is strong! it works, but once a month is probably the max for me..use with caution</li>
    <li> Removed my sever dandruff in just a few uses, however the smell is a bit strong &amp; can be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s brown with a bad smell and it did not stop the itching.</li>
    <li> Please do not quit selling this stuff! It literally is the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> it seems that this shampoo cleans the scalp like no other...or is it the menthol tingling that gives the impression? In any case, it&#x27;s the most highly concentrated coal tar shampoo I&#x27;ve found over the years.  This item w conditioner combined is the way to go for those w open lesions, so that a non-medicated conditioner doesn&#x27;t have to be used, losing that clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair, then apply leave-in conditioner lotion to the hair only, trying to avoid the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and it works well.  Wish the price would not keep increasing, but was able to get free shipping due to large order of multiple other items.</li>
    <li> Best dandruff product ever made!</li>
    <li> Great product and vendor. There was a problem with shipping (not vendor&#x27;s fault) but the vendor cleared it up and rectified the situation very quickly upon notification. Highly recommend both the product and vendor.</li>
    <li> I have used Denorex for years. Works just fine and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> It does not completely resolve the scalp itch problem. I saw no relief from it</li>
    <li> it was the same name and label as bought in the store, but didn&#x27;t feel the same, and had no conditioner as far as i could tell.  maybe it was old?</li>
