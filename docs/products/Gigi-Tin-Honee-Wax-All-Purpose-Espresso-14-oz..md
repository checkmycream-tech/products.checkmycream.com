      <li>Love the coffee smell as well.  </li>
      <li>Love the gigi products.</li>
      <li>OK...not sure if it was shipped this way, or if during shipping the problem occurred.  </li>
      <li>I will be getting more if I ran out of it.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the colour isn&#x27;t that appealing.</li>
      <li>surely recommend this.</li>
      <li>Ordering more immediately.</li>
      <li>No matter the hair type,they are gone in first application !!!</li>
      <li>I tried both kinds of wax, the honey wax which is original, and the coffee scented, they both are great, and I love how the scent of the coffee wax fills the room,  really perks you up with that coffee scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>i just wish i bought more rings for around my wax heater to help with clean up</li>
      <li>It somewhat Ok while it&#x27;s very hot</li>
      <li>It turned out that this wax works exactly the same as the original GIGI wax but smells wonderful!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product that I bought within the regular wax and the warmer.</li>
      <li>The smell is too strong and sweet.</li>
      <li>The coffee smell is kinda cool too, i get many compliments on the smell of my freshly waxed package.</li>
      <li>The only hair I&#x27;ve got left is perfectly sculpted eyebrows, my arm hair and the hair on the top of my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you want a wax to do, with the lovely roasted coffee scent an added bonus.</li>
      <li>if you spill it (must clean up asap-</li>
      <li>When I received the product, the wax had leaked out all around the seal and made an incredible mess.  </li>
      <li>This is a good soft wax, not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
      <li>But because the strips that you use with this wax are so long, I was able to reach and pull all on my own.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love the Espresso Honee</li>
      <li>but I can not be sure), and worked really well.  </li>
      <li>This is perfect for coarse or regular hair, and the smell is heavenly.</li>
      <li>and it went pretty smoothly.</li>
      <li>Favorite wax so far!</li>
      <li>I found that it wasn&#x27;t effective at removing hair on my legs, I think Espresso Honee might be okay to remove only fine hairs like the ones on my upper lip.</li>
      <li>only time I had a problem with the wax, it was my own fault.</li>
      <li>worth buying.</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh coffee.</li>
      <li>I managed to clean it up using an industrial grade solvent, but really, this shouldn&#x27;t have happened.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised at how easy it was to get the wax residue off.  </li>
      <li>No redness, very gentle, and took out all my unwanted hair.  </li>
      <li>It removes all your hair just from the first time.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>this wax removed my hair the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they are very sticky though!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it was a NIGHTMARE.</li>
      <li>An absolute sticky disaster!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the wax once so far, on my face (brows, moustache), but it smelled AMAZING while it was warming (which took forever...</li>
      <li>not favorite choice of gigi - but is good</li>
      <li>It was so much more effective than the hard wax at getting my hair off!!  </li>
      <li>This was the first time I was able to do my underarms on my own --- with the hard wax, I needed help from a second person to hold the skin or pull the wax for me.  </li>
      <li>Not that it isn&#x27;t good, but prefer the hard wax.</li>
      <li>It works as well as regular GiGi AP Honee wax, leaving my legs baby smooth, but it makes the whole house smell like coffee.</li>
      <li>I like Gigi wax, it really takes hair off, and then the espresso scent adds a bit of pleasure to the hair removing process.</li>
      <li>This worked very well for the intimate areas and does not need strips.</li>
      <li>Smells absolutely divine, though.  </li>
      <li>never have to look for another wax again because this works very well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i have the smoothest sack and crack on the block thanks to this wax.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works as well as regular GiGi AP Honee wax, leaving my legs baby smooth, but it makes the whole house smell like coffee. Very nice!  Also, re the seller, quick shipping, perfect product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite brand and scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. It was really  sticky and was hard to remove. My underwear was sticking to me for days. It did not remove any hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for several months on my legs and face. It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells fantastic! I remove it using muslin strips and can confirm that I was able to press the muslin strip with the used wax onto another area and found that it adheres well to the hair the 2nd and 3rd time around. When I need more wax, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this. I&#x27;ve used the unscented all-purpose as well, but with the espresso-scented honee, it ups the experience to something you might get in a spa. Ooh, la, la.</li>
    <li> The texture of this was very thin once heated, to the point it was hard to work with. Smells great though!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I bought within the regular wax and the warmer. This worked very well for the intimate areas and does not need strips.</li>
    <li> my Fav. buying again. saved at least 3 trips to the spa. one can I can do my legs, armpits and bikini 3 times.</li>
    <li> This is a good soft wax, not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s not bad either. Since using hard wax, I&#x27;m just not really a fan of soft! Not that it isn&#x27;t good, but prefer the hard wax.</li>
    <li> This wax box is magic...the way it works it&#x27;s outstanding...it left skin so smooth,so shiny, and yes full of coffee aroma too😊 I&lt;br /&gt;Will surely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very effective and easy-to-use wax. Seems like it will last me a while (home user). Smells AMAZING. Use with plastic cover on your home surfaces, and have oil handy, because it&#x27;s a b**ch when it cools off.</li>
    <li> I have always used the regular GIGI wax but for fun I decided to try this one because I thought the smell of coffee would be much better than the weird wax smell that comes along with the regular GIGI wax.  It turned out that this wax works exactly the same as the original GIGI wax but smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> smells AMAZING and lasts FOREVER. i just wish i bought more rings for around my wax heater to help with clean up but this stuff works and has topped any GIGI wax ive ever tried. so much better that the microwaveable one. and people, NEVER get the sugar wax, it DOES not work</li>
    <li> Favorite wax so far! Smells great, goes on smooth, grips well, and skin feels good. I prefer it with the non woven strips vs the cloth strips. Adheres way better and doesn&#x27;t seep thru.</li>
    <li> I tried both kinds of wax, the honey wax which is original, and the coffee scented, they both are great, and I love how the scent of the coffee wax fills the room,  really perks you up with that coffee scent.</li>
    <li> Great wax for someone who is familiar to waxing.  I used to use sally hansen wax, the one with the orchid on the box because it doesn&#x27;t stick to skin my only problem was that it wouldn&#x27;t always pull out all of the hair as well.  This wax gets every hair and I don&#x27;t have to go back later and fix it.  I use it with my GiGi wax warmer.  Put it on high for 20-25 minutes then low the whole time I&#x27;m using it.  And it worked really well when applying it thinly.  I would also recommend using something prior to waxing on the skin ie: baby powder, or any of GiGi brand options since it will help not to pull on skin.  Love the coffee smell as well.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to receive this wax, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. As a newcomer to waxing, maybe there&#x27;s something I was doing wrong, but this wax was very difficult to work with. It was hard to remove with waxing strips, and much of the wax stayed stuck on my skin. If this wax gets spilled onto anything, it&#x27;s an extreme pain in the butt to get off.  With many of the reviews on this page, I was very excited to try the product, but wound up being very disappointed. The GiGi Brazilian Body wax has been a lot easier to work with and has given better results, so I will stick with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked the smell, but nothing else. What a shame!</li>
    <li> I find this wax way too sticky. It is all over you and the floor (despite buying the Gigi heater, wax strips, pre and post wax lotions/cleansers). I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying I hate ordering things like this off the internet. I&#x27;m never sure if they are going to work, but by God this does! I may be the hairy-est girl on the planet and this wax removed my hair the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in the mail. Popped it in my wax warmer and went to town. I waxed EVERYTHING. From my eyebrows to my nethers all the way to my ankles. The only hair I&#x27;ve got left is perfectly sculpted eyebrows, my arm hair and the hair on the top of my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great price. Ordering more immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing at home for more than 15 years now. The microwave wax from drugstores is nothing compared to this one. It smells delicious and takes out even the finest hair in one stroke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the wax once so far, on my face (brows, moustache), but it smelled AMAZING while it was warming (which took forever... I think that was the new warmer I got also - [[ASIN:B000QS4JXK B000QS4JXK]] but I can not be sure), and worked really well.  No redness, very gentle, and took out all my unwanted hair.  Exactly what you want a wax to do, with the lovely roasted coffee scent an added bonus.</li>
    <li> the wax that i&#x27;ve been using before i found this product was gigi all purpose honee, but it didn&#x27;t quite do the job for me (way too sticky, thick and lacking in effectiveness) so i looked up other gigi brands and stumbled upon this baby (yay!) never have to look for another wax again because this works very well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;areas of application: eyebrows, upper lip and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-the smell of espresso lights up my room when i heat it up.&lt;br /&gt;-the wax is a dark chocolate brown color which may be intimidating for some, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or staining on your skin so it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;-consistency is perfect..not too sticky or thick on the skin (depends on your application)&lt;br /&gt;-goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-works great on fine/thick hair&lt;br /&gt;-no signs of redness, bumps or irritation before and after waxing&lt;br /&gt;-soft on the skin..has never taken off any layer of skin or left burns after use&lt;br /&gt;-wax in the comfort of your own home&lt;br /&gt;-cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- i use this with the gigi warmer.. it does take a while for it to completely melt on the highest setting (~30 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;-very messy if you spill it (must clean up asap- i use baby oil)</li>
    <li> A great product! Smells amazing but I&#x27;m a coffee lover so it&#x27;s no surprise! Removes hair great!</li>
    <li> The wax smells very nice. It is easy to wash off and effective. It removes all your hair just from the first time. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I use this to wax my junk.  It works so good i don&#x27;t have to shave my nuts again for 10 days.  Does it hurt... Hell yeah but i have the smoothest sack and crack on the block thanks to this wax.  The coffee smell is kinda cool too, i get many compliments on the smell of my freshly waxed package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had success with nearly all GiGi waxing products. Waxes, sticks, warmers, all have been nice quality and I&#x27;ve been happy with all my GiGi purchases. This wax smells lovely and does the job. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Wife LOVED IT!!!! Recommends!</li>
    <li> I recently just started waxing at home.  I first tried the GiGi All Purpose Honee and was so very impressed by the results. Then I picked up the Espresso Honee after reading favorable reviews about it. I used this product on my legs last night for the first time. I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love the Espresso Honee but I was mildly disappointed by it and I can now say I prefer the All Purpose Honee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:  Espresso Honee does smell so YUMMY. I also found that it is cheaper than the regular All Purpose Honee by about $9-$10 at my local Sally&#x27;s. I found that it leaves less residue on my skin compared to regular All Purpose Honee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:  It didn&#x27;t completely remove the hair on my legs.  I ended up having to use tweezers to remove the hairs left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I found that it wasn&#x27;t effective at removing hair on my legs, I think Espresso Honee might be okay to remove only fine hairs like the ones on my upper lip. I think that the regular GiGi All Purpose Honee wax still wins when it comes to removing coarser hair like leg hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like waxing hurts less when using this product. My eyes no longer water when doing my eyebrows, and I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritation like I&#x27;ve experienced before. Love, love, love this product! I&#x27;ve used on it a few friends, and they have completely agreed, this is definitely my new go-to wax. A great investment, and it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I like Gigi wax, it really takes hair off, and then the espresso scent adds a bit of pleasure to the hair removing process. I will reorder</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Gigi espresso all purpose honee wax for the first time and man,,,,,I loved it !!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth buying.No matter the hair type,thin,thick, coarsed or short.They will be gone in a single application.No need to re apply.I have been waxing for almost past 10 years,but never experienced so much comfort.No matter the hair type,they are gone in first application !!!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I fussed about is,it&#x27;s tooo sticky.Not during waxing,but if it stick on your fingers,it&#x27;s really tiresome to remove.My spatula was really hard to clean.Thing is this is semi hard wax.So it&#x27;s not that water soluble.</li>
    <li> Way too sticky and wouldn&#x27;t come off. It didn&#x27;t take all of the hair off either. I wasted my money....</li>
    <li> not favorite choice of gigi - but is good</li>
    <li> This is perfect for coarse or regular hair, and the smell is heavenly. It does NOT grip the fine, thin hair that&#x27;s grown on my legs and underarms after years of waxing.</li>
    <li> This wax smells sooooooo good and it works perfect for my needs.  I totally recommend it to other people.  It is not messy, or sticky when used properly.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying... My seller was awesome (Perfect Nail Store). Usually when I make a mistake, the seller takes advantage of that and makes my life miserable. I accidently ordered two wax pots when I meant to order one. I emailed them as soon as I saw my mistake, and they fixed it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the wax... It smells like fresh coffee. I used it for the first time on my legs, and it worked perfectly. It is very sticky as other have said, but isn&#x27;t that what you want from your wax? It worked great on my face as well. No scorching, minimal redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I had a problem with the wax, it was my own fault. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this wax, and I don&#x27;t see a reason to ever order another kind again except for a change of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use it to wax my legs and thighs. It smells good. I use muslin roll with it. Practice makes it perfect. I will be getting more if I ran out of it.</li>
    <li> But too messy. Smell is a little strong too. Not to mention the colour isn&#x27;t that appealing. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as normal soft waxes.</li>
    <li> I had no experience with soft waxes prior to using this product.  I&#x27;ve always used hard wax.  I like to experiment, so I bought the natural muslin epilating strips (feel and look like cloth) as well as the cloth epilating strips (feel and look like hard paper).  I found that the natural muslin epilating strips (they look like cloth) made it easier to conform to my body (ie knees), but the wax did go through these a little easier than with the cloth epilating strips.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like that the natural muslin epilating strips shed a lot of threads/pieces of cloth.  The cloth epilating strips (feel like hard paper) are much more stiff, and are a little harder to form to your body on angled areas (ie knees), however, it is easier to pull, there is no shedding, and it takes a lot more wax to seep through to the other side (where your hand goes).  I did one leg with natural muslin and one leg with cloth epilating strips:  both legs came out about the same, I had a few hands feel each leg and no one could tell the difference.  And completely off topic; but I just really dislike the names those strips are given because they are complete misnomers!  I decided to begin my review with this information because I read some negative reviews that talk about this wax going through the strips.  The short answer:  it depends on what strips you use.&lt;br /&gt;OK, the Espresso wax!!!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!  I wasn&#x27;t used to the sticky gooey gluey texture, but it didn&#x27;t take long to learn to handle it.  It was so much more effective than the hard wax at getting my hair off!!  It literally left no hairs behind where I applied it and removed it correctly (apply wax with hair growth direction, apply strip pressure with hair growth direction, pull strip the opposite direction of hair growth).  I wish I would have started using this wax years ago!!  I used it on both legs and underarms.  This was the first time I was able to do my underarms on my own --- with the hard wax, I needed help from a second person to hold the skin or pull the wax for me.  But because the strips that you use with this wax are so long, I was able to reach and pull all on my own.  And the SMELL!!!  It smells wonderful!!  I made a mess on my floor, and my legs did have a little bit of sticky residue.  Google to the rescue!  I googled how to get soft wax off body and hard surfaces, and all I had to do was use oil.  I soaked a wash cloth with olive oil and rubbed down my legs and underarms; the wax came off immediately!!  I had to scrub the floor with oil and a rag, but all of it came off.  I was really surprised at how easy it was to get the wax residue off.  I highly recommend this wax.  If you follow the simple directions on the lid, you will have excellent results.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
    <li> So sticky and really impossible to work with. I&#x27;ve been using wax all my life and this is the worst wax I came  across. It somewhat Ok while it&#x27;s very hot and you are using it but It&#x27;s HORRIBLE to get off of the skin afterwords and anything else it touches. An absolute sticky disaster!</li>
    <li> Extremely sticky and took like 3 hours to get rid of the after wax stickiness!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong and sweet. Plus it does nothing to remove hair. Worst wax ever.</li>
    <li> The Gigi Espresso more than met my expectations.  Love the fact I don&#x27;t have to go to the kitchen to heat the wax.  This is a great product for do it yourselfers.</li>
    <li> OK...not sure if it was shipped this way, or if during shipping the problem occurred.  When I received the product, the wax had leaked out all around the seal and made an incredible mess.  I managed to clean it up using an industrial grade solvent, but really, this shouldn&#x27;t have happened.  Smells absolutely divine, though.  Haven&#x27;t tried the wax yet but will let you all know.</li>
    <li> I got this because I love coffee... The first time I used it, it was a NIGHTMARE. I got bruises because the stupid wax wouldn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, it was MUCH easier and it went pretty smoothly. However, my hair grew back super fast, faster than it did with the Brazilian soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This is just too sticky.. Will not go off even if you wash with soap. you need to pull off every bit of wax using strips. If some patch remains.. then that gets too difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels like melted chocolate. I tried it and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I returned the warmer after that as it took too long to heat the wax. These containers are not made for microwaves and I had a huge mess to clean up. Hence 4 stars as they do not specify anywhere that they work with gigi warmers only :(</li>
    <li> Love the gigi products. .. they are very sticky though!  Sometimes difficult to get the wax off your body even after a shower</li>
