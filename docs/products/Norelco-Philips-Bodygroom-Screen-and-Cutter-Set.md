<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a big help for my existing Philips body shaver. My old screen and cutter were not working anymore. Now, with this replacement installed, it works just fine. Thanks, Amazon, for this product.</li>
    <li> Why would retailers sell an electronic grooming device that doesn&#x27;t sell the replacement blades? Yep! I had to search the net for replacement blades for a $60.00 men&#x27;s groomer that is being sold at Target, Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond and probably others, but don&#x27;t sell the replacement blades... Go figure.</li>
    <li> Replacement blade as good or better than original.</li>
    <li> I received this product pretty quick.  The product is the same quality as the original.</li>
    <li> If I were rating whether or not this product worked with the Norelco system, I&#x27;d give it five stars.  However, I&#x27;m rating how well this product actually works - and it&#x27;s just so-so.  I used to be a firm believer in the Norelco line, but in the past few months, even with replacements, I&#x27;m not satisfied and will be looking for another system.</li>
    <li> I have replaced the head at least 4-5 times and the head keeps falling off the machine while shaving. I cut myself several times too because of this. The design is flawed. Why can&#x27;t the machine hold the head? Perhaps, a button to release the head instead of just pulling it off would have helped the design. I am looking for other products.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother in law that couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in stores.  Checked at Amazon and got it no problem.  In 3 days, his shaver was just like new at a great price. Thanks</li>
    <li> The blade I got will not holed on atachments</li>
    <li> Could be a tad cheaper and they wear out a little quick</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original blade, but will do.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a dud, but it broke within one week of normal use.  The plastic &amp;#34;pegs&amp;#34; which hold the foil in place are weak and simply snapped off while I was shaving (I wasn&#x27;t putting any undue or unusual force on the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t want to waste any more money on these replacement heads, I now shave with a handheld safety razor, while my $95.00 USD Bodygroom Pro sits there on my shelf.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Bodygroom 2020. The foil itself worked fine, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t fit as well into the handle as the original foil did. It was too loose and eventually fell out on the floor while I was shaving. This made it even more loose, and when I tried shaving with it again, it fell out again, until it eventually stopped working. It&#x27;s possible that the foil was defective.</li>
    <li> This product fit perfectly on the BG2020 and my husband loves the fact that it shaves really close and leaves his face feeling smooth. You don&#x27;t even feel the prickled hairs that are usually left after shaving.</li>
    <li> It was the exact part that we were needing.&lt;br /&gt;The cost was reasonable.  It beats having to buy a new razor all together.</li>
    <li> great shaver and the price is better than buying in stores.  It came in fast and packed very well in the mail.</li>
    <li> TRIED THE MAN GROOMER AND HATED IT SO THESE REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR MY NORELCO IS NECESSARY</li>
    <li> Best for shaving all over the bodyhair. It has great power on hose hard to reach areas. I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Works well with the norelco axe bodygroom</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using for a few years now and I will continue to buy and use this product for many years to come.</li>
    <li> All is well, make sure it stays in place.  I need the replacement head for this razor.  Just fine to use.</li>
    <li> Works well Thank you and on time delivery. .</li>
    <li> This is not what I got in the mail!</li>
    <li> Same blade it comes originally. Good quality and great price. Depending on how often you use it, you can get up to 18 months of use out of it. Great replacement.</li>
    <li> Works well however,it keeps falling off. Very annoying when you are trying to shave. You are better off buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my body shaver, what gives?</li>
    <li> Great Quality! It took a few days for them to send it off but I got it in the amount of time they set for me.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and fits nicely, love it!  I bought another one just incase I break another one because it seems this style isn&#x27;t being made anymore!  Fast shipment and no problems...</li>
