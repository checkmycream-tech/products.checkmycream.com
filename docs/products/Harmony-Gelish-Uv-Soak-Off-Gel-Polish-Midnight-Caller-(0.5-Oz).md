<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lots of compliments on this color polish. Long lasting. Must apply thin coats.</li>
    <li> nice grey color with sparkle. I haven&#x27;t used it yet to see about coverage but looks nice in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This polish is a gunmetal grey color--exactly what I thought it would be, if not a little richer. I love it on its own, or with a coat of Waterfield over it. It&#x27;s such a fabulous color for fall...highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This color \\&quot;Midnight Caller\\&quot; is a great color that has nice coverage. You could probably get by with just one coat, but I  prefer to use two. This is a great alternative if you like to wear black. I like!!</li>
    <li> The color is very nice and gel is quality.</li>
    <li> Do a simple search for Gelish Swatches or the specific Gelish color and you can find many photos of the Gelish (and other Soak Off Gel polishes) polish applied on people. There are also many user groups and forums that post pictures of these polish colors applied on actual people in various types of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a problem with the polish that you didn&#x27;t research a color before you bought it, so taking off stars is unfair to the product. A simple written blurb advising others to research color is sufficient. Gelish is a very high quality UV cured soak off gel nail polish that wears for up to 21 days with no chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, you can mix these polishes by layering one polish color on top of other colors or actually mixing it with other colors to obtain your desired results. You also can sign up for SOG swaps on some forums.</li>
    <li> Awesome grey/silver color with sparkles.  The actual color on the bottle does not do any justice.  Two coats was a perfect shade</li>
    <li> Great product and beautiful color!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love gelish polishes.  This is a light gray color, not dark like photo.  I put 2 coats of midnight caller and one coat of Vegas night to add sparkle.  It was beautiful alone but I like bling.  The best thing is I can do my own at home with an inexpensive uv lamp and some alcohol to remove tackiness.  My mani lasts 2 weeks( I use my hands a lot  as a RN). I don&#x27;t have to pay $35 for a poor job from a salon.  If you want the true color go to harmony gelish page. Ps. I also have the ph bond, base coat and top it off.</li>
    <li> I wear this color all the time- one of my favorites. It has the perfect sheen and it&#x27;s a beautiful grey.</li>
    <li> This color isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s more silver than steel grey.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  This is one I may wear once or twice a year but not more often.</li>
    <li> I am really beginning to enjoy my Gelish polish. It has taken a little while to become proficient at it such that the nail polish stays on for 2 weeks. This polish looks great and has a wonderful silver/metal sheen. The color works well for many different outfits and stayed on for 2 days away from being 2 weeks. As usual it is super thick so you want to do light coats because it is so thick and it has a longer cure time because it is so dark. A great color and a great product!</li>
    <li> The color shown in the picture for midnight color is fairly accurate to how it applies with TWO coats. Most of the Gelish products are meant to be applied with two coats, so the pictures appear darker than they do compared to only one application on the nail. It is a very pretty and shiny pewter silver. It also looks really great with a layer on Night Shimmer on top, to add some sparkle.</li>
    <li> I like the colour, it&#x27;s just not as dark as I expected. It&#x27;s really thick and has some clumps in it. Still practicing, so I&#x27;m willing to give this another shot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it. I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
    <li> I would agree with the comment I read earlier.  The colors are a little difficult to guage from the chart or the internet.  I will add my two cents regarding the colors.  I purchased mideval madness and expected it to be a light gray.  It really is a brownish taupe.  Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the window on the bottle.  I agree with the other assessments of color the previous writer described.  Because the polish is so expensive, it would be grate if others would right thier own personal experience with the colors.</li>
    <li> Midnight Caller is a must have Gelish color.  I like by itself and also layered with a clear glitter polish over the top.  Either way it looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have many Gelish products. I love that their is a large selection of colors and that they are long lasting (2-3wks without chipping or peeling)  Midnight Caller is a great shade and can be worn with anything. I like it because it is much different than your basic reds &amp; pinks.If your looking for a sexy and sophisticated color I recommend Midnight Caller.</li>
    <li> Great metallic color without being too silver nor too black.</li>
    <li> Love my gelish manicure. One of my favorites. Really nice nail color. Totally worht it. Try it! Midnight Caller. Cool</li>
    <li> Nice color...not too runny, and is opaque with just two coats.  It is a nice pewter color, and although it is dark it does not take longer to cure than usual.</li>
    <li> A great sexy, sophisticated gunmetal gray with a beautiful shimmer to it. Perfect dark shade for those who have pale skin tones and are worried about looking &amp;#34;goth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Finally a gelish color I love. Even with only one coat. But better with two. A nice subtle shimmer. Beautiful.</li>
    <li> I get more compliments on this color than any other I have worn. It is elegant, understated but a little bold. Clean and professional looking but not boring. I put a little &amp;#34;Vegas Nights&amp;#34; sparkle on top sometimes, and it is a classy, not gaudy look. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice grayish metal looking, almost a metallic color.  I do not love this color but I do like it a lot.  Looks good with a lot of colors.</li>
    <li> If you are a silver fan, then you will love this color.  A nice shade that isn&#x27;t too dark or too light.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty medium slate grey polish. The base is quite frosty, the kind that makes &amp;#34;stripes&amp;#34; with the brush as you swipe along the nail. The glitter is very fine and in shades of grey and silver, and if you look really close, almost a blueish tone. The formula is smooth and I got even coverage with 3 thin coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice depth with the sparkles and the frosted base, but I&#x27;m personally not really a fan of frosted shades; I prefer cream or jelly bases with my glitter. I might just use it for french tips or small accent nails. If you don&#x27;t like frosted polishes, this one may not be for you. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Matches well with Water Field and if you like a steel look than this gel polish is for you. The size of the bottle was larger than expected and worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> I really thought, based on the photo as well as the name, that this color was darker. Even a black, which is what I was&lt;br /&gt;Looking for. It is however a nice color, more of a steel gray though, I added a sparkle clear coat to it after 2 coats and like it well enough but all in all I wanted. A black polish</li>
    <li> I have no clue where the greenish tinge of the color sample on amazon came from but this polish is definitely a pewter gray.  It&#x27;s quite lovely though and I wear it frequently.  It&#x27;s a good neutral color that goes with most everything and it can be the base for additional colors that turn out equally as well.  It&#x27;s got a bit of frosting in it so it&#x27;s not a dull gray, more of a polished look.</li>
    <li> I have many of the gelish colors and this one is my favorite. it&#x27;s a great steel gray color with a little bit of sparkle.  fun!</li>
    <li> Love the color! It&#x27;s like a sparkly pewter! And I love that the gel polish lasts me two weeks! I will definitely be buying more colors from Gelish!</li>
    <li> The only reason this color received 4 stars was because I did not realize that this shade was so metallic. I was hoping for a dark silver color, which this is, but I really wanted a flat silver not a metallic silver. I used 3 coats and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this color, Midnight Caller!  It is a deep pewter color with a slight shimmer.  It is not as dark as the picture but really beautiful.  I used two coats.  I agree with the people who say you can&#x27;t tell the colors by the pictures.  That is why I appreciate the detailed reviews that so many leave.  Thanks to all that so just that.</li>
    <li> I get a ton of compliments from both Men and Women when I use this color, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this polish! True to color shown here and stays on great!</li>
    <li> This color is very cute.  This gel polish stays on for 2-3 wks.  I work in the health field and Im always washing my hands.  I have never had a problem with it coming off before the 2-3 wks.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? If you want a dark pewter grey then you got it. The application process is easy, the color is lovely, and the product just last on my nails. It goes on thinly enough to not feel heavy on your nails and it strong enough to last a week without chipping. Simply put, I love it.</li>
    <li> The gelish  brand is good and that&#x27;s what I use but through this buyer, once they mail it and if it gets lost like mine did, they won&#x27;t help you. They said it&#x27;s my problem now. Will never buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I love the Harmony Gelish polish but it does not describe the colors at all. They look completely different when you get them home then they do on your computer. Midnight Caller is Dark pewter,Reserve is a neutral beige pinkish color. deep sea is beautiful dark with purplish metallic flakes. Silver sand is just glitter,simpler sheer is just clear with a tint of pink. Mint icing and ocean wave are not matte colors they are sheer and sparkly. they are very expensive and you have to be very careful when ordering them if you like the matte look it&#x27;s hard to tell which ones are and are just sheer and sparkly.</li>
    <li> Love the Gelish. If you are going to do gel nails this is the brand to use. Great colors easy to do yourself and lasts for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish polish, this color is a true silver color.  It is a smooth application and has lasted 2 weeks without any discoloration.</li>
    <li> I love gelish products, and wanted some bold colors for fun.&lt;br /&gt;This one caught my eyes, bought it and swatched on the wheel, very soft subtle metal grey, it&#x27;s between charcoal and grey.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Great great color. I read other reviews and agree that the picture of the color is not exactly what it looks like in real life. It is more of a medium-darkness metallic grey color, which is great for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This is such an all-around great color and wears forever.  It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> Lovely color.  Dark silver/Medium grey with shimmer.  Consistency is great.  It went on easily and didn&#x27;t chip, peel, wrinkle, shrink or crack after two weeks of wear.  It also came off easy once I was ready to remove it.  This is one of my go  to colors in my gelish line.</li>
    <li> This is like a gun metal grey, and I love it, but I love all things Gelish!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I always say great wear-ability!!!!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is amazing. Iw ould say it is like almost a gunmetal color, awesome color. if your looking for a silver/gray this is the way to go. Came fast too. great product</li>
    <li> I would describe this color as a very pretty shimmery slate grey. Looks great on! Covered well with 2 coats.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works perfectly! I could not be happier! The folks at gelish really have a good bead on a simple product, that anyone can use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happens to be my favorite color of all time! Dark, pewtery silver! It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I really love this color!! I am glad I ordered it!! I will be wearing it often. I have had it on since I got it and it is going on 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I usually do neutral colors, but wanted something fun. This color is FUN! 3 Thin coats and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I love this color!  It is slightly lighter than the picture, but it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color!  I would describe it as a gray/blue.  If I wear it with black or grey, it looks grey.  But if I wear it with blue, it looks blue.  It especially looks great with jeans.  The color matches denim blue perfectly.  It is a very versatile color.</li>
    <li> It is not so much the quality, but the color was just OK for me... It is a gun metal grey color, but left me somewhat disappointed.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE gel polish! The color is awesome too! This stuff stays on for 10-14 days! Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost. It would cost me at least $30 at the salon.</li>
    <li> Like the color, it lasted almost two full weeks. I recommend a couple of coats to get a good color.</li>
    <li> This color is fab!! and the quality is amazing. I have some IBD and trugel products that suck. This hands down is the best. And I just am in love with this color. This is a MUST HAVE!! BUY IT NOW</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COLOR!  It took a few applications to get the shade I was looking for but worth it.  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on this shade.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this color! It has been my absolute favorite to wear lately! Highly recommend it if you love gray/silver tones.</li>
    <li> beautiful color and long lasting, a must have.</li>
    <li> I love  this gelish color! It is a deep gray color so pretty. This is a great product and stays on at least 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Always hard to tell what the exact color will be when ordering online. I bought it hoping it would be a darker gray, but it is more silvery (even with two coats).</li>
    <li> I used this color the first time I ever di Gel nails.  It came out perfectly. I only need two coats..Looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
    <li> i love this color! It lasts over a 1 week with me and i love the shininess :) Perfect indeed!</li>
    <li> I love all the Gelish products. They are good quality and are affordable. will continue to add to my color collection.</li>
    <li> The color is great, the quality is good, and the price point is good. I love this stuff because normal polish only lasts like 3-4 days. I can wear Gelish for at least a week without noticing any wear in the polish. After a week I can tell some wear but it is minimal. This color is great, I use 2 coats some times 3 depending on how rich you want the color. For the amount of product you get the price point is great! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Like the color but Gelish peels off and is light around the egde of nail even with 3 coats. Cnd products stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;This only lasts 5 days or so.</li>
    <li> This color is close to the picture.  It is a great buy for the bigger size I received.  You definitely need to put 2 or 3 coats on to get the coverage you like.</li>
    <li> This is a dark metallic gray color (think the darker gray color that newer cars come in).  It&#x27;s a great nuetral.  I have very fair skin with a reddish undertone and I thought it worked well.  I&#x27;ve also seen this color on people with a tanner skintone and it looks great as well - albeit a little lighter.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it looked \\&quot;goth\\&quot; although I will also wear black or other dark colors, so maybe I&#x27;m just used to the look.  From the picture, it looks like it will go nice with \\&quot;Water Field\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve gotten that sparkly polish to wear over this as well.  It didn&#x27;t take any more time to dry under the LED light...30 seconds, just like the others.</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark metallic gray color with good coverage!</li>
    <li> Love this &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; it is very universal and can go with just about anything!  One of my fav colors!</li>
    <li> Color goes with everything.  The Gelish polishes last a long time, and they don&#x27;t lose their shine! I plan to order more Gelish polishes right away.</li>
    <li> Love the color, works great and stayed on 2-3 weeks. Didn&#x27;t need to use a full amount of time under the UV light since it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this color because I tend to wear more reds and pinks, but I wanted to try something different and I am glad I did! Its a very pretty dark graphite gray with a sparkle. Not too dark not to light. I use all Harmony gelish products and this was a great add to my collection! I used 2 coats only to get the right color. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite colour, I use it all the time. It goes on beautifully opaque with only two coats, and it looks amazing. I like to put a coat of water field, vegas nights, or night shimmer polish on over it get a truely stunning effect. If you want a nice color that goes with everything and fits any occasion, this is definitely it.</li>
    <li> Great and sophisticated color, very rich and slight shimmer. I love the cool greyish tones in this shade. Love all of the Harmony colors. So many of my friends and colleagues have bought the system due to seeing my nails. My only problem is I have too many colors, and it is difficult to choose.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is a gel polish, meaning it needs to be cured under a UV/LED light. (pro tip: your gel mani/pedi will also require gel base coat and gel top coat, purchased separately) Compared with other color gel polishes, the Gelish &amp;#34;Midnight Caller&amp;#34; is extremely smooth in consistency, which is why I said it applies just like regular nail polish. It is so smooth that I can get away with applying just one coat of color gel, without sacrificing the longevity of the gel mani/pedi. Other color gel polishes I have tried (especially pastels or shades of white) are &amp;#34;goopier&amp;#34; in consistency, rendering it impossible to get away with only one coat of color gel because it will leave streaks unless you apply a second coat to reinforce the color. There are many forums online discussing color gel polish; good luck and stay pretty!</li>
    <li> beautiful Color only 2 coats needed. So hip and fresh !! Look great on toes too ! One of my favorite Winter colors..not too dark but but not light at all. Pearlized alot .</li>
    <li> I have many Gelish colors and I must say, this is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a pretty gunmetal color.I usually put about three coats and it comes out nice and pretty and you can&#x27;t see the nail line. Sometimes when I want one finger to be only glitter I put one coat of this color and a few coats of Vegas Nights and it gives it a silver look instead of just a transparent glitter color. Definitely recommend this!</li>
