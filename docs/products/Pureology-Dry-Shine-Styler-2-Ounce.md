      <li>Great Purchase!</li>
      <li>A very good product.</li>
      <li>I read all the great reviews on this product and was very impressed.</li>
      <li>It is a great product.  </li>
      <li>A great product.................  </li>
      <li>I will cry if they quit making this great product.</li>
      <li>Product is great, never ordered through amazon.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>like it and price is good.  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
      <li>I received it quickly and with a hand written note thanking me for my order!!</li>
      <li>I glad to find it on line</li>
      <li>Deliver&#x27;s a wonderful shine,,,,,,,, A Shine that last.  </li>
      <li>Will also order more of these products</li>
      <li>I love, love, love it and will buy more.  </li>
      <li>but it works the way it should as its described.. :)</li>
      <li>I love the product and when I looked on Amazon to buy another 2 oz jar, my jaw dropped when I saw the price.</li>
      <li>Vegan and Cruelty Free!   </li>
      <li>I am amazed I do not need more.  </li>
      <li>:)  When I find something that \\&quot;works\\&quot; I stay with it.  </li>
      <li>I often mix it with some water-based wax product to give it more hold.  </li>
      <li>but no this one currently available through Amazon!</li>
      <li>However, its not so strong as to prevent re-combing or running your fingers through your hair.  </li>
      <li>but once you work it between your fingers and into your hair it works fine.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair which does not hold a curl or a style</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to deliver that &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; textured look, especially to the ends of a shag cut.  </li>
      <li>And, importantly, it dries so that it maintains the look all day</li>
      <li>it was a very consistent, smooth paste.</li>
      <li>I Love this whole line of hair products and will continue to use them.  </li>
      <li>It has more body and shine and is much easier to control.  </li>
      <li>(so many of the shine styler products never actually dry and therefore the look you create does not maintain and the hair ends up sticking together in un-intended ways).  </li>
      <li>This product delivers exactly what it&#x27;s labeled as:  shine that dries.  </li>
      <li>The price is very high.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Thanks</li>
      <li>It may not provide as much spikiness.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product, and I will purchase it again!</li>
      <li>A small amount of this product makes my hair smooth without looking it is full of grease.</li>
      <li>This jar looks identical and the product smells the same and is the same color, but it is more creamy, rather than waxy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product</li>
      <li>Since I have found this product, my hair has taken on a new look.</li>
      <li>Also  gives you such a healthy full haed of hair look, and as well you have no fly aways&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I have very thick,hgh-lighted ,dry hair.</li>
      <li>Be sure to only use a very small amount  would purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>It is supposed to be a rich, thick consistency and just a tiny bit will truly bring a shine to your hair and manageability as well.</li>
      <li>I certainly won&#x27;t pay $78 for a product that sells for much less in salon&#x27;s and used to on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is stickier than the last dry shine styler that I purchased on EBay last year-, probably old stock.</li>
      <li>amazon is great for alot of things but some things are just priced stupid and this is one of them.</li>

<li> amazon is great for alot of things but some things are just priced stupid and this is one of them.</li>
<li> It actually lasted that long!</li>
<li> and I find hairsprays are frequently too heavy for my type of hair, dragging it down.  </li>
<li> It is everything I expected it to be.</li>
<li> it is supposed to be a soft wax and stiff in the jar ... when you put it on your hair ... it makes it greasy and heavy ...</li>
<li> In the past I purchased Dry Shine from my local salon and it was a sort of tacky shoe polish type consistency.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look greasy.</li>
<li> I have a real hard time with flyway&#x27;s with my hair, this stuff REALLY helps.</li>
<li> Only half full,I think some of it evaporated,this has not been made in a few years.</li>
<li> What I was sent was not a fresh, unused package.  </li>
<li> Thumbs down from me on this stylining product.</li>
<li> Gives style and shine without weighing your hair down.  </li>
<li> I guess my hair is just too heavy for it to hold.</li>
<li> I use so very little</li>
<li> Everytime I purchased it in the past localy</li>
<li> I have used this product for 15 years ... and the past 2 jars have come runny ....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll go hunt it down rather than paying that price and risk getting a poor quality.</li>
<li> Very disappointed (1) that this product is off the store shelves when it was obviously a hot item because it was always gone the minute it came in and (2) the price has doubled and tripled since I&#x27;ve had to order it online.</li>
<li> Very unhappy with the last order.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair.</li>
<li> The quest for the product was exhausting, but amazon came to my rescue.</li>
<li> I notice that there are a number of reviews about the poor quality of the product they received.</li>
<li> parsley dried up as they&#x27;re taking advantage of the fact they quit making this product very expensive</li>
<li> For starters, I was unable to find this Pureology at any store in the Portland area.  </li>
<li> Product container has \\&quot;false bottom\\&quot;, a space of almost 1/2 inch!</li>
<li> Too bad it is being discontinued.</li>
<li> I am disappointed in the product.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>
<li> smells awful......</li>

    <li> Gives style and shine without weighing your hair down.  Vegan and Cruelty Free!   I have been using this for years and I love it!</li>
    <li> For starters, I was unable to find this Pureology at any store in the Portland area.  My hair dresser had used this product on my hair some time back and I loved it.  The quest for the product was exhausting, but amazon came to my rescue.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews on this product and was very impressed. I have very thick,hgh-lighted ,dry hair. This product did absolutly using this  for my hair.After using this product for about 2-3 weeks,i gave up and went on to another product.Thumbs down from me on this stylining product.I guess my hair is just too heavy for it to hold.</li>
    <li> Product is great, never ordered through amazon.  I buy this product at my local grocery store for under 25 bucks.  Look local and dont buy on amazon....amazon is great for alot of things but some things are just priced stupid and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> smells awful......I have used this product for years.  What I was sent was not a fresh, unused package.  Very disappointed.  I paid triple retail for it at that!!!!</li>
    <li> Since I have found this product, my hair has taken on a new look. It has more body and shine and is much easier to control.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is everything I expected it to be. Great Purchase!</li>
    <li> Only half full,I think some of it evaporated,this has not been made in a few years.The price is very high.</li>
    <li> Product container has \\&quot;false bottom\\&quot;, a space of almost 1/2 inch! It seems like you are getting about twice the product, but you aren&#x27;t. Beware.</li>
    <li> I last purchased this product from Amazon in 2012. It actually lasted that long! I love the product and when I looked on Amazon to buy another 2 oz jar, my jaw dropped when I saw the price. In November 2012 I paid $25. And now it&#x27;s $78??? I notice that there are a number of reviews about the poor quality of the product they received. It appears that this vendor is running a scam. I certainly won&#x27;t pay $78 for a product that sells for much less in salon&#x27;s and used to on Amazon. I&#x27;ll go hunt it down rather than paying that price and risk getting a poor quality. It is supposed to be a rich, thick consistency and just a tiny bit will truly bring a shine to your hair and manageability as well. My advice to Amazon is kick this seller to the curb and go back to the vendor from 2012. I highly recommend the product but no this one currently available through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and loved it. The last order not only increased in price but the &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; was not the same. It was gummy not like a paste I have received before. Very disappointed (1) that this product is off the store shelves when it was obviously a hot item because it was always gone the minute it came in and (2) the price has doubled and tripled since I&#x27;ve had to order it online. Wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the price because I like it IF the quality was the same. Very unhappy with the last order.</li>
    <li> A great product.................  Deliver&#x27;s a wonderful shine,,,,,,,, A Shine that last.  Also  gives you such a healthy full haed of hair look, and as well you have no fly aways&#x27;. or any frizz......... I highly reccomend this product, and I will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years ... and the past 2 jars have come runny .... it is supposed to be a soft wax and stiff in the jar ... when you put it on your hair ... it makes it greasy and heavy ... it is not supposed to do that.  I am going to send this product back as I have 2 jars of this that came this way.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair. A small amount of this product makes my hair smooth without looking it is full of grease.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day to help style my hair and it also gives it lots of shine.  Have been using it for years.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> In the past I purchased Dry Shine from my local salon and it was a sort of tacky shoe polish type consistency. This jar looks identical and the product smells the same and is the same color, but it is more creamy, rather than waxy. I tried some in my hair and it adds the shine and strand separation I am looking for. I don&#x27;t know why it is such a different consistency but once you work it between your fingers and into your hair it works fine. It may not provide as much spikiness. I don&#x27;t spike my hair anymore so I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair shine and body. I use so very little I am amazed I do not need more.  One jar will last me 6 months.</li>
    <li> Searched for this product for awhile, especially since it is now discontinued.  I received it quickly and with a hand written note thanking me for my order!!</li>
    <li> I have a real hard time with flyway&#x27;s with my hair, this stuff REALLY helps. A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look greasy. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used it before and didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it works the way it should as its described.. :)</li>
    <li> I Love this whole line of hair products and will continue to use them.  :)  When I find something that \\&quot;works\\&quot; I stay with it.  \\&quot;Thanks so much.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  Too bad it is being discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly what it&#x27;s labeled as:  shine that dries.  It&#x27;s great to deliver that &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; textured look, especially to the ends of a shag cut.  And, importantly, it dries so that it maintains the look all day (so many of the shine styler products never actually dry and therefore the look you create does not maintain and the hair ends up sticking together in un-intended ways).  However, its not so strong as to prevent re-combing or running your fingers through your hair.  I often mix it with some water-based wax product to give it more hold.  It&#x27;s actually gold in color and delivers a lot of shine.  I will cry if they quit making this great product.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair which does not hold a curl or a style and I find hairsprays are frequently too heavy for my type of hair, dragging it down.  This is the answer to a prayer, because it holds, and can be worked after applying to create fullness, volume and piecy looks.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It is stickier than the last dry shine styler that I purchased on EBay last year-, probably old stock. I am disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever.  I love, love, love it and will buy more.  I glad to find it on line</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and the consistency for all the containers were not what I have purchased for years from a local salon. Everytime I purchased it in the past localy it was a very consistent, smooth paste. The product I receive seems to have sperated, oils and paste?  I tried mixing it, but it is still not the same. Would not order this product again from this distributor.  Would like to return, but threw away recipt and don&#x27;t want or have the time to bother with it.</li>
    <li> like it and price is good.  if yu use pureology I would recommend this.  Will order again. Will also order more of these products</li>
    <li> parsley dried up as they&#x27;re taking advantage of the fact they quit making this product very expensive</li>
    <li> I always use this product. Clams fuzzy hair. Be sure to only use a very small amount  would purchase this product again.</li>
