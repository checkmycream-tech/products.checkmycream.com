<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful, and not dry</li>
    <li> I used to love this cucumber milk cleanser from Asia so I&#x27;ve been looking for something similar.  Sadly this one is not it.  It smells TERRIBLE &amp; I love cucumber smell!  Cleanser is gentle enough to use through but I can&#x27;t say yes to this cucumber.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, although I do wish it foamed or bubbled or something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan the Yes To products for a few years now. And once again, I am please with yet another product. This cleanser is great! Absolutely great. I have no complaints. It is gentle on my skin and leaves my skin clear. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using this cleanser, so that&#x27;s a PLUS in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this cleanser again. My money was well spent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product &amp; am currently onto my 2nd bottle. It gently &amp; effectively cleanses the skin leaving it moist &amp; clean. Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> After my tried and true Exposed Skin Care stopped working for me, I decided to go to peels to get clear skin. Since skin peels are so harsh on the skin, I switched over to gentle skincare in between the peels. This cleanser, witch hazel and biore sunscreen or coconut oil (at night). I have very oily skin and was worried that this combination would make breakouts worse. No worries there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is so gentle and removes my makeup pretty well. Granted, I do use neutrogena&#x27;s makeup removing wipes but I used them with the Exposed cleanser as well and get the same skin cleaning results, without the dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very soft which is great. I like the smell of cucumbers but some products can go over board. The only thing is to not use a full pump. Half a pump is always good enough for me to clean my face and neck. In love with this stuff! Never thought my greasey skin would like a cream cleanser.</li>
    <li> This cleaner doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or make me brake out, it makes my face nice and clean and has even cleared my completion :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must have for anyone who with sensitive skin or wants to improve their skin regime. Honestly worth it for the price. Favorite skin care brand with many uses. Cruelty free, paraben free, and eco friendly. Overall great buy, skin feels firm and naturally smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser. It&#x27;s the only one i can use for my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other face washes! I use it once a day (at night, in the shower). One bottle usually lasts me at least 4 or 5 months.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup and is hard to rinse off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and just recently I have not been able to find it in any local store.  Luckily Amazon has it.  Very gentle cream cleanser, non sudsy, does a great job on the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many face washes over the year, many have been good, but this one has just worked wonders for my skin. I never had much problem with major acne, but with my face constantly being red. This seems to really calm my skin, take away the redness, and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. Even my husband has mentioned how good my skin looks! This is such a good price and I can&#x27;t wait to try out their other products.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this item and now I have on auto ship as it is not available at my local drug or discount store.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin clean, refreshed and soft-could be the soy, I once used a VERY expensive soy cleanser and this is equally as good! I highly  recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This entire line works well for me and the milk cleanser is so exception.  It makes my skin look and feel like a million bucks.  Anyone with sensitive skin should give this a try!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to give this more than two starts because the bottle I recieved in the mail was almost half empty. No wonder it is an add on item, ITS HALF EMPTY. If I didn&#x27;t need facewash so bad I would have returned it right away, but I have extremely sensitive skin, am out of facewash and this is a good product. Who ever distributes this product through Amazon should monitor their merchandise better or not swindle customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great. I have used the line before and, even though the bottle was half empty, I used this as soon as I got it because I am in dire need of good facewash. It left my sensitive skin feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
    <li> It did not really help my skin.  It dried it out, and caused it become red and more sensitive. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash!!!  It&#x27;s creamy and the first time you use it you wonder if it will really get your face clean but as soon as you dry off you&#x27;ll see how well it gets off makeup (including mascara) while still leaving your face soft.  I&#x27;ve used this product (as well as the cucumber moisturizer, cucumber night cream and blueberry eye lotion) for several years now and haven&#x27;t found anything better.  I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with this plus they are really careful to make formulas that avoid the nasty ingredients that we shouldn&#x27;t be putting on our bodies.</li>
    <li> After trying several other cruelty free facial cleansing products, a friend recommended the Yes to...products to me.  I have ultra sensitive, very problematic skin.  I need something gentle enough not to cause more break outs and redness, but strong enough to keep my skin clean and help keep it clean.  This product didn&#x27;t really do much.  It didn&#x27;t make things worse, but didn&#x27;t make them better...so I just use it at night before bed.  It has a strong cucumber scent to it, which for me is okay.</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction to this face wash 8/10 times.  Not very hypoallergenic! It also didn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with rosacea and I have to be careful for so many things can cause me dermatitis or an allergic reaction and intensification of the red in my skin.  This cleanser along with the nano tech face cloths are my holy grail cleaning routine.  So gentle and effective it removes all my makeup without making my skin feel yucky afterward.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I prefer other face washes however, this one didn&#x27;t give me any problems.  Just not my favorite.  I expected better results and it was just average to me.</li>
    <li> IT doesn&#x27;t exactly strip away dirt like some powerful stuff, but it is really gentle and works well around my eyes which are extremely sensitive. Probably the only product I can get near them. Good for what it is, a daily light cleanser. My skin is pretty normal with some dry skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> smells really good of cucumbers, i normally use it to remove makeup n dirt normally at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love and I mean LOVE the YES TO products.&lt;br /&gt;I use the cucumbers because I have sensitive skin. People in my office noticed my face changing since I got this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> While I have not seen results with the Cucumbers Calming Night Cream, I do feel like this cleanser is a keeper.  It feels nice on my skin and seems to clean thoroughly.  It has a pleasant fragrance and texture.  The price is also reasonable and Amazon seems to be one of the few places that it can be found.  Local stores who carry the Yes To line do not seem to carry this cleanser, they carry another cucumber line type of cleanser but not the milk , so be careful to purchase the right one.</li>
    <li> I have bad reaction from this product. My skin burn and peel off from my first used.</li>
    <li> yea she likes this stuff. Smell nice I suppose I use it on the rare occasion but for the most part it is all her</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I have VERY delicate facial skin. Just about everything breaks me out and I had god-awful acne until I realized it was too much fragrance, artificial coloring, and foaming agent in basically every acne product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer mentioned, I don&#x27;t ever feel like my skin is really CLEAN with this cleanser. HOWEVER, after they discontinued my normal facewash, I REALLY needed something new that wouldn&#x27;t break me out to the point that I was ashamed to leave my house. :/ This is VERY gentle and even seems to calm any spots that seem about to pop up. To solve the &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; problem, I just add a little sugar after I put this on my face and it makes a wonderful and cheap natural exfoliatant. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for the skin (doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either) and will continue to be my HG until I can find something a little more exfoliating that doesn&#x27;t turn my face into a pizza!</li>
    <li> I use retin-A so I need my cleanser to be gentle but I also want to remove all makeup when I cleanse at night. This takes off the foundation, blush, mascara,etc. I can even take of long-lasting lipstick stains with this product. The best part is that it leaves no oily or filmy residue which is a nightmare when one has combination skin. The fragrance smells of cucumbers that one would find in high end spa products.   However I do want to note that for waterproof eyeliner or mascara I find that I need to use a separate oil based remover.   Overall, I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve already repurchased this twice.</li>
    <li> Wonderful gentle, fragrance free cleanser that will leave your skin clean but not dry. And it really does smell like cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fresh soy face wash for about seven years to remove eye make up. I dislike using cotton pads because it creates waste and my eyes are sensitive, but I also had to grit my teeth every time I bought the fresh $38 wash. I&#x27;ve tried near countless things to replace it, because of the price. I followed another review that said this was a dupe. She was right! It comes out a milky gel, and is similar in consistency to Fresh. It smells delicious, and works the same way. You don&#x27;t need to, but I also added rose water to mine per the other reviewer&#x27;s suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unintended consequence was that it cleared up my skin! It really gets rid of oil without stripping and causing over production. I&#x27;m really seeing a difference, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. It&#x27;s really inexpensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have trouble finding cleansers that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. This product feels fantastic when washing my face - very soothing and soft - and the smell is very light and pleasant. I like the pump top and the price is decent for the quality. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product. I was in the market for a gentle face wash since more harsher ones irritate my eyes/skin.&lt;br /&gt;On particular oily days, or sleeping with make up on though, I still use an exfoliating wash</li>
    <li> I love that this cleanser is somewhat thicker and not watery and wasted.  And the smell is so fresh!</li>
    <li> Una porqueria! I did my research and reviews about this cleanser before doing the purchased. To make sure that was a gentle cleanser.For so reason I don&#x27;t know why every time I used burn my face, horrible sensation that right away I washed it with water.The cucumber wipes also burnt my face. Why?  I don&#x27;t understand because my face skin is good not sensitive or complicated. But with this product has an awful reaction.I&#x27;m obligated to quit this cleanser and the wipes.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. Works really well without all those harsh chemicals. The price was great so I bought on Amazon instead of in the stores.</li>
    <li> This product is uncomfortable to use.  It dries out my skin like the worst chemical products.  I bought into the hype when I bought it, but will not be perpetuating it.</li>
    <li> I havent&#x27; tried it yet because I wanted a backup ready when my other expires, but I am really excited to try it.  The price was great and I like how natural it is.  Super fast delivery too</li>
    <li> So glad I found this. I love Fresh brand Soy Face Cleanser but its pricy and has parabens. This has a similar consistency, scent and cleansing abilities. Which is to say, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my oily skin (I&#x27;ve made the mistake of stripping out that moisture in the past which caused breakout - plus oily skin ages better so best not to take away all that lovely natural suppleness) and removed my mascara (Urban Decay Lush Lash) and other face makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to have rose water on hand (all purpose stuff, I use it for cooking) - and added about a teaspoon to this to make it a bit more like the Fresh product. Its subtle but goes really nicely with the cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, it wont lather. Neither does Fresh Soy Cleanser - because it doesn&#x27;t have harsh drying surfactants in it. Its still doing its thing, a little goes a long way. Just massage it throughly on your wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My wife buys this because she is very conscientious about products with harmful ingredients.  This product apparently is all natural and lacks those ingredients she wants to avoid.  It smells nice and cleans my face well.  I rarely have blemishes.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> The only cleanser that doesnt hurt my skin....3 yrs now...been loving it. Perfect for skin types like mine, that cant use face wash creams (cos it make us oliy) or gels (that dry us out)</li>
    <li> This cleaner is really light on the face and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry OR leave a residue. The smell is quite pleasant too. I just wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for acne prone skin since it has no acne treatments in it.</li>
    <li> hmm.. it&#x27;s okay. I have sensitive combination skin with moderate acne and this hasn&#x27;t really helped much. It makes my face feel clean without feeling tight and it&#x27;s not drying nor does it feel like I applied a bucket of oil, so I suppose that&#x27;s good enough for me. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very gentle but excellent cleaner.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. A little goes a long way. Takes makeup off easily.</li>
    <li> My new favorite facial cleanser. Love the smell, really gentle. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the perfect gentle skin cleanser.  I have been using it for more that 7 months and love it.  It is almost odorless and make your skin feel well moisturized when done.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale and have EXTREMELY sensitive &amp; dry skin and read about how the cucumber line bothered/burned/stung alot people&#x27;s skin so i decided to take a chance and ordered it anyway and i&#x27;m so glad i did !! It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all. In fact it actually started clearing up my break outs within 3 days of using it. You only need to use a pea size amount. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and it has not dried my skin out which is great coming from someone with already dry skin. It&#x27;s also cruelty free which is a plus for us vegans !</li>
    <li> I have used this face cleanser repeatedly and find that it is very gentle and leaves your face feeling moisturized. Compared to other cleansers that sometimes have very drying chemicals like salicylic acid or lots of detergents, this doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry. It will not exfoliate your face much if at all, but it is a great daily cleanser if you have mildly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very soothing and yummy smelling.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great! I love the soft feel of my skin after washing and the light cucumber scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m generally fond of Yes to products due to them being hypoallergenic and largely free of chemicals like parabens and phthlates: this product is no exception. It is paraben-free and SLS and petroleum free, which matters to me. My skin is normal though leanings towards dry, and I have yet to break out or suffer any dryness from the gentle milk cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The milk cleanser feels lovely on my skin. The milk cleanser true to its name, as the formula is gentle. In addition, the formula is silky smooth, thin, and pearly white. It does not contain SLS and other unnecessary additives and thus does not foam or lather very much, but the cleansing properties are still very apparent. It has a very calming yet refreshing scent, and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean after use. It isn&#x27;t a very moisturizing cleanser, but it isn&#x27;t drying either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: If your skin is on the more sensitive side, this may not be sensitive enough. If your skin is on the dry side, this may not be moisturizing enough. I have tried other natural products that are more gentle on the skin, so this cleanser may not be ideal if you have very sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 8 year old who doesn&#x27;t like to wash her face.  now that she has a &#x27;special&#x27; face cleanser, she is doing on her own and this seemed gentle and natural for her.</li>
    <li> This is not a BAD cleanser, but it most certainly isn&#x27;t for daily use if you have sensitive skin. I was really surprised that this is marketed towards us delicate-skinned folks, as it can be quite harsh if used daily. I would say it&#x27;s good for maybe using 2-3 times a week tops if you have touchy skin. The average person with non-sensitive skin should be able to use it more often. I myself can only use 1 or 2 different brands without experiencing dryness and flaking. But that&#x27;s just me. It&#x27;s a decent cleanser and worth a try, it does smell really good! This is very good and cleaning out the heavy grease.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural, gentle cleanser that could also remove eye makeup.  I also did not want it to be drying.  This cleanser met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. It grosses me out when I try to wash my face with it. I like the feel of it and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again,</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. It is really easy to use anywhere. If you are someone on a tight schedule this is even easy to use in the shower. The smell is nice and fresh. It rinses off easily.</li>
    <li> Pregnancy has made my skin exceptionally dry, yet prone to breakouts, so I was really struggling to find a product that kept my skin clean without stripping it. This cleanser is very mild and feels so soothing... I&#x27;m able to use it both in the morning and at night to remove my makeup. I do use it with my Clarisonic every couple days to help get a good, deep, exfoliating clean. It has a really mild cucumber fragrance that I like.</li>
    <li> I started using this when I was pregnant and needed a gentler cleanser and have kept using it years later.  Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without being drying or &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;-y.</li>
    <li> My friend had an amazing time using this cleanser, so I thought I&#x27;d also give it a go. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much difference to my skin. Other than that, it did feel nice to wash with. My skin is very sensitive and it didn&#x27;t overly dry me out. Just a shame that it didn&#x27;t do more for me.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite natural products. This cleanser is so fantastic for sensitive skin. The pump bottle is a bonus and makes it so easy and quick in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, and usually when I use cleansers my skin gets very dry and starts to peel a little (like skin dandruff lol) but I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and can honestly say I have not noticed that problem since using this.</li>
    <li> My skin is not overly sensitive, but I wanted to switch from using harsh face wash (proactiv and then clean and clear) to organic. This stuff is great...is doesn&#x27;t sud because its more natural. It is very gentle (again, no ezcema or anything serious so not sure about that) on my skin and refreshing...a light cucumber scent that is nice! I think its a great deal for the price. I use this in combination with apple cider vinegar toner (diluted 1 part ACV to 3 parts water) and Burt&#x27;s Bee sensitive skin moisturizer. The combo is great. Not sure if this stuff on its own would be good for acne prone skin, but it works very well on mine. With this regime, my skin feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note....I have blepharitis (itchy dry lids and beyond), and (obviously not a doctor so please be careful) but have been using this to gently clean my lids for two months and it works better than anything else! (ocusoft left my lids itchy and irritated, and flaky, while this leaves them clean and moisturized and soft.)</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this.. really did. It smells great and feels lovely on the skin, but at the end of the day, even though may reviews tout it as a sensitive skin cleaner, we found it too harsh and drying for everyday use... and that&#x27;s kind of a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> smells and feels so good on my skin. hallelujah for this!</li>
    <li> The cleanser is gentle, but I do not feel that it gets my face as clean as I would like.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great! It smells wonderful &amp; rinses cleanly. It&#x27;s not over drying which is great especially since my skin tends to dry out in the winter. I like that the product uses natural ingredients that are healthy for your skin. Will continue to love &amp; use this product!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it but it doesn&#x27;t give my face a super clean feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather very well either, so that could be part of why I feel that way.  It was interesting to try but probably won&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other face clensers and scrubs, and this is the absolute best for my rosacea.  There&#x27;s no parabens or sulfates.</li>
