    <li> I love this color. In between red and pink. Nothing like the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;Really fun when adding stripes or to pair it with Strawberry Smoothie color.</li>
    <li> Nice summer color! It applies thinly and smoothly. It had a sticky texture after curing that removes easily with alcohol.</li>
    <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, I did receive it in a good timely fashion and I love the color!  It looks to be about what I was looking for. I&#x27;m sure it will be great and I look forward to using it soon!</li>
    <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
    <li> Great subtle red color!  It has a shimmer in the color which is beautiful!</li>
    <li> This color is so nice! It is a muted red. Not too bright, but still a very nice shade. Will definitely buy again. Just wish you could see through the bottle.</li>
    <li> Very Happy ! Nice color. Fast delivery. as expected. Very Happy ! it&#x27;s CND. So It&#x27;s good quality. when real.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the shellac system and this, of course, is another color that works just as well. I was a little disappointed in the color itself, though. It was much more red than I anticipated. I thought it would be a dark pink. The color is still pretty, just not what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This polish lasts for weeks with no chipping.  Color will be slightly lighter than shown but I love it.  Will be purchasing more colors.</li>
    <li> I love Shellac and this is a must have color. The price is good, the shipping is great and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great color, looks great with a layer if zillionaire on top too! Great transaction. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>

    <li> This color is great. hey need to make many more colors in red. It is shinny and pretty. Excellent Buy!!!</li>
    <li> color goes on just like it appears. can&#x27;t wait for the warm weather to show off my nails and matching toe nails!!!!</li>
    <li> The QUALITY of this product is wonderful, however, the color is actually a bit different than what it appears to be on amazon. Not drastically, but not exactly what I was expecting. Wears perfectly though, and a beautiful color nonetheless!</li>
