      <li>Hospital cap was fabulous - truly made the hair look and feel clean.  </li>

      <li>Many thanks to who ever invented them.</li>
      <li>I thought this was the most ingenious way for a disabled or elderly person to get that clean feeling, without being able to shampoo and shower, or stand over a sink.  </li>

      <li>I will definately order more of these for my next surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quite reasonable too!</li>
      <li>ALso great when running late and needing to quickly &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; hair and save time from rinsing -- Downside is these prices are too high on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I recommend if you want a nice result with less dripping, get the Comfort Bath brand.</li>
      <li>I am an RN at a large university hospital.  </li>
      <li>After using this cap my hair was very greasy.</li>
      <li>It cleaned throughly and the heat massage was very comforting.</li>
      <li>In the hospital, the one I had left my hair so soft and nice, and I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t drip out of the cap.  </li>
      <li>I bought these due to an injury which prevented me from being able to shower for a while.</li>
      <li>Just warm in microwave, open, put cap on, massage with fingertips, remove cap and dry hair.</li>
      <li>Search you can often buy a case of 30 for under $70.00 from reputable supply houses ($2.33 or less each)</li>
      <li>Massage it in, remove it, lightly towel dry and comb through.  </li>
      <li>I, highly, recommend the caps and the brand; however, I think the packages we purchased were not quite up to par.</li>
      <li>I recommend heating in microwave for 15-20 seconds on high heat for maximum cleansing.</li>
      <li>As soon as I completed brushing a portion of my hair it would knot right back up - this has never happened to my hair before.</li>
      <li>I switched to the shampoo cap, and even though I could only really use one hand, it worked really well.  </li>
      <li>even better when warmed a little by a microwave!  </li>
      <li>It smells refreshing and washes the hair completely, without hardly any effort for the patient.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at the expense for the caps, but I wanted her to have them anyway.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended to take with you for a hospital stay or use during times when a shower isn&#x27;t possible.  </li>
      <li>I even have to towel dry it because it really soaks her hair.</li>
      <li>I suffer from MS and it has become very hard for me to wash my hair while in the shower so I was very excited to find this item.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When the caps arrived, I used the first one and found there appeared to be less liquid or moisture in the cap, but I thought it was coincidental.  </li>

<li> This product can come to your rescue when you&#x27;re sick or hospitalized and unable to shower in order to get that clean and fresh feeling of having clean hair.  </li>
<li> Take off, and towel dry.  </li>
<li> Just towel dry when finished.</li>
<li> I was using dry shampoo</li>
<li> But we tried the dry shampoos and nothing washed her hair out.</li>
<li> This product left a lot of residue in my patients hair, and did not clean it well.</li>
<li> Be careful though; after a while residue builds up in your hair.</li>
<li> I am not sure what I am going to do with the one I still have left</li>
<li> Which I figured was incorrect due to the price</li>
<li> We were without a shower for two weeks due to a bathroom remodel.</li>
<li> Since,the shampoo and conditioner keep contained within the cap there is no drippy mess.</li>
<li> It is not repulsive but it is not a clean smell either.</li>
<li> but after a few days my hair became sticky.  </li>
<li> Besides the pain, not being able to bathe or wash my hair is the worst part of surgery.  </li>
<li> Her hair was thin and sparse</li>
<li> it&#x27;s like giving someone a spa experience after a difficult day.  </li>
<li> Got this for my elderly mom after she had been ill.</li>
<li> She is unable to bend over the sink to wash and rinse her hair, so I can just use this shampoo cap, by warming up in microwave, put on her head, and massage the shampoo into her hair.  </li>
<li> This item is a must for the sick.</li>

    <li> For bedbound people this is a must have.  I am currently chair to bedbound and it helps me a great deal as I can wash my hair on my own.</li>
    <li> This product can come to your rescue when you&#x27;re sick or hospitalized and unable to shower in order to get that clean and fresh feeling of having clean hair.  Highly recommended to take with you for a hospital stay or use during times when a shower isn&#x27;t possible.  Very easy to use - even better when warmed a little by a microwave!  No water needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ReadyBath for my elderly aunt, who can no longer stand in the shower to wash her hair, but her independence is very important to her (facing major health challenges).  She loves the Readybath, because it allows her to be independent with her personal hygiene, and I will continue to purchase ReadyBath for her until she can no longer care for herself.</li>
    <li> When my Mom was in the hospital, she was given one of these caps to wash her hair.  I thought this was the most ingenious way for a disabled or elderly person to get that clean feeling, without being able to shampoo and shower, or stand over a sink.  We were both extremely satisfied with end results.  After she returned from the hospital, I began searching for this product for at-home use.  I was surprised at the expense for the caps, but I wanted her to have them anyway.  When the caps arrived, I used the first one and found there appeared to be less liquid or moisture in the cap, but I thought it was coincidental.  However, the second cap was the same.  I, highly, recommend the caps and the brand; however, I think the packages we purchased were not quite up to par.</li>
    <li> Besides the pain, not being able to bathe or wash my hair is the worst part of surgery.  Then I found these ReadyBath shampoo caps.  These are easy to use and quite effective.  I was using dry shampoo but after a few days my hair became sticky.  I switched to the shampoo cap, and even though I could only really use one hand, it worked really well.  I will definately order more of these for my next surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the product description stated I was buying a 5 pack but was only sent 1 cap.  The seller said there was an error with the listing so I would check with any seller before ordering to make sure you get what you are expecting.  You might also check out this brand [[ASIN:B000837CB4 No Rinse Shampoo Cap]].</li>
    <li> Whil in the hospital for extended stay they used this type of cap on my hair. It not only made me feel good my hair was so clean and conditioned. I found it online and was not dissapointed when I got home. Our daughter in law travels and does not always have available means of shampooing. I gave her some to try and she thinks they are wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I had been given a shampoo cap in the hospital and wanted some for home.  In the hospital, the one I had left my hair so soft and nice, and I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t drip out of the cap.  I tried this brand as the cheapest available.  I recommend if you want a nice result with less dripping, get the Comfort Bath brand.</li>
    <li> I suffer from MS and it has become very hard for me to wash my hair while in the shower so I was very excited to find this item.&lt;br /&gt;First this item said 5/pk. Which I figured was incorrect due to the price so I purchased two. I am not sure what I am going to do with the one I still have left but I will NOT use it. After using this cap my hair was very greasy. It tangled and knotted non stop while brushing it after towel drying (as directed). As soon as I completed brushing a portion of my hair it would knot right back up - this has never happened to my hair before. There is also a smell to this product that I can&#x27;t quite describe but as a female it is not at all what I would want my hair to smell like. It is not repulsive but it is not a clean smell either. I would strongly advise buying another no rinse cap.</li>
    <li> These were a god-send when I was caring for my elderly mother.  Her hair was thin and sparse so they worked well for her; I can&#x27;t speak for how well they would do on a fuller head of hair.</li>
    <li> My mother was in the hospital for over a month, and this was one of the offerings.  It is just fabulous.  You simply warm the package, remove the shower cap and place it on the head. Massage it in, remove it, lightly towel dry and comb through.  It smells refreshing and washes the hair completely, without hardly any effort for the patient.  It can even be done while the person is lying flat on their back. I can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo shower cap ... it&#x27;s like giving someone a spa experience after a difficult day.  WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for the disabled. My son is paralyzed. It cleaned throughly and the heat massage was very comforting. It heats in only 20 seconds in microwave.  Since,the shampoo and conditioner keep contained within the cap there is no drippy mess. Just towel dry when finished. Then throw out the cap.</li>
    <li> They got the job done for what they were</li>
    <li> I am an RN at a large university hospital.  We use this product on our patients.  I am haveing back surgery in about a month and knew this was something I could use.  I ordered 6 of these to have for home use until I can shower and wash my hair.  You can warm them up in the microwave and from the feed back I have gotten from patients they feel great. I like to wash my hair every other day and this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> This item is a great one to keep on your shelf; in caring for my elderly mom, this is a fantastic quick way to perk up her appearance! I strongly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I bought these due to an injury which prevented me from being able to shower for a while. These work great at making your hair feel clean and refreshed. I recommend heating in microwave for 15-20 seconds on high heat for maximum cleansing. Be careful though; after a while residue builds up in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this item!  It has been a great help in washing my mom&#x27;s hair.  She is unable to bend over the sink to wash and rinse her hair, so I can just use this shampoo cap, by warming up in microwave, put on her head, and massage the shampoo into her hair.  Take off, and towel dry.  It&#x27;s easy!  Quite reasonable too!</li>
    <li> Got this for my elderly mom after she had been ill. Wonderful product. Open, put on like a shower cap. Massage. It&#x27;s done!</li>
    <li> easy to use and convienent! Very nice to use when you cannot get in the shower. My Dad had knee surgery. works perfect!!</li>
    <li> I was trying to find the same cap as they use at the Cleveland Clinic hospitals in Cleveland.  My mom was at Marymount in Garfield Heights, Ohio.  Hospital cap was fabulous - truly made the hair look and feel clean.  This product did neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife used these when she was in the hospital.  It works great.</li>
    <li> We were without a shower for two weeks due to a bathroom remodel. The shampoo caps are truly rinseless leaving our hair clean and manageable. Excellent conditioner, ability to heat package is wonderful. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This cap is wonderful!!!  Works great on the elderly and those who can&#x27;t get to&lt;br /&gt;wash there hair on a regular basis.  Many thanks to who ever invented them.</li>
    <li> This item is a must for the sick. My wife fell in love with this item while in the hospital. She always felt better with her hair washed. It is so easy to use. Just warm in microwave, open, put cap on, massage with fingertips, remove cap and dry hair. No rinse, no fuss.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is ideal for individuals bedridden or wheel-chair bound. ALso great when running late and needing to quickly &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; hair and save time from rinsing -- Downside is these prices are too high on Amazon. Search you can often buy a case of 30 for under $70.00 from reputable supply houses ($2.33 or less each)</li>
    <li> My grandmother is bed ridden and we have had to give her bed baths. But we tried the dry shampoos and nothing washed her hair out. These caps are amazing! I warm them up in the microwave for about 15 seconds than apply to her head and begin to massage the cap against her hair for about 2 minutes, once you remove the cap her hair is wet and clean and smells good. I even have to towel dry it because it really soaks her hair. She has a very short hair cut so not sure how this product would work with longer hair, but for us it was perfect</li>
    <li> I used this product and it was so helpful. I would recmend it if you are in need of the help it provides.</li>
    <li> This product left a lot of residue in my patients hair, and did not clean it well. Will not being using this product again.</li>
