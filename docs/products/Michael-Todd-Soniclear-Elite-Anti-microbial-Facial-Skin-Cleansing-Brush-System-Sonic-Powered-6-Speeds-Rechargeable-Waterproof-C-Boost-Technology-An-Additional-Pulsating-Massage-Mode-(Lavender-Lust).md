      <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this product -</li>
      <li>So here is my honest review....</li>
      <li>I was absolutely thrilled to be given the chance to review the Soniclear Anti-microbial Skin Cleansing System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this item through a promotion in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
      <li>Cleaner skin begins with a cleaner brush™, so I&#x27;m here to tell you that this new product that I have, SONICLEAR,  is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>a well as the grips make it very easy to hold and use.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to switch between the speeds, even while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
      <li>innovative design comes nicely packaged and includes a purple plastic charging station and charging cord.</li>
      <li>This is nice :)</li>
      <li>but it is a nice add on for people who love this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I was impressed by how soft the brush is.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
      <li>of the best things about this is the antimicrobial protection, which does not wash off and keeps the brushes clean the whole time you have them.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>and I love that is</li>
      <li>I paired it with my favorite Tula skincare products and they work well together.</li>
      <li>And it does most of the work for you!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and yes I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I think that my skin glows more under my makeup because it doesn&#x27;t have yesterday&#x27;s make up on as well.</li>
      <li>but have never been able to splurge on one despite wanting to.</li>
      <li>I love that it is waterproof, so I can leave it in the shower without worrying about it getting damaged.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love using the body brush on my legs before I</li>
      <li>did receive this product for free from the manufacturer, but all opinions are my own.  </li>
      <li>I love that you  can also use the Michael Todd Soniclear in the shower.  </li>
      <li>After using it once, I was already in love with it.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my skin tone appears more even, my skin is softer, I do not feel as though I am focusing on acne or blackheads like I was before.</li>
      <li>For most of my face I was able to have the Soniclear brush on the highest setting, which made me feel like it was cleaning much better.</li>
      <li>SONICLEAR micro-massages away dirt and impurities and is able to protect itself from contamination.</li>
      <li>Even cooler, the system recognizes which brush head is attached automatically so the appropriate speed is used/delivered.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Another appealing part of the system is that it is said to remove makeup 6x better and cleanse 2x better than hands alone.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that its waterproof because I took it into the shower with me.</li>
      <li>I love that it has removable and replaceable brushes, as well being able to be used in the shower.</li>
      <li>I love that I can just take it in the shower with me in the morning</li>
      <li>if I can use it without issue I would guess that most anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>also love the body brush.</li>
      <li>It is SO much better than what I’ve been using.  </li>
      <li>and it couldn’t possibly be better than what I was already using, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Soniclear micro-massages away dirt and impurities and then protects itself from microbial contamination.&amp;#34; This is just what the Dr. ordered for my safe keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I’ve got so many things to spend on this time of year</li>
      <li>, purple is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that they thought of this because using something like this in the shower with a cleanser can be a slippery experience.</li>
      <li>also love the body brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
      <li>I really love to use the fastest speed.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this</li>
      <li>and I was worried that this brush would irritate my skin more than help it.</li>
      <li>and there is nothing better about this brush compared to one that is $10.</li>
      <li>I love this system.</li>
      <li>I knew that it wasn&#x27;t the most effective way to clean my skin</li>
      <li>It is a very unique tool for my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I take pretty good care of my skin</li>
      <li>love having one device for a full body exfoliation!  </li>
      <li>However, it is also very easy to clean each head.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so clean now!</li>
      <li>My skin is so clean that it glows!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Oh my gosh, what can I say?! I love this system. I was using my Olay brush, but now that this has arrived and I have had a chance to use it, this is going to be my go to. Very powerful system. If you are looking for a brush just to rotate back and forth then this isn&#x27;t for you. This one is a true sonic cleanser. I could tell a difference on my face after first use! I wrote about it!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.infusedreviews.com/2014/11/michael-todd-true-organics-soniclear.html</li>
    <li> I am always looking for great products that will make my beauty routine better.  I received the Michael Todd&#x27;s Soniclear and have been using the system for about 2 weeks.  I love it.  My skin feels so clean.  It also leaves it feeling soft, smooth, and exfoliated.  The system is easy to use too.  The system comes with a charging base.  The base simply plugs into the wall.  The system also comes with 2 brush attachments.  The smaller brush head is perfect for facial cleansing.  I like the larger attachment to smooth dry elbows, knees, and feet.  The Soniclear system has a number of different speed options.  This is great because you can customize this just to your needs.  The brush heads are treated, so that they resist bacteria.  I love that I know that this will keep the system clean and my skin clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free sample provided for a blog review</li>
    <li> The Soniclear has 3 different speeds for the face. I really love to use the fastest speed. It is so fast that I barely touch my skin to get this nice vibrating feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a beeping sound when it is time to move over to the next area. After 2 minutes the device shuts automatically off. I find that I turn it off earlier because my face feels already super clean after 1 minute. I like it quick but strong! It is your own preference! You can also do it longer but on a more gentle level- maybe if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soniclear has 3 different speeds for the body brush as well (the device automatically recognizes which brush head is used). While I am a big fan of the face brush I do not really use the body brush but it is a nice add on for people who love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that probably comes ultimately to mind is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;How is the Soniclear different compared to the Clarisonic?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing all Clarisonic devices and the Soniclear have in common is the speed: they all are 300+ movements/second. So no worries here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used to own the Mia (which is the smaller, travel friendly version of the Clarisonic) and here are the differences I observed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Mia does not have a stand to store! This is really inconvenient and unhygienic cause you have to lay the device down which makes it harder to keep the brush head dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Mia does not have a non slip hand grip and it can get slippery while using in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It does not come with a separate body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Mia does not have different speeds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Clarisonic brush head needS longer to dry then the Soniclear brush head (which is not hygienic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Mia 2 offers different speeds but it still lacks in all other points the Mia lacked mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Soniclear has one more thing none of the Clarisonic devices have: they use a new antimicrobial product protection on their brushes which makes the brush heads longer usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will save you again money in the long run! So instead of replacing the brush head every 3 month (Clarisonic) you only have to replace them every 6 month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads of the Soniclear are also cheaper! (Clarisonic: $27 vs Soniclear: $20- makes $108/year for Clarisonic brush heads and $40/year for Soniclear brush heads!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you don&#x27;t have to think twice on which one you should get! The Soniclear seems a no brainer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you get everything the Clarisonic+ has to offer but for the price of a Mia 2! ;-) (FYI I received the device for free for testing purposes but this is reflects only my own opinion!)l product protection on their brushes which makes the brush heads longer usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will save you again money in the long run!

    <li> As someone who tests out products on a regular basis, I&#x27;m pretty skeptical until I try something. Every once in a while, I find a product that I wish I had tried out much earlier. Soniclear Anti-microbial skin cleansing system is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it easy to use but it&#x27;s lightweight AND waterproof. Being able to use this product in the shower makes it easy to fit into a daily skincare routine. It offers two detachable brush heads - one for the face and one for the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station has a relatively small footprint so it won&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space. The only complaint I have is there isn&#x27;t a storage container for the brush head that you aren&#x27;t using nor is there any kind of shower caddy for it. Those are pretty trivial issues though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big question is... how well does it work? After using it once, I was already in love with it. My skin felt soft and clean. My tween used it also and I suspect we&#x27;ll be fighting over it.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC cleaning system. This is a substantial cleaning wand. Water proof. There is a beep every 20 seconds to prompt you to switch to new area of skin. Think about the last time you did a really good exfoliation on your face; how soft and smooth your skin felt. With Soniclear you get THAT same feeling every SINGLE time you use it! Morning and night!!&lt;br /&gt;There are two brushes included in the box. One for your face and one for your body. After using this 2x&#x27;s a day for almost 3 weeks the brushes don&#x27;t look any different than the day they arrived; so I believe this brush will last for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally in love with my Soniclear!! FANTASTIC product!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this product with an other like it since this is the first skin cleansing system I have ever tried but I have to say I am very impressed with  SONICLEAR from Michael Todd.  My skin feels great and I love that is is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 3 times so far and yes I love this product.  It is one I will use for a long time and that I highly recommend to all my friends and also all my readers.</li>
    <li> You can use any cleaner with this really. No matter what I use, my skin feels softer, looks WAY cleaner and clearer, and the pores on my nose look significantly smaller. This couldn&#x27;t be easier to use and it&#x27;s waterproof and rechargeable, so you can use it in the shower. This comes with both a face and body brush head, which is awesome. Michael Todd recommends using their washes or exfoliators with this, but I noticed that when I use the jojoba charcoal facial scrub, it stains the brush head gray (so just be aware).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has 6 speeds and 2 different heads, and 300+ sonic movements per minute, to really clean your face and body well (6x better than hand cleansing alone). It&#x27;s very easy to switch between the speeds, even while you&#x27;re using it. The face brush is definitely softer than the body brush head, but both are soft. There is also a non-slip grip, so you never drop it when wet. I am able to easily use this for as long as I want in the shower and then just put it back on the charging cradle and never have to worry about it again. When you&#x27;re using it, it actually beeps every 20 seconds for the face and every 60 seconds for the body, and stops for a second to remind you to move to another area of the face or body and then shuts off automatically after 1 minute on the face, 3 minutes on the body. Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about this is the antimicrobial protection, which does not wash off and keeps the brushes clean the whole time you have them. I mean, really, shouldn&#x27;t they all have that? After all, you&#x27;re supposed to be cleaning your face with it. There are also little plastic covers for both brushes to really keep them clean and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple of Soniclear knockoffs in the past and was actually happy with those because they left my skin soft and clean, but this is lightyears ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. This is so soft and gentle on my face, but really, really makes a huge difference everytime I use it. I use my best face washes with this (or Michael Todd products) because this really works the soap into my skin. When I get out of the shower, my face looks like I had a mask on. That&#x27;s how much of a difference it is. So much brighter, softer, and the pores on my nose are almost invisible (which is a HUGE plus for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the body brush. I use this and then a heavy moisturizer after the shower and my skin is so soft and smooth! I&#x27;m not the only one who loves this, it&#x27;s a favorite with natural beauties, bloggers, and celebrities alike.use it. I use my best face washes with this (or Michael Todd products) because this really works the soap into my skin. When I get out of the shower, my face looks like I had a mask on. That&#x27;s how much of a difference it is. So much brighter, softer, and the pores on my nose are almost invisible (which is a HUGE plus for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the body brush. I use this and then a heavy moisturizer after the shower and my skin is so soft and smooth! I&#x27;m not the only one who loves this, it&#x27;s a favorite with natural beauties, bloggers, and celebrities alike.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s travel friendly antimicrobial sonic skin brush. It comes with 2 different heads (face brush head and body brush head) and universal charging dock. Both brush heads are antimicrobial, safe and long lasting brushes. It&#x27;s recommended to change them every 6 months.    I take pretty good care of my skin and I have been using my Soniclear for a few days now and am completely in love with my Soniclear device! My skin is clear and my pores got smaller. Soniclear has helped with everything that was wrong with my skin. Worth the money! Stick with it and it will change your life! I strongly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have never been to a spa or even had a massage, but I imagine it must feel a lot like using the Soniclear! I received a Soniclear Skin Cleanser system by Michael Todd True Organics to review and I have never had anything like this!&lt;br /&gt;The sonic wave powered technology, cleans deeply, yet gently. It produces more than 300 sonic movements per second! It leaves my skin feeling invigorated and alive.&lt;br /&gt;I am in awe of the technology employed in this device. It has 6 speeds - three for each brush. And it knows which brush is on and automatically adjusts to the three speeds for that brush.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are treated with LIFE Antimicrobial Product Protection to guard against the growth of of stain and odor causing bacteria. They will remain protected for the normal life of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The handheld unit is waterproof so you can fully use it in the shower or bath. The handle has soft, non-slip grips to prevent you from dropping it. The shape a well as the grips make it very easy to hold and use. And it does most of the work for you!&lt;br /&gt;The Soniclear is rechargeable and you&#x27;ll get 35 minutes of continuous use from on full charge. Another thing that is very innovative about the Soniclear is it utilizes magnets to recharge it. It is a very unique tool for my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the Soniclear! I would have never guessed at how good my skin would feel after using it! It is like having a luxurious spa treatment without having to leave the house. It&#x27;s one of those things I didn&#x27;t think I needed, but now that I have used it, I don&#x27;t want to be without it because my skin looks and feels so much better!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I was worried that this brush would irritate my skin more than help it. But I was impressed by how soft the brush is. It feels more like a massage for your face than a cleaner! I could tell from the first time I used it that my face was a ton cleaner than it was with just my normal washcloth routine. My skin was soft and a little pink from the exfoliation. Within a week, I noticed the Soniclear making a huge difference in the clarity of my skin. My pores are smaller and the skin is softer and more even looking. The only issue I had is that one day I was out of moisturizer and my skin felt fairly dry until I was able to get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the body brush and the timer is extremely convenient. The best feature of the Soniclear in my opinion is that it is waterproof. I can use it in the shower or bathtub without worrying about it getting wet. The grips are soft and made to prevent it from slipping out of your hand. My only complaint is the cost. I would be hesitant to purchase it for the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely thrilled to be given the chance to review the Soniclear Anti-microbial Skin Cleansing System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a long time user of another (less expensive) brand, and I’ve always been tempted to step up to a higher end cleaner.  My Mom sensibilities always prevented this.  I’ve got so many things to spend on this time of year and it couldn’t possibly be better than what I was already using, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally three seconds after turning on my Soniclear, I was sold.  It is SO much better than what I’ve been using.  The power alone is worth it!  I tend to suffer from congest pores and sometimes also break out.  (How is that even possible at 43?!!)  A week after using this, some of the tiny white heads that I’d been dealing with for months finally cleared.  This shocked me because I’d previously been told at a spa that I’d have to go to a dermatologist to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually concerned about how my skin would react once I realized how powerful the unit was, but it was actually very gentle.  My skin is fair and sensitive so if I can use it without issue I would guess that most anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how my skin feels with the Soniclear!</li>
    <li> I have used other cleansing brushes, but the Soniclear appealed to me because of the antimicrobial properties. What surprised me is that the brush doesn&#x27;t spin - it vibrates or as it notes &amp;#34;micro massages.&amp;#34; I use the Soniclear on both my face and body and have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin - it&#x27;s softer, and the flaking after taking a shower no longer occurs. My skin feels so clean now! The brush fits comfortably in my hand and is easy to operate and charge.</li>
    <li> I suffer from sensitive skin; however, that isn’t always the biggest problem that I face. As far as my face is concerned, I am burdened with uneven skin tones, acne (at least once a month), blackheads, and combination skin. Needless to say, as a woman in my early thirties, there are still times when I feel as though I am a teenager and it is rather embarrassing. The sensitive skin does not stop at my face, nor do my problems! I get dry patches, small bumps, and once again, areas with uneven skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to combat these rather unpleasant skin-periences (see what I did there?), I have tried a number of creams, washes, brushes, cleansers, pads, etc… I have experienced positive results in one or two areas, normally for short periods of time, but nothing amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told by a number of friends that I need a full out skin cleansing system that includes a cleaner brush; however, I have always been rather hesitant due to the price of such systems. After doing a little research and reading a number of positive reviews on the SONICLEAR, I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I was nervous to use my SONICLEAR the first time because I was really worried that the bristles and movement of the brush would be too rough for my sensitive skin but I was pleasantly surprised. Another appealing part of the system is that it is said to remove makeup 6x better and cleanse 2x better than hands alone. Thanks to my uneven skin tone and blemishes I wear makeup anytime I go out socially. If I am heading to the grocery store or running an errand, you normally don’t find me dolled up but outside of small activities, makeup is in place. The problem is, wearing makeup only adds to the conditions that I suffer from so it is nice to have a system that cleans my face properly and does not add to the problems I am already battling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SONICLEAR Anti-microbial Skin Cleaning System comes with 1 Soniclear Device, 1 Facial Brush Head with Cover, 1 Body Brush Head with Cover, 1 Charging Stand, and 1 Charging Cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone that suffers from sensitive skin and multiple skin problems, I have to be honest in saying I have never established a real skin regimen as I have struggled to find one that works. That is another added bonus of the SONICLEAR System. It is waterproof which means I am able to grab it and take it with me into the shower for easy use during an everyday activity. This is a bonus because I did not have to establish a separate time to take care of my skin; a time that I would end up forgetting about. I tell my husband I am going to shower, my SONICLEAR is on the charger right next to the shower, and just seeing it reminds me to grab it as I step inside to wash. Perfect! Since this product can be used in the shower/bath, I should also note that it has a non-slip comfort grip. In other words, someone as clumsy as me hasn’t dropped and broken it … at least not to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the nuts and bolts …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SONICLEAR has six speed options; three for the facial brush and three for the body brush so you can set the speed that is right for you. It even has a stimulating pulse options which actually feels amazingly good on the face. Even cooler, the system recognizes which brush head is attached automatically so the appropriate speed is used/delivered. As you look over the information for the system you will see that you are only supposed to hold the SONICLEAR in one area for a certain period of time (20 seconds for the face and 60 seconds for the body). Every time you are supposed to move the cleanser to another area, the SONICLEAR will beep letting you know! This is to ensure that you receive an even and thorough cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the charging station on the counter in my bathroom; however, there are times when I feel as though it is taking up needed space. The SONICLEAR is supposed to hold a charge for up to 35 minutes of continuous use between charges; however, have charged after every use so I cannot say if this is true or not. I share this because if this is the case, you would only have to bring the charging station out and use it every so often. This would allow you to save space and store your SONICLEAR somewhere other than the counter. Again, for me, the countertop is just easier; it also increases the likelihood that I will remember to take the unit into the shower with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SONICLEAR micro-massages away dirt and impurities and is able to protect itself from contamination. It comes with a two year warranty and celebrity fans of the Cleansing System include Lady Gaga and Oprah; that is saying something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the month (give or take a few days) that I have been using my SONICLEAR I have noticed that my skin tone appears more even, my skin is softer, I do not feel as though I am focusing on acne or blackheads like I was before. As an added bonus, the skin around my elbow area that used to be somewhat rough is really soft. I’m more comfortable when my husband runs his hands over my body, when my daughter rubs her cheek up against mine when she is sleepy, and when I look in the mirror and don’t see redness or icky-ness looking back at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I understand and agree that the SONICLEAR Anti-microbial Skin Cleaning System is not cheap in the short term, it is well worth the investment in the long run. This is the first time I have used a Michael Todd product and after this experience, I definitely would shop from him again!</li>
    <li> I’ve tried several of these facial cleansing brushes from crazily expensive to too-good-to-be-true cheap and had varying results. The most expensive and well-known brand simply stopped working after a few weeks for no known reason. Others have been too harsh and abrasive- though overall I like the squeaky clean feeling they bring to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soniclear by Michael Todd is the first cleansing system I’ve seen that actually comes with an anti-microbial brush so you’re not transferring germs and bacteria back to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This innovative design comes nicely packaged and includes a purple plastic charging station and charging cord. Also, unlike some brushes that can only be used on the face, while ignoring 90% of your skin, this system comes with an interchangeable body brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to use. They recommend charging the unit for 24 hours before the first use. The brush handle is soft for easy gripping and and the entire brush is both cordless and waterproof for use in the bath or shower. The brush features 6 speeds-  3 each for the face and body, including a neat pulsing setting for the body. Attaching and removing the brushes was a lot like opening and closing the child-proof caps on medicine bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lowest setting, which is indicated for sensitive skin. I like how the brush has a built-in timer that beeps when it’s time to move on to a different spot on your face, so you know you aren’t overdoing it. It also switches automatically to the body speed settings when you attach the body brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t experience any skin irritation with this brush- it never felt too harsh or abrasive. It feels like you&#x27;re getting a relaxing facial massage while your skin is being cleansed! And my skin feels and looks amazing after using it. I can truly see a difference in my pores and in the overall smoothness of my skin. I’m planning to purchase one for my teen niece for Christmas, I know she’ll go crazy over it!I know she’ll go crazy over it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Pro X for 4 years now &amp; I loved it, but I thought maybe I was missing out on the Clairsonic hype. So I saw a review &amp; there was a discount code so I bought this system &amp; I&#x27;m really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $100 I have a brush that just vibrates, the bristles don&#x27;t even move against your face! And while the brush FEELS soft at first, it&#x27;s totally not. I find that my face feels pretty banged up after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend ppl buy an Olay Pro X &amp; buy brush sanitizer by elf &amp; spray the brush head before use to kill germs instead of wasting $150 on this face vibrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention how uncomfortable the vibrations feel? So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I usually wash my face with just soap and water. I knew that it wasn&#x27;t the most effective way to clean my skin but it was the easiest. Soap and water didn&#x27;t make my skin oily or too dry. It was simple and easy. Recently I have been wondering if soap and water was doing enough for my face. Every day I put on foundation, bronzer, and blush. I couldn&#x27;t help but worry that all of that makeup has been building up in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get the chance to use the Micahel Todd Soniclear facial cleanser! I have seen similar cleansers in Sephora, Target, Walmart, etc. but have never been able to splurge on one despite wanting to. It is just too hard as a college student to buy these expensive products- even if they are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened up my Soniclear and charged it immediately. The charging directions were very simple. As it charged I read the directions. I learned that this Soniclear Facial Cleanser has different speeds for different skin types! I think that this is such a great feature because not all skin is the same. I also learned that this brush isn&#x27;t just for my face! The Michael Todd Soniclear comes with a brush for your face and a larger brush for your body. The Soniclear will automatically know which brush is attached and will adjust to fit that need. The brush has a timing system so that you aren&#x27;t over-washing or under-washing your face and body. This brush can be used with a cleanser, or if you&#x27;re like me, just soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this cleansing tool a couple of weeks ago and I have used it almost every day. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since using it. I think that my skin glows more under my makeup because it doesn&#x27;t have yesterday&#x27;s make up on as well. My skin is so clean that it glows! When I am done using it I can truly feel that my skin is healthier and cleaner. When I use it I don&#x27;t have to press down hard because the brush itself is already doing all of the work. I just simply move it around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive so I use the sensitive setting and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin irritation! I have paired it both with a cleanser and with regular soap and I found that both were effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention the best part - this product can be used in the shower! I personally find this very convenient. By using it in the shower I wont be making a mess of my sink and I can do it while I let my conditioner soak in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this product. It has done wonders for both my face and my body. My skin is a lot smoother, a lot cleaner, and a lot healthier! I love it! My mom is begging me to buy some extra brush heads so that she can swap them and use it too! It is that good!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive so I use the sensitive setting and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin irritation!

    <li> I am 50 years old and have HUGE cavernous pores on my nose and around the nose area.I am constantly getting pimples and blackheads and I know its a huge no no but I squeeze all the time because I can&#x27;t stand feeling gross. I bought this brush after a particularly &amp;#34;lively&amp;#34; squeezing session that left me bleeding and I am so glad I did because this brush is AWESOME! First of all, it&#x27;s much larger than I imagined and it doesn&#x27;t actually seem to spin like the cheapy brushes do, it vibrates. I think it was the vibration that really cleared out my pores! Whatever it is, I can honestly say that this thing really worked! I use a 5x magnifying mirror (because my near vision isn&#x27;t so great but mostly because it helps me to see what&#x27;s going on with my disgusting pores) and I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my face was. I love the fact that its waterproof because I took it into the shower with me. My suggestion, no matter what your age is you shouldn&#x27;t squeeze or pick your face (yeah, now I can preach, lol) and now there is no reason to. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> When I first received my Soniclear and took it out of the box, I decided to look over the instructions. At first look, my thoughts were “How many instructions do I need for this thing?” however after actually using the product, it is not bad at all, very easy to use. When it came to actually using the Soniclear, I used it with two different types of products, exfoliating cleanser and regular acne face wash. For most of my face I was able to have the Soniclear brush on the highest setting, which made me feel like it was cleaning much better. When it came to the exfoliating cleanser, for me the middle setting was the best way to go, and around the nose on slow. In the end, no matter which setting I had the brush on, my face felt SO clean and smooth, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I did receive this product for review, however this contains only my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Is there one person that has an authentic review on this product?! Every person who has commented on this product has reviews that sound like they are trying to sell it and has a long history of promoting products with 5 stars on all their reviews. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> My thorough review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soniclear arrived quickly, and the thorough packaging made it well-protected, which is important when ordering an item like this; You don&#x27;t want it to arrive damaged and have to go through the hassle of a return or exchange. Been there, done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soniclear itself is substantial. I have used other facial brushes and none were as heavy and well-made as this one. It&#x27;s balanced as well, meaning it&#x27;s not top- or bottom-heavy. The housing is waterproof for use in the shower. I love that I can just take it in the shower with me in the morning and I&#x27;m not wasting time doing my facial routine over the sink. There are also grips on the side for a non-slip hold. I&#x27;m so glad that they thought of this because using something like this in the shower with a cleanser can be a slippery experience. I had no trouble holding on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads themselves are soft, and I like that they&#x27;re antimicrobial; Important when you&#x27;re using something on your face. Besides keeping your skin cleaner, there&#x27;s no chance of re-contamination if your brush is loaded with bacteria from old makeup, dirt, and oil. That&#x27;s something to think about if you have even mild acne; A dirty facial brush could make the problem even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body brush is large, and covers a bigger area in a smaller amount of time. The facial brush is much smaller, but if I would change anything about this device, I would make it a bit smaller still for areas like the nose. It makes quick work of your cheeks and forehead, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it on my nose, but I think that would make this brush even easier to use. I also like that each brush comes with its own cover. When you use a brush like this, you clean it after use and leave it on the charger on the counter. When you go to use it, you expect it to be clean, and with a cover, it will be. You don&#x27;t want your facial brushes getting loaded with dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a recharging cradle - No more batteries! The solid plastic base has a wide footing, so no tipping, and it has a hole for drainage if your brush it still wet when you put it away. What you won&#x27;t find: metal contacts that can corrode and rust up in a steamy bathroom. You don&#x27;t have to make sure the contacts are touching for it to charge, just plop the Soniclear into the base and it starts charging! It also come with a Two Year Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way that the Soniclear is unique is that it has six speed controls (3 for face, and 3 for body) and a timer that lets you know when its time to move to another area. The brush automatically detects which brush head you put on and the timer runs accordingly: 2 minutes for face, and 3 for body with beeps at regular intervals so that each area gets a full treatment. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve never kept a timer in my bathroom, and if a product requires a certain duration of use, I&#x27;m one-Mississippi-ing my way through it. I LOVE this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: I have had horrible problems with clogged pores my whole life. I used the brush for 2 1/2 weeks and I would say my pores are absolutely clearer and smaller than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s recommended you use the brush 3 times a week, but I started with twice a day. It&#x27;s been about a year since my last real facial, so I knew that I needed a super-deep cleaning. I regularly use masks, but it&#x27;s just not the same. When I first used the brush, I broke out with a few big zits, but that was because it was completely cleaning all of the deep-down gunk out of my pores. Once I got all of that up, they went away quickly using the brush; I would say it took 3-5 days for them to heal down to pink marks and another 3-5 days for those to go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny blackheads that I always get on my nose are gone and the whiteheads that I always get right above my chin are dwindling. I paired it with my favorite Tula skincare products and they work well together. The dullness is gone; My skin looks shiny and clean. This brush is not only cleansing my face, but exfoliating as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this brush: Sturdy, substantial, well-made, innovative, smartly designed, EFFECTIVE. That&#x27;s a huge deal. If you are a beauty nut, regular make-up user, have skin problems like acne or blackheads, or just love a good facial, this brush is absolutely for you. A+ing my face, but exfoliating as well.    I cannot say enough good things about this brush: Sturdy, substantial, well-made, innovative, smartly designed, EFFECTIVE. That&#x27;s a huge deal.

    <li> At this price, it is out of the price range of a lot of people, however the fact that it is antimicrobial, so you don&#x27;t have to replace the brush heads does make up for it a little.  I love that it comes with two different sized brush heads, and that it senses which one is attached and adjusts the speed settings.  Each brush head comes with a cover with small holes to let air pass through so it can dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to charge it 24 hours before the first use, but that wasn&#x27;t really a turn off for me.  I love that it is waterproof, so I can leave it in the shower without worrying about it getting damaged. One charge lasts about 35 minutes, so depending on usage, I usually only have to charge it once a week or so.  I love using the body brush on my legs before I shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used any type of sonic brush before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I thought the brushes would feel rough against my skin, especially at high speeds, but these brushes are surprisingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free from the manufacturer, but all opinions are my own.  To read my full review you can visit MeHimAndTheCats.com</li>
    <li> You face feels deeply cleansed after you use this and the charge lasts much longer than other cleansing brushes. It is slightly more expensive than spinning brushes but it&#x27;s much better for your skin, it doesn&#x27;t pull the skin and the sonic action deeply cleanses the skin. The body brush is also great, your skin feels very clean and it cuts your shower time in half. I recommend using the lowest setting of the face brush daily and the highest setting no more that twice weekly. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use the Soniclear for a deep cleaning and a little luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first cleaning, my face felt so clean and smooth. I used the SONICLEAR to help remove my makeup and dirt from the day. I love using it throughout the week when I feel like I need a deep cleaning. It is so gentle on my skin that I find it beneficial to use it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love having one device for a full body exfoliation!  I can use this at the sink and in the shower with no issues.  The brushes are soft and gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Clarisonic all the way</li>
    <li> I like to exfoliate my skin regularly and keep it super smooth. I was happy to try this product out because it sounded like something that could deeply cleanse my face and body as well with it&#x27;s detachable spin brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very simple to use. Once charged, it really doesn&#x27;t have to be charged for a really long time. I been using mine for weeks, practically every day, and the battery still hasn&#x27;t completely died yet. I love that.&lt;br /&gt;The two brush heads are easy to remove and switch from the face brush to the body brush. I can pick whichever face or body cleanser of my choice, dip the brush head into it and then scrub away. I like that there are three different settings to pick from. The highest one being perfect for deep exfoliation (getting rid of the dead skin cells on your face or body. You only need to use that one once or twice a week. The other two settings can be used on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;Another cool thing about the Soniclear is that you can do certain sections evenly. What I mean is it scrubs for a certain amount of minutes, beeps and then starts again. What I like to do is start on one cheek, go to my other cheek, my neck and chin, sides of the face, my forehead, etc. You don&#x27;t have to do this, but I like to.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine both in the shower and out. It feels soothing while it&#x27;s cleaning, like a mini massage. This is nice :)&lt;br /&gt;One other thing that I love about this product is that it is Anti-microbial. However, it is also very easy to clean each head. What I actually do is clean the face brush with a little bit of olive or argan oil to get any makeup off of it and then I wash both brushes with antibacterial soap and let them air dry before using again.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. Of course I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given a Soniclear for reviewing purposes. All of the opinions expressed here are solely based off of my own personal experience with the product and in no way influenced.</li>
    <li> Here are the features I like: It charges quickly and holds it charge for a decent length of time. It is very easy to use. I just hold it in place and let the brush do all the work! It is a lot softer and gentler than I was anticipating. I expected it to be scratch or rough, but it was not. I feel like really does clean better than the makeup remover wipes I use. Of course I lover the color, purple is my favorite. It is pretty light and not obnoxious to hold. The handle is large enough that I can get a good grip, but not too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is that it takes up a lot of space on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks with my normal cleanser and I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s about half as much acne as there was before.  It&#x27;s not a big change, but it&#x27;s enough to justify continuing to use it.  I&#x27;m noticing some brightness changes in my skin, especially in my cheeks right on either side of my nose.  It feels like I&#x27;ve used a light exfoliating scrub afterward.  I don&#x27;t suggest trying to use this to clean over your nose or close to your ears though.  The vibrations that are making that cleaning possible are way too much for me to handle.  It&#x27;s like an extreme tickling sensation that&#x27;s just too strong to stand for more than a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system IS $150.00 at the time I picked it up, which is a little more than I&#x27;d normally spend on a beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antimicrobial for a clean brush every time&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes included (face and body)&lt;br /&gt;3 speeds for each brush&lt;br /&gt;Slight exfoliating effect&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with your regular cleanser or theirs&lt;br /&gt;Rechargable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too soft for use with a strong exfoliating cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Timing beeps are useful, but rather loud (especially in the shower)&lt;br /&gt;Unit turns off after the suggested time so you don&#x27;t overdo it&lt;br /&gt;Even lowest setting is a bit too much for sensitive parts (nose, near ears)</li>
    <li> Cleaner skin begins with a cleaner brush™, so I&#x27;m here to tell you that this new product that I have, SONICLEAR,  is absolutely wonderful.  I  have never had anything like this when I was young, and I wish I did.  I had terrible acne when I was a teenager.  No matter what I did I had blackheads and pimples and at the most inopportune times!  I was so sad!  The sonic skin cleansing brush with built in antimicrobial protection against stain and odor causing bacteria.  Sonic cleansing can create a breeding ground for microbial contamination when skin cells, makeup and moisture residue combine with bacteria that cling to the brush bristles between cleansings.  That&#x27;s why this beauty I&#x27;m giving to my granddaughter who is 16 years old.  She doesn&#x27;t have really bad skin, but this will prevent her from having it I&#x27;m sure.  This is a wonderful product and if you have any teenagers in the house you need to get this for them they will love you for it.  I think it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
    <li> I love the Soniclear! I have a Clarisonic, but I prefer this far and away. The facial cleansing brush head is so much gentler and better for my sensitive reactive skin. I can use it a couple of times per week, without a problem. The body exfoliating brush is great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product - I was really overzealous with it at first and was using it 2x/day which dried out my skin and made me uncomfortable, but since I&#x27;ve established a cleansing routine, this has been a great addition. I don&#x27;t use it exclusively with Michael Todd cleansing products, but anything works with it. It stays clean, the speeds of the brush are comfortable, it keeps its charge for quite a long time - with every day use, I probably only have to charge it once in 2 weeks. I initially didn&#x27;t like the intermittent automatic stopping feature that it has, but I&#x27;ve learned to work with it, and it&#x27;s good for timing if you are picky about how long you use it on various areas of your face. The larger brush head that is meant for body worked really well for cracked heels and exfoliating larger surface areas.</li>
    <li> Get the healthy clean skin you&#x27;ve always dreamed of with Soniclear by Michael Todd True Organics. This beauty must have has 6 cleansing speeds (3 for your face &amp; 3 for your body), it’s waterproof so you can cleanse away dirt in the shower, and it’s also rechargeable! This would be a perfect Holiday Gift!!</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews and heard that even some celebrities used it...that should have been a dead give away that it was a ploy to sell it. Well, I bought into it and actually BOUGHT IT, So here is my honest review....it is not worth the money AT ALL! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This product claims to stay clean and it does because it doesn&#x27;t clean the face very well. The bristles aren&#x27;t very soft. It only has three settings and they vibrate. I was highly disappointed when I got this and found out it doesn&#x27;t spin because  the ones that do tend to clean the face better. This only vibrates, that&#x27;s it. You have to move the brush manually to wash your face while it vibrates. The vibrating action does buffer your face and it feels smooth afterwards, but I was looking for a face brush to clean my face not buffer it, especially not one that costs as much as this one.Trust me, you can find a better product anywhere else at a much cheaper price. SONICLEAR IS A RIPOFF!  I&#x27;m giving it one star because it is a ripoff and there is nothing better about this brush compared to one that is $10. Also the return process is quite difficult, so think twice before you buy from MichaelToddOrganics.com  UPDATE: Returned my item and finally got refund...But did not receive full refund because they have the nerve to Charge you $40 just to take the item back...In other words they try to screw you one way or another. I have never heard of any company making you pay them to take the item back, just to get a partial refund. Normally with trustworthy companies you return their product and they give you your money back and don&#x27;t make up a re-handling fee nonsense just to steal money from your refund. I would have this company looked into as they are not upstanding or trustworthy at all. They are very shady and their products are of low grade quality.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about a year and it stopped working.  I&#x27;ve had a Clarisonic  for 4 years with no problems. I&#x27;m only using  Clarisonic from now on.</li>
    <li> I was more then a little ecstatic to get the Michael Todd Soniclear. Matter of fact I had no idea how much one of these costs, so when I found out after receiving it, I had to be the one to give a try to see what all of the fuss was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me to be able to tell my readers a product was worth the amount this costs it better have jumped through hoops. Well the brush is circular and the results were amazing. I noticed a different in my own skin after the first use, and now that I know how good it works, I am going to order a brush for my husband and my daughter to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a weak immune system and have learned not to share personal products with anyone, not even family. My toothbrush is even kept far away from everyone elssae&#x27;s. OK so back to Soniclear which is amazing if I didn&#x27;t say it already. &amp;#34;Soniclear micro-massages away dirt and impurities and then protects itself from microbial contamination.&amp;#34; This is just what the Dr. ordered for my safe keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gizmo is super easy to use but you can see for yourself in the video towards the bottom of the page. I love that it has removable and replaceable brushes, as well being able to be used in the shower. The best part is that it is rechargeable which means no batteries to fidget with. You can use the Machael Todd Soniclear on both your face and body easily by just changing out the brushes that are included with your kit. Easy twist on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything being said I have to let you know the price is around 150.00. Would I buy it. Yes I would and my order for the brushes for my husband and daughter will go in so they have a little something extra in their stockings this year. I received this item through a promotion in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how clean my face felt after just the first use. The micro massage appears to lift dirt away while the vibration stimulates blood flow. Bottom line is that it felt great!  I love that you  can also use the Michael Todd Soniclear in the shower.  I was very pleased with the results  and highly recommend it. Disclosure: While I did receive this product complimentary through the company, this is my 100% my honest opinion and in no way shape or form change my opinion or alter it in any way.</li>
