### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great shaves from each one!  </li>
      <li>Really impressed with the shave.</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>great for the price.</li>
      <li>I used to buy these from the dollar store and they were great.</li>
      <li>these do not pivot, but the  pivot are even more excellent, just remember to change the angle of shaving with this razor or youll cut yourself.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, quick shipping!</li>
      <li>I use Edge Gel shaving cream, which is good for getting a close shave and good for my face.  </li>
      <li>I found the originals at the Dollar Tree website and they arrived exactly as pictured and they are awesome.</li>
      <li>I love these razors!</li>
      <li>Honestly they should have kept the quality and charged more!</li>
      <li>For what they cost these razors do an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Kind of flimsy</li>
      <li>these are the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s probably my own fault as opposed to the razors.</li>
      <li>I found they are not so good when shaving under the nose as they tend to cut you easily.</li>
      <li>feel a bit &#x27;cheap&#x27; but don&#x27;t let that fool you - good product.</li>
      <li>I felt they were better than good news because they easily lasted 10-20 shaves.</li>
      <li>With a clean, warm face I applied a nice lather from my 99 cent can of Barbasol.</li>
      <li>The original gray version pictured are the best razors that I have ever  used including the high end quad blade type of razors.</li>
      <li>They were OK but better off going to Walmart and getting some 3 or 4 blade razors.</li>
      <li>I like the Personna Speed3 better because they pivot.</li>
      <li>You can even use them more than once.</li>
      <li>I can submit unless I have two more</li>
      <li>Their OK tho</li>
      <li>I am using one a week and they really give a great shave.</li>
      <li>any event, I&#x27;ve never been able to use a disposable blade more than once.</li>
      <li>Based mostly on the price.</li>
      <li>i used to have razor burn from any type or brand of razor, not any more.  </li>
      <li>The razors worked good and they were super cheap</li>
      <li>I loved the old ones 5 Stars !!!</li>
      <li>They look so cheap and simple, but they provide an incredibly close shave.</li>
      <li>Fairly smooth</li>
      <li>Fantastic value</li>
      <li>Then, on a trip to Philly, I was fortunate to have had my disposable blade confiscated at the airport.</li>
      <li>My husband uses all kinds of fancy double edge razors with the best kinds of blades from Feather to Shark to Astras to Gillette and what ever else, and they shave very well once you learn how to use them.</li>
      <li>clean and close</li>
      <li>But if these are the replacements then I have to go back to good news.</li>
      <li>When they returned they looked the same but right out of the package they dragged on the face and dulled easily and really weren&#x27;t even good for one decent shave.</li>
      <li>Cheap, effective and sharp.</li>
      <li>Great shave, but blade rusts and is dull in just 2 days.</li>
      <li>These are okay for generic razors.</li>
      <li>The Mach3 is the only replaceable blade I&#x27;ve used that I can get more than one use out of.</li>
      <li>thanks amazon for having these blades.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a very mild comfortable shave, don&#x27;t cut and last a long time.</li>
      <li>but they get sold out real quick due to the reasonable price</li>
      <li>Used other disposable razors that last weeks,  but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>the main price is the shipping.</li>
      <li>but the do work decent.</li>
      <li>I thought, 10 decent looking razors for $1 ???</li>
      <li>and it grows so quickly that i must shave daily.</li>
      <li>For the closest shave possible you can go back to the fancy double edge razors but for a terrific comfortable cut &amp; nick free every day shave you can&#x27;t beat these!  </li>
      <li>Be sure to completely rinse and dry the blades before storing to keep blades from oxidizing and becoming dull between shaves.</li>
      <li>These shave my face nearly as well as a mach 3!</li>
      <li>My beard is fairly soft</li>
      <li>With these, I&#x27;m surprised to say I can use them twice.</li>
      <li>years old</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s especially irksome to have to spend so much of Mach3&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say my beard is not particularly heavy,</li>
      <li>Ten cents per razor, more than 10 shaves per razor, do the math folks that&#x27;s less than one cent per shave!</li>
      <li>You can probably go to target or walmart and get a few more of this same style and quality for about the same price, but no complaints.</li>
      <li>( I generally use an electric razor )!</li>
      <li>Usually I can&#x27;t even get a full shave out of one.</li>
      <li>After 10 shaves it is still dangerously sharp and the lube strip still looks like new.</li>

<li> It can be very difficult to go back to a more traditional style of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They are extremely light weight and can be difficult to hold.</li>
<li> And then I thought, it won&#x27;t stay sharp or last long.</li>
<li> .....will continue to use the other razor from the same company.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve cut myself a few times but nothing major.</li>
<li> These also can be found at any local dollar tree for a lot less considering</li>
<li> I shave every other day and these razors constantly stay sharp.</li>
<li> I have a chrome safety razor that I used for a long time with satisfactory results, but I would always knick the skin every other shave.</li>
<li> And they are made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: For the ladies out there who may want to shave their legs with these, I would like to inform you that even though they worked well for my wife, the constant exposure to water in the shower will cause these to rust after a few days unless you store them somewhere dry after use.</li>
<li> they have a different angle of cutting, so be aware.</li>
<li> I usually use 3 razors out of the pack of ten per the month.</li>
<li> I like the other type of razors from this company</li>
<li> /make brand, I usually use the other razors from the same company...been using them for sometime....</li>
<li> I was forced to walk into the airport Dollar General, and I bought a pack of these disposable Personna razors.</li>
<li> I use the pink ones to do my legs!</li>
<li> Mach3&#x27;s have an odd hinged head that takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
<li> They do &#x27;pull&#x27; a little</li>
<li> and i mean all for my beard is extremely course</li>
<li> Usually 4-5.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;m broke to the point that I can&#x27;t afford my usually Mach3 blades, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.</li>
<li> These cut me sometimes and that hella sucked, and they are really small.</li>
<li> I get at least 15</li>
<li> They sent a blue colored version with same name and they are TERRIBLE.</li>
<li> so guys (or ladies) with tough beards will probably get fewer shaves.  </li>
<li> To the people who give poor reviews for these razors, they must be daydreaming when they shave their face,legs, etc.</li>
<li> Contoured areas of the face are easier to shave than with the expensive safety razor.</li>
<li> But sadly, they did a bait and switch.</li>
<li> I am sick of how overpriced mach 3 and fusion, etc are, because I am a poor college student yet still would like to look presentable.</li>
<li> terrible product.</li>

    <li> They were OK but better off going to Walmart and getting some 3 or 4 blade razors. These cut me sometimes and that hella sucked, and they are really small. Their OK tho</li>
    <li> The product in the photo of the gray Personna razors is not what shipped. They sent a blue colored version with same name and they are TERRIBLE. Like shaving with a credit card. The original gray version pictured are the best razors that I have ever  used including the high end quad blade type of razors. But sadly, they did a bait and switch. I found the originals at the Dollar Tree website and they arrived exactly as pictured and they are awesome. Don&#x27;t buy these; they are a rip off.</li>
    <li> My husband uses all kinds of fancy double edge razors with the best kinds of blades from Feather to Shark to Astras to Gillette and what ever else, and they shave very well once you learn how to use them. But you cannot beat these personna twin blade razaors for the price and the shave. They&#x27;re a very mild comfortable shave, don&#x27;t cut and last a long time. For the closest shave possible you can go back to the fancy double edge razors but for a terrific comfortable cut &amp; nick free every day shave you can&#x27;t beat these!  Fantastic value and you get 10 for a dollar at the Dollar Tree! I use the pink ones to do my legs!</li>
    <li> Its not disposable razor.  Its replaceable ones. Do not order if you&#x27;re looking for a disposable stick to come with the razor.</li>
    <li> thought they came with handle so cant you them</li>
    <li> I have a chrome safety razor that I used for a long time with satisfactory results, but I would always knick the skin every other shave. Then, on a trip to Philly, I was fortunate to have had my disposable blade confiscated at the airport. I was forced to walk into the airport Dollar General, and I bought a pack of these disposable Personna razors. They revolutionized my shave. I don&#x27;t think I have ever cut myself with these razors. They look so cheap and simple, but they provide an incredibly close shave. Contoured areas of the face are easier to shave than with the expensive safety razor.</li>
    <li> Requested by the homeless shelter staff</li>
    <li> I used to buy these from the dollar store and they were great. I felt they were better than good news because they easily lasted 10-20 shaves. Then they disappeared at all our local stores for 6 months. When they returned they looked the same but right out of the package they dragged on the face and dulled easily and really weren&#x27;t even good for one decent shave. I loved the old ones 5 Stars !!! But if these are the replacements then I have to go back to good news. Honestly they should have kept the quality and charged more!</li>
    <li> These are not razors - they are just the blades.  I know have a pack of blades without a razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, quick shipping!</li>
    <li> These are okay for generic razors. They are extremely light weight and can be difficult to hold. I found they are not so good when shaving under the nose as they tend to cut you easily. These also can be found at any local dollar tree for a lot less considering the main price is the shipping.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! Really impressed with the shave. I am using one a week and they really give a great shave. Great buy!</li>
    <li> To the people who give poor reviews for these razors, they must be daydreaming when they shave their face,legs, etc. I shave every other day and these razors constantly stay sharp.I usually use 3 razors out of the pack of ten per the month. Dollar Tree, the razors cost $1.00.HIGHLY SUGGESTED</li>
    <li> You can probably go to target or walmart and get a few more of this same style and quality for about the same price, but no complaints.</li>
    <li> my name is thomas and i&#x27;ve been shaving since i was 14, and now i&#x27;m 60. i&#x27;ve used every type of razor imaginable and can tell you these twin blade with comfort coating beat the pants off all and i mean all for my beard is extremely course and it grows so quickly that i must shave daily. even 4 and 5 blade razors can&#x27;t compete with this one.</li>
    <li> i used to have razor burn from any type or brand of razor, not any more.  these are the absolute best.  they have a different angle of cutting, so be aware. these do not pivot, but the  pivot are even more excellent, just remember to change the angle of shaving with this razor or youll cut yourself. thanks amazon for having these blades.</li>
    <li> I needed to shave. I am sick of how overpriced mach 3 and fusion, etc are, because I am a poor college student yet still would like to look presentable. I was at my local dollar tree and saw these. I thought, 10 decent looking razors for $1 ??? I bought 3 packs. I took them home. I took a shower. With a clean, warm face I applied a nice lather from my 99 cent can of Barbasol. And then... I was amazed. These shave my face nearly as well as a mach 3! And then I thought, it won&#x27;t stay sharp or last long. After 10 shaves it is still dangerously sharp and the lube strip still looks like new. Ten cents per razor, more than 10 shaves per razor, do the math folks that&#x27;s less than one cent per shave! Try them! And they are made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: For the ladies out there who may want to shave their legs with these, I would like to inform you that even though they worked well for my wife, the constant exposure to water in the shower will cause these to rust after a few days unless you store them somewhere dry after use.</li>
    <li> The razors worked good and they were super cheap so I have to give this 5 stars. You can even use them more than once.</li>
    <li> Great shave, but blade rusts and is dull in just 2 days. Used other disposable razors that last weeks,  but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> For what they cost these razors do an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;Very clean and close shave - will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;They feel a bit &#x27;cheap&#x27; but don&#x27;t let that fool you - good product.</li>
    <li> At the 99 Cent Store, I buy these in packs of 10.  With tax included, they cost about 11 cents each.  I get at least 15 great shaves from each one!  I&#x27;d say my beard is not particularly heavy, so guys (or ladies) with tough beards will probably get fewer shaves.  I use Edge Gel shaving cream, which is good for getting a close shave and good for my face.  Be sure to completely rinse and dry the blades before storing to keep blades from oxidizing and becoming dull between shaves.</li>
    <li> you can get these same razors for a $1 at your local dallor store. but the do work decent.</li>
    <li> These are only used as a last resort...( I generally use an electric razor )! They do &#x27;pull&#x27; a little but I can deal with that.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m broke to the point that I can&#x27;t afford my usually Mach3 blades, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. Based mostly on the price. The Mach3 is the only replaceable blade I&#x27;ve used that I can get more than one use out of. Usually 4-5. My beard is fairly soft so it&#x27;s especially irksome to have to spend so much of Mach3&#x27;s. A design that&#x27;s what 20? years old now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I&#x27;ve never been able to use a disposable blade more than once. Usually I can&#x27;t even get a full shave out of one. With these, I&#x27;m surprised to say I can use them twice. Sometimes even three times. I get a passably close shave. Fairly smooth and I end up with the beginning of sandpaper 8-12 hours later but not enough to have a shadow. I&#x27;ve cut myself a few times but nothing major. I think that&#x27;s probably my own fault as opposed to the razors. Anyone that&#x27;s used a Mach3 will know what I&#x27;m talking about. Mach3&#x27;s have an odd hinged head that takes a bit of getting used to. It can be very difficult to go back to a more traditional style of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m still broke the next time I need blades, I&#x27;ll get these again.</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy but they work</li>
    <li> terrible product. Like something from 1981. get two shaves out of one blade.... maybe... doesn&#x27;t even rinse well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;says I can submit unless I have two more words&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried &amp; they did well. They gave me a close shave too. I like the Personna Speed3 better because they pivot.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective and sharp.</li>
    <li> I like the other type of razors from this company/make brand, I usually use the other razors from the same company...been using them for sometime....use to get them at Walmart but they get sold out real quick due to the reasonable price.....will continue to use the other razor from the same company.</li>
    <li> great for the price. I get a close shav e and no cuts.</li>
