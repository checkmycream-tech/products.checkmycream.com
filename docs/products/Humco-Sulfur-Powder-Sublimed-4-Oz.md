      <li>IS a fabulous conditioner.  </li>

      <li>But overall really good product.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty strong, but that&#x27;s about what you&#x27;d expect from sulfur.  </li>
      <li>It also shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with any kind of skin problems.</li>

      <li>So far I love the progress.</li>
      <li>I cannot give You Feedback right now</li>
      <li>I used a small amount of this in my hair oil mixture and it works great for a hair growth remedy.</li>
      <li>This product mixed with my Sweet Sunnah Organic Rosemary Carrot Hair Oil Rocks!!  </li>
      <li>I am avid hunter.</li>
      <li>This item was received within the time and was exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>I saw this on youtube &amp; thought i give it a try, Im pleased with the results, and it will last a year</li>
      <li>This is my first time purchasing this</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the results i got in such a short period of time.</li>
      <li>It pure Sulfur Powder.</li>
      <li>I really like this brand of sulfur..</li>
      <li>They really need to lower their price by using a 4oz.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The chiggers haven&#x27;t been much of a problem since we started to use the sulfur</li>
      <li>It is very drying</li>
      <li>nothing to really say about this product since i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
      <li>I have learned that a light dusting on socks and around the waist is enough to keep chiggers and ticks off.</li>
      <li>AND IT HAS PROVEN TO WORK VERY WELL FOR HAIR GROWTH...</li>
      <li>ive used sulfur products before, but this one really smells, i guess because its straight up sulfur.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>and I have seen resuls much faster.  </li>
      <li>I have not noticed any real improvement in my breakouts since using this</li>
      <li>It really helps relieve a itchy scalp</li>
      <li>Powdered sulfur is one of the main active ingredients in Clearasil, but just using the sulfur without the benzyl peroxide seems to give better results and avoids the greasy, staining paste of that product.</li>
      <li>AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It really helps clear up my acne.</li>
      <li>maybe some tea tree oil for extra antimicrobial power and lavendar and/or camomile extracts to calm the skin and limit redness.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sulfur mix with jamaican black castor oil and sweet almond oil  on my scalp for a month now, and it has grown my hair so much</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen, online that people mix emu and sulfur to help grow their hair, but this hasn&#x27;t made my facial hair grow haha!</li>
      <li>I still feel like I&#x27;m being ripped off because the price is higher to pay for the extra 2 oz. of bottle space that&#x27;s not being used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really careful to add only a little bit since sulfur is pretty strong (and since I don&#x27;t want my face to smell!).</li>
      <li>I find it helpful so far and notice that my hair has grown a bit.  </li>
      <li>but so far I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>I received the same package and was very effective.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>The sulfur has so far seemed to work.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t wash the sulfur near your eyes, it will burn for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep goats and this winter they contracted lice.  I had read that giving sulfur to them would get rid of the lice.  It did and their coats look great.</li>
    <li> My daughter has excema on her legs bad and this product has not only stopped the raw itching but it has even cleared up any dark marks left. GREAT PRODUCT. I use this in my natural hair with a oil and it definitely helps with growth. I will order again</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product it was just what I needed. It helped to read others reviews and they were very accurate with the description of the product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this and I&#x27;ve used it in a recipe to help grow your edges.  I&#x27;ve only made one batch so we&#x27;ll see how it works.</li>
    <li> nothing to really say about this product since i don&#x27;t use it anymore. i guess if i find a use for it i will have something to sayl.</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING IT BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MY HAIR AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time controlling my eczema, and have used virtually everything under the sun.  This product is really good for all kinds of skin conditions.  My eczema cleared up in under a week, and the itchiness is just gone.  I have never been so relieved.  I mix it with my lotion and apply to the rash, once or twice a day.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with any kind of skin problems.</li>
    <li> I use this as a topical powder for sores, itches etc.  However, I also substitute plain sulfur for it as well.  I buy this mostly for friends and family so I can send some home with them when they have issues for which sulfur is a help.</li>
    <li> ive used sulfur products before, but this one really smells, i guess because its straight up sulfur. i really never found out if it worked properly because it made my entire bed smell like sulfur because i slept with it on.</li>
    <li> I saw this on youtube &amp; thought i give it a try, Im pleased with the results, and it will last a year</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of sulfur.. It did not cause scalp irritation unlike some brands out there. I made my own concoction of an oil blend with essential oils and a tsp of sulfur.. I love it!! I&#x27;ve been getting some good growth... The only disadvantage is that the sulfur clumps up when mixed with oil. But overall really good product.</li>
    <li> The sulfur has so far seemed to work. The chiggers haven&#x27;t been much of a problem since we started to use the sulfur</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading many articles on pimple/acne treatments.  The smell is as expected, like spoiled eggs.  The powder does not really break down when mixing with maskes or daily moisturizer and seams to sit atop your skin instead of absorbing into it.  I have not noticed any real improvement in my breakouts since using this so I would skip it and go for the standard salicilic acid wash and benzoil peroxide leave on treatment daily...maybe some tea tree oil for extra antimicrobial power and lavendar and/or camomile extracts to calm the skin and limit redness.</li>
    <li> I use the sulfur in my hair mixture to grow back my edges. It works with consistency and patience. I will continue to reorder!</li>
    <li> Awesome Product and very versatile. I use it in face mask, hair products and minor cuts and bruises. I wish there was a scoop to dispense it, otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> Sulfur Powder Sublimed is what use to be sold as Flowers of Sulfur, in England.  This product is recommended for scabies (a mite) and acne.  How not sure.  But I purchased as a gift for my mother&#x27;s cousin, who lives in southern Missouri.</li>
    <li> I just started using sulphur for hair growth.I mix it with my hair grease. U can halso mix the sulphur with your hair oil as well.So far I love the progress.</li>
    <li> The sublimed sulfur is very pure and of good quality. I mixed a little of this sulfur with vinegar to make a paste, not thick but not  watery. I applied it with a cotton pad onto my hand that has tiny blisters that itched so so bad. I rubbed on it until the blisters turned whitish and punctured, and left the solution on it overnight. It totally stopped the blisters from getting worse and most importantly there is no more itch and it is almost gone after several uses.</li>
    <li> This product reduces the oily feeling of my skin on my face.  Powdered sulfur is one of the main active ingredients in Clearasil, but just using the sulfur without the benzyl peroxide seems to give better results and avoids the greasy, staining paste of that product.</li>
    <li> I use this in conduction with my facial soap and let it sit for a bit like a mask and I wash it off. It really helps clear up my acne. It is very drying so I&#x27;d advise on following up with a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also tried using this with essential oil for hair growth both as a pre-conditioning treatment and a daily use for scalp massage but it was inconclusive.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with acne breakout on my face. I read sulfur helps against acne, so I decided to try it. I mixed the sulfur with my face wash every night and it actually cleared my acne.  I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s having problems with acne. Don&#x27;t wash the sulfur near your eyes, it will burn for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcia Smith</li>
    <li> It smells medicinal.  I was so embarrassed at work because though I took a bath after using it, one of my co-workers said that I stunk.  I STILL cannot get rid of the smell of rotten eggs that has also permeated clothes I wore when treated and the day after.  AVOID!</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL.  i MIX IT WITH A COMBINATION OF OILS AND IT HAS PROVEN TO WORK VERY WELL FOR HAIR GROWTH...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HAIRLINE!</li>
    <li> Sulfur power is a very good product.  The smell is strong, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Thanks! As described.</li>
    <li> I initially gave this product 1 star because I thought they were dishonest in the amount I received. When I opened the 4 oz. bottle it was only half full, so I felt I had been ripped off, but another reviewer said she measured it in another bottle and it was actually 4 oz., but they used a 6oz. bottle to package it in. They really need to lower their price by using a 4oz. bottle instead of a 6 oz. bottle. I still feel like I&#x27;m being ripped off because the price is higher to pay for the extra 2 oz. of bottle space that&#x27;s not being used. So instead of giving them a 1 star as I initially did, I&#x27;m giving them 2 stars for passing the cost of the unused 2 oz. on their customers, because 4 oz should not be almost $8 bucks!!!</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product I have noticed that my face and my hair has been coming up with these pustules.However, I mix it with coconut oil, emu oil and black jamacan castor oil to ensure proper moisture and dilution. Not only that; I have never had issues with Acne or any skin trouble but since using this product I have had to get a Microdermabrasion just to clear up the bumps.  The upside is that it works great for my boyfriends flakyness.  Maybe, my skin is just a bit too sensitive for this product.</li>
    <li> I have 4 a/b hair and bought this to help aid my growth.  I made my mixture and have been using for 2 months now and I&#x27;m shocked and suprised to see that I have gained an inch \\&quot;EACH\\&quot; month since I&#x27;ve started using it.  This mix works better for me than the MN Challenge and I have seen resuls much faster.  I highly recommend purchasing this powder if you are looking to make a hair sulfur mix just be extremely careful NOT to inhale any of the powder, I put a scarf over my nose when handling this powder.  The recipie I use is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NJoy&#x27;s Sulfur Mix for Hair Growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 heaping tsp Sublimed Sulfur Powder&lt;br /&gt;4 oz Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;2 oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;2 oz Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)&lt;br /&gt;4-5 drops Rosemary Oil (optional)&lt;br /&gt;4-5 drops Peppermint Oil (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;My\\&quot; mix&lt;br /&gt;1 heaping tsp Sublimed Sulfur Powder&lt;br /&gt;4 oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;4 oz Wild Growth Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is I apply a small amount in my problem area on my scalp every night or every other night, baggy (cover my head with shower cap) and wrap my scarf around my head and that&#x27;s it! I personally don&#x27;t get a lot of buildup on my scalp and I usually wash once every two weeks or once a month.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible even when I mixed it with lavender and peppermint oil. I did not stick with it long enough to see if my hair would grow.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for a skin condition.  Mix it with alcohol and it clears it up in a few days.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my scalp (for growth) and have been for three weeks.  I find it helpful so far and notice that my hair has grown a bit.  It does have a stinch to it but it&#x27;s really not that bad.  I read that mixing sulfur with coconut oil reduces the smell of the sulfur; I mixed the product with the coconut oil in the beginning so I don&#x27;t know if the stinch is stronger without it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment arrived quickly; totally legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great buy!</li>
    <li> My body, unfortunately dislikes Sulfur very much. It made me itch. So I can&#x27;t say rather it works or not.</li>
    <li> This sulphur product was effective for me. I used it in a body lotion for skin ailment. It worked.&lt;br /&gt;Also mixed some of the sulphur with my cats flea powder-- it worked. Cat is no longer itching . Best product for skin ailments.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of this for my mother who was making a salve for a rash.  I purchased it after seeing a poster mentioned that it was great for adding to hot oil treatments.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over two weeks now.  And it blends in well with my hair oils.  And I can see a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product helps my hair grow.  I only use it in my hair oils not alot just a little.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old bottle of sulur powder(sublimed) for several years.It was given to me by my father who has since passed.He had told me in wwII they had serval uses for this product including healing bullet wounds.I ran out and could not locate it at any stores so went online.I was hoping it was the same since co. name was different.Thank God it was since I have found serveral uses for it.</li>
    <li> They were shipped promptly. The product is great.  I used to purchase this same product at the local drugstore. Now that they do not have it, ordering online is the only option. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I MIX THIS WITH MY OILS AS A HAIR TREATMENT HOPEFULLY I SEE A DIFFERENCE  IN MY HAIR WILL UPDATE AS SOON AS I SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR</li>
    <li> But I have every confidence it will be just as effectiveon me as it has been on all the other customers who rated it highly.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product for hair growth! Heard great reviews about it so far so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll have some good results as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sulfur mix with jamaican black castor oil and sweet almond oil  on my scalp for a month now, and it has grown my hair so much</li>
    <li> I just started on 15th Of April 2013 I cannot give You Feedback right now but I think I&#x27;m going to like it...</li>
    <li> I used a small amount of this in my hair oil mixture and it works great for a hair growth remedy.</li>
    <li> This sulfur powder is as described.  I bought it for my face for some blemish areas.  Seems to help reduce them somewhat.  If I mix it with my soap for face washing, it leaves my face nice and soft.  You just must be careful not to get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I mixed this (per another reviewer) with some oils.  Applied to my hair and scalp, wore a plastic cap overnite and shampooed 12 hours later.  Man!  This is some conditioner!  My hair feels fantastic!  Good grief!! It is sooooo silky!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS a fabulous conditioner.  I will definitely be using this again.&lt;br /&gt;Ten stars!&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Update - 01-14-14&lt;br /&gt;Made a FACIAL mask.  Another \\&quot;wow\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short while but so far I have no complaints. It does have a smell but not to the point where it&#x27;s not useable. Anyway I&#x27;ll be able to give a better detail review of how this product worked for me and my hair growth 2 months from now.</li>
    <li> I am avid hunter. I hunt primarily in Florida. Chiggers and ticks are everywhere! I did some research and learned that sulfur powder is supposed to keep chiggers and ticks off.  Guess what?  It works! In August I got a nasty infestation of chiggers after scouting a creek bottom. I got the Humco Sulfur Powder in October and returned to the creek bottom. When I got home I was chigger free.  I did experience a mild, burning/itching reaction to the sulfur powder, but not too bad.  I have learned that a light dusting on socks and around the waist is enough to keep chiggers and ticks off.</li>
    <li> This product mixed with my Sweet Sunnah Organic Rosemary Carrot Hair Oil Rocks!!  Stopped my persistent itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Luv This!</li>
    <li> Humco is a great product.  I got just what I ordered and it is great for keeping red bugs off.  It also shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The product is sold as sulfur, but it is very hard to determine if it actually is. There is no ingredients listed on the package and it does not smell like sulfur.</li>
    <li> it cut my hair. How do you use it to grow yours? i use 1 tbsp of powder with 4 oz of oil. What went wrong? i also had headaches</li>
    <li> My neighbor said this is good for flu, to put a tiny bit on top of wood stove. I did and it does seem to help. You should not use much as there would be blue flame. My Mom used to give a little of this to cats with milk for distemper.</li>
    <li> I add Sulfur Power to my conditioner; love the benefits to the hair!! I will continue to use this product!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for mixing into my homemade face masks.  It smells pretty strong, but that&#x27;s about what you&#x27;d expect from sulfur.  I&#x27;m really careful to add only a little bit since sulfur is pretty strong (and since I don&#x27;t want my face to smell!).</li>
    <li> I made a sulfur hair oil with Humco Sulfur Powder, and I was very pleased with the results. It was very easy to use, mix and pour. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This item was received within the time and was exactly as pictured.  It was well packaged.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I made my own sulfur mix for my scalp, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell, even when I added peppermint and rosemary oil.</li>
    <li> I use this product as part of my natural hair treatment because of my psoriasis. The amount that they give you will last a long time and not expensive either.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.. will last a very long time. Was very satisfied with my transaction.  Product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a short time and I already see a good amount of hair growth. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I mix it with my hair oil to decrease fungal growth. Sulfur is good for decreasing the growth of fungal proliferation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  exactly what I wanted.  Thank you for your prompt service. Very good for hair and scalp issues. Thanks</li>
    <li> Got this to add to my body butter and make an hair oil. Shipped quickly and bottle was larger than expected</li>
    <li> I mix this with my hair products, Sulfur is good for your hair. So if you are looking for a product to add to hair grease, or oil, this is it</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results i got in such a short period of time.I would recommend this product to anyone who has experienced hair thining or hair loss.</li>
    <li> Used in our Chinchilla&#x27;s dust bath because he had bald itchy spots.  Used for three weeks and he&#x27;s all better.  No longer itchy and no longer bald.  Remember to only use a teaspoon mixed with a cup of dust.  Smells a little funky but so worth the results!  Works on skin rashes for people too, mix with your favorite lotion.  Works wonder for skin rashes, look it up!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I received the same package and was very effective.&lt;br /&gt;My Doctor told me to use it and it did work for what I need. It pure Sulfur Powder.</li>
    <li> Yesss!!...I used the sulfur powder, mixed w/ Olive oil &amp; tea tree oil to relieve hair scalp dryness &amp; itching. So far, so good!!... It was worth the buy!!...☺</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for mixing with natural oils. It really helps relieve a itchy scalp</li>
    <li> I mix 2 parts sulfur powder with 8 parts emu oil to use topically for acne. I used to use, de la cruz&#x27;s sulfur ointment. I had good results with that and I used it for years. But, the only downfall was that you could see my skin flaking off! When I mix sulfur and emu oil, I get better results, without the crusty skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my face, avoiding the skin under my eyes, in the morning and at night. I don&#x27;t wash it off after 10 minutes like de la cruz&#x27;s sulfur ointment directions say to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen, online that people mix emu and sulfur to help grow their hair, but this hasn&#x27;t made my facial hair grow haha!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to create my sulfur based hair mix for my natural hair growth journey. Its cheaper and more natural then buying a product with sulfur. Also, I get more for less.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001V9OWNU Humco Sulfur Powder Sublimed - 4 Oz]]</li>
    <li> Item came promptly and was very helpful for my little grandson. We will ordered it again when we run out</li>
    <li> First, this simple first aid treatment as become impossible to find.  I searched for months for something that would help, all the while wondering what happened to plain old sulfur powder. I wanted something dry because moisture is part of the problem and because hopefully he wouldn&#x27;t be so desperate to lick it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, all the sores I sprickled it on healed overnight.</li>
