      <li>These are the best wax strips that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I really loved Veet!</li>
      <li>Be brave.</li>
      <li>I mostly use them for my eyebrows, and these strips are perfect for that.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find the product I prefer I would or a wax-er who does a good job.  </li>
      <li>This arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>the strips were fabulous!!</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon theses strips, and they are AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I tried for 10 minutes to warm them up and make them work.</li>
      <li>this is the best waxing strips that are fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>waxing product available!</li>
      <li>and I love this product.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s hope others have a better experience.</li>
      <li>Not so sure about bikini, but if you want to wax your face, these ones are the way to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff, I love how it works and not that much pain keeps hair away for a long time.</li>
      <li>light scent... but not overpowering...</li>
      <li>I am usually sensitive and swell, turn red, and breakout after waxing, but this veet strips are AWESOME!</li>
      <li>perhaps I need to exfoliate more or warm it up more because it doesn&#x27;t pull hardly any hair off.</li>
      <li>They were SO easy to use, and pretty clean except for a tiny bit that got on my cheek, which was easily wiped away by the finishing wipes.</li>
      <li>yeah, right....</li>
      <li>I used the strips on my face, and they work better than some regular wax you spread on yourself.  </li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t hurt and leaves skin smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>the whole package is not enough to clean even One ARM!</li>
      <li>I guess if you needed to use it on a large portion of body, like your legs or \\&quot;lady\\&quot; area.  </li>
      <li>This product comes in strips with a slathering of wax in the shape of a large oval.  </li>
      <li>what I found is that you really need to be PATIENT... and apply PRESSURE in order for these to work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my whole life and never tried anything else like waxing or plucking</li>
      <li>I have tryed them on the bakini area and under arms and don&#x27;t have much luck.</li>
      <li>I threw the whole box away.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended these!</li>
      <li>but you really do need to be patient and allow the pressure you apply to heat up and then heartlessly rip that hair out.  </li>
      <li>They were just as good, if not better than the wax that I got professionally.</li>
      <li>These wax strips are very easy to use, and I do not find them messy at all.</li>
      <li>I tried it a few times but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to rip away the rougher hairs.</li>
      <li>I did use it along the bikini line where the hair is baby soft and it worked like a charm leaving just some red spots I&#x27;m hoping fades quickly; but, when I tried this on my legs it did NOT work.</li>
      <li>Plus it leaves your upper lip really smooth, i would definitely  buy this again.</li>
      <li>inspired by you tube (for real), I decided to get a box of these and give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;The strips cut easily, if you want smaller strips customized to your lip / brow area or other....</li>
      <li>They leave embarrassing marks on your face that clearly show everyone that you just waxed if you don&#x27;t use it literally everywhere!</li>
      <li>My first use of this product was on my upper lip.</li>
      <li>the strips are so tiny and the price is a bit much for the size they are!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been known to have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>So I suppose if you have soft hair give it a go.</li>
      <li>They all went directly to the trash.</li>
      <li>I was using the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; flavor, too.</li>
      <li>It barely pulled any.</li>
      <li>worked like a charm, the hair came right off with little pain.</li>
      <li>Hot mess.</li>
      <li>Honetsly I love this product, it works well and it pulls off the hairs easily and it isnt as painful as other wax strips.</li>
      <li>This is much easier to use than any heated or liquid wax which I have tryed once, made a mess and there for never tryed again.</li>

<li> This is much easier to use than any heated or liquid wax which I have tryed once, made a mess and there for never tryed again.</li>
<li> small papers, very week papers actually, with a \\&quot;spot\\&quot; of wax on them...</li>
<li> But for rough leg hair, I&#x27;d say this was a major miss.</li>
<li> As I was trying to open them, the wax would stick only to one side, leaving one side waxless while the other would not even stick to my thumb.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t hurt long...</li>
<li> It is dry, doesn&#x27;t stick, thus doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
<li> so the first part of each strip doesn&#x27;t get pulled well and some wax always get stayed behind.</li>
<li> enclosed are three tiny wipes to remove the waxy mess...</li>
<li> I followed the directions carefully.  </li>
<li> It pulled out only a few hairs and hurt like heck.</li>
<li> especially people for thick coarse hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried using a couple of other brands of ready-to-use wax</li>
<li> While moving I found that I had a couple of the small Veet strips left</li>
<li> Now, I won&#x27;t have to be self conscious about my lip, and won&#x27;t have to ride public transportation to an expensive hair salon to get it done</li>
<li> Despite the uselessness of the shape (for me at least ) the wax isn&#x27;t even sticky enough to pull hair.  </li>
<li> All it did was leave a sticky, gooey mess under my armpit.</li>
<li> You have to use the greasy little packets they provide to wipe it off.</li>
<li> It just left a sticky mess behind.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
<li> To anyone who says they&#x27;re messy, what the heck were you doing?</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> If you get any results you&#x27;ll still have a few straggler hairs you&#x27;re going to have to pluck yourself.  </li>
<li> but I was just left with a horrible mess, which their enclosed wipes didn&#x27;t clean off.  </li>
<li> so no more dresses for a little while.</li>
<li> But when I went to buy more I accidentally picked up the Sally Hanson brand strips, those things are completely awful!!!</li>
<li> You can reuse the strip a few times before needing another one!  </li>
<li> This is a very messy product.....</li>
<li> I am the type that hardly leaves comments</li>
<li> If I could give a negative star review I would.</li>
<li> Not a good product.  </li>
<li> They hurt a lot less, they take ALL of those annoying black hairs but don&#x27;t leave embarrassing marks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m tired of paying $20-30/mth on lip &amp; brow waxing...</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s useless, leaves a sticky mess, and a bad shape.  </li>
<li> I will not make the mistake of buying the wrong brand again.</li>
<li> Waaay to expensive.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy them, the seller is terrible and the product is plain bad!</li>
<li> Maybe I got a bad box.</li>
<li> Terribly painful.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve gotten sick of the shaving and decided to give this a try.</li>
<li> This is terrible!</li>
<li> These wax strips are beyond horrible.</li>
<li> a terrible product!</li>
<li> This product is the worst thing I have ever used in my life.</li>

    <li> This is much easier to use than any heated or liquid wax which I have tryed once, made a mess and there for never tryed again. My first use of this product was on my upper lip. the strips were fabulous!! worked like a charm, the hair came right off with little pain. I have tryed them on the bakini area and under arms and don&#x27;t have much luck. perhaps I need to exfoliate more or warm it up more because it doesn&#x27;t pull hardly any hair off. But for the finer hair on the face it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is a very messy product.....enclosed are three tiny wipes to remove the waxy mess...yeah, right....</li>
    <li> R u kidding me...this is the best waxing strips that are fast and easy.  I am the type that hardly leaves comments and I love this product. This product comes with 4 wipes that can be reused and 20 wax strips with vitamin E and almond oil. These wax strips are not plastic, but cloth that can also be reused.  I doesn&#x27;t hurt and leaves skin smooth and soft.  I am usually sensitive and swell, turn red, and breakout after waxing, but this veet strips are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Honetsly I love this product, it works well and it pulls off the hairs easily and it isnt as painful as other wax strips. Plus it leaves your upper lip really smooth, i would definitely  buy this again.</li>
    <li> I tried these wax strips- they didn&#x27;t remove hair, just left sticky waxy stuff all over my skin.  I followed the directions carefully.  I tried several different times to be sure it wasn&#x27;t something I was doing wrong but I was just left with a horrible mess, which their enclosed wipes didn&#x27;t clean off.  I would never buy these again.  If I could give a negative star review I would.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time in good condition.  I used the strips on my face, and they work better than some regular wax you spread on yourself.  You can reuse the strip a few times before needing another one!  I think it will last a while.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is terrible! especially people for thick coarse hair. I used it on my underarms and I think it only pulled off 25% of my hair from using 4 strips lol&lt;br /&gt;What a terrible product!</li>
    <li> My mom works at a salon, so over my university winter break, I went and got my upper lip waxed. However, yesterday I looked in the mirror and the sight of my upper lip hit me like a bullet! Immediately I rushed to the nearest Safeway Grocery Store, and looked for a waxing kit. I stumbled upon theses strips, and they are AMAZING. To anyone who says they&#x27;re messy, what the heck were you doing? Rubbing them all over your face? They were SO easy to use, and pretty clean except for a tiny bit that got on my cheek, which was easily wiped away by the finishing wipes. They were just as good, if not better than the wax that I got professionally. Now, I won&#x27;t have to be self conscious about my lip, and won&#x27;t have to ride public transportation to an expensive hair salon to get it done (Oh, the life of a broke college student). I highly recommended these!</li>
    <li> small papers, very week papers actually, with a \\&quot;spot\\&quot; of wax on them...I could not imagine such a quality...the whole package is not enough to clean even One ARM!</li>
    <li> These are the best wax strips that I have ever used.  I only use them for removing stray eyebrow hairs.  These wax strips are very easy to use, and I do not find them messy at all.</li>
    <li> Hardly enough wax for a lip.  Waaay to expensive.  Cheaper just have done than theese things.  Also didnt work well either</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my chin, I was very happy with the results! But when I went to buy more I accidentally picked up the Sally Hanson brand strips, those things are completely awful!!! They leave embarrassing marks on your face that clearly show everyone that you just waxed if you don&#x27;t use it literally everywhere! While moving I found that I had a couple of the small Veet strips left so I used them, and I was impressed all over again!!! They hurt a lot less, they take ALL of those annoying black hairs but don&#x27;t leave embarrassing marks. I will not make the mistake of buying the wrong brand again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying $20-30/mth on lip &amp; brow waxing... inspired by you tube (for real), I decided to get a box of these and give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;The strips cut easily, if you want smaller strips customized to your lip / brow area or other.... what I found is that you really need to be PATIENT... and apply PRESSURE in order for these to work.  Be brave. You can do it!!&lt;br /&gt;The hair does come off... but you really do need to be patient and allow the pressure you apply to heat up and then heartlessly rip that hair out.  You don&#x27;t want it... GET RID OF IT! It won&#x27;t hurt long...&lt;br /&gt;As for the &#x27;almond&#x27;... light scent... but not overpowering... whatever... I&#x27;m in it for the wax.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tricky to come off, the wipes work well... so does baby oil.  Not cotton balls. Hot mess. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use them again... but I may upgrade if this DIY wax thing continues to work out.  If not, well... I&#x27;ll be getting a brow pencil won&#x27;t I.  (gulp).&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered it in hopes it would be similar to the Nair strips they sell.  Something I could use on my upper lip.  This product comes in strips with a slathering of wax in the shape of a large oval.  There&#x27;s no way you could use this on your upper lip w/o having to cut it into strips your self.  It&#x27;s fine I guess if you needed to use it on a large portion of body, like your legs or \\&quot;lady\\&quot; area.  Despite the uselessness of the shape (for me at least ) the wax isn&#x27;t even sticky enough to pull hair.  I have regular body hair.  Not too thick, not too thin, not coarse, not that fine, dark and easy to see against my lighter skin.  It barely pulled any. It just left a sticky mess behind. You have to use the greasy little packets they provide to wipe it off. You can&#x27;t just wash it off with soap and water.  So it&#x27;s useless, leaves a sticky mess, and a bad shape.  I wish I could find the product I prefer I would or a wax-er who does a good job.  If you get any results you&#x27;ll still have a few straggler hairs you&#x27;re going to have to pluck yourself.  FYI I did also try using it on my legs and bikini area.  It worked in the bikini area only b/c the hair is thicker and coarser.  Best of luck!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. It is dry, doesn&#x27;t stick, thus doesn&#x27;t remove the hair. Maybe I got a bad box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a couple of other brands of ready-to-use wax and I always come back to these ones. I&#x27;m not a fan of the oil wipes that come with it, so I tend to just rinse whatever I wax with soap and water. I mostly use them for my eyebrows, and these strips are perfect for that. Not so sure about bikini, but if you want to wax your face, these ones are the way to go.</li>
    <li> They took the hair off of my back, but I am terribly red.  My wife helped me do this 6 hours ago, and we followed all directions.  Terribly painful.  I was using the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; flavor, too.</li>
    <li> Not a good product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst thing I have ever used in my life. I tried the Veet for underarms. I followed the directions exactly. Did it pull off any hairs? No, it did not. All it did was leave a sticky, gooey mess under my armpit. I threw the whole box away. Don&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I really loved Veet! Its the best &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; waxing product available! I would recommend it to all the girlies out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my whole life and never tried anything else like waxing or plucking and I&#x27;ve gotten sick of the shaving and decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve never been known to have sensitive skin but this seems to do something to me. I did use it along the bikini line where the hair is baby soft and it worked like a charm leaving just some red spots I&#x27;m hoping fades quickly; but, when I tried this on my legs it did NOT work. It pulled out only a few hairs and hurt like heck. I tried it a few times but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to rip away the rougher hairs. Now my legs are patchy and red so no more dresses for a little while. So I suppose if you have soft hair give it a go. But for rough leg hair, I&#x27;d say this was a major miss. Also, the wax is a pain to get off. I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to pain so the first part of each strip doesn&#x27;t get pulled well and some wax always get stayed behind. For me, the wipes they give you did not get the wax off and I was stuck with it on me for a while. Let&#x27;s hope others have a better experience.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, I love how it works and not that much pain keeps hair away for a long time. It has some oil tissues with it  so it cleans up excess wax or residue.</li>
    <li> the strips are so tiny and the price is a bit much for the size they are! wish i could have seen how big the strips were before buying them!</li>
    <li> These wax strips are beyond horrible. I tried for 10 minutes to warm them up and make them work. I even tried warming them up with my hair drier. Nothing helped. As I was trying to open them, the wax would stick only to one side, leaving one side waxless while the other would not even stick to my thumb. They all went directly to the trash. Oh, not to mention that it took them two weeks to arrive! Don&#x27;t buy them, the seller is terrible and the product is plain bad!</li>
