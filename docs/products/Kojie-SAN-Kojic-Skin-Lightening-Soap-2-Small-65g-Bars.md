      <li>I love this soap and fast shipping too ^ ^</li>
      <li>I even started washing my body with it, but it melts so quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>This soap does exactly what it says it will do to your face lightening your face up, but make sure you will use some face cream with it or you will have a shinning and glowing face, also it will be dry but smooth to the touch.</li>
      <li>I received it really fast!</li>
      <li>Minimal lightening noted in about the 4th week of use, nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>I was willing to take.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>A WHOLE LOT!</li>
      <li>You will see a difference the first use.</li>
      <li>PS not to mention I spent hundreds of dollars on microderm/Peels and TRI-luma and none of them gave me this kind of results in just a day to now three weeks</li>
      <li>I took a quick selfie the next day and saw that my skin tone was evening out, and a pimple I had was going away super fast, and a scar I have seems to be evening out!</li>
      <li>it really worked to remove acne, dark spots from my face, body so far its a really good soap</li>
      <li>;) I&#x27;m back to my original complexion.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to apply much makeup at all now.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast as well.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.  </li>
      <li>This soap is not for taking a whole bath because it will be gone as soon as you lather it up.</li>
      <li>On an unexpected note, my KP has pretty much disappeared while using this.</li>
      <li>in this little time:) so I continued to use it because I wanted faster results</li>
      <li>It would be better to have long lasting results.</li>
      <li>it makes a thick leather and it smell nice.</li>
      <li>this soap or any other soap will not make you light skin.</li>

      <li>an i looked VERY old for my age and people use to think I was the oldest and ask why you look</li>
      <li>never usually get pimples</li>
      <li>and I was like wow!</li>
      <li>I have a natural glow</li>
      <li>So far it has lighted my skin after about a week of use, but not my scars.</li>
      <li>So far I have no complaints about the soap or the customer service.</li>
      <li>far I&#x27;ve used this product three times.</li>
      <li>It does make your skin soft though.  </li>
      <li>I use it every other day because it burns, my face gets red then after few mins it looks good</li>
      <li>It does dry a bit, but I am willing to endure this until my hyper pigmentation  scars are faded.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better just to get the big bar and not the 2 small bars.</li>
      <li>After the first time (only washed that night)my face seemed brighter the next morning, so of course I kept using it</li>
      <li>This soap has worked better for me than many of the expensive facial products/treatments that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
      <li>The first time and the other two times I left it on for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>

<li> This lightening soap will help fade dark spots on skin, clear skin and brighten your complexion.</li>
<li> it is small, but you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
<li> The key to using this soap is not to leave it on too long on the face.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin much like some reviewers have mentioned but that may be due to the fact that I have used chemical peels before in the past.</li>
<li> I have hyper-pigmentation due to sun damage (not wearing sunscreen) and everyone is noticing a difference and its only been three weeks of me using this stuff!</li>
<li> I have not open this pack up yet because I am still using the other pack I had brought.</li>
<li> It will make your face skin dry</li>
<li> It do lighten the skin and it will make your skin have a shining glow too, if you don&#x27;t like the glow or shine then put on some face cream that will help lighten your face or stop your face from feeling dry.</li>
<li> It is small, but you really need a little to begin with to see how it will do on your skin.</li>
<li> but I think I might start using it once a day or every other day because the skin around my nose was red and started to peel due to irritation.</li>
<li> It tends to leave the skin dry and watch out for cuts this soap will make it BURNNN, but other than that.</li>
<li> My skin is brighter, there are less blackheads and the few blemishes I have recently gotten are already going away.</li>
<li> I notice that when I use this I can sometimes feel a tingly feeling which would be due to the acid.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face everyday for the last few months and it has worked miracles.</li>
<li> My skin is dark but it still has worked well for my complexion.</li>
<li> This soap helps with acne, dark spots and it lightens the skin.</li>

    <li> **i&#x27;m not using this to get lighter. I&#x27;m only using this for even skin**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used this product three times. After the first time (only washed that night)my face seemed brighter the next morning, so of course I kept using it but this time I started the morning and night routine for faster results. I took a quick selfie the next day and saw that my skin tone was evening out, and a pimple I had was going away super fast, and a scar I have seems to be evening out! I&#x27;m going to continue to use it. I left it on my face for 1 min. The first time and the other two times I left it on for 3 to 5 minutes. I&#x27;m going to exfoliate next time and see what happens. I also wash my neck so it&#x27;s blends with my face.</li>
    <li> AMAZING SOAP!!! BETTER THAN KOJIE SAN DREAM WHITE!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, good product works good on skin, takes a while for it to work but worth the work thanks</li>
    <li> I love this soap and fast shipping too ^ ^</li>
    <li> Works great and these smaller sizes are good for travel, but I still prefer the bigger size bars. Can&#x27;t leave home w/o Beauty Regiments</li>
    <li> So far it has lighted my skin after about a week of use, but not my scars. It does dry a bit, but I am willing to endure this until my hyper pigmentation  scars are faded. On an unexpected note, my KP has pretty much disappeared while using this. Nice side effect!</li>
    <li> I got my soap two weeks ago and I already see a difference in my skin! Im glowing and im going to stock up!!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it , love it..fantastic product and it works.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for the Seller. 2 stars for the Soap.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap for hyper pigmentation it didn&#x27;t lighten the marks.&lt;br /&gt;It did however cause clear beautiful skin maybe one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;BUT when I stopped using it my face began to breakout with nasty pimples.&lt;br /&gt;I never usually get pimples so I know this soap was the cause.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known about that before I bought it but hey it&#x27;s the chance I was willing to take.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> The only bad thing about this soap is the size, it only lasted a week for me. But it leaves me skin sooo smooth offcourse youd have to moisturize afterwards. It tends to leave the skin dry and watch out for cuts this soap will make it BURNNN, but other than that. This soap is good, ill be buying again!</li>
    <li> This soap is the best.  It works fast clearing skin discolorations well and giving skin a nice look.  This soap has worked better for me than many of the expensive facial products/treatments that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  My skin is dark but it still has worked well for my complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face everyday for the last few months and it has worked miracles. My skin tone is even and has  brightened. I have a natural glow and I don&#x27;t have to apply much makeup at all now. The soap works, it just requires consistency. Also, make sure you have a good moisturizer, it does tend to be a bit drying.</li>
    <li> This soap is FANTASTIC! It is safely lifting discolored patches on my face. I have hyper-pigmentation due to sun damage (not wearing sunscreen) and everyone is noticing a difference and its only been three weeks of me using this stuff! This is now a staple in my skin/body regimen! The shipping was fast as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, but nothing! Not working for me at all. It didn&#x27;t lighten me</li>
    <li> I brought the soap About three weeks ago I received it really fast! Once I read all the reviews I was like let me try it now, So I did and the first time it burned really bad I was like omg I going to be bleeding but after I rinse it off, I notice my skin was smooth bright and I was like wow! in this little time:) so I continued to use it because I wanted faster results so I used it the times a day and I have see my skin transform so much better I&#x27;m 1.5 lighter and I a very dark skin person my sister uses it as well but she caramel complexion and now she have change shades to where she&#x27;s a very light /white complexion! she almost 40 and looks 20! and I&#x27;m only 36 and I wanted to look my age because I had very bad keloid skin ,melasma from having my last to kids an i looked VERY old for my age and people use to think I was the oldest and ask why you look so old!/ but since I been using this saop I will say thank you to whoever made it I thought I would never look as youthful and bright as I do now and I&#x27;m was A DARK skin girl but not anymore!;) I&#x27;m back to my original complexion. I will be buying again.PS not to mention I spent hundreds of dollars on microderm/Peels and TRI-luma and none of them gave me this kind of results in just a day to now three weeks I&#x27;m almost flawless.</li>
    <li> Is a good soap but it didn&#x27;t go with my skin type</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the skin lightening soap. I have been using the soap for a month now. The texture of my skin has improved dramatically and the discoloration has faded a lot. I have plans to continue using this soap even after the marks have cleared up entirely. I have noticed a few bumps on my checks, however, I believe those are from dairy. So far I have no complaints about the soap or the customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and will buy some more of it. This soap helps with acne, dark spots and it lightens the skin. I feel you will need to get a skin lightener to help the process. You will see a difference the first use. It is small, but you really need a little to begin with to see how it will do on your skin. It will have your skin tingling then you have to wash it off. I think when it tingles it is saying wash me off. I order this soap and another different 2 pack. It is the same soap and works the same. I have not open this pack up yet because I am still using the other pack I had brought. People this soap is amazing and works really really well on the skin..it is small, but you don&#x27;t have to use much of it. This soap is not for taking a whole bath because it will be gone as soon as you lather it up. Oh yeah..it makes a thick leather and it smell nice. After every wash there will be a tingling on your face, I like it but I know it is time to wash it off. It do lighten the skin and it will make your skin have a shining glow too, if you don&#x27;t like the glow or shine then put on some face cream that will help lighten your face or stop your face from feeling dry. It will make your face skin dry so use some sort of face cream. I personally use skin lightener cream like Nadinola. It works great with this soap for me..and my daughter. This soap does exactly what it says it will do to your face lightening your face up, but make sure you will use some face cream with it or you will have a shinning and glowing face, also it will be dry but smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> Minimal lightening noted in about the 4th week of use, nothing spectacular. IT did brighten my completion, but once u stop you return to your original color. It would be better to have long lasting results.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results with this soap. It was drying on my skin as well. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m light skinned white female. , I see no difference in between thighs where I&#x27;m trying to lighten :( using once a day used 2 bars already . Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> The soap works. Lightened up my darksports i totally would recommend this to people with darkspot problems. I love it</li>
    <li> it really worked to remove acne, dark spots from my face, body so far its a really good soap I use it every other day because it burns, my face gets red then after few mins it looks good its been some months now using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for not even a week and I already see a difference in my skin. Several people thought I have been wearing makeup but I tell them I am using this soap and it has done wonders for my acne and hyper pigmentation.  When I do wear makeup I notice it goes on a lot smoother and my skin looks a lot more even than before I started using this soap. I use it 2x a day but I think I might start using it once a day or every other day because the skin around my nose was red and started to peel due to irritation. To help with the peeling I used Neosporin. Even with the peeling and irritation this soap is worth the buy! I am so happy with it. You just have to figure out what works for your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this soap to rid my face of pimples and blemishes but be careful, it could become very irritating to your skin.</li>
    <li> This soap work for some people, I have been using this soap for 5 months and to be honest this soap or any other soap will not make you light skin. This lightening soap will help fade dark spots on skin, clear skin and brighten your complexion. If you are using lightening soaps consider bleaching lotions and creams, also try lightening pills. Just using this soap will not make you light skin.</li>
    <li> I went through a really bad acne period and it left me it bad dark acne scars. I have been using various brightening products but none of them worked like this Kojie San lightening soap. I have been using it every night to take my make up off and it has brightened up my face A WHOLE LOT! my scars are almost gone and i&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks. I even started washing my body with it, but it melts so quick. It&#x27;s better just to get the big bar and not the 2 small bars. I tried the small bars first just to see if it works. My big bars are on the way! I love this soap.</li>
    <li> The key to using this soap is not to leave it on too long on the face. You can leave it on the body for three minutes but for the face in often just wash it off as soon as I develop a rich lather. Must have but don&#x27;t over do it</li>
    <li> Does not lighten and dries out the skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and can already see a little bit of a difference. My skin is brighter, there are less blackheads and the few blemishes I have recently gotten are already going away. I notice that when I use this I can sometimes feel a tingly feeling which would be due to the acid. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin much like some reviewers have mentioned but that may be due to the fact that I have used chemical peels before in the past. I definitely recommend this soap because it does work.</li>
    <li> I may purchase this but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.  It does make your skin soft though.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
</ol>
