      <li>a plus the container is quite a good size</li>
      <li>this is a superior product.</li>
      <li>My Honey, loved this Honee.</li>
      <li>Loved this waxing kit.</li>
      <li>have tried the Sugar Wax kit offered by bodyhonee too and absolutely loved that one for my arms and legs and anywhere my hairs were not SO darn stubborn and</li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>It does a good job removing the hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every wax out there, this is good stuff.</li>
      <li>For the price I was expecting a product hugely superior to what you can buy in a drugstore, but that was not what I found.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m really happy to say that this method specifically is the absolute best way to remove one&#x27;s hair, atleast for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair removals but this one has been the best by far!&lt;br /&gt;It was able to remove everything</li>
      <li>Great kit, just need patience, experience, more strips oil and spatulas</li>
      <li>Product stays warm for a fair amount of time although periodic reheating is needed to do both legs.</li>
      <li>I found that it worked best when it was thinner -- right after heating.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have those huge strings of wax coming off of the stick when I was trying to apply it to my legs!!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Removed my hair easily (tho never painlessly, lol).</li>
      <li>Just did more damage than good.</li>
      <li>Run the orange lid under warm water and the lid will twist off easely.</li>
      <li>So you would think this wax is really awesome since its highly rated top 10 on amazon!</li>
      <li>If a product is good , I have no problem supporting it!!!</li>
      <li>Its very easy to use</li>
      <li>the wax was Very strong but Got.hard</li>
      <li>This is BY FAR - and I&#x27;m not kidding - the best wax I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have some handy when you are waxing.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best wax for him that we have purchased.</li>
      <li>More strips and sticks would be nice, but the company has to make money somehow!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>So strong!</li>
      <li>Great and super easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to do on your own, quite painless, and the user manual is also very detailed.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a very simple but excellent product.</li>
      <li>excellent on the private area.</li>
      <li>I think you better put some baby powder on your skin before putting this beast</li>
      <li>I fear I may not be able to reopen the jar for another use -</li>
      <li>Buy hey, love love love this product.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product!</li>
      <li>and im the type of person who will make sure</li>
      <li>Wow - if &#x27;sticky&#x27; is a good thing for wax, you can have too much of a good thing.</li>
      <li>smooth as glass!</li>
      <li>For the price, I would expect more strips.</li>
      <li>And the wax only took 1 minute in the microwave to be perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE! It is painful, useless, and SO STICKY! The strips left several sizable bruises that lasted for days and even caused some minor bleeding. Some bad reviews have cited this product as their first experience with waxing, however I have waxed successfully in the past many times. In addition to leaving me with sore, unsightly bruises, I was so sticky! it is NOT water soluble, and the wipes that come with the box are little or no help. I tried soaps, lotions, and the wipes, and the only thing that seemed to remove the wax was vigorous scrubbing my skin until it was screaming red! The kit may say &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; but it hardly removed any hair at all! At first I thought I was using the strips incorrectly, so I reread the instructions and tried changing the sizes of the strips and thickness of the honey spread. It still didn&#x27;t work! On top of all of this, I developed bumps on my skin after using the wax. This product should come with a safety warning!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was expecting! Great and super easy to use. It&#x27;s going to save me so much money from going to the salon to get waxed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s messy, hard to clean up, and for a first time bikini/genital waxer, oh so painful. The pain I got over. The aftermath however, was something else. The hair did grow back much finer, but after a few weeks I noticed what I thought to be deep pimples in the area. Turns out they were deep ingrown hairs. I couldn’t stand it. Hoping no one else had the same effect, even after careful sterilization of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was satisfied with the result right after. smooth as glass!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wicked. I&#x27;ve usually used the blue box of the same brand, but I gave the Extra Strength a try this time. Stuff is much stickier and gets hotter in the microwave. Don&#x27;t lose the little bottle it comes with because that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll get the stuff off yourself afterward. A bath really get nothing to make gross sticky feeling on my legs go away. I went through 1.5 bottles of Goo Gone removing the wax i spilled on the counter and couch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used wax for almost 10 years now, and I did not like this one. To me, it was just too messy, even though I followed every direction on the paper. Will not by again!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a lot of waxes but this one didn&#x27;t break me out and I didn&#x27;t have those huge strings of wax coming off of the stick when I was trying to apply it to my legs!! Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> At home waxing is hard and messy, but this stuff works pretty well! I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin one bit since I started using it. Easily saved for later and reusable, so it&#x27;s a really great value!</li>
    <li> It works, it&#x27;s amazing....period. Used it on my underarm, stomach, face and it pulled every strand of hair right off. I used to spend $240 monthly at the spa for full body wax but now, all I go for is a monthly brazillian for $40 bucks. I wax all the other areas myself now. It works.&lt;br /&gt;Tried Sally Hansen removal kit. That was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I ran out of the wooden stick applicator and the white strip. And if that wax gets on any of your clothes, there&#x27;s no getting it off. Buy hey, love love love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this wax i have used many different kinds and this one by far has worked the best follow the directions and you will have great results!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on legs. Be careful with the heat...this does heat quickly and there&#x27;s a fine line between the perfect temp/consistency and too hot. Product stays warm for a fair amount of time although periodic reheating is needed to do both legs. One pot of wax will do both legs (from the knee down) with enough left over to do a single leg. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product for what your paying..the only thing is you will want to buy extra strips and sticks because there is only a few in there. Also could cause some irritation so make sure you have something to sooth the skin afterward.</li>
    <li> This wax was incredibly strong.  It did a pretty good job or removing the hair I applied it to, but it also took the skin with it.  I mean, literally took the skin off to the point where I had blood that kind of seeped to the surface, and deep enough to develop scabs.  NOt what I was looking for, but I mean, if you&#x27;re desperate to remove the hair, this will do it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just me, I can&#x27;t do this. at-home waxing not my forte.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t helpful in getting the really hard parts.  And it was messy.</li>
    <li> Works great on longer hair but not as well on short stubby hair</li>
    <li> This is a 3 coat wax. 1 on you,1 on the applicator, and 1on the floor. Use mineral oil or baby oil to clean up.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and put the wax in the microwave for 1-2 minutes. I then proceeded to wax my legs, I found that the waxing strips are high quality and really pull a lot of hair off at once. It took me a few tries to really get the hang of it and not use to much wax but once I got a hang of it, it was super easy and left my legs looking AMAZING! While I am a SUPER hairy person It left my legs hairless for almost a week and I&#x27;ve noticed since the hair isn&#x27;t as thick and isn&#x27;t growing as fast. I will definitely be using their kit in the future.</li>
    <li> I had never tried waxing before. This worked great, hair stayed entirely gone for a week. It took a lot longer than I expected at only a few square inches per &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t include quite enough wax to do my full body, even though I&#x27;m not very large (5&#x27;9&amp;#34;, 130 lb) and I ended up having to skip underarms a bit of the upper leg. Also, a couple more of the woven paper strips would have been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to experiment with a couple other types of wax before I come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!!!!  First couldn&#x27;t get into it.  The lid was so tight, and several people tried.  Finally took a knife to it and was a nightmare.  I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great!!! Love this stuff so much!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going with wax, go with this!</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time last night. Absolutely in love with this product!!! I have only used it on mine and my hubby&#x27;s eyebrows, but it worked like a charm!!! My hubby said that it was much less painful than he was used to when he got them professionally done. It was about the same to me, but not as bad when you pull it off yourself, versus waiting on someone else to do it, lol. Definitely plan on trying it out on my underarms and bikini area this weekend when I have a little extra time. So glad I went with BodyHonee brand-will definitely be a repeat customer!!! :)</li>
    <li> Not enough strips compared to the wax. Really needs to come in a set with a warmer. The lid gets stuck on it and it cools rather quickly so you constantly have to keep re-heating it. Does the job for now.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for over 30 years. This is BY FAR - and I&#x27;m not kidding - the best wax I have ever used. I recenlty purchased a second box and will not use any other from this point on. The only drawback is you will run out of strips (included in box) before you run out of wax. I purchased a roll from a beauty supply store, which lasted me over 2 years.</li>
    <li> Worth the price! It is a very efficient and effective product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Only got 5% of the hair out and my skin was almost bleeding. Will go back to using my Sally Hansen Brazilian Wax.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but it&#x27;s really sticky so is really hard to get off if you get it on your body</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman and this wax worked wonderful on my facial hair.</li>
    <li> Great at-home kit! The wax itself works just as well as professional salon wax. Be prepared to buy extra applicators and cloth strips - but that&#x27;s no big deal. Just a forewarning - the wax can be messy when hot so let cool before the wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; get all over your countertop. I love this wax though and am happy to have found something that will save money in the long run!</li>
    <li> I went to emergency care from this product.&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself worked perfectly. I usually use the sugaring method of hair removal, but I wanted to try something that really got all the hair off once so I don&#x27;t go over the same spot five times.&lt;br /&gt;This got all the hair off in the first rip. My underarms took less than 5 minutes each to do because it was so strong and effective. I thought this was the best product ever.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I usually have slightly sensitive skin even with the sugaring where it&#x27;s a little itchy and bumpy after, but aloe vera and some lotion take it away entirely.&lt;br /&gt;This broke me out in rashes so bad I had to go to urgent care and they put me on prednisone because no other topical steroid cream would get rid of it. The rashes covered my entire body with the exception of the right side of my back and face. they were painful and incredibly itchy! Clothes were so uncomfortable and laying in bed and heat just made it worse. I only waxed my lower legs and underarms, but it broke me out on my thighs, stomach, chest, lower back, sides, feet, hands, and arms. I&#x27;m still fighting off the last part of the rash and it&#x27;s been over a month.&lt;br /&gt;I can not say this loud enough, STAY AWAY from this product.&lt;br /&gt;(the picture attached os under my arm, where the rash took over. You probably can&#x27;t tell in the picture but it&#x27;s extremely raised and red)</li>
    <li> the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever done it not only did not work but when I tried using it left a scar on my leg.</li>
    <li> Great product, very pleased with the ease of use and the outcome but there is not enough of the cloth strips, application sticks or cleaning towelettes.  I&#x27;m hoping to be able to buy more of those seperatley since I only used about a quarter of the wax.</li>
    <li> Product works well for an affordable at home kit.  It only comes with 2 applicator sticks. I would recommend getting some extra. I found that the strips were very large and I ended up cutting them into 4 because I was only doing a bikini wax. Although depending on the area  you want to treat 8 might not be enough for a larger areas. The finishing oil comes in two wet nap like packages. You may be to purchase extra if you pan on using this note than once.  Make sure the wax stays at a very thin liquid consistency as well.  Reheating may be necessary. If the wax it&#x27;s thick it hurts more and doesn&#x27;t work as well. Overall I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years and always used the same product, gigi bikini wax but I stumbled upon this because the other just wasn&#x27;t doing that great of a job. This stuff is amazing! It lasts longer because you don&#x27;t need much and It gets every single hair the first time so less irritation from going back over spots. The trick is definitely the cornstarch. Put plenty on any place you wax or it will hurt. And I just buy the cloth strips at my local sally&#x27;s when I run out.</li>
    <li> This wax is VERY STRONG and only for those with extremely thick, coarse hairs. It will get every last bit of hair off, but it is not water soluble (like the Sugar Wax Bodyhonee sells), it comes off only with the supplied finishing oil. I really liked this wax, but you have to be careful using it and only work on one small section at a time. If this product gets onto any carpet or clothing item you will have a really hard time getting it off. I would only recommend this product to experienced waxers or professionals...it does give you that spa quality result though.</li>
    <li> fantastic. Totally worth investing. Heats up very quick and has not left a single hair behind.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully just be careful to follow all directions first. A little messy, like all wax, so take precautions when setting up your area. Honestly was super surprised at the amount of hair that was removed first time. Not disappointed at all, just wish there were more strips!</li>
    <li> It does a great job of grabbing all different hair types. This wax is VERY sticky and VERY strong, but any&lt;br /&gt;leftover wax residue easily came off with baby oil.</li>
    <li> This is Srinivas&#x27;s wife... I don have very heavy growth on my legs but do have quite a few ingrowths. I found this product to be ok compared to the veet waxing strips i used..&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The hair came off pretty easily without much pain.&lt;br /&gt;2. 1 strip can be used multiple times and it still removes hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;3. Microwave heating is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;4. The finishing wipes were the best compared to other brands (I have used Nair and Veet)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Since I am not used to this kind of product it was quite messy and if you drop it on the floor its difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not very effective for the ingrowths and also quite a lot of hair jus broke instead of being pulled out from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;3. need to keep reheating as it cools of pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will order this again. Probably prefer veet waxing strips as they are very easy to use and pretty much work similarly.</li>
    <li> Regular body honee is a better product.  The spa wax works about the same as the regular body honee, but is much more of a pain to remove residue when done.  Even after using the supplied oil and a long hot shower, treated areas are still sticky.</li>
    <li> As someone who usually pay to have professional waxing done, this stuff is the REAL MCCOY.  I have eczema so I can&#x27;t use alot of products on my skin, I have had NO ISSUES using this product.  No breakouts, no irritation NONE.  I am a woman of color , so ladies it does work on us.  I tried waxing south of the border and let&#x27;s just say it removed it a little TOO WELL, LOL. But still no irritation.  So ladies this product removes the hair wherever you put it.  It does come with strips but you will need to buy more, so that&#x27;s the only draw back.  Is it sticky ,Yes.  Is it hard to remove, no. Use baby oil and it quickly removes it. Just make sure you have some handy when you are waxing.  Its not a smelly product , which was another plus for me as I am someone who suffers from severe migraines. So that is a non-issue as well.  Would I recommend this product YES.  Was I paid to review. NO. Did I get this free. NO.  I paid my hard earn money for it.  I received NO DISCOUNTS for reviewing this.  So beware of products where you see people are saying they received some sort of compensation to review it.  If a product is good , I have no problem supporting it!!!</li>
    <li> Great! Took everything off in one clean sweep.</li>
    <li> Best waxing product I have ever used. Easy to use and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Easy, no mess, works well. So much better than most of the waxing kits I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended. Update: After having used this for a while,  I&#x27;m changing from 5 stars to 2 stars.  This does not work well for coarse hair.  It grows back in a week!  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pros - The product works as expected, gets all the hair. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting excess wax off with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Had to keep re-heating once the jar fell below about half-full. Not enough wax! I expected to be able to do my full legs with the 1 kit, but I had only enough wax for my knees down. (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s not that I have super long legs). So I&#x27;m not really saving much money doing this at home if I need 2 pots of wax just to do my full legs.</li>
    <li> So you would think this wax is really awesome since its highly rated top 10 on amazon! and im the type of person who will make sure im getting the best kind of wax, no lower than 4 stars and has great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;WELL! idk where i went wrong but i followed every step. The wax was literally like honey. when i went to wax it off my armpit......it didnt even come off. i had to do it at least 5 times. Now my hands and everything i touched is so so so sticky. And my arm pits are bruised and thres a layer of skin missing. Same thing happened with my eyebrows and upper lip</li>
    <li> It works, but requires a lot of heat to get it tacky. And then it gets EVERYWHERE!  We still find it around the house after we used it, which was 3 months ago!! Very thick!</li>
    <li> I decided to give this Spa Wax a try on my bikini and underarms and WOW it removed every trace of hair! Even the shortest, thickest hairs were completely removed. Obviously, waxing those areas will always be a little painful, but the soothing finishing oil that came with the kit calmed things down a bit. If you have really stubborn, thick, coarse hairs this is the wax for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Sugar Wax kit offered by bodyhonee too and absolutely loved that one for my arms and legs and anywhere my hairs were not SO darn stubborn and coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that as I continue to wax and my hairs grow thinner and weaker I could completely transition to the Sugar Wax kit (I really love that, that one is water soluble!!!). But for now, this super strong wax will have to show my coarse stubborn hair who&#x27;s boss.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was a great price and because I have never done alot of waxing before and needed something that would be easy to use.  It had clear and precise instructions that were very simple to understand.  I love that it had an oil because it made it feel much better after I had finished waxing. I was also surprised to know that it keeps hair gone for eight weeks which is so nice so that I am not constantly waxing.  I really enjoyed this product and I am glad that I purchased it</li>
    <li> It worked great! I&#x27;ve tried lots of other waxing kits but this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
    <li> This is a very stressful product. Its very easy to use but you have to heat the wax up every 10mins or so.</li>
    <li> The product works very well for removing hair, but it is entirely too difficult to remove excess wax from the skin. Also more strips should be included.</li>
    <li> works great! better than other waxes I have used. excellent on the private area.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I am s little clumsy so it fell on my carpet idk how to remove it tho lol😂</li>
    <li> This was an absolute Horrible Mess! I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but this was awful! NO hair came off and I followed the EXACT directions! Not only did I try this for my legs, but, my husband tried this for his chest and BOTH times we both ended up completely sticky! I&#x27;m really upset because I used BodyHonee&#x27;s Hard Wax Kit: Face, Underarms &amp; Bikini Hair Remover with no issues, but this one was terrible! My advice, avoid this one!! I ended up throwing this in the trash! That&#x27;s a waste of 20 bucks!!</li>
    <li> The hair came off.  The wax left such a mess and was so hard to get off.  Even with the wax remover, it didn&#x27;t want to come off.  There were not enough strips with the kit.  For the price, I would expect more strips.</li>
    <li> FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO A T! If it tells you to put that jar of wax on a plate you put it on a plate. Let it cool in the microwave at least a minute before you even touch it. I&#x27;ve been soaking my hands in cold water for an hour because I burned them and we still can&#x27;t get the wax off. If you&#x27;re not professional I would reconsider buying.</li>
    <li> this wax is great. if you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s not messy at all, and really takes care of stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me.  As a first time waxer, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  Not nearly as painful as I feared and it removed my coarse dark hair.  I found that it worked best when it was thinner -- right after heating.  I also used powder and I think that made the difference.  I will definitely keep using this.  I wish I had discovered it a long time ago!</li>
    <li> I originally ordered the regular wax with little success, I wax at home and understand the concept of waxing, except i guess that I have courser hair. This product worked fine, the only complaint I have is I had a difficult time getting the excess wax off, especially under my underarms. The product works and I will be ordering again. I am wanting to use an more earth friendly product. I ended up using most of the jar to do full legs, bikini line and under arms, this is still a lot less expensive than paying professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the company contacting me after my experience with the other wax, they worked to fix the problem. Which makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Incredibly effective with great sticking power. Highly recommendable!</li>
    <li> After trying the Sugar Wax kit, I thought why not give this one a try to for the areas where I have much coarser hair. This wax is not joke, it will remove every little ounce of hair you have. The only downside is that it does not wash off with water and can get messy if you are not extremely careful. I used baby oil to remove any leftover wax on my skin and elsewhere. Happy with this purchase :D</li>
    <li> this product exceeded my expectation. I love it easy to use and effective.&lt;br /&gt;great product. The finishing oil should of been bigger</li>
    <li> I bought this product to &#x27;Manscape&#x27;.  It was fine on tougher skin but caused a trace of bleeding when waxing my scrotum.  The bleeding stopped momentarily but formed a little scabbing in a few days. Added 8/3/15 - In hindsight it is a bad idea to wax the hair off the scrotum. A good pair of tweezers and a few hours of tedious work is a much better idea. I still use this BodyHonee on regular skin. I have found out by trying it, if you have a few hairs left after pulling off the strip.  Get a fricking ice cube out of the freezer - then apply the wax liberally over a new area and lay down the epilating strip and rub for 20 sec or so. Then apply the ice cube along the outside of the strip to really harden the wax as much as possible.  Caution: It Really HURTS when you rip it off. But it gets every single hair out. Note: I prepared the area beforehand with talc.</li>
    <li> My Honey, loved this Honee. :) No spots, not as much pain as with other kits, no mess. If you are familiar to home waxing, you will love this kit (according to her). The package is a little smaller then expected, but most likely will purchase again, depending on &amp;#34;consumption&amp;#34;. 1 pack should be enough for her for around 1.5-2 months.</li>
    <li> Loved this waxing kit. Got all my hairs out at one time. Bought this kit too save myself some money from going to get professionally every couple weeks. Works great. Wax cools kind of fast, just be prepared  to reheat a few times.</li>
    <li> This wax is awesome .... I normally break out after I wax ...... Little white zits in waxed area every time!! But not anymore...... This wax is amazing and strips away all the unwanted hair!!!! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great for all coarse hair.  I would use a different type for legs. The lid was difficult to get off.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Didn&#x27;t leave any remaining wax on the skin. Would give it 5 stars if it came with more wooden spatula things and more cloth strips. I had to buy extra strips. Because of the price I might be reluctant to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I did buy this again. I do like this better than the sally Hansen stuff I buy at Walmart so it was worth buying the extra strips and spatula sticks.</li>
    <li> Super sticky.  Had a tough time getting rid of the stickiness on me, or any surface it touched. Used lots of body oil.</li>
    <li> So far so good. HOWEVER, something went wrong when I got closer in for my bikini. I get Brazilians all the time and thought, why not. Lets try more in on the lips per say...ummm NO. Could not get the wax off the hair! I did well on all other parts, felt good about it. But when the wax got stuck, I re-warmed the wax and still the same. Needless to say I need help in that area. I don&#x27;t know how the spa&#x27;s do it. Other than that be very careful, I was genius enough to step in the plastic bag where I had my used wax strips and got wax all on my toes and foot! Now I can&#x27;t get it off! The towelettes work well but you only get 2 and I need it for my bikini area. I ordered some more post wax oil from another company though. I bought extra strips and spatulas ahead of time. Which trust me, I used all the strips that came in the box for this one wax and I&#x27;m not even done! Great kit, just need patience, experience, more strips oil and spatulas and you are good to go!!</li>
    <li> I seem to be the exception here, but I was not a huge fan of this wax.  Like all wax, it made a huge mess and hurt like crazy to remove.  For the price I was expecting a product hugely superior to what you can buy in a drugstore, but that was not what I found.</li>
    <li> This sucks, I bought this cause I wanted to start waxing and it was like pouring honey on yourself, barely took any hair off and such a mess afterwards and to even open the product was a pain in the ass the wax sealed the lid when it was shipped</li>
    <li> 5 Stars if this is really a weapon of mass destruction.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to remove my \\&quot;hard\\&quot; hair. It appears as \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; but not strong enough. First time I used it to remove my underarm hair and it worked pretty good. Second time, today night, I was using it to remove the hair on my body and it couldn&#x27;t do the job. After several times trying I used up all strips and the hair with wax was still there.&lt;br /&gt;You can never imagine how hopeless I was. The sticky hair is like a big boom threat can&#x27;t be removed. The only thing I can reach at the time is the finishing oil. It can resolve remaining wax but can&#x27;t resolve a bunch of messy wax-hair. I try to cut the hair by my knife, the wax wets the blade and can&#x27;t be removed so i gave up. After many different approaches, I decided to PULL the hair. Indeed, the wax is a thing, I just didn&#x27;t have enough strips to finish the work. So the pulling is not so tough, I still get hurt like a s***. This is the MOST PAINFUL EXPERIENCE in my life so far. As I said, the wax did the job, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get bleed.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I remove most of the wax-hair and cover the finishing oil on my skin. I hope tomorrow will be a new day.&lt;br /&gt;My knife, the basin, two cups, shower curtain, many switches were ruined by unremovable wax plus TONS OF PAIN. Should I claim a compensation to Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final words: If you have a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; hair and you don&#x27;t know how hard it is, do NOT try it at home by yourself. This is a weapon of mass destruction.</li>
    <li> I did waxing way back in the day for my face, but the last time I bought a kit (without strips), I was so disappointed in the results, I just gave up.  Then I got sick of shaving my face every day, so I did some searching, and the great reviews brought me to this.  And lo and behold, it works!!!  It doesn&#x27;t always get every little hair, but it does make a huge difference!  I&#x27;m REALLY impressed!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it worked GREAT! We did have to buy additional strips, since there were not enough in the box, but that was not a big deal. This is by far the best wax for him that we have purchased. Easy to use and did the job as it says.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have bought wax for at home hair removal and the first time I have ever waxed so I have no other experience to compare it to so I can only speak of my experience with this specific product. This is a very simple but excellent product. It came with everything you need to do an at home wax. 2 tongue depressors, 50 strips and 2 after wax clean up wipes. I did however buy extra wax strips, and after use wipes. I followed the instructions which were simple. Heating the wax in the microwave for 1 1/2 mins. I used it for both my armpits and legs. I did have to reheat the wax after my legs to thin the wax a little but only for 30 secs.  If you have never waxed before I compare it to pulling tape off your arm..It stings slightly but not bad. It removed ALL of the hair that the wax covered leaving nothing behind.. 4 days later and I still have no stubble. The after use wipes it included are excellent and much better than the additional ones I bought. It removed the spots of wax that was left on my skin. I had a few red bumps and was slightly tender the remainder of the day but not anything significant. It says not to use deodorant for I think 24 hrs which I did use it since I had to work that day without any additional irritation. There was enough wax to do both my armpits and legs. I&#x27;m a size 16, I&#x27;m kinda big so the jar has very little left in it after having done all that. I have bought 2 more for future use. I am extremely happy with the results and recommend this product for anyone wanting to wax at home.

    <li> I bought this because I have extremely coarse, dark hair that I always have trouble getting rid of. The product definitely did what it promised and removed most of my hair, but made a huge mess in the process. The wax is NOT WATER SOLUBLE meaning the only thing that can remove it is the oil provided, so anything the wax dripped on was instantly ruined. But even the oil did not get some of the wax off my legs and amazingly enough there was still tiny patches of wax on my legs the next day. There&#x27;s also not a lot of product in the box, so if you are going to wax your legs or larger areas, I suggest getting two boxes. All in all, not awful but not amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I have really tried waxing before but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and everything is great quality.  Worth every penny!  : )</li>
    <li> First time waxer here. I did a lot of research before buying this product because I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had 0 reaction from it.I did take other precautions like exfoliating and a after wax balm but over all I am 100% satisfied with the quality of the wax and strength.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it really worked well!  I&#x27;ve never tried it before, but it did the job. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This did not work at all!  It is just a slimy mess of goo.  It is less sticky than honey.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve tried! I wish it came with more wax sticks though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick coarse hair and I&#x27;m alway self conscious about it but this was kit really helps with it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really take off the hair even after a few tries. Just did more damage than good. First time waxer.</li>
    <li> Definitely salon quality but really messy!</li>
    <li> Too messy, very hard to clean and not enough remover</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Wax is very sticky and DOES NOT remove all hair. Very expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying a kit that was on the lesser range of prices, but I shouldn&#x27;t have been. This wax is literally perfection. So much so that I felt obligated to leave a review. Easy to use, little to no pain, great instructions, generous servings of wax and wax strips... I will definitely be buying this again when I run out of wax (won&#x27;t be for a while, they give a lot!) The presentation is beautiful. I warmed the wax up for a minute and it worked great. I have really coarse hairs (REALLY COARSE) and this wax had no problem taking every one off. I tried using it on my upper lip (I know it is body wax) and it worked seamlessly, with no irritation-- this is a big deal! I have very sensitive skin! I love this wax :-)!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great wax!  Most waxes usually break me out after but this didn&#x27;t at all.  Hard to get the top off when you get it because the wax had hardened onto it but I got it off once I heated it.</li>
    <li> This really IS extra strength!!!! I waxed my junk and aside from taking a little skin, it pulled out all my hair!!!!  The bad part is that after all that, my d I c k didn&#x27;t get any bigger. Oh well. It still looks good!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie and say I wasn&#x27;t excited to try out this product. The truth is what girl would say no to not having to shave for a month or two. So when the package finally came in the mail I read the instructions carefully beforehand, as was recommended, and followed them to the T.&lt;br /&gt;All I got was sticky. The wax stuck to me better than it did to the cloth strips and no more that four hairs came out at a time. The result was frustration and sticky skin; and that wax does not come off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I might give this product a second chance at a later date; after all now I have a full jar of wax; but as it stands now this product was a fail for me.</li>
    <li> Too sticky to even use. It gets all over everything and cannot be taken off</li>
    <li> Wow - if &#x27;sticky&#x27; is a good thing for wax, you can have too much of a good thing. When I first used it on my legs I was super-impressed: it got out every single hair first time, unlike any other wax I&#x27;ve ever used. But when it started dripping on my fingers and they stuck to the spatula, I started to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not wrong that this product isn&#x27;t water soluble. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not thinking through what that meant before buying it: but seriously, what&#x27;s the point of using wax that isn&#x27;t water soluble? The tiny bottle of &#x27;finishing oil&#x27; in the box barely covered half a leg. I used half a bottle of olive oil scrubbing my hands and legs to get off the stickiness; and until I succeeded, everything I touched - door handles, taps - was left with a slight sticky residue that had to be scrubbed off later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have no idea how you&#x27;re supposed to get the wax out of towels, if not with water. I washed mine at 90 degrees and it had no effect on the sticky blobs that had unavoidably dripped on my towel while I was waxing. As for the waxing strips, they certainly aren&#x27;t re-usable: they ended up in a sticky ball in the trash, followed by my towel and the waxing kit. The whole experience was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are smooth, though, it has to be said ;)</li>
    <li> I love it! So easy to use! I would recommend buying extra applicators and waxing strips, but other than that great product!</li>
    <li> LOVED this product! Removed my hair easily (tho never painlessly, lol). For me this is a great way to save money on salon waxing because I hate to shave my legs or beneath my arms. I still leave my bikini area to the experts :-/</li>
    <li> I bought this to wax my 21 year old son&#x27;s back. Worked great. Think I&#x27;ll try it on my legs for summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a water-soluble wax by a different company that I used for years that was recently discontinued.  I followed the directions and the results were pretty good (bikini area).  I wish it were water-soluble too, but the oil that came in the box is pretty good at getting off any residue.  I just wish the bottle of oil were a little larger.  I also wish that more application sticks were included because I couldn&#x27;t get the wax off of the one I used, so I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> will definitely be getting this always.</li>
    <li> Was super sticky and very messy...will go back to the hard wax. Did remove the hair as it claimed it would. Make sure not to get it to hot when heating in the microwave.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Extra Strenghth Hair Romoval Kit just as expected. It comes with only 2 wood wax remover sticks, 6 wax strips and a small bottle of oil. Removing the lid wasen&#x27;t difficult as some people would think. Run the orange lid under warm water and the lid will twist off easely. For the hard paper lid, remove it with a par of pliers, with an extra pair of hands holding it down and carefully let the wax drip back in the plastic jar. After i used it for my unwanted course hair it worked really well, i love it :).</li>
    <li> This product is great! Gets the job done. I will definitely buy it again. Only negative is that it is slightly messy but I feel that&#x27;s most likely the case for any at home waxing kit. I did not even find it that bad (mess-wise) for being a first time home waxer though. So I just use a lot of coconut oil for the clean up and do it sitting on an old towel. Problem solved!</li>
    <li> can be messy if you&#x27;re not used to using wax. But otherwise it&#x27;s easy, works really well. I always keep a jar on hand in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> It is high quality wax. If you know what you are doing, even a little bit, it is a great product. I feel like a lot of the people reviewing it poorly aren&#x27;t following the directions. I used it on my legs and it was great.</li>
    <li> I guess extra strength is just not strong enough as I had a lot of left over hair on the guy I used this on and I&#x27;m not a waxing novice so I know what I was doing</li>
    <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m not a professional but this waxing product made it easy for me.  I am hooked on this product! It makes waxing so easy for me to wax myself and my daughter.  The hairs are removed easily and we have had no allergic response to he wax. My daughter&#x27;s skin is super sensitive and it does not affect her at all!  Will always buy this👍🏽</li>
    <li> This is awesome and smells great!</li>
    <li> I gues I made a mistake ordering &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34;..this was a mess literally..the wax was Very strong but Got.hard way.to quick..soon as you smear it..painful more than most wax..waxing should probably stay to Professionals..came with very few strips..I would only recommend this Wax to experts..Painful Very Messy Dangerous.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Followed instructions but failed to remove hair.  Only a few waxes have worked well on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easy to apply, and easy to remove residual wax.</li>
    <li> Its too thick and sticky</li>
    <li> its messy!!! and there are not enough Epilating sheets... i had to buy extra</li>
    <li> Sort of messy. One kit got me through both legs from the knee down. The wax cools fast so be prepared to reheat.</li>
    <li> So strong! And after waxing the skin is smooth and without bruises/bleeding.</li>
    <li> Works wonders!!! Comes with strips and 2 wooden sticks. The wax goes on smooth and does the job. I advise to put the jar in some hot/warm water while working on your wax to prevent it from hardening quick.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with other inferior home-waxing products.  This is the product to buy!  Why?  Because it works.  All hair is quickly and easily removed.  It&#x27;s less painful than other products.  It&#x27;s less prone to skin bruising than other products. And it&#x27;s easy to remove any wax residue. I was just about to give up on the home waxing scene when I read some other positive reviews and decided to try this product.  All I can say is WOW!  I really and truly can&#x27;t believe the difference.  My only concern is that I can&#x27;t find extra towelettes to buy online, and I don&#x27;t know yet if baby oil is a suitable alternative for cleaning up.</li>
    <li> When I received the wax the first red flag was that it was different packaging and led me to believe the formula changed as well, I was right. The first extra strength wax I had worked great this new one is a lot more gooey and not as firm. really messy now.</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s natural but it&#x27;s very Messy, not something I would buy again</li>
    <li> Do not use for a Brazilian wax! This wax gave me the most horrible pain and frustration. That being said, it did okay on the parts of my body that were flat and could be pulled tight. The unfortunate thing is that it sticks to EVERYTHING and is impossible to remove. Probably will not buy again. :( I really wanted to like it too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product today for the first time and I must say that this is by far the best wax I have ever used and I have tried almost all products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with all other (with or without strips) this is a superior product. I am not a professional beautician. I use this product for myself.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. It heats up quickly and it does not need to be re-heated often.&lt;br /&gt;2. It pulls all the hair out without breaking it. I use a thin layer of wax and the hair comes right out. If wax builds up a bit just use oil to clean the area and apply a thin layer. Without any exception all the hair comes out without trouble or pain for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is not painful and it does not irritate the skin (really a lot less pain than any other wax I have ever tried)&lt;br /&gt;4. It cleans up easily with oil from the skin, it is not sticky and can be cleaned from other surfaces if you have spills without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;As a plus the container is quite a good size so I expect it to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind that is not water soluble (I prefer it with the oil for hydration purposes) and I really don&#x27;t mind ordering the strips for it. I used to wax with Sally Hansen the lavender kit but this wax is far better. No contest. I love it and I will buy it for as long as it will be on the market and nothing else ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an AA woman who decided to try waxing at home rather than shaving. I&#x27;ve gotten waxed several times, professionally, the latest being about 5 years ago. Just haven&#x27;t found anyone I want to trust down there since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this in extra strength. It was a breeze on my legs and didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. I was pleased to have no reaction to the wax as well (in the past I found out the hard way that latex can transfer into the wax in a waxing salon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bikini area was an entirely different animal. Although the directions reiterate pulling against the direction of hair growth, in this thicker, coarser area, I found this excruciating and miserably ineffective. I had to go WITH the direction of growth and it worked beautifully that way. Be sure to pull the skin taught or you will just be ripping at your skin with no payoff. Don&#x27;t be alarmed if the removal causes a little bleeding. I experienced a bit of bleeding in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil included worked well to immediately dissolve small areas of wax residue on my hands and fingernails. But this wax is runny. I spread out a large black garbage bag on the bathroom floor and did my business on it rolling up all the trash and discarding when I was done. And the wax only took 1 minute in the microwave to be perfect for me. Lasted through both legs, then I had to reheat for another 30 seconds for my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because the protective cover was very difficult to remove (it was literally glued shut from wax), the box included only 2 sticks and only enough strips for my legs, underarms and partial bikini wax (it was originally intended to be a Brazilian, but the amount of strips forced me to only so a bikini wax). I only have a small amount of wax left over anyway, but make sure you order additional fabric strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would say I would definitely order this wax again.</li>
    <li> The wax worked really well, but I wish it came with more strips.</li>
    <li> I wanted to save money and try to give myself a wax and I really like this product for an at home wax! I have very thick hair and this wax does the trick. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the hair removal at at! The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like, which I&#x27;ve experienced with other at home waxes is the mess. Be careful not to spill the wax anywhere because if you accidentally step in it, you&#x27;ll be picking up little hairs and stuff from around the house as you walk. You&#x27;ll probably need to go ahead and purchase some more wax straps and spatulas because I went through the ones that came with the kit quickly. Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Never waxed before.  Super extra strength will pull all short &amp; thin hair. Highly recommended to all men &amp; women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair removals but this one has been the best by far!&lt;br /&gt;It was able to remove everything and it did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it is really Extra Strength! I think you better put some baby powder on your skin before putting this beast &#x27;cuz otherwise it could peel of your skin as well, specially in that &#x27;soft&#x27; skin area.</li>
    <li> The extra strength wax is for very thick hair. It is sticky, but the sugar wax works even better for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to get the Sugar wax and that is a hundred times better than this wax and will easily come off.&lt;br /&gt;This company is also VERY great at customer service. Prompt, helpful, and I&#x27;ll definitely be doing business with them again.</li>
    <li> I know BodyHonee is a smaller company, so I felt compelled to leave a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good -&lt;br /&gt;- It heats up well&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- Strips are thick and really grab the hair&lt;br /&gt;- It removed ALL of the hair on my bikini line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad -&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s messy - I laid a garbage bag on my bathroom floor, which helped keep the floor clean, and surrounded myself in paper towels, which were heavily spotted with wax&lt;br /&gt;- Needs accompanying Finishing Oil for removal - despite what the Internet says, baby oil, vegetable oil, olive oil do not remove dried wax&lt;br /&gt;- Wax is somewhat hard to remove once dried on unintended target - I used my nails to scrape away wax strings (I pulled the stick away from the jar too slow) from my arm test spot and legs&lt;br /&gt;- I fear I may not be able to reopen the jar for another use - the side drippings may make it difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly -&lt;br /&gt;- The Finishing Oil leaked during shipment, so the box was mutilated and I lost half of my oil - product shipment could be improved&lt;br /&gt;- More strips and sticks would be nice, but the company has to make money somehow!&lt;br /&gt;- The negative comments left by other reviewers, in my humble opinion, stem from the fact that they do not know what they are doing.  Waxing yourself is not easy - you need to figure out the best position depending on where you&#x27;re waxing, pull your skin as taut as possible, rip as close to the skin as possible, it takes practice, time, and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you are tired of spending tropical beach vacations complaining about razor burn, unsightly bumps, and downright pain like I am, spend the money and wax away.  Great wax for a good price.  Do your homework though about waxing tips depending on your hair location!  Use powder before waxing, too, that really made a difference.  I&#x27;ve used just about every wax out there, this is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have never used wax before nor waxing strips. This was my first attempt at waxing. Armpit hair was my problem, this worked really well for me. If you&#x27;re a first timer like I was, it will get messy. It will work for pretty much any part of the body as it did for me. Some people may say it doesn&#x27;t work for coarse hair other say it will, I&#x27;m one of those that it does work. My armpit, chest is coarse and then obviously the pubic area hair as for most men have really coarse hair, this took care of that. Yes it will hurt and yes you will bleed and get red that&#x27;s the normal thing of waxing. I recommend you get yourself a soothing gel with aloe and other vitamins to sooth the area after waxing, also an oil or even olive oil for if and when you might have a few dried out wax areas on your skin, get a cotton ball put some oil on it and it will rub right off. I went on and bought extra sticks and wax strips as it doesn&#x27;t come with enough. I read up on the do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t for waxing ill give them here, at least what I did to get my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower a few hours before waxing, wash the area thoroughly of which you will wax with warm water. No caffeine or anything that will alter high blood pressure Have some baby powder applied to the area you&#x27;re waxing this will get rid of moisture. A painkiller before waxing may help with the pain (i didn&#x27;t take one). Pain isn&#x27;t an issue for me. And finally just have some soothing gel for when you are done to apply. The instructions on how to wax should be included in the box, warm wax, have a milky wax before applying, don&#x27;t double dip the stick for applying wax, apply towards the hair growth, put your cloth and press it down good, pull away the hair growth. Keep the area clean, don&#x27;t use tight clothing, No direct sunlight, no tanning, if you could remain naked and well ventilated even better, especially areas like the armpit where sweat might be an issue. If you want to prevent ingrown hairs or infections, many people will say this is a no-no but you can spray a bit of alcohol on the area yes it will burn but it will kill off bacteria (i did this for my armpits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find some hairs grow back faster than others, this is just something to do with hairs in your body that might not have been present or too short during your waxing session, it&#x27;s normal to see hairs growing. You can get a another wax in 15 or 30 days for those hairs if you wish to for me it&#x27;s not a big deal ill just wait the 8 weeks and do a full wax again. Any questions feel free to comment.

    <li> I really like this product. It does a good job removing the hair and it does not hurt.</li>
    <li> The ratio of wax to strips to oil is way off.  By the time I was done, I had alot of wax left, but needed at least 10 more strips and another bottle of oil.  FYI:  This kit only includes 8 strips, BTW.  I had to buy more and finish the job later, which was disappointing.  It did work as advertised, but it needs some work in the &amp;#34;what&#x27;s included&amp;#34; department.</li>
    <li> It definitely works very well but be prepared for an inevitable sticky mess. I&#x27;d recommend getting extra waxing strips and have some kind of oil on hand to clean up the mess. This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever waxed and I was surprised that there was barely any pain at all, except for the armpits, now that one did hurt but the rest were not really painful.</li>
    <li> This works great. This is the only home wax kit that has worked for me. I only wish it came with a cream to apply afterwards to get off any wax that was left behind.</li>
    <li> The product directions say microwaving works, but it makes a big mess because it is too hot for awhile, and then it cools off too fast.  You really need to have it on a warmer at a constant temperature to do any good with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to clean up, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work though.</li>
    <li> Worst wax experience ever. First, of all, right out of the package, the lid is impossible to open even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;sealed.&amp;#34;  Yeah, right, sealed shut with leaking wax.  Cheap packaging for sure.  Then, when you open the lid, about 50% of the product is already gone - since it&#x27;s stuck on the lid.  I followed the heating directions (staying conservative) but still managed to obtain practically 2nd degree burns handing the wax. Not to mention another 50 percent of the remaining heated stuff fell out of the packaging and landed on my arms, legs, countertop, microwave, and floors, and clothes.  It&#x27;s been a pain in the butt getting it out of ANYTHING.  Save yourself the time and money and get some hard wax.</li>
    <li> This wax is good, it worked well for the underarm area, lower legs and upper lip for me. I, however, found it too strong for the other areas of the body and instead ordered the &#x27;all natural water soluble&#x27; kind by the same company. It&#x27;s also more of a hassle as this in not water soluble and as much as you try it always gets stuck to other items in the process of waxing. Overall, I&#x27;m just happy that I can take care of personal grooming myself and not have to visit a beauty salon for these things. It&#x27;s easy to do on your own, quite painless, and the user manual is also very detailed. The quality of the strips and wax itself is very good. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, would just be careful of the kind you order - different type for different hair types. I found this is better for long, coarse hairs.    ---      Now a brief history of the hair removal methods I&#x27;ve used and why I think waxing is the best.    In the process of finding ways to remove hair from my skin, I briefly tried epilation. It didn&#x27;t work for me. The machine is way too harsh and hurts the skin when pulling the hair out of it. It&#x27;s also not pleasant as all the moving parts kind of scratch the skin while using it. It&#x27;s kind of like plucking each and every hair slowly from the root. The most painful way of going about removing hair, I think.    My next method to remove skin from my hair was shaving, which a lot of people do here in the US but didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair would grow up thick and coarse and ver quickly. It&#x27;s of course cheap and quick, but the results you get are also not long lasting and not nice to feel.     I finally went back to waxing, which is what I did in my home country where salons do it cheaply. I found it expensive to continue doing it here and also much more of a hassle to go to salons. Now I have found a way to continue to get that smooth silky feeling of after waxing, with no pain, and good long - lasting results, at the same time being easy on the pocket. Previously there were the pre-applied wax on strips that you could heat with your hands and apply to the skin but never removed the hair for me well, and I never ended up using them. I briefly even tried those creams which would remove hair, but I think they are harmful to the skin, and something I would never go back to. It basically makes the hair weak enough so that the hair would fall off, which is never a good way to go about it. Waxing removes hair from the root, which is why it lasts much longer than any other method that removes hair only from the skin.    So, I&#x27;m really happy to say that this method specifically is the absolute best way to remove one&#x27;s hair, atleast for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Arrived quickly and is an easy to use product with a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; feel. The only reason I did 4 stars is because it left behind a lot of the thinner hair. But that could definitely be a&amp;#34; beginners mistake&amp;#34; by me. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Have to say it works, but also hurts....</li>
    <li> This is probably my 15th purchase of this product. Its really great for my micro-mustache hairs, my armpits, and legs! Its lasts a long time too when you get good at home-waxing.</li>
    <li> Another great kit by BodyHonee! Like their other products this is easy to use and effective. Summer is approaching and the beaches are calling get ready by removing any unwanted hair! After waxing you won&#x27;t have to worry about the hair re growing back for up to 8 weeks! Love this and BodyHonee&#x27;s other products, living in Florida everyday is a beach day so I&#x27;m always ready and love how I can use their products at home.</li>
