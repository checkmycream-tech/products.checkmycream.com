      <li>Nerium works way better!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever used</li>
      <li>My skin looks great and it does glow with health.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks great and it does glow with health.  </li>
      <li>using the cream for 4 months my skin looks amazing, glowing and people still comment that I still am glowing HA!</li>
      <li>I loved the way it made my skin look and feel but after using it for two months all my eyebrows fell out.</li>
      <li>just had a baby and loved the way my skin felt, looked and glowed during pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not that good.  </li>
      <li>Is a very good produt, that&#x27;s all,  the pinck cream is a bit too strong for my eyes</li>
      <li>I notice the ruby one the minute I put it on, and my face feels amazing when I wake up after having the night one on all night.</li>
      <li>This system is by far the best (waaaay better than neutrogena).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After using the Overnight, I made sure that I wore a hat for my morning run with some sunscreen as the product label warns that your skin will be more apt to burn after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>and I was pretty happy to see the shift.</li>
      <li>I hope they make more in this line as I would LOVE an eye cream.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a strong retinol treatment, if this peels my skin off, and I am sure it will not</li>
      <li>The Ruby Crystal contains ruby crystals and optical diffusers and skin illuminators that reflect light to help skin look more even and give it a healthy glow--</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to help with fine lines as I had to discontinue using it.</li>
      <li>Happily, I did not experience any problem with the Brandt products which, according to various sources and Brandt&#x27;s Sirius radio show on the Stars channel, contains the highest level of retinol available without obtaining a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Get free sample from sephora and try them.  </li>
      <li>Decide on your own since cosmetics really varies from one person to another.</li>
      <li>skin does feel good and it is soft</li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone who cares about keeping their skin looking healthy.</li>
      <li>This smells fruity clean to me.</li>
      <li>Beyond that I notice a huge difference in my skin when I am consistent about applying these and when I forget.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 3 months now and in that time I have been able to stop my botox injections completely!  </li>
      <li>I do remember experiencing this feeling initially when I used the Advanced Skin Technology product--which utilizes a progressive leveling protocol to allow your skin to better adapt to a vitamin A regimen--this means that you start with lower concentrations of retinol and then graduate to higher strengths over time.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells funny.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps, because of this, it is better to stick with the smaller sizes.  </li>
      <li>instructions caution those who have not applied retinol on their skin to be aware that a feeling of burning or tingling can occur.</li>
      <li>Perhaps, because of this, it is better to stick with the smaller sizes.  </li>
      <li>You will notice them curl and poke upward first.</li>
      <li>, I bet it will come back better than it was.</li>
      <li>but I grin and bear it - with smooth skin and no laugh lines :)</li>
      <li>Get ready to glow!</li>
      <li>So far feels like a clean, but working treatment.</li>
      <li>But it did make my dry skin feel better.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a large difference in my skin since I started using Dr Brandt Glow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, it works fine.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt silky smooth after two days of daily use.</li>
      <li>Took about two months but the difference was clearly noticeable...and only got better in time.</li>
      <li>for a few years, I was enthusiastic about trying the Dr. Brandt Skincare glow by Dr. Brandt Ruby Laser Technology kit which includes two formulations of retinol application in one package.  </li>
      <li>I saw results right away, this product is a keeper, it help to clear my malasma</li>
      <li>At 54, I want the old off and the new stimulated faster.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and moisturizers tend to make me break out.</li>
      <li>The only down side is product smell, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>This product was going well for the first few days, but after using it for 5 days I began to break out.</li>

    <li> I am very serious about my skin, when i start a certain regimen and routine, I STICK to it and follow the directions and steps down to a T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for my skin. it actually made it look a bit worse. then before i knew it, it was gone and i was out money I could&#x27;ve spent on something that actually might benefit my skin.</li>
    <li> This smells fruity clean to me. I have been looking for a strong retinol treatment, if this peels my skin off, and I am sure it will not, I bet it will come back better than it was. At 54, I want the old off and the new stimulated faster. I will continue this review after a week of use. So far feels like a clean, but working treatment.</li>
    <li> It works...I have 2 dark spots that have noticeably lightened. Retinol makes a difference in skin texture. The only down side is product smell, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and moisturizers tend to make me break out. This product was going well for the first few days, but after using it for 5 days I began to break out. It smells pretty bad too. I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to help with fine lines as I had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and in that time I have been able to stop my botox injections completely!  This is the best product I have ever used and I would recommend this to anyone in their late 30s to early 50s.  I hope they make more in this line as I would LOVE an eye cream.</li>

    <li> Is a very good produt, that&#x27;s all,  the pinck cream is a bit too strong for my eyes so I put in my face</li>
    <li> Took about two months but the difference was clearly noticeable...and only got better in time. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says its going to do. It can be a little irritating to your skin at first but if you start off using it every few days, all should be well. Get ready to glow!</li>
    <li> When I started using this people noticed. I am thirty five and I was pretty happy to see the shift.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a large difference in my skin since I started using Dr Brandt Glow.&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel good and it is soft but I have not seen any vast improvement of my skin tone or texture.</li>
    <li> The smell is not that good.  The skin did look shiny and healthier.  I wish the smell will be improved.  I just used for a week.  Overall, it works fine.  I didn&#x27;t see big changes in small lines.  I still have them.  But it did make my dry skin feel better.  Get free sample from sephora and try them.  Decide on your own since cosmetics really varies from one person to another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few retinol creams.  This system is by far the best (waaaay better than neutrogena).&lt;br /&gt;I just had a baby and loved the way my skin felt, looked and glowed during pregnancy.  As soon as I had the baby my hormones were crazy and my skin was dull and ashy (hair dry and thinning too!). I noticed results in the 1st 10 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;After using the cream for 4 months my skin looks amazing, glowing and people still comment that I still am glowing HA! If they only knew it came in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did not use this product while pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;The odor is not great but I grin and bear it - with smooth skin and no laugh lines :)</li>
    <li> Nerium works way better!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this after using Dr. Brandt&#x27;s other products. My skin felt silky smooth after two days of daily use. I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone who cares about keeping their skin looking healthy.</li>
    <li> I definitely needed this cream. I notice the ruby one the minute I put it on, and my face feels amazing when I wake up after having the night one on all night. Beyond that I notice a huge difference in my skin when I am consistent about applying these and when I forget.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells funny.  If I put it on my husband leaves the room.  Does moisturize, etc but has a peculiar odor.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing. I loved the way it made my skin look and feel but after using it for two months all my eyebrows fell out. This is a retinoid side effect. So if you have sparse brows beware! You will notice them curl and poke upward first. Wish I had known that was a sign.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible and I saw no results. I did like how the pink adds a shimmer, but again, not worth the price just for a shimmer and again, smells so bad.</li>
    <li> After using [[ASIN:B000PHP86E Green Cream - Level 9 1 oz.]] for a few years, I was enthusiastic about trying the Dr. Brandt Skincare glow by Dr. Brandt Ruby Laser Technology kit which includes two formulations of retinol application in one package.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions caution those who have not applied retinol on their skin to be aware that a feeling of burning or tingling can occur. I do remember experiencing this feeling initially when I used the Advanced Skin Technology product--which utilizes a progressive leveling protocol to allow your skin to better adapt to a vitamin A regimen--this means that you start with lower concentrations of retinol and then graduate to higher strengths over time. I started with the 6 and progressed to the 9.  Nevertheless, I haven&#x27;t used the Green Cream product for a number of years and I thought this absence from retinol use would cause some skin problems.  Happily, I did not experience any problem with the Brandt products which, according to various sources and Brandt&#x27;s Sirius radio show on the Stars channel, contains the highest level of retinol available without obtaining a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contains two products: the Ruby Crystal Hydracreme for Daytime use and the Glow for overnight.  The Glow contains 2% active retinol in a time release delivery system.  The Ruby Crystal contains ruby crystals and optical diffusers and skin illuminators that reflect light to help skin look more even and give it a healthy glow--so in essence this daytime product does double duty as a wrinkle cream and a cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products do their job well.  Little is needed to slather over the face while avoiding the eye area so the daily and overnight application of .5 ounces in the pump bottle lasted me about 5 weeks as I ordered this product at the end of July 2012.  Not too bad as a trial--the 1.7 ounce products are each $65 and $85 for the Ruby Crystal and Overnight respectively--and this kit gives you the two .5 ounce sizes to try for $65.  If you like the product I would spring for the bigger size with this one caveat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, over time, the creams start to smell a little badly.  The packaging alerts the user to the fact that the color may change; I didn&#x27;t experience that but I did find that for the last week and a half, the Ruby Crystal product, in particular, has a rather unpleasant aroma.  Perhaps, because of this, it is better to stick with the smaller sizes.  I do not know if this aroma gets worse with time, but I do think I can bear with 10 days of unpleasantness rather than a progressively bad odor that I might have to put up with for more than two months:)  Once the Ruby Crystal was applied, the odor was NOT noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, despite the foul odor of the Ruby Crystal, the product works well. My skin looks great and it does glow with health.  After using the Overnight, I made sure that I wore a hat for my morning run with some sunscreen as the product label warns that your skin will be more apt to burn after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  I would order Dr. Brandt Skincare glow by Dr. Brandt Ruby Laser Technology Kit 2 x 0.5 oz again rather than purchase the larger packaging.  Despite the rather progressively fierce and unpleasant odor of the Ruby Crystal day product, in particular, the product does the trip and rewards the user with glowing skin.
