    <li> BEST SMOKEY EYE AND AFFORDABLE</li>
    <li> My husband has complemented the lighter bronze on the right so many times, and he is not one to throw out compliments very often. The glitter in the eye shadow is just right. It looks beautiful from far and close up as well. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I have two of these (brown/pink and silver/gray). They are really nice colors, and definitely great for everyday wear (obvious color but not over the top). The silver/gray is a little dark for me, but the pink/brown is perfect (I&#x27;m pale, blond hair, blue eyes), and I wear a lot of pink/brown/blue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking high and low for an eyeshadow that has bronze and gold and this fit the bill perfectly.  The colors blends really well together.  I&#x27;m happy I kept searching and found this!</li>

    <li> Love Maybelline eyeshadow, great product glad I can find it online- arrived perfectly and is great  color.  will definetly consider buying again</li>
    <li> I love this combination of colors. I use a damp eyeliner brush with the darker brown for a liner and the lighter side for the eyeshadow. Perfect low-key look for the office. Doesnt irritate my eyes. Looks good all day long.</li>
    <li> I Have Always Loved Maybelline!!!! But this is something special!  I don&#x27;t like putting to many colors on my eyes!  This is so pretty and simple to do!  And it shimmers on your eyes!  But I like to wet my brush a little and rub it in the eye shadow!  Ughh soo pretty!  But the best kept secret is that you can buy all colors in big lots  for 2.00 ...I went crazy and got all colors!  Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours Truly!  Darcelle!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful new product for me, the colour was pretty. I would recommend this eye shadow to anyone. I wish they had a blush to go with it that would be nice.</li>
