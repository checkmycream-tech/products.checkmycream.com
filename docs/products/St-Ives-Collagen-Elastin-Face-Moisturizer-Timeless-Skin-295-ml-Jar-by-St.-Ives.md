      <li>The three pack is a good bargain!</li>
      <li>I think it is wonderful and is as good</li>
      <li>It is GREAT.</li>
      <li>It also is great to use on your hands before going</li>
      <li>But as the creme feels and smells so good and comes at a great great price</li>
      <li>Dr. Oz recommended it as something good that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.  </li>
      <li>I Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Well, I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>On top  of that, it is made in the USA!</li>
      <li>Amazing price.</li>
      <li>No need to pay those high prices for the perfect age defying moisturizor.</li>
      <li>Then the store where I bought it quit carrying it, so delighted to find it here and able to get it plus a free nail file!</li>
      <li>face feel wonderful and soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>This was a great find on Amazon and use this product first thing in the morning and at night.  </li>
      <li>I love this St. Ives moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>i love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for many years and hopefully, will be able to buy it, tho&#x27; many stores no longer carry it.</li>
      <li>Seem to moisturizer and help with your skin problems, and I love the price</li>
      <li>Absolutlely LOVE this cream.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels when you rub it on your face.</li>
      <li>This will make your skin very soft and absorbes beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, it is remarkable how soft your skin is after use.</li>
      <li>The creme smells very nice, is very light, great as facial creme and all over the body.&lt;br /&gt;The creme absorbs very fast as I get ready in the morning and put it on lightly before i apply my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Great price also, as I could not find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Am</li>
      <li>Not only does it help prevent wrinkles and smooth lines, but it also feels great on.  </li>
      <li>Just smooth hydrated skin.</li>
      <li>but quickly absorbed into my skin!</li>
      <li>Being a very sensitive skin type person, with most things having a reaction, this has been the only and best one I have been able to find and use daily.</li>
      <li>My skin feels amazing and looks soft and radiant...</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>One of the most reasonable choices I have seen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so moist and cool and soothing, and I like the the fact St Ives Moisture Cream is fragrant</li>
      <li>just as described best value i have found ,I will definitely come back for more when needed,I highly recommend this !</li>
      <li>&lt;--my smile WITHOUT smile lines!</li>
      <li>It was cheap, so it wasn&#x27;t like I would be losing much if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>After only three weeks of use in the evenings, I can already feel a difference in the softness of my skin, see a reduction in the oiliness during the day, and most importantly, see that my smile-lines are dramatically reduced.</li>
      <li>but that could be because it will probably take more than 1 jar because I am almost 70 yrs old.</li>
      <li>Old skin is reisillent to most Moisturizers and Creams no matter how much you pay.</li>
      <li>I got this shipped to me very fast.</li>
      <li>I used St Ives moisturizer for about 10 years ,20 year ago,it was amazing ,and about £3 ,thought it was discontinued ,as couldn&#x27;t find it in the shops,last month saw it recommended in a Dailymail online article so tried online,[ had never thought of doing that before] still not available in UK.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>but I really can&#x27;t see much difference yet</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Very inexpensive</li>
      <li>Nothing seems to be As Advertised no matter how much</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer that is non greasy.</li>
      <li>greasy,at the price use it several times a day, Some creams feel all silky smooth but have little effect,St Ives I feel goes into your skin and makes it smooth.</li>
      <li>it is not the same as  what I had used 20 years ago,that was pink and seemed better than this, but my skin is 20 years older,so I might be asking too much.</li>
      <li>Makes the face very soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I bought the three-pack, since I hear it is getting very difficult to find. :-)  </li>
      <li>and it really works!I can see an instant difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, and I can see the lines deminishing.</li>
      <li>My Skin feels soft</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s affordable product, and works as good as expensive product, the result come after 2 months used</li>
      <li>not sure about the long term benefits of the collages as advised on Dr. Oz , guess it will take a lot more time then 3 month to see the benefits.</li>
      <li>A large jar will last a long time.</li>
      <li>I wish I had found this facial Moisturizer in my early years.</li>
      <li>I like the richness of the cream during the dry winter season hear in New England.</li>

    <li> Absolutlely LOVE this cream.  Dr. Oz recommended it as something good that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.  On top  of that, it is made in the USA!</li>

    <li> i love this moisturizer. it is getting hard to find, but Amazon pulls through again! Very inexpensive and it really works!I can see an instant difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it is remarkable how soft your skin is after use. A large jar will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this product and could not believe I found it&lt;br /&gt;at Amazon.  I think it is wonderful and is as good if not better&lt;br /&gt;than some very expensive moisturizers that I have used.  It makes&lt;br /&gt;my face feel wonderful and soft as a baby&#x27;s butt. I will for sure&lt;br /&gt;buy it again. It also is great to use on your hands before going&lt;br /&gt;to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Had seen this on Dr. Oz and decided to try it.  Like it and will probably be a lifetime fan.</li>
    <li> Being a very sensitive skin type person, with most things having a reaction, this has been the only and best one I have been able to find and use daily. Then the store where I bought it quit carrying it, so delighted to find it here and able to get it plus a free nail file! Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I got this shipped to me very fast. Excellent product. my mum uses it-she is 68 but she looks 48.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this cream...I was skeptical at first...its thick and goes on like a heavy cream...but quickly absorbed into my skin! My skin feels amazing and looks soft and radiant...Ive also been using on my hands and elbows...I love it so much I have my mom and friends using it! Wish it came in a gallon tub....I Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this St. Ives moisturizer.  Not only does it help prevent wrinkles and smooth lines, but it also feels great on.  I usually wear it at night, but will even wet it during the day sometimes because it&#x27;s so lightweight an non-greasy.  I have combo skin and this product works well for me. The three pack is a good bargain!</li>
    <li> This was a great find on Amazon and use this product first thing in the morning and at night.  I wish I had found this facial Moisturizer in my early years.</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer, along with a specific witch hazel as an astringent, after a friend saw Dr. Oz&#x27;s review. It was cheap, so it wasn&#x27;t like I would be losing much if I didn&#x27;t like it. Well, I LOVE IT! This is better than any other -- including expensive department store brands -- moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. After only three weeks of use in the evenings, I can already feel a difference in the softness of my skin, see a reduction in the oiliness during the day, and most importantly, see that my smile-lines are dramatically reduced. I&#x27;m just glad I bought the three-pack, since I hear it is getting very difficult to find. :-)  &lt;--my smile WITHOUT smile lines!</li>
    <li> The product exceeds the advertisement.  The product is not oily.  Makes the face very soft.  Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I use it in the morning every other day .  I have another moisturizer I use. I have already ordered this twice and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> just as described best value i have found ,I will definitely come back for more when needed,I highly recommend this !</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer that is non greasy. This will make your skin very soft and absorbes beautifully. I have used St. Ives for years and am very happy with their skin care line. As they say, a little dab will do ya!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream for about 15 years. I like the richness of the cream during the dry winter season hear in New England.</li>
    <li> I just started using St Ives  Moisturizer. My Skin feels soft but I really can&#x27;t see much difference yet but that could be because it will probably take more than 1 jar because I am almost 70 yrs old. Old skin is reisillent to most Moisturizers and Creams no matter how much you pay. I&#x27;m going to stick with St Ives. I have used it on my Hands along with my Face and Neck and I do see a difference in my Hands and my Neck. Try it ... One of the most reasonable choices I have seen. Nothing seems to be As Advertised no matter how much you pay.&lt;br /&gt; Mercy</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s affordable product, and works as good as expensive product, the result come after 2 months used, it make my skin brighter, smoother, the spores closer, and had a healthier skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for many years and hopefully, will be able to buy it, tho&#x27; many stores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> Like this day time face cream, was on Dr. Oz. Seem to moisturizer and help with your skin problems, and I love the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used St Ives for 20 years. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and been disappointed every time. I love the way it feels when you rub it on your face. It&#x27;s so moist and cool and soothing, and I like the the fact St Ives Moisture Cream is fragrant free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.K Tucson:</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of a recommendation from Dr. OZ....he was 100% correct. No need to pay those high prices for the perfect age defying moisturizor. This is the last one you&#x27;ll ever use. My skin is soft, and I can see the lines deminishing. Thank you Dr. OZ, thank you St. Ives.</li>
    <li> I used St Ives moisturizer for about 10 years ,20 year ago,it was amazing ,and about £3 ,thought it was discontinued ,as couldn&#x27;t find it in the shops,last month saw it recommended in a Dailymail online article so tried online,[ had never thought of doing that before] still not available in UK.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not the same as  what I had used 20 years ago,that was pink and seemed better than this, but my skin is 20 years older,so I might be asking too much.This cream even with shipping worked out inexpensive .&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy,at the price use it several times a day, Some creams feel all silky smooth but have little effect,St Ives I feel goes into your skin and makes it smooth.</li>
    <li> I dont have one bad thing to say about this stuff. It is GREAT. What I have been searching for. I actually recommended it to a bunch of my co-workers and they are all addicted to it as well. No greasy feeling. Just smooth hydrated skin. I will never use anything else again</li>
