      <li>The mini puf is one of those nearly perfect travel items -- small, does the job well, inexpensive.  </li>

      <li>These buf-puf singles are so easy and useful.  </li>
      <li>Gentle cleanser and love</li>
      <li>exactly what I used to get in the store (only for more)!!</li>
      <li>This is a more light, sensitive one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quick way to exfoliate your skin</li>
      <li>Quick shipment and</li>
      <li>This is a great product and much more sanitary than reusing the same face sponge daily.  </li>
      <li>My local stores have either quit carrying these, or they are SO popular, they are always sold out.  </li>
      <li>I always have a fresh one for my face in the shower, and I like the feeling after I use them.</li>
      <li>(they turn from orange to white when the soap is gone) and use my own cleanser.   </li>
      <li>I use the cleanser on them, but when I want to use a special cleanser (for dry skin during winter for example), I just rinse the cleanser off that comes in the buf-puf, and dab on my own cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for travel after having used the extra gentle Buf Puf, which I liked a lot.  </li>
      <li>I love theses, they are not to rough and leave my skin smooth and shiny</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for years and like them very much.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying these!</li>
      <li>It keeps his skin clear and free of blemishes.</li>
      <li>I really like them a lot!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to reuse my facial scrub pad more than a couple of times</li>
      <li>Pharmacies just don&#x27;t carry these consistently.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how smooth my face was after using them.</li>
      <li>I did need to use the hotel&#x27;s soap with it after the first use.</li>
      <li>I normally have skin that flakes in certain areas and this has minimized that problem significantly.  </li>
      <li>This has become increasingly hard to find, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>They really don&#x27;t scrub very much unless you use a lot of pressure.</li>
      <li>Use them nightly after I remove my makeup to clean pores and smooth rough skin.  </li>
      <li>One time use each makes it easy to use for travel since you don&#x27;t need to pack different products, and because it is activated with water, you don&#x27;t have to worry about making it thru security lines.</li>
      <li>I love these little facial sponges (although they&#x27;re more like mini scrubbers than sponges).  </li>
      <li>- Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The only thing effective on facial flakes.</li>
      <li>Good, but I might try the normal next time instead of the dry skin.  </li>
      <li>They are really practical for everyday light exfoliation!  </li>
      <li>acne has greatly improved due to the exfoliation and the fact that I&#x27;m not touching my face with my fingers.  </li>
      <li>and they take off all the dead cells, leaving my skin soft and ready for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and they are a little cumbersome at first</li>
      <li>and then you just toss the small sponge, very sanitary!!  </li>

<li> The mini has cleanser already in it and all you have to do is to wet it.  </li>
<li> When my skin feels dry and needs a little exfoliation, I grab these to buff all the dry patches and skin off and it works.</li>
<li> other site is as reliable.</li>
<li> Really loved these and they are outrageously priced now.</li>
<li> These are small single use scrub pads that already have soap on them.  </li>
<li> I have used these for years and have trouble finding them in stores.</li>
<li> Buf-Pufs substituted for the missing wash cloths in Europe.</li>
<li> I used these as a teenager and have had trouble finding them in stores.</li>
<li> My only complaints are the pads are really small and extremely thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not real happy with them.</li>
<li> They are hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> I have to use these or my face looks dull and yuckky.  </li>
<li> These pads are way too thin to maneuver on your face.</li>

    <li> Perfect!  Quick shipment and exactly what I used to get in the store (only for more)!! - Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I love theses, they are not to rough and leave my skin smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> looked for years in store but couldn&#x27;t find them. Love them!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like some of the ingredients in them .  I rinsed them all off and am using my own cleanser with them.</li>
    <li> These buf-puf singles are so easy and useful.  Makes your face feel spa/facial-clean afterwards.  I use the cleanser on them, but when I want to use a special cleanser (for dry skin during winter for example), I just rinse the cleanser off that comes in the buf-puf, and dab on my own cleanser.  They are really practical for everyday light exfoliation!  They are hard to find in stores.  Many places carried them, but now I cannot always find them.  Some drugstores have them occasionally.  I&#x27;ve learned to stock up when ordering them though.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite!  Gentle cleanser and love that they are disposable too!</li>
    <li> I love this product and can find it NO where!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 15 years, I love this.  It&#x27;s a quick way to exfoliate your skin and then you just toss the small sponge, very sanitary!!  This has become increasingly hard to find, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.com.  THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> Got these because my product is discontinued.  I remember using them as a teenager.  They are fine.  One time use though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years and like them very much.</li>
    <li> These are small single use scrub pads that already have soap on them.  I don&#x27;t like to reuse my facial scrub pad more than a couple of times so this makes so much more sense.</li>
    <li> I bought these for travel after having used the extra gentle Buf Puf, which I liked a lot.  The mini puf is one of those nearly perfect travel items -- small, does the job well, inexpensive.  The mini has cleanser already in it and all you have to do is to wet it.  So, you don&#x27;t need to carry cleanser. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I actually did not throw the puf away after only one use.  It seemed wasteful, so I used each puf about four times.  I rinsed it and let it dry between usings.  I did need to use the hotel&#x27;s soap with it after the first use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the mini IS mini and seems so small compared to its big sister, the regular Extra Gentle Buf Puf.  But that seems less important than the fact that this is a very good product that serves travelers well.</li>

    <li> Excellent product for my skin type, which is combination oily and dry. I don&#x27;t need any thing else, it&#x27;s a scrubber and cleanser all in one.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and have trouble finding them in stores. I can always count on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;No other site is as reliable.</li>
    <li> When you want a fresh scrubby for your face - you cannot beat these!  I really like them a lot!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and much more sanitary than reusing the same face sponge daily.  Great for travel as they are prefilled with gentle cleanser.  I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I did not realize these had cleanser already when I ordered them, but it was a nice surprise.  They are great for my daughter to wash and toss the sponge after one use.</li>
    <li> makes skin smooth and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Always use for my family.</li>
    <li> These are easy to put in your gym bag.  Love them!  However, I wish they were slightly larger.  I will order them again.</li>
    <li> The only thing effective on facial flakes.</li>
    <li> 0 stars….. 3M is not making these anymore and I think you are price gouging!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a week and always before I go to bed.  It works great and leaves my skin soft after use.</li>
    <li> I love these and cant find them any place else!!</li>
    <li> Very good for my skin.  Great product!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The only way I can get my teenaged son to wash his face. It keeps his skin clear and free of blemishes.</li>
    <li> Exfoiliate, Exfoiliate, Exfoiliate! Love these! My local stores have either quit carrying these, or they are SO popular, they are always sold out.  I have to use these or my face looks dull and yuckky.  Thanks for carrying these!</li>
    <li> When my skin feels dry and needs a little exfoliation, I grab these to buff all the dry patches and skin off and it works.</li>
    <li> Omg! I don&#x27;t know why they spurred selling these in the store!</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t matter oily skin or dry skin these work great. Pharmacies just don&#x27;t carry these consistently. I use them over and over again.</li>
    <li> Buf-Pufs are impossible to find in stores.  I was so glad to find them on Amazon.  In Europe often no wash cloths are provided, and I still had makeup to scrub off each night.  Buf-Pufs substituted for the missing wash cloths in Europe.They are so cleansing and portable.  They were perfect for traveling (every day use, too) and provided a nice exfoliation, too.  I recommend these.</li>
    <li> I really love these!  They are not too harsh on my sensitive skin.  My skin has felt smoother since using these.  I normally have skin that flakes in certain areas and this has minimized that problem significantly.  You just have to keep using them to see the difference.  I use one every morning along with my regular facial cleanser.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give them a five is because it takes some time to get use to the thinness of each single pad and they are a little cumbersome at first but after a while you get a feel for it.  I would definitely recommend this product and I will be purchasing them again!</li>
    <li> very fast shipping,i am happy will order again.</li>
    <li> I have used Buf-Puf Singles in many years, and it is simply the best for me. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get it here in Denmark.</li>
    <li> Great product, and the price was cheaper on here than it is in stores.</li>
    <li> I use the larger Buf-Puf at home but these singles are great for travel...easy to pack, use once and throw them away!</li>
    <li> These are great!  You can wash and exfoliate at the same time.  I was surprised at how smooth my face was after using them.</li>
    <li> I used these as a teenager and have had trouble finding them in stores. My daughter started having trouble with dry skin and pimples on her face, so I went to Amazon hoping someone would have an old box of them sitting in storage...I hope they never discontinue these because I now am using them for deep exfoliation on aging skin as well.</li>
    <li> This is great to clean the dryer spots of my face. It isn&#x27;t too abrasive. If you are looking for a more abrasive cleanser, this isn&#x27;t it. This is a more light, sensitive one.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for about 14 years.  Every so often they disappear off shelves and I can find nothing that compares to them.  I use every morning and they take off all the dead cells, leaving my skin soft and ready for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I would and do recommend this product to any age woman or man.  Got my husband using them too.</li>
    <li> One time use each makes it easy to use for travel since you don&#x27;t need to pack different products, and because it is activated with water, you don&#x27;t have to worry about making it thru security lines.</li>
    <li> I always have a fresh one for my face in the shower, and I like the feeling after I use them. I place one on top of my washcloth, mildly scrub face, throw the Puf out.</li>
    <li> Really loved these and they are outrageously priced now. I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Thin as paper. Thought they would be more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Good, but I might try the normal next time instead of the dry skin.  I have had both and they are both a good product.  It took awhile to get&lt;br /&gt;the product, but very happy when I did received them.  Keep making them. Thanks</li>
    <li> Use them nightly after I remove my makeup to clean pores and smooth rough skin.  My only complaints are the pads are really small and extremely thin.</li>
    <li> These pads are way too thin to maneuver on your face. They really don&#x27;t scrub very much unless you use a lot of pressure. I&#x27;m not real happy with them.</li>
