      <li>The four pack is perfect to keep around the house and at work for easy softening anytime.</li>

      <li>Like many of you, I spend a lot of hours each day pecking on a computer.</li>
      <li>So I put some more on, and then some more, and then some more..</li>
      <li>My hands look and feel better than they ever have before.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil cream seems to work much better than this.  </li>
      <li>I love the four pack because I like to keep a tub in my travel case.  </li>
      <li>It worked so well for his hands that he wanted more of it.</li>
      <li>Appealing texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and is especially good if you have really dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is some of the best hand cream I have ever used and one of few my husband has actually liked.  </li>
      <li>(If you are due for a pedi and don&#x27;t have time, just put a dab of this on your feet, and they will feel super soft)My arms are practically flawless after a couple days of using this stuff, and I am so excited to have nice arms again.     </li>
      <li>This is very reasonably priced, (they could charge a lot more in my opinion), it smells excellent without being overpowering in the slightest and it eliminates dry hands altogether.</li>

      <li>This hand cream is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This cream is light yet rich and leaves no lingering oily residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich</li>
      <li>It has a clean scent, that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>She says it feels rich and has plenty of substance and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I suppose I was imagining something somewhat like the JR Watkins body cream - just more intense.    </li>
      <li>I plan on giving tubs to my girlfriends in their birthday gift baskets so that they can love it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve definitely had better, more moisturizing hand creams (that are quite pricey in comparison)</li>
      <li>Long story short, this would have been perfect</li>
      <li>It does a great job and never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>It has an extremely light unisex fragrance much like the fresh aroma of bath(bar)soap.</li>
      <li>This stuff is just udder cream (also available here on amazon) repackaged in smaller containers for more money.  </li>
      <li>I too find it useful as a ceramicist and artist.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase Watkins through another online merchant but was pleasantly surprised to find it at a better price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It quickly healed the cracked and peeling skin on my thumbs and around my nails and has kept my hands smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Hands\\&quot; product (great on dry hands, non oily lotion, male friendly scent).  </li>
      <li>I bought it to replace our previous favorite, a lanolin product we picked up in New Zealand which was amazing, but it would cost the earth to have it shipped here.</li>
      <li>I keep a tub of it beside my computer and smooth it on my hands frequently.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the better creams that I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for an awsome product!</li>
      <li>The label has the cute vintage look that is big in &#x27;apothecary&#x27; items these days.</li>
      <li>but this is pretty cheap considering you get 38.8oz of hand cream total.</li>
      <li>The J.R.Watkins hand cream is thick,easy to apply,rubs in quickly and completely.</li>
      <li>Get one of the pure lanolin products and save money and time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less greasy and is the best all round hand cream, body lotion/conditioner we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>It is as rich as many of the high-end salon products I brought in the past.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone, of either gender, who wants a reasonably priced hand cream that does the job.</li>
      <li>I have been dealing with this my whole life</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, subtle smell.</li>
      <li>With a more neutral (and less overpowering)</li>
      <li>This cream works just as well, and for effectiveness I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that my review is based on my personal usage of the product which consists of frequent applications daily, perhaps a dozen or more.</li>
      <li>However, we could not find the cream in any stores (other JR Watkins products were available, just not this particular cream).</li>
      <li>Most creams or lotions which I used on my dry, cracked hands left an oily or greasy residue which fouled my keyboard.</li>
      <li>My face at age 70 has taken on a new life.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, the smell isn&#x27;t so strong that you can smell it when your hands are away from your face.. but, unfortunately, when you put your hands up to your forehead (Thinking, \\&quot;WHY did I buy a four pack??\\&quot;).. that smell doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
      <li>I will NOT be going back to my high priced salon brands!</li>
      <li>Much like a solid block of wax, much like chap stick in a larger jar.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands frequently</li>
      <li>in this that you&#x27;d have to use an entire container each application to get real protection.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is part of the &#x27;natural&#x27; line by JR Watkins.    </li>
      <li>It dries right up after application with no real benefit during the day or night.</li>
      <li>This hand cream feels really nice, and not nearly as greasy as some considering how thick it is.</li>
      <li>Strangely, though it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs very quickly, my hands never really felt moisturized - just extremely dry, under a film of..</li>
      <li>We live in the SW where it is dry and</li>
      <li>I have both dry &amp; sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is hard to find but worth the search.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hand cream is the only hand cream that I have tried that has healed my dry and chapped hands.My finger tips crack in the winter and the small cracks are painful. Using this cream has prevented this from happening.Excellent value for the money!</li>
    <li> I just love this wonderful product.  The cream is rich and silky feeling and makes my hands feel wonderful.  It is hard to find but worth the search.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better, more moisturizing hand creams (that are quite pricey in comparison) but this is pretty cheap considering you get 38.8oz of hand cream total.</li>
    <li> I purchased the set of four tubs of JR Watkins Hand Cream for my boyfriend for his birthday. He had a tub that he also received as a gift a couple years ago, but was long since out of the cream. It worked so well for his hands that he wanted more of it. However, we could not find the cream in any stores (other JR Watkins products were available, just not this particular cream). As an auto technician and someone who likes to get his hands dirty, he finds this cream to work miracles on his skin--healing the most cracked, dry, and broken skin. I too find it useful as a ceramicist and artist. We both recommend this product to those who use their hands a lot.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, to the point that my skin will often crack and bleed from only a few second exposure to a winter wind.  I have tried every product on the market, been precribed numerous products and altered my diet to try and prevent this condition, yet nothing has helped.  This product has been miraculous for me.  I use it nightly before bed during the Fall, Winter and Spring and no longer suffer from any skin problem.  I love the four pack because I like to keep a tub in my travel case.  Once you get used to this product, you don&#x27;t like to be without it!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone with dry skin. I use it all over where dry skin patches appear.  My face at age 70 has taken on a new life.  A little bit goes a long way. Thank you.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve become somewhat connoisseurs of moisturizers in this household, and this is a good one. I bought it to replace our previous favorite, a lanolin product we picked up in New Zealand which was amazing, but it would cost the earth to have it shipped here. This cream works just as well, and for effectiveness I highly recommend it. It does a great job and never feels heavy or greasy. The only flaw is the scent, which is strong and very stereotypically feminine. I got the cream primarily for my husband, who suffers from dry skin and eczema; he uses it because it works well, but it makes him smell like a lady. With a more neutral (and less overpowering) fragrance it would be perfect. Come on Watkins, it&#x27;s not only females who need to take care of their skin, and not all of us girls want to smell like a flower patch either.</li>
    <li> To preface this review, I&#x27;m a male in my mid 20s.  I bought this item in attempt to try something a little cheaper than Bath &amp; Body works&#x27; \\&quot;Look Ma New Hands\\&quot; product (great on dry hands, non oily lotion, male friendly scent).  Long story short, this would have been perfect had it had a less painful odor.  The scent screams feminine so if you&#x27;re a guy look elsewhere - it reminds me of something my grandparents would have worn.</li>
    <li> this stuff must be the cadillac of hand creams. It&#x27;s so rich it feels like silk going on your body. I especially enjoy the revolving ordering system - so you never run out.  Bruce Borkosky</li>
    <li> I had truly hoped that this would be a creamy, luxurious and deeply moisturizing product that I could put on and instantly feel soothed and moisturized.  I had also imagined that the ingredients would be a little less artificial.  I suppose I was imagining something somewhat like the JR Watkins body cream - just more intense.    After I receieved my shipment, I eagerly put some on, expecting a great healing...  There was no great healing.  So I put some more on, and then some more, and then some more.. Strangely, though it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs very quickly, my hands never really felt moisturized - just extremely dry, under a film of.. I don&#x27;t know.. something?    I&#x27;d tried to rationalize the smell into \\&quot;it smells like baby oil\\&quot; but.. it doesn&#x27;t.  It smells like my grandma&#x27;s cold cream.  Fortunately, the smell isn&#x27;t so strong that you can smell it when your hands are away from your face.. but, unfortunately, when you put your hands up to your forehead (Thinking, \\&quot;WHY did I buy a four pack??\\&quot;).. that smell doesn&#x27;t go away.  The ingredients are:  water isopropyl myristate, mineral oil, sorbitol, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, lanolin oil, polysorbate 60, fragrance, methylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea, propylparaben, acrylates/C 10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, cetyl alcohol, sorbitan stearate, triethanolamine.    Yikes.  Had I seen the ingredients beforehand, I would definitely not have made this purchase. (WTF are acrylates?  And do I want them on my skin?)  You might note how low on the list lanolin is.  Cetaphil cream seems to work much better than this.  And it won&#x27;t make you smell like you have blue-gray hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just udder cream (also available here on amazon) repackaged in smaller containers for more money.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this or udder cream for real lanolin need.  There&#x27;s so little lanolin  in this that you&#x27;d have to use an entire container each application to get real protection.  Not recommended.  I&#x27;ve suffered from dry skin problems all my life (now 62) and know from whence I speak.  Get one of the pure lanolin products and save money and time.  This will make your skin feel real good when you put it one but 10 minutes later you&#x27;ll need to use it again and again and again all day long.  It dries right up after application with no real benefit during the day or night.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it cream by any stretch. Much like a solid block of wax, much like chap stick in a larger jar.</li>
    <li> My friend loves trying out hand cream and was very impressed by this Watkins product. She says it feels rich and has plenty of substance and absorbs quickly. There were also 4 packs in the consignment!!!</li>
    <li> The lotion works well but it has a dated scent to it.  Other than the smell which I think might be from the oils in it it is a good product.</li>
    <li> We live in the SW where it is dry and both my husband and I need a hand cream that protects.  We used to buy Watkins&#x27; Shea Butter which they no longer carry.  So we decided to try this product.  It&#x27;s less greasy and is the best all round hand cream, body lotion/conditioner we&#x27;ve found.  We appreciate its non-perfume but pleasant smell. I also buy their hand and body lotions which are stationed at our sinks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less-expensive, quality hand-cream. I saw the great reviews on this product so decided to give it a try. It is as rich as many of the high-end salon products I brought in the past. I have both dry &amp; sensitive skin and so was concerned about any negative to reaction to ingredients. I experienced NONE! Also I noticed that in addition to my skin feeling moisture my nails seem to be healthier also. It does not leave an oily after-residue. I will NOT be going back to my high priced salon brands!</li>
    <li> I wash my hands 15 or 20 times a day as a nurse. My hands were always dry and all the hand creams people brought in had scents. Some patients do not like scents some are allergic. The J.R.Watkins hand cream is thick,easy to apply,rubs in quickly and completely. There is no greasy,sticky residue left on your hands. I keep a jar by the sink where I wash my hands. My hands look and feel better than they ever have before.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is fantastic.  I was skeptical when I read reviews saying it is nongreasy, but it truly is nongreasy and makes your hands really soft.  It is some of the best hand cream I have ever used and one of few my husband has actually liked.  It does wonders for cracked, dry, skin.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I spend a lot of hours each day pecking on a computer. Most creams or lotions which I used on my dry, cracked hands left an oily or greasy residue which fouled my keyboard. I was cleaning my keyboard several times a day which became time consuming and annoying. Then I discovered J.R. Watkins Ultra-Rich. This cream is light yet rich and leaves no lingering oily residue. I keep a tub of it beside my computer and smooth it on my hands frequently. Within a few seconds I can return to my keyboard without smudging the keys. In fact, I sometimes forget I have it on until I wash my hands and feel the lotion liquifying, so I know it has still been protecting my skin. It quickly healed the cracked and peeling skin on my thumbs and around my nails and has kept my hands smooth and soft. It has an extremely light unisex fragrance much like the fresh aroma of bath(bar)soap. And the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger around like some other creams. A few minutes after applying it I can&#x27;t even smell it unless I put my hands up to my face. I would recommend it to anyone, of either gender, who wants a reasonably priced hand cream that does the job. Keep in mind that my review is based on my personal usage of the product which consists of frequent applications daily, perhaps a dozen or more. I wash my hands frequently (it is cold and flu season) and reapply my Watkins each time. One final remark. I used to purchase Watkins through another online merchant but was pleasantly surprised to find it at a better price on Amazon. Between the lower price and free shipping I saved almost 25% with Amazon.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot you can say. This is very reasonably priced, (they could charge a lot more in my opinion), it smells excellent without being overpowering in the slightest and it eliminates dry hands altogether. I would have given it a sixth star if there were an option.</li>
    <li> This is indeed an \\&quot;ultra-rich\\&quot; cream, but it is not just for hands. This water based cream is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used for all over protection. It&#x27;s not greasy and is especially good if you have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have sebhorric dermatitis, and my hands and feet peel and crack. Many lotions make this condition worse, and the ones that worked were either greasy ointment type stuff or pretty expensive. (I have one therapeutic hand cream that 8 oz costs more than the four pack of this stuff!!) I recieved this as a gift and was a bit apprehensive.     I also have Keratosis Pilaris (Chicken skin disease) where there are tiny bumps on my upper arms. I haven&#x27;t tried to treat this in a while because everything I used years ago didn&#x27;t work.    This stuff works. It softens my hands and feet. (If you are due for a pedi and don&#x27;t have time, just put a dab of this on your feet, and they will feel super soft)My arms are practically flawless after a couple days of using this stuff, and I am so excited to have nice arms again.     It has a clean scent, that I don&#x27;t mind. It doesn&#x27;t seem to conflict with my perfume. The label has the cute vintage look that is big in &#x27;apothecary&#x27; items these days. I don&#x27;t believe this is part of the &#x27;natural&#x27; line by JR Watkins.    The four pack is perfect to keep around the house and at work for easy softening anytime. I plan on giving tubs to my girlfriends in their birthday gift baskets so that they can love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I really like it. it smells nice, not greasy and my hands become more smoother than before! it works great on hands!</li>
    <li> I have critically dry skin and a condition known as KP that causes tiny red bumps on the backs of my arms.  There is no known cure for this and every cream my dermatologist has prescribed me has done NOTHING!!  Watkins cleared my skin up in a matter of weeks!!  No more bumps!!  I have been dealing with this my whole life and now it is gone.  Thank you so much for an awsome product!</li>
    <li> This hand cream feels really nice, and not nearly as greasy as some considering how thick it is. Definitely one of the better creams that I&#x27;ve used and I would have given it 5 stars except that the tubs come unsealed. I think that these days, it should be a given that companies use a safety seal on any product you use for your health, even if it is your skin health. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> My husband is hooked on this product. Appealing texture. Non-greasy. Soothing. Healing. Pleasant, subtle smell. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
