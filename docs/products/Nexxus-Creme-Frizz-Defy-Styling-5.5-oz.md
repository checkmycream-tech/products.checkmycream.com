      <li>Love the smell of this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The product is okay, but results aren&#x27;t quite what I had hoped!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I buy this product in-store, but because I shop with Amazon a lot and use there reviews to help me out, I felt I needed to come here and review this product :) Buy it &amp; try it!</li>
      <li>and it is really nice.  </li>
      <li>this is the best cream fior controlling my very wild hair.  </li>
      <li>This product smells amazing, I love that it has Moroccan Argan Oil because most salons recommend this oil for your hair.</li>
      <li>It is also very light, so there is no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Need I say more.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Cream from Ojan works better</li>
      <li>And once again, LOVE the smell...</li>
      <li>Love how this creme makes my daughers biracial hair manageable but not greasy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more for sure.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>You can never have too many</li>
      <li>For anyone that uses Gel and hates the crunchy feeling but wants a light hold, this one is great.  </li>
      <li>I love this product it really gives my hair a nice texture.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance &amp; leaves my hair feeling silky but did have to use a second product to eliminate the flyaways.</li>
      <li>The hair is not only smoother but looks fuller &amp; thicker as well - nice bonus!</li>
      <li>and I am trying not to get too excited.</li>
      <li>I thought I would give this a try as several of the Nexxus products I started using recently have been very good.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>As I was on the verge of desperation and prepared to use cow dung (as a last resort of course), this is a great find!</li>
      <li>The price if very reasonable for the reliability of what this cream does for my hair.</li>
      <li>After going to many local stores I could not get it.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pretty neutral also.</li>
      <li>I have to wash it out immediately, thus getting rid of the curl-defining effect I was buying it for in the first place.</li>
      <li>A good anti frizz product that works is hard to find.</li>
      <li>I really notice a difference when I use this product.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair, and it only takes a pea size amount to smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>It seems to work really well</li>
      <li>I really like the whole Nexxus Friz Defy line - I have been using the shampoo and conditioner and now the styling cream.  </li>
      <li>I love that it controls without the stickiness or stiffness of other products I have used</li>
      <li>I guess i need a flat iron to get the sleek and smooth hair I would like</li>
      <li>Personally I think it&#x27;s worth every penney</li>
      <li>Other times there are no clumps and this products works fine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my bottle was just not mixed right, I use this once a week then use mouse and sometime gels over it.</li>
      <li>When you live in Florida....</li>
      <li>I am now past the point of being able to return these.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that keeps my hair from frizzing in hot, humid South Florida.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy, this styling cream gives me almost bouncy curls.  </li>
      <li>Make sure that you do apply it once your hair is a bit dry, but not dry completely dry.</li>
      <li>its a lightweight, soft, almost tropical smell.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been this well defined, almost completely frizz-free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found very few products that can keep my curl hair in control and frizz free.</li>
      <li>I have the most unruly curly, wavy hair which usually frizzes regardless of whether I blow dry it or leave it to dry naturally.</li>
      <li>If I want more hold, I can just mix a little Gel in with it and it helps when my hair is a little longer.</li>
      <li>But, I took a chance because I like the other products so much</li>
      <li>They stopped carrying it at my local general store.</li>
      <li>I would still buy this product if someone could ship me another one and convince me that the little particles where just a fluke that happened during a particular batch!</li>

<li> They don&#x27;t break down and you have to pick them out of your hair.</li>

<li> I never had that happen with previous purchases but</li>
<li> It made my hair softer when I use it and then throw my hair is braids, when I undo the braids my hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
<li> This product helps keep those &amp;#34;rogue&amp;#34; little hairs down.</li>
<li> I have dark brown to black hair and it does not make my hair look greasy!</li>
<li> When I pour it onto my hands , there little pieces of what look like grains of sand.</li>
<li> I put this on towel dried hair.</li>
<li> however it leaves my hair a bit heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> I have been seeking products to tame my silver wirey ,wavy ,frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I am always leery of a styling cream because my hair is so fine anything heavy just makes an awful weighed down mess.  </li>
<li> I usually wait 10-15 minutes after I towel-dry my hair, then I apply Frizz Defy...works every time!</li>

<ol>
    <li> Great with Frizz Defy Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. This product helps keep those &amp;#34;rogue&amp;#34; little hairs down.</li>
    <li> This product does help with the frizz however it leaves my hair a bit heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair product. When the stores around me discontinued it, I ended up on Amazon. I have tried everything there is to try and still nothing beats this one for my hair. HOWEVER, my recent purchase was not up to standard. There were little tiny white bead-like pieces in the cream that ended up in my hair. They don&#x27;t break down and you have to pick them out of your hair. I never had that happen with previous purchases but with this purchase, multiple bottles were like that. I am now past the point of being able to return these. I would still buy this product if someone could ship me another one and convince me that the little particles where just a fluke that happened during a particular batch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found very few products that can keep my curl hair in control and frizz free. This tube last longer than a bottle of Frizz Ease. I can&#x27;t even find Frizz Defy in the store anymore, so I&#x27;ve taken to ordering it on Amazon. Fingers crossed that this product isn&#x27;t discontinued. The price if very reasonable for the reliability of what this cream does for my hair.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It seemed to increase the frizz, not decrease it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance &amp; leaves my hair feeling silky but did have to use a second product to eliminate the flyaways.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff! The smell is not overpowering what so ever but it does fade. This product has tamed my Florida frizz! I put this on towel dried hair. I have dark brown to black hair and it does not make my hair look greasy! Win-win I&#x27;ll be getting more for sure.</li>
    <li> this is the best cream fior controlling my very wild hair.  I love that it controls without the stickiness or stiffness of other products I have used</li>
    <li> I really notice a difference when I use this product. I use it mixed with mousse on my curly hair and it helps with the frizz.</li>
    <li> I have been seeking products to tame my silver wirey ,wavy ,frizzy hair. I thought this would do the trick. However after blow drying with a paddle brush, I saw no difference except hair felt softer. I guess i need a flat iron to get the sleek and smooth hair I would like</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have shoulder length hair, and it only takes a pea size amount to smooth my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my bottle was just not mixed right, I use this once a week then use mouse and sometime gels over it. It made my hair softer when I use it and then throw my hair is braids, when I undo the braids my hair is softer and less frizzy.

Other times there are no clumps and this products works fine.</li>
    <li> This styling cream works perfectly in conjunction with frizz defying shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> When you live in Florida....you get frizz!  This is great to eliminate the frizz from all that humidity.  I have thin/fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  Great find!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing, I love that it has Moroccan Argan Oil because most salons recommend this oil for your hair. I love the lightweight feeling, and how great it controls the frizz in my hair. And once again, LOVE the smell... its a lightweight, soft, almost tropical smell.

    <li> I have the most unruly curly, wavy hair which usually frizzes regardless of whether I blow dry it or leave it to dry naturally. I thought I would give this a try as several of the Nexxus products I started using recently have been very good. It seems to work really well and I am trying not to get too excited. It still needs to be tested under various weather and life conditions but I am hopeful! As I was on the verge of desperation and prepared to use cow dung (as a last resort of course), this is a great find!</li>
    <li> I really like the whole Nexxus Friz Defy line - I have been using the shampoo and conditioner and now the styling cream.  I am always leery of a styling cream because my hair is so fine anything heavy just makes an awful weighed down mess.

    <li> Best frizz product I have ever used. Hope they keep making this product. A good anti frizz product that works is hard to find.</li>
    <li> For anyone that uses Gel and hates the crunchy feeling but wants a light hold, this one is great.  If I want more hold, I can just mix a little Gel in with it and it helps when my hair is a little longer.</li>
    <li> The cost is the only downer for this product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product it really gives my hair a nice texture.</li>
    <li> The prices was so good. I bought three tubes. You can never have too many Nexxus Frizz Defy Styling Cream</li>
    <li> Helps get rid of frizz.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that keeps my hair from frizzing in hot, humid South Florida. Need I say more.</li>
    <li> Can sometimes leave a residue in my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is okay, but results aren&#x27;t quite what I had hoped!</li>
    <li> A good product to blow out hair and helps to straighten my frizzy type hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have tried every product there is for my medium-thick, curly,long, and friz-prone hair, and this product works! My hair has never been this well defined, almost completely frizz-free. It is also very light, so there is no greasy feeling. Make sure that you do apply it once your hair is a bit dry, but not dry completely dry. I usually wait 10-15 minutes after I towel-dry my hair, then I apply Frizz Defy...works every time!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy, this styling cream gives me almost bouncy curls.  I like the product, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The Frizz Defy cream feels sticky in your hair. I have to wash it out immediately, thus getting rid of the curl-defining effect I was buying it for in the first place. I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this great stuff in the stores anymore that made my unruly hair ruly why do manufactures pull good things‼️</li>
