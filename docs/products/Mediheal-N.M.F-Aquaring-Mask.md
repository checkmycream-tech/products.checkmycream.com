    <li> This mask feels very good when it&#x27;s on your face. After you remove it from your face, it leaves your face feeling like you have five pounds of product on your face. It does do a good job of moisturizing. My mom likes this product though so I guess it depends on the person.</li>
    <li> I pretty like this mask. Comfortably,</li>
    <li> the quantity is really good!</li>
    <li> dry combo. Broke out horribly had to give it away. witch hazel in here makes the mask not too moisturizing</li>
    <li> I love it ，I bought it again！</li>
    <li> I bought it for $25 and this was a really good mask. But now the price is too low that I am afraid to purchase. My Korea friend says this mask is around $25 to $30 if purchase in korea. I just do not believe it could be this cheap here.</li>
    <li> Good box not damage.already started use,feel great!will buy again when I ran out.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little sticky after use and I have to wash my face. overall very good !</li>
    <li> Feels amazing! I highly recommend this product. Best used with a toner before and lotion after.</li>
    <li> My friend recommend this mask (clinie)to me said the essence is not rich but very good for moisturizer，after I received the mask I found out although the packing is same but the mask name is different ,it&#x27;s shows as &amp;#34; mediheal&amp;#34;  is not &amp;#34; Clinie&amp;#34;  and the essence is too rich for my skin. I think this mask is good for dry or aged skin.</li>
    <li> Good for the dry skin type, use it before the bedtime . After use do not need to wash it ,it&#x27;s worth to try</li>
    <li> It is my friend&#x27;s gift, and hopefully she like it!</li>
    <li> very good  dont need say any thing  try it</li>
    <li> i just afraid that is the fake one. The picture showed Mediheal, But the product I received is DIFFERENT!! It showed L&amp;P Clinic on the bottom. PLEASE carefully check your product. I Afraid of that is the fake one. The picture and product looks similar, but the brand seems very different. It might be the fake one.</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry skin!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is going to be my new favorite mask. The price on Amazon is better than Sasa.com in HongKong.</li>
