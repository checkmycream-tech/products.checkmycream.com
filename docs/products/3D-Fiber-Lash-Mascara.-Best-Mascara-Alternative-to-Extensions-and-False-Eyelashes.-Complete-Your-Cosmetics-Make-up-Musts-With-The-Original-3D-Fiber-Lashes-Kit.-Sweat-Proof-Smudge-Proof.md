<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product. I received it before I expected but the instructions were not in English.</li>
    <li> I just received my 3D fiber lashes. They came promptly on time are amazing! My lashes have never looked so long and full! Applying my 3D fiber lashes take half the time of applying false lashes and look way more natural. Order yours today!</li>
    <li> So bad! Messy! No difference! Real waste of money</li>
    <li> The gel made my eyelashes fall out, and it smelled old and disgusting. I was a little skeptical of putting it on, but i tried it anyway. The smell was so bad that i had to not breathe while applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use fake eyelashes because everytime id wash my face at night, eyelashes came out one-by-one, and that ha never happened with any other mascara ive ever used.  I would give the product 0 stars if i could..&lt;br /&gt;The case is cute, and the fibers work &#x27;okay&#x27; with other mascara, even though the fibers are really thick and kind of look clumpy, but its just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the high end stuff if you want something to work really well, or wear some false lashes. This is not worth the money AT ALL.</li>
    <li> This 3D mascara really does work it makes my eyelashes look longer, fuller and very pretty it lasts all day so theirs no need to reapply it. This kit includes 1 tube of black transplanting gel which is the longer tube, 1 tube of black 3D fiber lashes which is the smaller tube obviously lol and 1 pink case I like the tubes design and colors they are really pretty it&#x27;s supposed to come with instructions but mine didn&#x27;t which is bad specially for those of you who don&#x27;t know how to use this product but since I have some experience with 3D lash extension mascaras this isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I apply the transplanting gel first then I apply the fiber lashes and then I apply another coat of transplanting gel to seal in the fibers. I recommend that you do one eyelash at a time because you don&#x27;t want the transplanting gel to dry up, if it does and you try to apply the fiber lashes they wont stick and will get all over your face and in your eyes and you don&#x27;t want that to happen trust me also be careful when you&#x27;re applying the fiber lashes if you are new at this take your time.</li>
    <li> Love how my eyes look after one application. I have blonde lashes and they never stand out....with this 3D Fiber Lash they POP! It was quick and easy to apply and caused no irritation to eyes or eye lashes. They lasted all day and into the night with no reapplying needed. You can see the difference right away. I am thrilled with this. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Beware, you don&#x27;t get what is shown here. I don&#x27;t hate this mascara. It does make my lashes much longer than most lengthening mascaras but it does tend to be clumpy and doesn&#x27;t last all day. It looks great for about an hour if you can get it on without clumps. After that, it doesn&#x27;t look any different than $8 Maybelline. It also did not come with the case and the instructions were all in Chinese. Which, according to a comment on another review may mean that this seller is selling counterfeit product. I also had a weird smell and since it isn&#x27;t labeled according to FDA rules (in english for one thing) there is no expiration date to tell whether or not it&#x27;s expired product. I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t completely hate it but I should I should give it zero stars because of the false/misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> just buy regular mascara, too the same a effect.  Plus there no case, plus instruction it came in a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> Product was completely dried up when it got here. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely an amazing product totally love it and recomend it to all my friends!!!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this, I waited over a month for it to arrive and when it finally did it wasn&#x27;t in a case, it was in zip loc baggie. Which wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The tops came off when I tried to unscrew it, horrible quality. When I got into them the fibers were completely dried out, which is whats so special about this so thats crap. The transplanting gel was good, but kind of pointless without the fibers. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything too great but I definitely was expecting better quality product than I recived. If you decide to order this I hope yours is usable!</li>
    <li> take to long to shipping. the product is good for the price.</li>
    <li> It made my lashes look great!!!😍💕</li>
    <li> Very pleased! This fiber mascara truly lengthens lashes and is just as easy to apply as regular mascara. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Des my come in box. Came in a bag and the fibers were dried up. Horrible. What a waste of money and time since I waited about a month to get it. I guess I&#x27;m back to my falsies</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little bit more better quality. And I didn&#x27;t really see the difference between this and my regular every day mascara</li>
    <li> I love it and I will be getting more. Love how many comments I get on it</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look beautiful!</li>
    <li> When I got my set the fibers would no stick to the fiber brush at all I was so disappointed</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying again. Package arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Niece she likes it very much.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom, she LOVED it she said she felt sexy with long lashes and boosted her self esteem</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had bought Younique set and I ran out and I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend $50.00 for another and that when I found this and decided to give it a try it and I was not disappointed it worked just like the Younique . As low my as you know how to put it on correctly then it&#x27;ll stay on all day and you&#x27;ll have long beautiful lashes. If you don&#x27;t know how to use it because it not in English just look up how to put on Younique mascara and follow it . I will be using Love Alpha from now on .</li>
    <li> For the price in amazed at how great it work! Yes, there are fall outs but not too bad</li>
    <li> the product is good, the pink case was filthy</li>
    <li> It extends my lashes without making them look too bulky and unnatural.  I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I been using it since i got it. It does NOT come with the pink case</li>
    <li> OK  I am a fan!  I have heard so many favorable things about fiber lashes but never tried them myself.  I could not wait for the package to get here. As soon as it arrived, I read the directions (easy to understand) and started using it.  It was simple, and worked! My eyelashes looked a mile long, no joke, the 3D fiber lash extension mascara is wonderful. The mascara lasted all day, I did not need to reapply and there was no flaking at all.  I can not stress enough that this works. If you want great looking lashes, this is what you need to buy.</li>
    <li> as I put it on the fibers get all over my face. but other then that I am very pleased and will be buying it again !</li>
    <li> Even though it works well, the fibers come off all over your face throughout the day :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not sure if I&#x27;d repurchase. I do not like the clumping. Not too disappointed for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! A steal for the price. I have wasted tons of $$ with false claims. THIS lived up to the hype. I have no lashes and this gives me big fat, plump black lashes like falsies. My daughter kept borrowing it so I bought her some of her own. GET THIS NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as Younique mascara only with the bonus of cuter packaging and lower price!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Only downside is I didn&#x27;t get the case :/ but oh well! Still love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product--makes my Lasik lashes look even more lush and plentiful.  After a lifetime of skimpy lashes now have my perfect combo!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this!  PS GREAT customer service as well.  Many thank yous to the inventors.</li>
    <li> With false eyelashes,  the glue often sticks to the eye lashes which makes removal painful.  Plus false eye lashes tend to look false up close.  This product delivers a false lash look on someone who has always had short light colored eye lashes. It&#x27;s so much simpler to use for every day use and making good impressions with your beautiful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the little fibers can get in your eye if you don&#x27;t make sure to have a good glue to fiber ratio.  I also noticed it helps to put mascara over the fiber lashes to keep them from falling into your eye once they dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it takes a little practice but it&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Not as shown. Received opened and in a ziplock</li>
    <li> AMAZING! - I bought this 3D mascara being the biggest skeptic. I have the shortest eyelashes in the world so thought I&#x27;d take a chance so see what the hype was all about. Well to my surprise, this stuff works, and I&#x27;m talking works AMAZINGLY! I was actually shocked but pleased. I don&#x27;t have time nor would I want to apply this daily, but definitely on the weekend when going out. The lash extension is impressive and definitely gives your eyes a POP! The only downside are the fibers falling on your clothing or worse sometimes in your eye so careful when applying. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great addition to your make-up bag!</li>
    <li> This product works, I have thinning lashes and putting the Cashmere Micronesia on my lashes was a miracle. Love it!</li>
    <li> Life changing. I have short awful lashes. They look amazing. I am speechless. Look at my photo to see for yourself. One is side by side with fiber lashes vs. without. Other pic is with it applied to both. These pictures are with just the fiber lashes I did not use my own mascara underneath. I don&#x27;t think it is necessary. I am so happy with this mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> flakes off in my eyes.. but compares to the younique pretty well.. Younique flaked off in my eyes also.. but  I would take this over the $30 crap any day.</li>
    <li> This mascara is easy to apply, and it looks great- for the first hour. After that, I started discovering chunks of mascara all over my face, and then the burning would start. My eyes couldn&#x27;t handle it; I have NEVER had a sensitivity or allergy to any makeups but for some reason, this mascara made my eyes water and burn. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Had a lot of compliments. One friend thought I had false lashes</li>
    <li> The packaging and everything was very cute and all but the mascara itself smelled like metal and I would never ever put it on my eyelashes</li>
    <li> Okay but I like the Younique brand better . . . this one seems a bit &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; and clumps more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in love with this product but I do like it a lot so far. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t make my eye lashes look full although it does lengthen them. I read many reviews of people complaining of the fibers falling but I did not encounter than problem. Instructions said to seal the fibers with more gel after using the fiber wand so they won&#x27;t fall off and it worked great for me. Some fibers will obviously come off with the second coat of gel but it still left my lashes looking much longer than they actually are. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> After just one use, I can honestly say that I like this product.  My lashes look like they did when I was 20.  I will need a little more practice unclumping/separating my lashes in the future.  I will continue using this product, but probably only for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Took forever to receive product. Didn&#x27;t come in case as shown. Dried up. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is crazy awesome!  I&#x27;m amazed at the beautiful full lashes this product gives me.  This is the best mascara!</li>
    <li> Part of the reason I ordered this was the case, and imagine when I received it there was no case just a plastic bag, neither of the Navarre were sealed so I&#x27;m assuming the person I bought it FROM liked the case not the product and passed it on to me</li>
    <li> I compared it To Younique and given that both are made in China, and Love Alpha is much cheaper, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. Younique seems a bit longer but this product is good</li>
    <li> love it and great price</li>
    <li> Loved the length.  Not my favorite but worked really well.  I would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I like this. It doesn&#x27;t clump if you follow the directions and is easy to remove</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected to give a nice 3D fiber lash look. Didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or issues.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I got a few fibers in my eye not bad but I had it the second time. I love the product it worked to my liking. I will purchase again 😊</li>
    <li> I do like the finish look of the product, but if you have any eye sensitivity you may want to avoid it.  The Fiber Lashes are constantly falling off, most of the time into your eye (a killer, especially if you wear contacts like me!) and all night you will have people telling you that you have eye lashes on your face.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as I thought it would be. It did add volume a little but not really any length. I was expecting different more dramatic results but it was just a bit above regular mascara.</li>
    <li> Well the 1st time I used it...I had black stuff on my face....Not Good! So I use it with my mascara.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW!!! The mascara not only lengthen but also thicken my lash. It comes in a beautiful carrying case. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This mascara it awful it looks good at first but after a few minute it comes of and they are little black stuff all over the face</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I had previously purchased Better Than False Lashes by Too Faced for which I paid 35$ and I can honestly say this system is extremely better than the Prestige brands! It is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation! The length results are amazing! I applies 3 coats of this and I was in love with my eyelashes! Never going back to those other brands! I highly recommend you buy this now!</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  I found that it clumps fairly easily but I think some of that is user error.  I seem to get better the more I use it.  It can be applied multiple times to make lashes look fuller.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to recive my purchase ..but the product works surprisingly well..I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I Can See How This Would Be Great For A Make Up Expert. But As For Me They Just Made My Eye Lashes County looking</li>
    <li> minimal irritation and rarely; looks great</li>
    <li> Seriously can&#x27;t believe how much it made a difference.  I have purchased fiber mascara in the past, very expensive ones as a matter of fact, and the little fibers would get all over the place and it took a long time to apply. This mascara was very easy to apply as the fibers went on easily and it did not make a big mess. I followed directions that were on the package itself. I did one eye at a time applying the gel before and after the fibers application. I have no complaints and I am very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> Lashes are longer, but not worth the itching and irritation that was caused by the fibers. I used them 3 times and the last time I left it on for about an hour and couldn&#x27;t take it any longer. My eyes hurt and were extremely irritated for the whole time I had the mascara on. Would never try this again.</li>
    <li> wow .. it really worked ...did one eye first to compare.</li>
    <li> I really like this product,  but sometimes the fibers do irritate your eyes</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING, I have been wearing false lashes, and this is so incredible, its so natural and extends and thickens instantly. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it only a few times and so far I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;You need to be patient with it if you want it to work right. Take your time applying each step and you&#x27;ll get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this with a special code/price and I&#x27;ll shell out full price for it again!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this mascara I was running out the house to a doctor&#x27;s appointment so I was a little worried about the time it would take to put this stuff on since it is actually a 3 step process at minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you put on the gel, then you put on the fibers, then you seal it with the gel. The directions suggest to do it one eye at a time because you don&#x27;t want the gel to dry before you get the fibers on - and I definitely agree with that recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions also say you can apply as many coats of the fiber as you want - just seal with the gel in between coats. I applied 2 coats of fiber before leaving my house and found that I did get little fibers falling on my face - not a big deal if you lightly brush them off as to not smudge the rest of your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 coats of fiber I was pleased with the results and headed out the door. The product stayed on all day and wiped off easily that night. It seems this would not be waterproof so no swimming and no crying when you wear this ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another suggestion the directions give is to use an eyelash comb to separate the lashes and I would HIGHLY suggest this too. I did find my lashes clumped together a little more than I would like - but again not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this product and can see me using it when I go out for the evening. The caveat to this is I would only use it when I have time to do my make up. I would not use this when I am short on time. Doing at least 2 coats, brushing the fibers from my face and separating the lashes is too much when time is of the essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product because it works as described. If not for the time factor I would&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Alpha provided this product sample at a reduced price for my unbiased feedback and review.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes look amazing ! Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my sister. She loves it! The packaging was good and everything came as described! I highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> i give it a 3 because there is not nearly as much product in the mascara as it should be and also the lash part is so messy and it gets on your face and in side of your eyes.!!!MspyPlus.com</li>
    <li> Absolutely dislike this product. My regular drug store mascara has a better result. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Have ordered 3 times it&#x27;s a  must have</li>
    <li> fibers kept falling in my eyes</li>
    <li> amazing really helps if you blink to pull the lashes down over the mascara. that way your fibers are in one consistent direction.</li>
    <li> Came with no instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find product to be as great as the hype.</li>
    <li> Works, but fibers land on ur face. Happens all day.</li>
    <li> It shipped pretty fast however it says it came with a pink case my item arrived very fast but no case and they were just in plastic. I&#x27;m pretty displeased by this also one of the tops were broken.</li>
    <li> I use mascara every day and it can sometimes be difficult to remove.  I have also tried lash extensions that are applied at the salon, not at home, and it is very time consuming and costly. So when I was offered this 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara from Love Alpha for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order. I read the directions and applied. I am very impressed with this Mascara!! I look like I have real long and thick lashes!! The best part for me, other than the way I look, is that it is easy to remove. I don&#x27;t have to pull anything off and it wipes off with makeup remover wipes. I definitely recommend this 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara for anyone who wants full and long lashes without having to spend time and money at the salon.</li>
    <li> I love this - I tried eyelash extensions once and hated them. I&#x27;ve tried another brand of fiber lash mascara and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t love having to order through a distributor. I was really excited to try this once since I was able to review it free. It works great! Lashes look amazing and it doesn&#x27;t flake off and end up on your cheek 1/2 way through the day so long as you seal it after the last fiber application. It&#x27;s definitely an everyday mascara for me and something I&#x27;ll continue to use!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !!! just what I expected and at really good prize !!! I had been wanting to get 3d fiber mascara for a while but the brand and knew were quit expensive, so when I found this one I decided to try it and I loved it ! it is really easy to apply, it takes me like 5 minutes to do it every morning before work and it lasts me all day (8:00 am to 6:00 pm) for work I only use one coat and thats enough, my eye lashed look noticeable longer. Definitely recommend it ! try to wear your usual mascara underneath and then apply the gel and the fiber, this will give you better results (:</li>
    <li> It took a long time to arrived, it did not come in a pink case like it should be very dissapointed</li>
    <li> I love it. I got this by using a high discount code. after applying on my eye,my eyelash looks longer.</li>
    <li> Loved this mascara !! It makes a big difference !! So far I love it !  Have used it a week now!! Works great !!!!</li>
    <li> Too thin, takes too long to put on in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer too faced better than sex.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this. I have gotten so many compliments on my lashes. Very easy to use. Will buy again. It&#x27;s best to follow the directions so they don&#x27;t look weird.</li>
    <li> I have my new favorite mascara!  I went looking for a comparable fiber lash builder to the $30 brands.  I fell in love with Love,  Alpha. It is easy to use and only comes off when I want it to. I would recommend this to anyone who wants long beautiful lashes with ease.</li>
    <li> No! Furry lent flew everywhere!! Will not purchase again! Boooooooo</li>
    <li> works like Younique brand!</li>
    <li> Like every other fiber last product.. it&#x27;s a bit tricky to apply.&lt;br /&gt;This product sheds fibers throughout the day and can get into&lt;br /&gt;your eyes.</li>
    <li> I would say the idea of this mascara is interesting. There are two parts. One mascara looks normal as usual with very dense and long glue, another one is just pure fiber which you can easily touch it with finger and see how it broken and the fiber fly away. When using two mascara, it do make eyelash long. However, the second mascara which fiber suppose to be sticked and be extended, but the truth is, this fiber is flying everywhere, and there is a very big chance it flies and stick to the eyeball !!!!</li>
    <li> I had the fibers falling off all day long.  So, I applied more glue and worked harder at getting fibers to stick.  This resulted in a clumping problem on my lashes.  Right after they were applied, before the fibers started to fall, I loved the way my lashes looked.</li>
    <li> Great quality. My gf definitely loved this gift.</li>
    <li> I never heard of anything like this, but I&#x27;m older &amp; like things quick &amp; simple. However, I was curious or had a &amp;#34;moment&amp;#34; &amp; decided to try this. I put my mascara on 1 eye &amp; this product on the other. This stuff is messy, it leaves little fibers under &amp; in the eye. I hate stuff in my eyes. It made my lashes look a little thicker, but my mascara made my lashes longer &amp; cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is the best and most effective mascara that I have ever purchased. I am absolutely in LOVE with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. Only complaint is when shipping items to US it should have instructions in American English.</li>
    <li> Am so in love with product &amp; so is my daughter.  So easy to use &amp; will be more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeee it, I even bought it a second time!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. Easy to use and I only needed two coats to make my eyes pop. I do NOT use another mascara with it (some people do). I found the product works much better without another mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed as I didn&#x27;t use the product for about 5-6 days and when I went to use it again, it does NOT work. Just know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, LOVE this product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Had high expectation about his product due to good reviews. Unfortunately, it left a clump up look and little black fibers below the eye area. </li>
    <li> So far, so good. As long as I don&#x27;t rush it my lashes look great.</li>
    <li> My product looks like the same tube but is not Love Alpha, it is called Vixen.  I did not receive the pink case as many other purchasers have not.  Is it shipping later?</li>
    <li> They do make your lashes appear slightly longer and more plump but the fibers tend to flake alot and get into your eyes. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Fibers constantly fall on my face &amp; irritate my eyes!</li>
    <li> Its goopy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> this stuff made my eyes so irritated and didn&#x27;t look nearly as good as the younique brand does!</li>
    <li> I thought this was the best thing ever when I first applied to my lashes but as the day went on I started feeling things in my eye. It became so uncomfortable that I could not wait to get this stuff off my eye. I thought I would try a second time to see if maybe I just used to much of the fibers and the second time I tried less fibers. It was just as bad the second time. I felt like something was in my eye the entire time I wore this. I want to try a third time but a little hesitant because of the first two experiences. I liked the way it looked when applied. My lashes were extended and beautiful to look at but the eye irritation took away from the lovely look. Hope to get it right the next time I try this. I did receive a discount for the review of this item.</li>
    <li> I did see length but no volume, I did feel a little disconfird made my eyes feel a dry, I didn&#x27;t get the case !!! And there is no ingriendt list</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it works just as described I will probably buy another one once this one runs out</li>
    <li> good mascara but i dont really think they make your eyelashes look longer</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, though I have to admit I freaked out a little while adding the fibers, I kept thinking they were going to end up in my eye!  Once I got past that, I was okay, but it is strange the first time especially for a girl who&#x27;s not always the best at applying makeup lol.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product for $3. As a person who uses am expensive brand of mascara, I feel this is not worth the price (though I may feel differently if I had used store brands prior to this). The fibers fall off throughout the day &amp; it takes so long to get to a thick enough coat.</li>
    <li> Not too pleased at all. I pretty much bought this particualr one for the pretty case that not only is pictured but also in the product info, it does say it comes with the box as well as English instructions and some sort of pamplet. I just received it today and it came in a very cheap clear bag. No box, no pamphlet and not even instructions in English!! If I wanted just the tubes I would have chosen one of them without a box and paid more than half as much money!!</li>
    <li> BIG LASHES.  Enough said.  Easy to use, and great results.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> its a great product and i would recommend to all my friends and family!!</li>
    <li> Works great the only bad thing the instructions were in a language I couldn&#x27;t read (wasn&#x27;t english)</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I have used other 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara and this was definitely of quality.  First I opened the mascara to a broken cap (the cover twisted right off of the main cap - Broken), then the mascara seems to be dried up, no substance on the brush.  Very disappointing purchase.  Would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product arrivedin a plastic ziplock bag,instead of the pink case its advertised in.  The gel tube is dry after A couple of days, and the gel tube the metal top came apart from the plastic wand. I think this product was used before it was sold to me.  I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I have never tried 3d fiber lashes so I got these cause they were cheaper. I hate them I constantly have fibers in my eyes and the fibers only add volume and not so much length.</li>
    <li> Love they way it looks, but it&#x27;s a tad bit difficult to get ofd</li>
    <li> Awsome!!! I really recomend you girls!! Get it right now it&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> Great Product.... Wife just love using this mascara..</li>
    <li> Ok... It does give the appearance of longer lashes but with any kind of humidity they start coming off.  Kind of spidery looking too.</li>
    <li> Disappointing to find out it does not do what its meant to. I really was looking forward to some lash extension!</li>
    <li> Love it. It is easy to apply. I use 2 applications and it increases the length and fullness better than any other mascara. It is so wonderful. It also washes off so easy. I will definitely keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Its easy to apply and does exactly what it says.  My lashes looked long, beautiful and natural.  It was also softer than my usual mascara. My friend was so amazed, she bought the product from her phone while we were having lunch. I am over the moon and will definitely by this product again! Notes: No need to use regular mascara under it unless your lashes are shorter than average.  The key is to read the instructions they send you via email completely before you use it the first time.</li>
    <li> Really amazing! My lashes are nice but now the people talk it...</li>
    <li> I love this fiber lash mascara. It is easy to use and really does lengthen, volumes and define lashes as described. Great buy. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My eyelashes haven&#x27;t looked this full in 10 years!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive brands</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I use it everyday. I apply as directed and I never have problems. A few fibers are under my eyes by the end of the day but nothing that I can&#x27;t wipe off with a tissue real quick. I love this and paid $5.99 for it. Wish it was still that cheap! Also if the gel starts to seem dry I add 2-3 drops of contact solution and that does the trick.</li>
    <li> Love it! Seller was communicative. Product works better than expected - (better than others that I&#x27;ve tried). Great transplanting gel mascara wand so that you can pull the straight - no tarantula lashes over here! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try fiber mascara for awhile. So, I was excited when I got the chance to get this for a reduced price to try and review. This is a three step process. First you put on the transplanting gel, which is like a mascara. While it&#x27;s wet, you brush on fibers to add length and volume. You then set it with another coat of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and added a lot of volume to my lashes. Much more than you&#x27;ll ever get from a mascara alone. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is when I washed it off, there were fibers every where, on my face and on the cloth. But, while I was applying them and while they were on, the fibers stayed in place perfectly and didn&#x27;t fall onto my face at all.</li>
    <li> It seems to to do the job, but I can tell that the product  will run out fast .&lt;br /&gt;But worth the 6. 00$</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a perfect 3D fiber lash mascara for the past few months. I have tried numerous kinds, and some go on easier than others while some just look better than others. However, when I found this one, I decided to give it a try, and I am so happy I did! This fiber lash mascara is by far my favorite. It is very easy to apply and dries so nicely. I didn&#x27;t even have to use a lash comb when I was finished. I also love how easily the mascara layers on itself. It doesn&#x27;t come out clumpy at all. I always work with one eye first to completion. I use the gel and immediately apply the fibers. I wait about a minute before applying the top coat of gel, which works best for me. Also, a lot of people will recommend that you start with a base coat of regular mascara, but I recommend that you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;ll make the gel and fibers harder to apply and may make it look clumpy. When I applied this mascara, it lasted all day without any fibers falling lose. I even fell asleep with it on, and it stayed perfect for the whole next day too! It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, and I can&#x27;t wait to keep wearing it. Everybody freaks out over how nice my lashes are, especially when I have this fiber lash mascara on, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Photo: top shows one eye done and one eye with no mascara, bottom shows end result. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but its better to get it from an actual Macee Leigh rep</li>
    <li> Very cool product &amp; does work, but whether or not it&#x27;s good for your lashes it&#x27;s difficult to tell since it was shipped all the way from China.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Works just as well as Younique 3D fiber lashes but cost way less! Only down fall was that it took so long to come in the mail (3 weeks) but it was well worth the wait because of the difference in prices!</li>
    <li> When you buy this product it comes in a cute pink hard case. The first time I tried this product I instantly saw results. I was very happy with the results. This product works wonders and is also fairly cheap compared to other 3d fiber lash mascaras. It easy to use and mess free. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run when wet. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also the customer service with this product is outstanding. From the email I got giving full instructions to the company thanking me for the purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this was my very first attempt at buying a fiber lash mascara. Since ordering this brand I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to test out another brand as well. I&#x27;m not a huge makeup guru, but I have hypothyroidism which causes my eye lashes to basically not exist. This stuff worked GREAT! It&#x27;s easy to reapply several hours later if necessary. I will say that I had a friend over when the product arrived and she showed me how to do it. Her instructions were almost the same as the products instructions, but it was good to have someone hands on to show me how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply I get both the defining gel and the fiber lash want out and turned upside down ready to use. I&#x27;ve found that if you use the fiber last IMMEDIATELY after the defining gel it sticks better. I make sure that I have no extra fiber lashes hanging off of the wand before I apply it to my eyes. I did have them fall in my eyes and irritate a few times, but the more I use it, the more I discover how to avoid that. This is one product that you need to practice with to get good at applying it. I will say that I have used the Younique 3D fiber lashes and I like this product better and it is less expensive. It&#x27;s still a hefty price tag for mascara so I may search out another brand that I can get for cheaper, but if I can&#x27;t find one, this is the product I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an inexperienced mascara putter on-er, this product is great for me!!!</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, my lashes did look longer and thicker. The only problem was the glue like tube didn&#x27;t hold the fibers on well enough and the fibers fell into my eye throughout the day. Whenever I wear it my eyes get so irritated by it and people always tell me I have things in my eyes, and it&#x27;s of course the fibers. So if you want to buy it be careful to watch out for eye irritation.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara very much. It helps my eyelash long and thick. I don&#x27;t need fake eyelashes anyone. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Great price great product will buy more...</li>
    <li> Totally recommend It Makes Your Eyelashes Look Fake But On The Natural Side ... Jaja. Your Eyelashes Won&#x27;t be Hard As Of A Regular mascara Would ... My Eyelashes felt like Feathers I Loved It . !!!</li>
    <li> Way too pricey, I found the same thing for a third of the price, works just as well. Make sure you try and find and affordable product</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product. the application was very easy.(just follow the instructions) was. it washes off really easy too! My friends were very shocked when I told them it was a mascara and not fake lashes and i had only applied one coat!! would definitely buy again. incredible product! ........i decided to try two coats, oh man!!!! just like long fake lashes, great buy!!</li>
    <li> I love 3D fiber lashes. These are similar to Younique fiber lashes! They are amazing, I do put regular mascara on first and usually do two coats of the lashes! They make your lashes appear thicker and darker some of my friends had tried mine because they thought it looked like I had fake eyelashes! These are a must have!</li>
    <li> I wear a basic face of makeup, most times none at all. There are often occasions I want a &amp;#34;beat&amp;#34; face. You know, that full glamorous look. Whatever your preference this 3D mascara will give you life with no parole!! My look isn&#x27;t complete unless my lashes are looking good, however, I have yet to master the art of falsies. This mascara is easy to use, saves me time and money. Best of all, it makes my lashes incredibly thick and lengthy like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. It&#x27;s buildable so you can apply to the level you are seeking whether its a simple look or dramatic.This product is a must have for those that don&#x27;t want to bother with the hassle of applying lashes everyday or spending money to get them done. A must have for your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve bought the American made brand. This was a disappointment. Fibers get in your eyes. I don&#x27;t think the mascara looks anymore lush and thick than my normal everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this and I give this product 10 stars!!! I have fine short lashes and this makes my lashes look absolutely beautiful</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my lashes and the fibers get in my eyes too much.</li>
    <li> The gel goes on fine.  The fiber stuff is floofy (if that is a word) and it looks good initially, but soon it falls into your eyes, onto your cheeks, or just plain irritates.  I also tried adding my own waterproof mascara over this after it dried.  It works okay, but if sort of seems clumpy then. Both ways I feel my eyes are irritated, and they never are with my usual waterproof mascara.  I am very glad I did not waste the money on the 36.00 stuff, though some reviews state that the expensive stuff works better than this does.  This is from China &amp; does not come with a case (if you care).  Many feedbacks stated that though.  Took about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this kind from now on, I have tried many kinds I actually have about 10 different mascaras in my makeup bag right now and nothing compares to this mascara, you will not be disappointed if you buy this kind 👍</li>
    <li> Instructions were not in English.  Flakes too much.</li>
    <li> Wife says that it doesn&#x27;t look any differet from regular mascara and the fibers get into her eyes. All day irritation.  Only bonus was she fell asleep with make up on and it looked like it had just been applied.  Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Works great! Makes your eyelashes look fuller &amp; just as good as the other competitor brands.</li>
    <li> Seems like gel is not wet enough and lashes also almost like tubes are halfway full. Not anything like yoniqe eye lashes&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper version. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This is the first one that I received to review that is super cute and comes with a pink box which I love most. The details on the mascara is the cute and so appealing. It is similar to younique mascara but this one doesn&#x27;t apply as good as that one. I didn&#x27;t notice much fall out during the day but I did have to go over it again during the day. I notice it didn&#x27;t apply a dramatic look like I was looking for but i would continue to use it for days that I want a little more length with my lashes. I just wish all bottles of mascara could look this cute and appealing.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!!!!  Shipping was fast and i love the case it comes it!!!  I have barely there lashes and was kind of skeptical at how much of a difference this product would actually make.  Let me tell you it is a huge difference!  A lady I work with asked me if I had gotten fake lashes!  This is def going to be part of my routine in the mornings!  I went really slow because the two tubes was new to me, but after the second day I had the hang of it and now it is a breeze!  I will def order this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> Wish it made my lashes fuller I do tend to go for my falsies but that&#x27;s just me. However it does make my lower lashes look amazing</li>
    <li> Does exactly as described! You will have much longer lashes. I had no issues with this product. Great price too</li>
    <li> So I bought this thinking it was the younique 3D fiber lash mascara Ive seen around. It was not it was some asian 3D fiber lash mascara I could not read any of the writing, but ultimately it worked great it is only my second day using it but my first day I had 2 people ask me if my lashes were real!!! I have longer eye lashes already but this mascara is not thick or clumpy,love it!</li>
    <li> Eye irritation was terrible!!!!  I am not sure what is in this but my eye turned so red and irritated that I didn&#x27;t put it on the other one!!  Is there formaldehyde in this or something......anyway it was awful!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This product does just what it says, my lashes were long and thick. My friend brought it to.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at first but it is irritating and clumpy.  Plus it has a terrible odor.</li>
    <li> This is the second kind of fiber lashes I&#x27;ve tried and i like this one more ! So far ... I would order again</li>
    <li> I love the mascara!!&lt;br /&gt;It just took a long time to get here.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Stays on all day long with no flaking!  Really glad I purchased this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The lashes didn&#x27;t stay on without flaking for very long.  It irritated my eyes no matter how far up my lashes I started or how maany times I sealed it.  Definitly won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> VERY EASY AND GOOD TO USE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used 3D fiber lash type mascara so it was a little weird to me and kind of clumpy. It did make my lashes appear to be longer and washed off very easily.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome.  I am in love with this product.  Looks professional.  My eyes looks and feels more vibrant.  No fussy, messy looks.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great Mascara makes my lashes look like they are long and thick! I will by this again in a minute!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the different 3d fiber mascaras and I can say that this brand ended up being my favorite.  It not only gives me incredibly long lashes but I can chose between a dramatic look or a natural look By how many coats I apply.  This mascara was never clumpy like some of the other brands and it&#x27;s not messy and difficult like false lashes.  When I want to remove,  it&#x27;s as simple as baby oil or a regular eye remover. I can&#x27;t even go back to my old mascaras now that I use this.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product,  great price,  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Was suppose to come with a Case. NO CASE.  WILL. NOT BUY AGAIN!#!!!</li>
    <li> seems like a good idea until you use it. gets very clumped on lashes and doesn&#x27;t stay for more than an hour</li>
    <li> Loved this product compared to a different one that I had purchased. Wish I could purchase again but it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> The product works just OK, I am not impressed enough to give up on false lashes. It doesn&#x27;t look natural at all and makes your lashes look pretty wild and unruly. It does make them look fuller and longer but I personally think it looks sloppy. The fiber got into my eye throughout the day and was irritating but mostly stayed put. I will use it to make thinner lashes look a little fuller but once I run out I won&#x27;t bother purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I was blown away by the huge difference that it makes compared to regular mascara. whenever I will need a new one I will def get the same again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work and I didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> I have been reading a lot about fiber lashes and how they are very popular right now.  There are brands that are more expensive and maybe they work better.  I have a hard time getting the fibers to look natural.  They want to clump and bend at a weird angle on the tips of your lashes that gives you a &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lash effect.  Not pretty!  I am still using them but I have to apply an extra coat of mascara over it to make the fibers behave.  The first tube of liquid you put on your lashes before applying the tube with the fibers in it has a weird chemical smell and makes my eyes burn if I get it too close the the base of my lashes which you are not supposed to do but accidentally getting too close can happen. I could not really recommend this product.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again but I might try another brand just for comparison. I bought this product because I was using a grow lash serum and it was making my eyes itch.  I really liked the grow serum but the eye itching was a drawback.</li>
    <li> Amazing product makes you look like you have incredible lashes! A must try, you will love it. The price is affordable.</li>
    <li> If I cud give it zero stars I wud! Horrible product! Made my eye itch and burn and my lashes looked no different then wear Maybelline mega plush volume. .....will never ever buy this again! Plus the tubes were defective the tops came right off</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at a reduced price to offer an honest opinion. My daughter absolutely loves this mascara! It really brings out her eyes! Also it lasted all day and night and did not run at all! It also comes in such a cute case. Great value a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Im a member of Elite Deal Club so I can try great products for an amazing price. I have small lashes so this duo enhanced my lashes. Buy this product! You will love it</li>
    <li> My long lost search for volume is over! 3D Fiber Lashes not only makes your eyes pop, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate you like many other brands on the market!! I found it very easy to apply and it really brings out my sexiness! If you&#x27;re looking for a natural product to make your lashes fuller then I would definitely recommend buying this! Just follow the directions as instructed and you&#x27;ll be in glamorous in no time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that this would have been a great product if I had been able to get more than two applications out of it. I was really disappointed that the fiber wand was empty after I used it only twice. I won&#x27;t buy this from the same supplier again.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It achieves a very noticeable intense look.</li>
    <li> The product kinda works. I keep feeling like they fall off and drop in my eye. It&#x27;s an uncomfortable feeling. It came with no case. The bottles are cheep. One already came off the shell. It is a little hard to apply because the gel clumps really bad on the brush. I just don&#x27;t like the quality of the product at all. What else can you expect for that price thou.</li>
    <li> the only problem I had was I was supposed to get the carrying case and didn&#x27;t but the product is GREAT &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My eyelashes doubles in size and became fuller. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family and already have.</li>
    <li> They definitely work to enhance your lashes--and importantly, more than great lash mascara, or the leading typical kind. However they are SOOOO messy &amp; clumpy!!! After applying them, I have little lash fibers all over my face &amp; worse- all in my EYES!!! Getting fibers everywhere is a major disaster in the pursuit of full lash. However if you like clumpy, it definitely works.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed in these. They flake all over my face and get in my eyes despite following instructions to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; them. Not impressed with how they look. They are a mess--definitely will not buy again!</li>
    <li> As I age. ..my lashes get thinner  and  more sparse.  Your mascara  really does give me long full lashes with very little effort.  I love it.  What more can I say.....</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product and over all the shipping was fast. I do believe its over hyped and over priced. I did notice more volume and length but not more than any other high end mascara (like falsies). I&#x27;ve also heard that Better than Sex Mascara was just as good with less hassle and less applications.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! Im in love with this thing! I don&#x27;t have to spend 3 hours on my lashes anymore. Definitely gonna buy again :)</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It made my lashes look great and I didn&#x27;t have any of the flaking or irritation others have experienced. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara very quickly. It was sealed in cute pink case. I have eye lashes but I want them to be more pronounced. I have used many other mascaras and I still have not noticed the difference I was looking for until now. This 3D Fiber Mascara gets the job done. It looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes that&#x27;s how much my eye lashes pop. I wear contacts and the mascara did not cause any issues at all. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Younique 3D fiber lashes, thought I&#x27;d see how these compare.  The gel has an odor, which I don&#x27;t get with Younique.  My lashes seemed to clump more also</li>
    <li> I love the enhancement this product gives my lashes without using false lashes. They look natural. The only thing I dislike is it does tend to flake a little bit leaving black spots under my eyes. This is reduced however by putting some powder under my eyes and making sure to heavily apply the gel. In addition the seller &amp;#34;Love Alpha&amp;#34; is obviously all about good customer service because they have followed up with me several times to ensure my happiness.</li>
    <li> Live it but takes practice to be perfect</li>
    <li> I am lucky to have naturally long lashes, but they are very fine and stick straight and lose curl with just about every mascara. I ordered this product not necessarily for the extra length, but for thicker lashes and more volume. I was expecting this product to uncurl my lashes like most and that I would end up with with very long and straight lashes, but to my surprise, that didn&#x27;t happen. The formula is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your lashes at all. After some experimenting, for me I find it best to still use my regular mascara prior to using the 3D fiber lash extension mascara. I get great length and increased volume with this product. You do have to be careful about how many layers you apply though, your eyelashes start to get pretty spidery with too much product. And if you curl your eyelashes, curl BEFORE you apply the product. Curling after causes your eyelashes to stick together like glue. Some of the stray fibers will end up on your face, but they&#x27;re easy to brush away. This probably isn&#x27;t an every day product for me since I tend to stay pretty basic during the week, but I will definitely use this when I want a more dramatic look at night.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Its one of those things that i will never be out of. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My instructions were in Japanese. So I hope you already know how to apply this crap. It didn&#x27;t really make my lashes any longer. Definitely thicker and clumpier. My case was damaged when I got it and you can tell both tubes were not sealed when I got them. Almost as if they were used. Not sure if I will even keep using this product... Super disapointed!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this mascara was a joke. The first tube, a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is just regular mascara. The second tube is literally what it says. Fibers. It confused me so much when I first opened it.  After actually using it for a while and playing around with it to get the hang of it, I like it. You put the mascara on and then immediately coat it with the fibers which gives it the length. And then you add another coat of mascara. There&#x27;s a trick to it and it takes some getting used to but I don&#x27;t feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This definitely makes your eyelashes much longer!  My only wish is that it made them thicker too.  I put on several coats but they never appeared thicker.  I would recommend this if you only need to lengthen your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product at all...I see no difference using this item then when I use regular mascara. Does not lengthen my lashes. In my opinion it does nothing!!!</li>
    <li> My lashes look amazing...get so many compliments on my eyes</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of my money! As soon as it arrived I opened it and the tube was dried out! I would never purchase this specific product again!</li>
    <li> My girls like this product.</li>
    <li> Instructions were in Chinese or something BUT Internet search fixed that. I love this stuff! Pretty, natural, and fun!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t include the case or the instructions in English.  The fibers do fall off but seem to stay pretty well once I put mascara over them. Doesn&#x27;t seem to lengthen much. And I have to be careful not to get it too clumpy. Overall it&#x27;s not much difference in my normal mascara. I&#x27;m glad it was cheap.</li>
    <li> These did nothing for me and I was so excited!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I waited about a month for this product. I was excited and eager to try it out, well that didn&#x27;t happen. The gel is completely dried out. Waste of money. I do not recommend anyone waste their money on this!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a replica of the real thing. Poor quality. Flakes all over your face. Took a month to get it.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara in the pink packaging thinking it was the same product my friend had.  NO WAY!  This stuff is junk.  It flakes, it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the stuff my friend had.  If you want the original 3-D Fiber lashes check out Lash Ninja on Facebook and the website too (same name, dot com)</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE THIS! I have barely any lashes and this makes me look like I have amazing, long, and thick lashes. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is my second review since it seems my first one has been deleted. I commented on the packaging how it was all in Chinese so I had to ask someone who had referred me to this product. I did get a response right away and was instructed that the directions in English were inside the pamphlet. I did and there is no directions in English. As for the product it is ok but my eyelashes definitely do not look like the pictures on the pamphlet.</li>
    <li> This product is everything I wanted it to be! The packaging is sleek and the instructions are easy. I would recommend doing two or three coats of your regular mascara prior to doing the two step fiber process. This produced more full and longer lashes for me. I highly record getting this product! I have told everyone I know to go out and buy and they have loved it as well!</li>
    <li> very cool product!  Never seen anything like it.</li>
    <li> The gel is nice! The fiber tube that&#x27;s added after gel is applied comes off around eyes and cheeks.</li>
    <li> It works and my lashes look much longer! The only problem is that a few lashes seem to fall off in my eyes or on my face but it was not too noticeable. Overall I like the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way my eye lashes are super lusciously long and beautiful plus its comfortable it didn&#x27;t bother me a bit I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Works great. No smudging or smearing. Goes on great.</li>
    <li> everyone asking if i have false lashes on with the beautiful length and very easy to apply.did not need mascara with this&lt;br /&gt;received at discount for my reveiw and its so worth buying ladys.works great</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY EYE LASHES FALL OUT!!!</li>
    <li> It does not go on easy it makes eye lashes look messy and not natural,  goes on clumpy.</li>
    <li> It does not matter how you apply the fibers, this stuff is horrible and clumps!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and my gorgeous lashes. Shipping was quick &amp; package delivered within stated timeframe. A++</li>
    <li> I have seen different mascaras like this with the Fiber for a few years now. I never tried them before this one. I was hesitant due to people saying the fibers sometimes get in your eyes. I did NOT have that problem with this mascara. I actually really liked this and how full it made my lashes. The only downside is the brush for the gel. it does not separate the lashes very well. I had to use a different wand to separate my lashes. After that I used the gel, then i put on the fiber. I did not have any issues throughout the day with flaking or fiber falling off. Even better, at the end of the day it came off super easy with water. No messy black stuff around my eyes. Just kind of rolls up and comes off with no mess or fuss. Definitly one of the best mascara&#x27;s I own, and I have tons.</li>
    <li> The directions came in Chinese but that&#x27;s nothing the internet can&#x27;t handle. I&#x27;m Asian so I know an amazing mascara when I see one. I absolutely love this product I will be buying it all the time now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money on the fake stuff. Get the real stuff and the new 3D now.  (...)</li>
    <li> Hi I have a question for the people that have gotten this mascara does it work.?</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it, you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied. Directions are on description of order, I love it. It makes my lashes look long and beautiful. Definitely not like an oordinary mascara. Just reordered ! ✔</li>
    <li> Does not come with case... Very little fibers... Loved the result but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product made my lashes fuller and longer! Who doesn&#x27;t want that?!  I really put it to the test last night by doing many layers of fibers and it looked amazing. It looked like I had fake lashes on! Some fibers do end up falling onto my skin but no big deal!</li>
    <li> Did not like flaked off in my eyes and face. Did not hold up in humidity and felt it flake off in my eyes all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, when I first tried to use it I was disappointed because it just didn&#x27;t seem to be that dramatic of a difference. I then read a reviewer used her OWN MASCARA FIRST, so thats what I did &amp; Such a Difference, the transplanting gel is too thin to build from. This is an Excellent Product that Really Works!!!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how to use this mascara and the instructions weren&#x27;t in English.  Incidentally, I am unhappy with the product and don&#x27;t find it any better than my &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
    <li> Totally loved this item. The fibers were soft and sticks onto your lashes. They stick on really good, kind of like water proof.</li>
    <li> The really do add volume and make my eye lashed look longer. Definitely happy I purchased.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Applies with no problems. Only problem was that instructions came in non-English. I had to find instructions on YouTube</li>
    <li> TOTALLY love this!! I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d enjoy this product. I&#x27;m so bad at putting on fake eyelashes so I tried this and it&#x27;s way easier and goes on beautifully, you can do more than one coat/application and keep adding length and volume in whatever spots you want. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Not satisified at out all..would not recommend these..</li>
    <li> It actually works you just have to take your time applying the mascara it doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable as long as you add enough transplanting g3l</li>
    <li> OMG! This is amazing!!!!!!!! Is a must buy and I don&#x27;t really write reviews! But I want everybody to know how AMAZING IT IS!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the excess flakes, otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Not happy, the lashes fall off and make under the eye black!!!</li>
    <li> I just received  my 3d fiber lashes and it was dry and smelled awful. I was very disappointed in the product and upset that I paid $15 for nothing. I&#x27;m only giving one star because you can&#x27;t give anything else.</li>
    <li> was not as good as I expected. did not lengthen my lashes much</li>
    <li> While it may make your lashes look slightly longer, it isn&#x27;t worth it. Once it is applied a lot of those fibers flake off and stay on your skin unless you notice them and wipe them off. I ended up just using the mascara part for regular every day use and threw the fiber part out.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Increases my lashes naturally without the need for and fake eye lashes</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money and the mascara is not any better than regular product.  It arrived with instructions in Chinese so I really did not know how to use it properly.  They finally sent me instructions in English after I complained but I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try for my sister-in-laws wedding!!! I didnt want to spend an outrageous amount of money on the name brand one (i am sure you have all heard of it)... I was skeptical buying it - but this is truly AMAZING!! I had a very bad experience less than a year ago having false lash extensions put on - lets just say I ended up with ZERO, yes ZERO natural lashes left! After babying my lashes for 8 months and letting my naturals grow back in (thank god they did) I was itching to get more length and volume that the extensions give, well let me tell you this WILL give you that and will not cost you your natural lashes!! These lasted the entire wedding, they even lasted thru tears (which was impressive). I HIGHLY recommend these for anyone looking to try fiber lashes.. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> No directions that are in English, it was all in Japanese or Chinese not sure which. the lint stuff gets into your eyes and causes irritation.  It does thicken your lashes or at least the appearance, but not without a cost.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The seller sent an email with a step-by-step guide that made application fool proof.  I am sold!</li>
    <li> Falls apart on your lash. Not the real deal or anything like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice n does what it should but finishes too quickly.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product and over all the shipping was fast. I do believe its over hyped and over priced. I did notice more volume and length but not more than any other high end mascara (like falsies). I&#x27;ve also heard that Better than Sex Mascara was just as good with less hassle and less applications.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!! Product was as described. I would definitely be purchasing again for the price. Way more economical. My lashes look thicker and longer!!</li>
    <li> There were no instructions; there are two tubes and it wasn&#x27;t clear which is used first. When I did try it it was no better than the mascara I normally use. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;m raving about it.</li>
    <li> Flakes off on your face after time.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;m honestly not understanding why this has so many bad reviews because I love this mascara. I assume there has been a recent change in the product because unlike many others, my instructions were in English. I am a contact lens wearer and I didn&#x27;t experience any running or fibers falling into my eyes. No irritation at all after about 9 hours of wearing it. Application is everything with this product. Use your own mascara first, then follow the instructions given.</li>
    <li> I liked it...make my own lashes look thicker and longer....</li>
    <li> The price for the mascara is reasonable. The mascara does not come with the case but came in a box that was pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> product was dry when it got here need refund</li>
    <li> Mascara was completely  dry and unusable. Complete waste of money and I cannot get a refund.</li>
    <li> The product does make your lashes look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;However it climps up far more than normal mascara. I have to use a older mascara brush behind the product in order to separate the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I also did not receive a carrying case with mine.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was kinda disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> This product quality is unacceptable!! And I think when a product is available in the USA, English instructions and ingredient list should be included with packaging.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t come with the case</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the expensive brands! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve been using younique 3d lashes for the last year but thought it was over priced and kindve came out clumpy. This brand is way better and less expensive! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very smudgy. Smears a lot not that different than regular mascara...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Younique mascara &amp; less hassle than fake lashes.  I found both in this mascara!  It&#x27;s super easy to use and comes off without eye makeup remover ( a HUGE plus for me since most of the removers burn my eyes)  I just use warm water &amp; it&#x27;s all gone - no raccoon eyes in the morning either.  If you want waterproof - this is NOT for you though.  Holds up fine in normal wear - but will run if you swim, etc.</li>
    <li> It does lengthen lashes but not as well as Younique 3D Lash mascara.  I tried out my sister&#x27;s and her&#x27;s definitely looks a lot more fuller and longer than this one.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy  this product and the way it makes me feel.  I have used other lash extension mascaras and this one does just as good.</li>
    <li> Great product last for quite awhile, went out for the day and didn&#x27;t have to reapply all day Love it. received at reduced cost for honest opinion /review. Thanks</li>
    <li> Package arrived verybeat up with box ripped open. The actual product had a weird smell. Almost smelled like rubber cement. The tubes were both already opened when I received them. The fibers seemed quality, but where were they from?</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I so freaking love the mascara! It&#x27;s so amazing and I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I love it! it makes my eyes look fabulous! The seller went above and beyond to get this to me and even reimbursed me when I explained that my product had become damaged through the mail. Love love love it! I will definitely buy again! I wanted to try something close to the 3D fiber lash stuff and hadn&#x27;t been able to find anything I could actually afford. I didn&#x27;t want to go broke buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like. I tried the Physicians formula one and it was ok then I got this in the mail and its awesome!!! No clumping, doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge. Doesn&#x27;t flake off. Lasts all day until I take it off and get this... I remove it with a baby wipe! Yeah it really is the best thing I have found so far. Great seller, great product!! Thank you for everything!! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love this mascara. I will be buying again</li>
    <li> I love it, it actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive brands!</li>
    <li> The product was dry and did not come with instructions that were in English.  Did not do what it claimed.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.  It was old, crumbly and dry.  Top it off, instructions were in Chinese!</li>
    <li> Used 3 times and now stuff is all dried up and flakes all over...mess</li>
    <li> I loved it for the price you pay its a great deal it&#x27;s simple to use and makes your eyes pop great purchase And very easy to get off</li>
    <li> Have to say that I&#x27;m impressed that this stuff works so well. Definitely lengthens and gives my lashes body. Definitely worth the price paid!</li>
    <li> Great product! Gives volume and length without clumpy spider eyes!</li>
    <li> I love this 3D fiber lash mascara! Will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> I really love how this applies. My only issue is that when applying the fibers, sometimes they will fall into my eye and cause slight irritation but maybe that is my fault as I haven&#x27;t used anything like this before. It adds wonderful length and volume and looks fabulous if you can get past the light irritation if it happens to get into your eye. After drying i didn&#x27;t have any issues with fallout though, just the initial application is tricky.</li>
    <li> I think for the price this mascara is great! I will most likely buy it again.  The whole idea of 3D fiber lashes I am not sold on yet.  I find that I get the fibers all around my eye and they can be difficult to get off.  The result of them is definitely fuller longer looking lashes.  Like I said, compared to other brands this is a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it for every one of my daughters and friends. I have never had eyelashes that showed up before now.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  will keep using</li>
    <li> I did not came with a case</li>
    <li> Love 3D fiber it works as described it makes your eye lashes look much fuller no problems what so ever pretty simple to use. Oh, and that cute little pink case they come in is a big plus</li>
    <li> This mascara really does wonders on the lashes. My lashes look 2x longer and fuller. Although the high price I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be buying more...my lashes look so natural and LONG/FULL!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product- comparable to the popular fiber lash mascara that independent consultants are selling these days- PERFECT PRICE</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a fiber mascara that wasn&#x27;t $40+ and went with this product based on customer reviews.  I am not impressed with this product at all.  I get better results with a regular lash lengthening mascara then with this product.  I see no real results from using the fibers with this kit.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Terrible didnt realize I was buying a Chinese knock off it was just terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> White build up mascara was completely dried out. Tried everything to fix but product was too old. Big waste of money</li>
    <li> BEST FIBER LASH I BROUGHT</li>
    <li> If you want pieces of what feel like microscopic hairs in your eyes all day, this is the product for you. I tried this product twice thinking I must have done something wrong the first time, but sure enough I had the same results the second time as well. I was going for longer lashes and ended up looking like I had been crying all day. I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I have plenty of experience with application and I assure you, it was not a user error, this mascara makes you want to scratch your eyes out. I wish I could give it a 0 star rating because that&#x27;s all it deserves.</li>
    <li> It only makes my lashes thicker not longer.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this mascara as it&#x27;s an off-brand of the Younique lashes. I was pleasantly surprised, as it works amazingly! The directions are not in english, and have no photos, so you if you don&#x27;t already know how to use it, it would be hard to figure out. Personally, I have found that for the best results, I apply my regular mascara first, then the mascara from this brand (the larger tube) and before the mascara dries, you add the fibers (smaller tube), after that you apply the mascara again. It sounds like a lot, but once you get the hang of it, it takes less than 5 minutes. Also, I have tried the Younique (sp?) mascara and I hated it. It REALLY irritated my eyes! The fibers constantly fell and got in my eyes. That doesn&#x27;t happen with this, except for the initial application. So when you are finished, take a bronzer brush and simply brush the excess fibers away!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty awesome! False lashes are all the rage right now but very expensive. This mascara has little sticky fibers that make your own lashes look long and thick. The only thing was it was a bit messy. I put sticky notes under my eyes for easier clean up. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s very easy to do.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 3D Lash Extension and I am in love with this mascara very easy to apply and the length &amp; dimension of my lashes looks like my eyelashes are fake I&#x27;m so pleased and excited!! Please buy this product I promise you&#x27;ll fall in love with your new lashes as well!!! Best invention ever!!!!! And affordable!!!! Jeannie from Chicago!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the results that this mascara provides.  My lashes appeared longer and thicker and it easily washed off.  I would definitely try this again!</li>
    <li> It was amazing!  I love the product!  It comes in English AND Chinese, I super glued the English instructions to the inside of the case.  The case is REALLY pretty as well. Does not get in my eyes and is easy to apply with and without directions and it lasts all day.  I love it and I definitely recommend this for ANYONE that wants to look like they have false eyelashes WITHOUT the hassle.</li>
    <li> You would think from the picture that the items would come in &#x27;case&#x27; , right?. Well it didnt it came in a clear plastic bag with the &#x27;information, instructions&#x27; wrapped around the two tubes. I have used the product would rate it average, now that being said the instructions are in another language  and one only and it is not english  or anything that I could look up and translate so I may be applying it wrong?? even though Ive tried it all the ways it could be tried there are only two tubes? and it is like any other mascara Ive used no marked difference. So should I as the consumer be aware that the picture of the product could be misleading and read the description of the item if the &#x27;box&#x27; makes a real difference in my decision to purchase this item.  Now the instructions are another matter if you are selling your product in an english speaking country you should have english directions, I know that many things I purchase in the USA have the directions , information in many languages ? right? its an average product , average price but if I had purchased it at the store I would have known or been able to see before hand what I was getting and if I could understand how to us it. And if it had come int he nice pink box thats what caught my eye that would have helped with the entire purchase , dont put the product in a box if it comes in a plastic bag? its not rocket science guys.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.. Took a long time to get to me. It also didn&#x27;t come with the case. Just the two tubes of makeup. I did notice it does add fullness and length.</li>
    <li> The containers are flimsy. Neither tops were on tight.  The mascara is clumpy</li>
    <li> Its a great product, i love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a more cost effective way to keep up with youniques product, and I am very happy with the price and product. I&#x27;ve used them both and only purchased this product twice.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s basically like plain mascara. like if you buy this you might as well buy something at the drug  store for 5$  guess you get what you pay for and this is worthless</li>
    <li> Yes I&#x27;m very pleased  with my fiber lash</li>
    <li> Received On time. The product is amazing. I will order 5 more Soon.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received it,I used n it right away. It actually increased my lashes a lot instantly. I love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived at my doorstep quickly. Very nice product. It would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Works as good as the expensive stuff that sells for $32.</li>
    <li> So dry! I had to throw it away waste of money DO NOT buy. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product spent to much. Cute case but it was dry.</li>
    <li> The fibers were an irritant therefore don&#x27;t care for it.  The skin around my eyes broke out in red bumps.</li>
    <li> First of all the directions are not in english so I had to just guess at how to apply it. I never get irritation from make up but the one time I used this I felt like something was in my eye for 2 days after.</li>
    <li> So I am pretty much lazy in the makeup department and one of my closest friends is always driving me crazy about needing to put on like 10 minutes of mascara...who has time for that especially with 2 boys, husband, house, and full time career?!  So I look around and found this product.  It does 100 swipes of mascara in less than a minute!!!  Now I have nice eyelashes and a friend off my back and it makes my eyes pop!!! Thanks!!  You have a repeat consumer here :)</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my lashes look.  This is the best product you can buy for a great price and it is simple to use!!</li>
    <li> Product works as described but seemed to dry out faster than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I just received my 3d mascara today.  I am not satisfied at all. When I opened my package my mascara was already opened.  I could tell because there was mascara on the side of the tube. I don&#x27;t want to use it because I don&#x27;t know why it was opened?  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> LOVE...LOVE...LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> very very disappointed in this product. Received it without the pink case but with a small plastic ziplock.-not as shown in the pictures. i&#x27;ve felt like i&#x27;ve beed deceived. buyers beware!</li>
    <li> I guess I thought this would be a better product.  Most people may love the fiber lash mascara but I find that the fibers get in my eyes and irritate them.  It may be for some people but just not for me.  It did come in a very nice case but the instructions were not in English.  It was okay.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....Definitely a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Gel is dry! I will not recommend or buy ever again!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! Better than Yonique.</li>
    <li> this really makes your lashes longer and eyes wider, the only problem is you end up with some black residue around your eyes, but overall the product does what it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price but does not achieve the 3D effect.  It&#x27;s like a regular mascara.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Minimal flaking.</li>
    <li> I did not like these fiber lashes.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I tried younique 3d fiber lashes. If you wanT REAL 3D LASHES order at www.youniqueproducts.comCrystalLeelashes</li>
    <li> A lot of trouble.  I would rather just use regular mascara.</li>
    <li> Starts flaking off in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Fibers don&#x27;t always stay in lashes and gets into your eyes.</li>
    <li> Info specifically say that this product comes with a case. Mine came in a plastic bag and when I opened it the product was obvious that it had been used. Very dissapointed. I will never be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It was dried out when delivered</li>
    <li> Just came in a baggie...not the case....</li>
    <li> Applicator on mascara broke during second use. Fiber does not make a big difference. Not happy with this product</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Sent it back...It completely flaked off into my eyes and on my face.  Didn&#x27;t seem like there was very much in the tube either.  There is a reason this is so much cheaper than the others.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara NO MORE FALSE EYELASHES my prayers have been answered!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this set!  I don&#x27;t get big matted fake looking lashes but it&#x27;s considerably better than what I was born with.</li>
    <li> instructions were in Chinese and was dried out never buy again was very disappointed</li>
    <li> the maskara itself smells like paint but you get passed it after a few minutes. the fibers tend to fall but you can wipe them away (very embarassing if you forget to wipe them away) makes eyelashes very long and srtring like but no volume to your lashes at all. but for 5% of the cost of one at ulta or any other beauty store it is definatley worth the money</li>
    <li> First if all it took 4 months to come and then it came w no case and no English directions and then the product sucked.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It clumped up.</li>
    <li> excellent product 👏 I&#x27;m in live with it</li>
    <li> I will purchase again!! Gave my lashes a boost without looking fake!!! Easy to apply. A few extra steps but worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
    <li> Pure  trash ,when I received this product ,disappointed  me, the package where it came it seems that  someone  used  before , and  I never would use  something used  in my face , one of this product was completely empty , don&#x27;t waste your money  on this  trash. thanks</li>
    <li> Awesome product yes it really work my daughter love it</li>
    <li> Fibers keep falling on face won&#x27;t stick to lashes very long</li>
    <li> Gel was dry, bad customer service, go to the original maker of these lashes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome! I get so many compliments on how long my lashes are. My lashes hit my glasses.  I work all night... No raccoon eyes! I sent some to my sister. .. She is amazed at how her lashes look. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This 3D mascara works just like most 3D mascara. Apply the gel then the fibers, repeat steps depending on how extensive, long and full you want your lashes. It gives your eyelashes the great dramatic effect and makes them stand out more, especially if you have short, thin lashes like I do. It&#x27;s a lot more dramatic if you apply eyeliner to your eyelid first before putting on the mascara. You&#x27;ll need to make sure you have an eyelash comb handy because it can become clumpy, depending on how many layers of mascara you put on. The fibers tend to fall out during the day, but not a lot. If I want to keep my dramatic look, I have to reapply at least one coat, but that can make it look spidery. If you wear contacts, be aware that these fibers can also fall into your eyes and effect your contact vision. When this happens, I just put a drop of my solution into my eye and it washes away the fiber. I love the case it comes in. Very cute and chic. I purchased this mascara on promo to test and review. It works like most 3D mascara like I stated in the beginning. Great for women with short, thin lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara on a Sunday night and received this item on Wednesday morning, so fast delivery. Item comes packaged in a cute pink  eyeglass shaped container. Easy instructions for applying the mascara and 3D fibers. Makes my eyelashes longer than if I just used regular mascara. I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but the fiber is crazy and goes every which direction, all over your face, your counter and in your eyes, so it&#x27;s not that easy to use nor does it do what I thought it would.  It also does not come in this nice case they show! It is in a plastic bag!  The directions are in Japanese or Chinese and there is NO ENGLISH in the packaging at all.  Also the tubes are unmarked so you don&#x27;t know which is which and have to be careful when returning the wands to the tubes!  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> So far i like it. I wore it for the 1st time today and i didn&#x27;t experience any shedding of the fibers. It is really simple.  However i did have to use my favorite mascara 1st before applying my fibers. I don&#x27;t like my lashes to be clumped. It came b4 Christmas when it said it was schedule to come jan 8. So 2 thumps up for that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased love alpha before and really liked it. I liked it so much I purchased a set of four to give out as Christmas gifts. Well...I was a little disappointed this time with the package. Not only did it take almost a month to receive the items but all four sets came in individual baggies. What happen to the pink cases it usually comes in? Will continue to purchase product but NOT from that particular vendor!</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara. I have short very light lashes. This mascara dual brings my lashes out to an extremely long level. I love this and will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great for the price. I love the mascara.  It is easy to use and isn&#x27;t overly clumpy.  The only thing I will say is it took a long time to come and I didn&#x27;t get the case.</li>
    <li> Very good. It did take a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday day or night. Would not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the transformation of my eyelashes. This product is incredible. Many of my friends were commenting on how long and pretty my eyelashes were</li>
    <li> Works good just takes forever to get</li>
    <li> Yep. That&#x27;s some good stuff. I tried it before I splurged on that one brand we do not speak of.... Yeah, I&#x27;m not even bothering to buy it now. I love this one soo much. It&#x27;s not clumpy and doesn&#x27;t leave fibers all over my face, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look all stupid and spidery</li>
    <li> Crazy thick and long lashes. Takes a little practice but looks really awesome when you finish.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Fiber lash and works just as well</li>
    <li> Didnt work well for me. Once i put it on, I should have taken it off, but i went about my day, and the fibers started to fall on my face, into my eyes, and irritated me the whole day. It wasnt a great experience for me, i think ill just stick with regular mascara.</li>
    <li> The fibers don&#x27;t stick on your eye lashes. I didn&#x27;t like this product at all...😳</li>
    <li> Great product but it dries out to fast the gel stuff</li>
    <li> I love this product!, if not used correctly however..  it could be disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Remember one is wet, ( the transplant gel ) and one is dry ( the fiber lash ),  Iit does look dried out, have both bottles open in hand and do one set at a time. Also lock your lashes in with a coat of the transplant gel and you won&#x27;t have flaking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given these simple tip to all my clients who purchase this s product, and everyone love s it! no  complaints!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will never again use anything but.</li>
    <li> Love it. I will order again.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because unless you apply it perfectly on and take your time it&#x27;s clump at stick your lashes together! It took me about 3 times to get it to go on right. Nothing like the 40 dollar American made one I just ordered that one goes on nice and smooth no mess.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Wish the instructions had been I&#x27;m English but I got the hang of it and my eyelashes  look great!</li>
    <li> This mascara does work but after wearing it a few hours I had fibers all underneath my eyes from where they didn&#x27;t stay put</li>
    <li> I have never tried a 3D fiber lash extension mascara before so I was excited to try this one out for the first time. This mascara was easy to apply and it comes with the instruction guide. Once you use the transplanting gel and apply the fibers there was a bit more volume and length in my lashes. Always make sure you seal the fiber with the transplanting gel cause if you don&#x27;t then the fiber starts to fall on your cheek which had occurred to me. Overall I love that I was able to get more length and volume with this mascara. This is a two step mascara.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It does take some practice to figure out how to use it but once you do your lashes will look fabulous every day!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always been very into big lashes. I naturally have pretty good eye lashes but this product helped make them amazing! It was completely worth the price. Washes off easily and makes for stunning eyelashes!!!</li>
    <li> First of all this product didnt meet my expectations at all. I followed the instructions exactly and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, just using a good mascara will give you better results. The fibers get in your eyes and all over your face....literally everywhere. Such a great idea but not worth the pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> This makes a huge transformation for my eye lashes. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends! I hope you all enjoy your purchase</li>
    <li> Great fiber mascara and at a much better price than the other more popular brand. This mascara lasted all day and I had no flaking at all.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for a perfect price.</li>
    <li> So easy to use! My lashes look 100% better! Fuller and longer! Love this!!!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my daughter and she LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I believe I applied this mascara correctly (first applying my regular one them following up by applying the other two) however I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and although it did sort of act as a transparent mascara, the effect was lackluster compared to what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Worst make up product I bought on Amazon yet! Looks clumpy and terrible, they get all over under my eye, they get IN my eye and it hurts because they are so small and there&#x27;s so many of them, and it was hard to wash off even with make up remover. It Came in a plastic Ziploc bag with no case. Shipping took awhile, but I would expect that since its coming from China. I would not recommend buying this if you&#x27;re trying to go for a false eyelash look because it definitely doesn&#x27;t get the job done!</li>
    <li> False advertising. All I got was the tube of mascara and a tube of fibers. No case and instructions were in Chinese.</li>
    <li> dry and nothing was in bottles.</li>
    <li> 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara works Great! Comes in a cool container. Applies easy and really plumps up my lashes. Perfect color and addition to my already full lashes. Thank-you!.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I use it every morning and it is easy to apply. No clumping or smearing.Does not smear or smudge throughout the day. Easy to remove at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wear it now. I can&#x27;t believe how nice my lashes look. Almost fake. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $29.00 - LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Fibers flake onto your face and under your eyes all day. By the end of the day there are no fibers left on the lashes and you look like you have extremely dark circles under your eyes.</li>
    <li> i like this because its not TOO dramatic. I would like the color to be a bit darker, but i like how it leaves my lashed looking natural</li>
    <li> It definitely adds length, the only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is they tend to get a feathery look, rather than a more polished look like fake eyelashes or extensions.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! My lashes are actually visible now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Warning: make sure there is no fan or breeze while applying the fibers!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with my items... Delivery was fast and I love my fiber lash extensions thank you guys💜</li>
    <li> I have blonde eye lashes so on nights I go out this product is great for making my lashes look great without having to use extensions. Love read directions and you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> Wow do these work great!  The instructions come in chinese, so I needed to youtube instructions.  Put regular mascara on first, then gel, then fiber, then gel.  Repeat with gel/fiber/gel for additional coats.</li>
    <li> I have used other 3D lash products and I love their gel brush. Price is amazing and I will keep buying this product</li>
    <li> GOT IT TODAY.. DIDN&#x27;T EXPECT TOO MUCH (SORRY).. EVEN ONE OF MY COWORKERS HERE TOLD ME SHE USED A FIBER LASH MASCARA THIS MORNING AND TOTALLY DID NOT WORK.  SO, I PUT ON THE FIRST COAT .. OKAY... SECOND COAT.. WOW!!! THIS IS AMAZING!!! MY LASHES LOOK FULLER AND LONGER.. FIBERS A BIT ON MY FACE BUT I TOOK A QTIP AND CLEANED THEM UP FAST.. ONE FELL INSIDE MY EYE AND IT WAS NO PROBLEM.. JUST GOT IT OUT WITH THE SAME QTIP.  AWESOME, AWESOME.. AWESOME</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara this my 3x now to buy this mascara great price and really work it 👍😃 better to buy this than @ Walmart I will buy more and more 😃😊👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I have the original unique 3d fiber lashes and this brand does not come close to unique. I was excited about this when I got it but the mascara part is very liquidy and didn&#x27;t stick right to my eye lashes. It&#x27;s an ok product for the price but I rather spend the 25-35 dollars on the unique brand</li>
    <li> This helped to give the appearance of longer lashes. First I apply the mascara to the lashes. Then I apply the fiber to the lashes to add length to them. Then finally, I apply the mascara again over both the lashes and fibers. However I have to be real careful not to apply too much fiber on the lashes or the lashes and fibers will clump when I apply the final coat of mascara. Sometimes I just wear the mascara and don&#x27;t bother with the fibers. For a better and more natural effect, use just a little fiber on the lashes.</li>
    <li> Worked very well .Wish it would have came with a lash brush also.</li>
    <li> Company shipped very quickly, A + for that.So far I love  product I have very short ,sparse lashes and this product makes me look like I am wearing falsies.  The product did come with a case as well as instructions in English, the company also sent an email about how to make the most of this product and use it correctly.  The only thing I did notice was it is a little hard to remove but not any more so than waterproof mascara.  A tiny bit of flaking when first applied but if u wait a couple of minutes it just brushes right off.  No flaking or smudging throughout the day even in the 90 degree heat.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This Mascara is incredible!!!  Looks like I have false eye lashes on all day!  Easy to wash off!  Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful, Love it</li>
    <li> This fiber part of the mascara is great, they are a good length and thickness, and are not overly shiny, which is a problem I have had in the past. The transplanting formula however is much to dry and thin, I could not get the fibers to stick to it even after re-reading instructions and watching several YouTube tutorials. I ended up using another mascara I owned that is very sticky, applying the fibers, then applying some clear mascara as a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also while the outer sunglasses like case was in good &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; condition, the two tubes of product are very dented and scratched up, so much so that I couldn&#x27;t tell if that was the pattern or look that was intended.</li>
    <li> Item did not appear new. The case was a bit worn and the product didn&#x27;t seem to have a lot in it. Lashes got in my eyes causing irritation.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s drought. I can not use it.</li>
    <li> I received my lashes kit today, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! This stuff is crazy awesome!  It looks like I have on false eye lashes, only better!!  Daphne Beauty, this product is amazing! I&#x27;ll never buy mascara again!! I LOVE my eye lashes!! These are very easy to apply and wash off easily! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!! 😁</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance, and she said no more false lashes this mascara gives her the look without the glue and half the application  time.</li>
    <li> would have rated this item a 5 star except the directions were in Chinese only. Had to check the site and reviews to learn how to use the product. Works well. Great value. Just please make the directions in ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is perfect, but I didn&#x27;t receive a box with mascara. That&#x27;s the only thing I have to mention.  thank you</li>
    <li> This product extended my lashes to be at least twice as long as regular mascara. Lashes do not look fake, they just look full and lush.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Don&#x27;t wear it every day but on special occasions. Looks natural. Remove like mascara. MUCH better than false eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Great product. Normal mascara I have to do 8 coats to get the same as one coat of the 3d mascara</li>
    <li> Sucks  didn&#x27;t even come in a case not what I expected</li>
    <li> Makes lashes look longer and better, doesn&#x27;t come in the case and can be clumpy if your not careful, directions come in Spanish, sooo can&#x27;t read then. And my lid of the massacre broke m. Had to glue it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. My clients love it!</li>
    <li> Not real Younique Fiber Lash mascara. Filled with chemicals. False advertising.</li>
    <li> It works good...but when I got it 2weeks later it did not come how it is shown it&#x27;s did not include the case to put it in...one of the main reasons I pick this kind to order</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it works so well. Im glad I got it</li>
    <li> Didnt work as I expected. This product doesvthe same job any regular falses mascara you buy at walmart. So i just recently ordered younique fiber lash mascara and I am so happy with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara! Such a great price too... I use it every day and I also bought one for my mother who has very fine lashes. They make her lashes so long and full she couldn&#x27;t believe the great results. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Would be nice if I spoke Chinese , perhaps then I could read the directions. Lol</li>
    <li> Smells funky, irritates my eyes, and the fibers flake off so easily and fall under my eyes or in my eyes. Everything came in Chinese (I think that&#x27;s what it is...) and my case looked use with black hairs all inside of it. It does make your eyelashes look fuller, and comes off easily with water. But I would recommend going with something different. I got this because it was cheaper and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $35 for mascara, but I&#x27;d rather pay that price or just go with normal drugstore mascara.</li>
    <li> I absolutely looooove this product! It looks so natural and it last all day and waterproof! I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and it came with no case and in a plastic bag. And no English instructions.</li>
    <li> why is it so expensive now? i bought this back in January for $6. now its abt 20 bucks. wow. But I tell ya, ITS SOOOO WORTH IT!!!</li>
    <li> This a horrible item. The fiber falls into your eyes repeatedly throughout the day. I hate to waste money but I&#x27;m too scared that I&#x27;ll get droopy bags under my eyes from attempting to get all the fiber out. I found that this product is not worth the money. I purchased LOVE ATTI and don&#x27;t have these problems. And no ladies the fiber is not falling because I don&#x27;t know how to apply it or due to the mascara I am using .... It&#x27;s just a horrible knock-off.</li>
    <li> My lashes are naturally short and this just makes them bold and long and BAM out there!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was ok did not come with English instructions or the pink case</li>
    <li> This was a horrible product. My eye turned red because of the fibers! There is no way I will buy it again. If I could give this zero stars I totally would!!!! Waste of money..</li>
    <li> I love it! It gives me a dramatic and bold look without looking clumpy! I have ordered a different brand of fiber lashes from a a different company that was a lot more expensive than this product (35$) and it doesn&#x27;t even compare! The shipping took longer than I expected and hoped for but the quality of the product as well as the price evened it out. I will be ordering my fiber lashes through this provider again.</li>
    <li> Great product for someone whose eyelashes is short.  Extremely please with it.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Thick, but easy to work with if you are familiar with makeup. Plus you can use as many coats as you want without looking like a clumpy mess.</li>
    <li> Mine did not work nothing like I expected. The instructions were in Chinese and I did not receive the case that was supposed to come with it! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This product took forever to get in. It did not come with a case!! just in a plastic bag. instructions were in Japanese. not impressed i will spend the money and get the real thing.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this product when I first bought it. It does exactly what is says it will. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are no English instructions, but that wasn&#x27;t a huge issue. I just watched a video on Youtube to see how to apply. It was very simple. After a couple of weeks, the product just isn&#x27;t the same. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it still works. However, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;gloopy&amp;#34; and not as easy to apply. I think this is because the fibers start to get mixed with the wand from the mascara. When I purchased this, I had hoped that it would last longer. I have only had this for a few weeks, and I already feel like I will have to re-order soon or try something different. I am leaning towards trying a different product that does the same thing.</li>
    <li> doesnt do anything different then a mascara u could buy at walmart</li>
    <li> I really liked how this mascara makes my eyelashes look :)</li>
    <li> Really adds that dramatic look to my eyes that I was looking for. Much better then adding fake lashes gives the same effect with out all the hassel of using glue to apply fake lashes. Great mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s improves my lashes but doesn&#x27;t work  5 star</li>
    <li> The product was not what I expected at all. When you apply the mascara (by the instructions - which are in a different language), it flakes all over your face and irritates our eyes.</li>
    <li> Holy Lashes!! I am so happy about this mascara..I&#x27;ve tried another brand that a girl locally has sold, for way too much  money, and this mascara is not only affordable, BUT BETTER!! It came in a nice pretty pink box!! Very sturdy, with a tube of gel, and a tube of the fibers.. both black!  They were both secured in place with an elastic band.. The tubes are beautifully colored pink and purple with 3D glitter specks.. I started with the gel tube, applied 1 coat to my lashes, then applied the fibers..only needed 2 streaks of it, then applied the gel tube to hold in place.. I didnt have to apply more than one round of fibers on each eye because this mascara works soooo good.. It not only stayed on all day, but didn&#x27;t smear or leave fibers on my face like the other local girls mascara.. I am truly pleased with this and cannot wait to wear it again tomorrow!&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinions</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! A must have.  Cheaper than the name brand and works just the same, if not better.  Does not irritate the eye.</li>
    <li> Get the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  They&#x27;re amazing!  www.youniqueproducts.com/sarahkabbe</li>
    <li> This product was sold as &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, but it was dry, seems old and did not perform as described. I wish I could return it now but unfortunately it is too late. I should have contacted the seller. My bad!</li>
    <li> Not what I excepted. Worst s*** ever...</li>
    <li> It was dried out and unfortunately I purchased two.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the low reviews on this product - I have the blondest, thinnest lashes ever and this product changed that in an instant. I will be purchasing this product again and will be buying for Christmas presents. This product is easy to use - the instructions DO come in English..I don&#x27;t get that review, it has nothing to do with the actual product..anyway - it is 3 steps - put the gel on - this is the tube that has a normal looking brush - then you follow up with the other tube, this has the fibers - then a second coat of the get and you will be amazed. If you don&#x27;t believe me, believe this, I did one eye with my normal mascara and one eye with this product on a Saturday and went up to my husband who commented &amp;#34;did something happen to your eye?&amp;#34; - now, if that isn&#x27;t a compliment, then I don&#x27;t know what is. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap for a reason :-/ It&#x27;s no good! It can&#x27;t compare to the authentic Younique. I buy from my friend and that stuff is amazing!! Plus it&#x27;s all natural green tea fibers so I know I&#x27;m not messing up my eyes. [...] and u can guarantee you&#x27;ll get a quality product with a money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> I really love the mascara it has started flaking  a lot of my eyes since I&#x27;ve have  been  using it never did  at first</li>
    <li> Delivery was quicker then expected, arrived in perfect condition. I love this product, it&#x27;s amazing. I will order from this seller again, love it, thank you :)</li>
    <li> My lashes look amazing. I had doubts that it would work but I am in love!!</li>
    <li> is a great product considering its coming all the way from china</li>
    <li> So far I love this stuff. .Wish I would&#x27;ve had it moons ago. Came quick and does what is says..</li>
    <li> After doing extension that are expensive, and trying fake lashes, this has been the best product ever.  It applies easily, 4 steps as the directions but then on your way with 3D lashes.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve never used fiber mascara so this was my first experience and it was not good. The fibers that go on get all over your face and in and around your eyes, which is very uncomfortable. It really doesn&#x27;t make your lashes that much longer either. The directions are all in Chinese. It took over a month to get here. Not worth the wait. I will not be ordering this again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> directions are in Chinese so i still don&#x27;t know if I am applying it correctly.  It feels like sand in my eyes!  I really can&#x27;t see a difference in my lashes either.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Meh. Not a fan. Hard to apply and I like my &#x27;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tube Technology Lash Extension Effect Mascara, Blackest Black&#x27; ten times better.</li>
    <li> Mascara comes with out pretty pink case in the picture.  What you get is an ugly baggie with the mascaras.  When contacted the seller wanted &amp;#34;reship&amp;#34; the cases that were never included to begin for another 15-22 days so you will wait a total of 30 to 44 business days to have this great 3d mascara that actually works well. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well. Should have known for the price</li>
