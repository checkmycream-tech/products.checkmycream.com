      <li>It&#x27;s pretty though.</li>
      <li>The cap fit nice and wasn&#x27;t too hard too keep in place.</li>
      <li>Instructions were provided on how to care for the hair which I really appreciate since this is my first cosplaying wig.</li>
      <li>I had to wash it a few times which took most of the beautiful curl out :/</li>

      <li>I spend a VERY long time trying to untangle it, however, despite my best efforts I hardly made a dent in the whole tangle issue.</li>

      <li>so well I love the color, such a vibrant blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly decent quality for the price.</li>

      <li>Very soft, not plastic-y feeling hair.  </li>
      <li>It was the exact blue.</li>
      <li>It was really silky and felt like actual hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, my only two complaint is that it does get tangled easily, but I&#x27;m not too worried about that.</li>
      <li>However,  it had a very pungent smell as if it had been packaged ans sitting in a factory for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Looks nice but was a little tangled, to be expected since it&#x27;s not real hair</li>
      <li>This wig looked great on but the white cap underneath showed through near the bangs. :(</li>
      <li>I was incredibly surprised at how similar the actual wig looked to the picture.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is so soft and very long.</li>

<li> BUT A LITTLE TO BLUE FOR ME.</li>
<li> but it definitely has some thin spots.</li>
<li> My wig came with a small piece of cardboard glued to the hair in the front bang section.  </li>
<li> It arrived to me unbelievably tangled and frizzy.</li>
<li> Not pleased about that.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s still pretty just a bit disappointed.</li>
<li> I love wigs, so it would have to be really bad to make me unhappy.</li>
<li> There were some knots that I ended up cutting out, but nothing major.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit complicated to brush without pulling out some hair.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it tangles like crazy and gets frizzy with any movement.</li>

    <li> GREAT COLOR JUST LIKE THE PICTURE</li>
    <li> I am using this for a Ramona Flowers cosplay! I had to style the wig and cut it. It came in on time and was packaged neatly. The wig is very soft and easy to untangle. The price is definitely a steal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly decent quality for the price. My only issues were the style of cut of the wig didn&#x27;t match the picture, there was bald spots I had to cover by over extending and only measured 26inch at the longest point.. I like this wig alot though &#x3D;) worked for my Rocker Juvia cosplay!</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister. it&#x27;s a nice wig, but you can see a little through the hairs and underneath to the wig cap</li>
    <li> This blue wig pleased my granddaughter immensely and I didn&#x27;t mind it. In fact, I think it&#x27;s kinda fun. Buying it at a very reasonable price and receiving it in 4 days is pretty awesome too.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wig! It even came with a comb. I would not recommend if you have never had a wig before because it can get tangled easily.</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful color and came in good condition</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty wig. Unfortunately it tangles like crazy and gets frizzy with any movement. The top of the wig is thiner, which isn&#x27;t a huge problem,  just need to style it. My wig came with a small piece of cardboard glued to the hair in the front bang section.  Not pleased about that. I am 5&#x27;5 and this wig goes to my posterior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a wig before so I decided to get the package deal. It is wonderful, thick and fits so well I love the color, such a vibrant blue.</li>
    <li> It arrived to me unbelievably tangled and frizzy. I spend a VERY long time trying to untangle it, however, despite my best efforts I hardly made a dent in the whole tangle issue. Also, for the frizz, it was so frizzy even after I tried straightening it the frizz was still there.</li>
    <li> Image makes it look like there are bangs (fringe) but nope.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price and shipping was excellent. Came with a cap and snaps so it held the wig in place.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a wig party and I kept my wig on all night. No problem.</li>
    <li> The quality is great,I had to cut the bangs down a bit,The curls are beautiful and it is so soft.</li>
    <li> IT IS GORGEOUS BUT A LITTLE TO BLUE FOR ME. IT IS VERY NICE AND SOFT WIG THOUGH. :) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It is pretty but it definitely has some thin spots. Was it worth the price? Yes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the color it Is exactly as the picture shows! The curls are perfect as well as the length!</li>
    <li> This was my first wig ever purchased. This wig came with hair net over it, which is a good sign. The cap fit nice and wasn&#x27;t too hard too keep in place. I was incredibly surprised at how similar the actual wig looked to the picture. It was the exact blue. The curls came exactly as shown. It was really silky and felt like actual hair. Because the wig is so long, it does tangle easily. It&#x27;s a bit complicated to brush without pulling out some hair. There were some knots that I ended up cutting out, but nothing major. I trimmed the bangs a bit as well. There pretty easy to style. The wig was light and wasn&#x27;t hot at all. It was a bit big for my head. The hooks helped, but after moving around a lot the hooks came undone. I now learned it&#x27;s easy to hook it in the front. Also, some bobby pins would help too. I did get many compliments when I wore the wig. I was satisfied with my purchase and would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with my purchase! I bought this for a bachelorette party and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out. The wig itself is so soft and very long. It looks very similar to the pictures with the exception that the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; are thicker and longer then they look in the pictures but could easily be trimmed if needed. I just tucked some of them back. The color is right on to the picture and it is just as perfectly curly as well. The wig cap it came with is a nice quality and easily holds back my hair. I used the comb that came with it on the bangs and it smoothed them out perfectly. Very happy with my product and recommend this to anyone thinking about purchasing!</li>

    <li> I like this wig. It&#x27;s a pretty color, my only two complaint is that it does get tangled easily, but I&#x27;m not too worried about that. And it&#x27;s a bit shiny and plastic looking. To my surprise though, there&#x27;s different shades of blue in the hair, so that was a nice touch!</li>
    <li> The color is exactly like the picture, and it shipped fast! It&#x27;s amazing quality.I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful color, though I haven&#x27;t had too many chances to use it yet. Very pretty, though, and one of my personal favorite colors that they have to choose from.</li>
