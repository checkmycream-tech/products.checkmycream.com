    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the item so I can&#x27;t honestly rate the goods. I got hair dress instead. So I received two of the same items in different sizes.</li>
    <li> This product was not described accurately.  It is a pomade not a conditioner. I just don&#x27;t want anyone to be misled.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for  a friend. she states that she can not use anything but this for her hair.</li>
