    <li> Best, absorb faster. Very pure</li>
    <li> I love essential oils. They last a long time, are better than any expensive face cream on the market,  and they are natural.  What I like best about Leven Rose&#x27;s oils is they are 100% organic and cold pressed, meaning nothing has been lost in the processing.  This is a very important factor when it comes to oils...of any type.  I purchased jojoba oil first and now this fantastic four some.  A definite must for all who are into using what God gave us.  I give them 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Very impressed with this gift set.  Beautiful, thoughtful packaging.  Perfect size to sample products (and for travel).  I ordered this gift set specifically for the Jojoba Oil and Rosehip Oil, and what a bonus to be able to try the Emu and Argan oils as well.  I&#x27;ve been trying to transition into using all natural products for skincare (wrinkles, sun spots, aging) and these kept coming up in my research.  Together they (Jojoba &amp; Rosehip)  are fabulous.  Love the feel of the oils on my skin and the fresh look I have in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using them together every morning and evening as a moisturizer for my skin, with a few drops of essential oils added in.  I will update soon with results.  Very happy with this purchase!  Thank you Frances and Leven Rose for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Lovely set.  It does seem to be a little bit pricey per. oz for personal use, but they do all seem to be quite high quality oils and are in amber glass with eye droppers. If this is a gift, the presentation is great and makes it easily worth it.&lt;br /&gt;All of the oils have been great, but I have been particularly blown away by the emu oil.  It completely transformed the texture of my skin right away after adding a few drops to a lotion.  I usually have a bit of KP on my arms and legs, and it seemed to have a really positive impact on that.  I&#x27;m ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;Get this set as a wonderful gift for someone else or for yourself as an easy way to try out the different benefits of different oils.</li>
    <li> Love this pack it was prefect. I got everything I wanted and all in one. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is such a great gift to anyone.  The bottles are packaged in a cylinder plastic container and it looks really cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand is very good because it works. You can feel confident in the product you are buying.  Each bottle comes in a dark glass container with an eye dropper.  These bottles are great to take while flying.  It&#x27;s actually the reason why I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to bring my 4 oz bottle (especially since you have to pay to check your bag now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Jojoba Oil and it has made my skin amazing!  It cleared it up and my skin is so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the Argan Oil and my hair is smooth and less frizzy.  It makes my hair look healthy and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the Emu Oil or Rosehip Oil yet. I&#x27;ve read that all four of these products are good for your skin.  Emu Oil is good for pain and Rosehip Oil is good for revitalizing scars, wrinkles, etc...</li>
    <li> I love ordering for Leven Rose. Frances is so personable and always leaves a little note in the package you get or sends and email. The gift set comes packaged in a cute cylinder package with a silver bow and you can see the oils through the packaging with the darling pink lables. The oils are 100% organic and cold pressed which makes them the very best quality. The feel so wonderful! Thank you Leven Rose for always providing the very best quality and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love these oils! Perfect size to try them out. I use them on my skin and hair everyday, they make my skin glow and get rid off all the frizz. I will defiantly be buying from here in the future due to the high quality of oils and great results!!</li>
    <li> These oils are presented beautifully. I am dividing the oils up for gifts but these can be kept as a set and given as it. Love the oils and can&#x27;t wait to try the Emu oil.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing gift - just in time for the holiday season! - but really a great anytime gift for anyone you know who loves and appreciates good quality essential oils. I love the quality of Leven Rose oils.  This Leven Rose gift set is a perfect blend of quality and presentation. The Gift Set came in a gift wrap packaging all ready to hand to the recipient of the gift!!</li>
    <li> Leven Rose is such a great company and...thsir products!!!&lt;br /&gt;BOTH AMAZING 💝📦...&lt;br /&gt;and I can&#x27;t finish until I say affordable even before coupon codes &amp; who can resist PINK🍥🌹.</li>
