      <li>but whatever it is, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a body cream with a sweet scent while at the same time moisturizes and does not leave the skin feeling greasy.</li>

    <li> I LIKE IT, ITS FUN, LONG LASTING, AND SMELLS GREAT! MY BOYFRIEND LIKES IT TOO, HE SAYS IT SMELLS LIKE LAFFY TAFFY! I AM ORDERING THE PERFUME AS WELL!</li>
    <li> I purchase the full line of this scent because my boyfriend tested it in store - shopping with me, which I did force him to do (I like picking scents he will like to smell on me when I can) - and he loved the smell. He said it was just as girly as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty girly, but this scent is more girly than I am. It reminds me of a ballerina. It smells like potpourri made from roses, summer flowers, and vanilla sugar. I like the smell, I just prefer something more fruity or baked sweets. I will admits it is a nice smell though - I would probably purchase the candle of it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this lotion again, simply because it isn&#x27;t my style of scent and because I want to keep trying the limitless scents from this and other brands. I would recommend it to my friends - we love luxury, girly items, and pink.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Pink Chiffon, and this lotion is very high quality.  Upon application it absorbs quickly and gives your skin a smooth, silky feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some lotions do.  On occasion I use it for my hands also, and it works very well.  And the tube is so pretty! I would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent of Pink Chiffon.</li>
    <li> I got this as an early birthday gift and it smelled nice in the tube. I put it on after my nightly shower and I fell in love.

    <li> Pink Chiffon is one of my favorite fragrances!!  This perfect for my fragrance layering. I have the body wash, lotion as well as the spray mist.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels awesome, and I suffer with sinus a so I can&#x27;t stand strong smells so this is great.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for it&#x27;s playful, flirtatious, sweet scent. The perfume is nice, but not the usual expectation for a perfume. The lotion is velvety and will have you in a great mood.</li>

    <li> Bough the perfume with tis cream smells better....both of them still doesnt last long at all</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZAYN! Its really girly and it smelt just the way I thought it would!  After a days use my hands. Fetter and elbows were soft!&lt;br /&gt;It last longer when paired with the tine fragrance mist. Definatly a great Buy! [[ASIN:B0076372TQ Bath &amp; Body Works Pink Chiffon Fine Fragrance Mist 8 oz (New Look)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^ Its together a bit pricey but its worth it!</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of Bath and Body Works&#x27;Pink Chiffon selection. I already have the body spray and the shower gel and this body cream is a nice addition to my collection. Unlike most scented lotion that does not do a very good job in moisturizing the skin, this one&#x27;s different. Maybe it&#x27;s because of it&#x27;s triple moisture feature but whatever it is, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a body cream with a sweet scent while at the same time moisturizes and does not leave the skin feeling greasy. It absorbs well!</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS! It&#x27;s a good moisturizing lotion. smell lasts really long too:) and a good deal! Esspecially for people who live in Hawaii haha</li>
    <li> Its the same product that they sell at &amp;#34;bath and body works&amp;#34; for a cheaper price! and yes its AUTHENTIC!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite for the wife so got it as a gift. My only issue and why 3 stars is the additional, impossible to remove label placed on it by seller. It is about a 1 to 2 inch barcode label that is uncharacteristic of the product and wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if came off cleanly. The tube was also misshapen from storage so had to open it to allow air in and reshape. Will go through B &amp; BW next time. If not a gift and buying for self use, great price as add on item.</li>
