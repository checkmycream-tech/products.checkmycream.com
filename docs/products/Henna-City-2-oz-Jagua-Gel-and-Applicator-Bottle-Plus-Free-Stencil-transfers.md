<li> With this ink a little bit really does go a long way!</li>
<li> Curious to see how long it&#x27;ll last.</li>
<li> Was waiting till it gets dry, after i didnt know what to do and i went to the bathroom to check how its going to resist with water, and all the gel went...</li>
<li> So dont sleep with this stuff because even though it looks dry, it will copy itself onto whatever its pressed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> , it was gark geen, i thought like whait, i wanted a dark blue one...</li>
<li> The gel lasts a while, i have done 5 tattoos already and still have half the bottle left.</li>
<li> I would get the smaller one and save a little bit of money.</li>
<li> You can even do layering/shading, but you gotta be really careful.</li>
<li> Just be careful where the jagua gel ends up though because it won&#x27;t come off for 12-15 days.</li>
<li> so I think that&#x27;s why it looks dark blue (almost black) on my skin.</li>
<li> It leaves a dark blue to black color</li>
<li> It stayed dark for almost 3 weeks which is a week longer than promised.</li>
<li> P.s you have to be careful once applies allow the ink to sit for a few hours</li>
<li> Seems to be slowly fading daily, so maybe another week or so.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t compare it to henna or any other temporary tattoo ink, but this stuff was so messy and clumpy.</li>
<li> Looks like a black tattoo after it dries.</li>
<li> Dried in about half an hour</li>
<li> The lines dried really unevenly and my fingers were black for a week.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s maybe that iv used to much on myself that after it begins to fade it leave a red irritating mark that Iches like crazy</li>
<li> Or just if a person wants to draw on themselves without worrying about damaging skin or bad chemicals.</li>

    <li> Shipped fast and works as indicated. I just tried out a design on my foot using one of the included stencils and it was easy to apply. Dried in about half an hour but I left it on for 2 hours. As described, it was light grey for the first 24 hours but then began to darken and was darkest after 48 hrs. It&#x27;s day 6 now and it is fading to a more bluish black but still looks great. Curious to see how long it&#x27;ll last. Seems to be slowly fading daily, so maybe another week or so.  I&#x27;ll be playing around with it a lot and using it to try out variations of a tattoo I&#x27;m planning to eventually have done permanently. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for making temporary tattoos. Looks like a black tattoo after it dries. This is especially helpful if you are interested in getting a tattoo but you want to try it out to see how you like the designs.</li>
    <li> Burned and irritated skin. Did not get credit when returned item either.</li>
    <li> Fantastic natural product !&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions , start fading after 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Fun !</li>
    <li> Love the ease of the ink flow. The ink stayed on for almost 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to henna or any other temporary tattoo ink, but this stuff was so messy and clumpy. The lines dried really unevenly and my fingers were black for a week.</li>
    <li> Perfect. You can make for you tatto hole year))))</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that you will not regret buying this product. I was looking for another form of henna that would stain black and this exactly what I was looking for! It leaves a dark blue to black color so it looks more realistic than henna. Although do be careful not to mess up because it stains immediately, even though you may think you wiped it away quickly, I promise after the color starts showing you will see where you messed up.  My design stayed for 2 weeks even though they were on my hands.  I have nothing bad to say about this product it truly exceeded my expectations. Oh, one note unless you are doing huge tattoos/designs that cover like the entire stomach, you really do not need this huge bottle. I would get the smaller one and save a little bit of money. With this ink a little bit really does go a long way! Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Ink came in super quick am ready to draw yeah!&lt;br /&gt;The process to use is easy just gonna get on it and than order another bottle</li>
    <li> Shipped really quickly, I was so excited to try it out. MUST get more in the future because I&#x27;m loving it so much! Looks like a real tattoo but without the pain and commitment</li>
    <li> Gave to my Granddaughter and she was pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> Exellent!! I ordered this product, and it satisfied all my expectations!!! An applicator bottle is confortable and easy in use, as well as the quality of the product! I draw some japaneese ieroglifs with my ball pen on my left hand and then i covered it all with Jagua gel, it was gark geen, i thought like whait, i wanted a dark blue one... Was waiting till it gets dry, after i didnt know what to do and i went to the bathroom to check how its going to resist with water, and all the gel went...it was transparent and i coud see only the contours...i thought like what the hell... But the next mornig went i woke up i noticed that tranparent tattoo become solid and now its getting more and more dark blue, like real a tattoo!!! Really impressive!!! Recommend to every one!! Really cool effect! Thanks to Henna City ;)</li>
    <li> Used it for my 16 yr. old daughter. It burned her skin and she still has a rash from it a month later!!! Would definitely NOT recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> Great consistency and smell. Beautiful, dark results.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome because it allows me to design tattoo ideas and put them on my skin WITHOUT my parents freaking out about it :) I find it very easy to use and think it is a very good product and should be seriously considered if one is considering getting a tattoo but doesn’t know what they want and wants to try some different designs out. Or just if a person wants to draw on themselves without worrying about damaging skin or bad chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product is the REAL deal. Works EXACTLY  as stated. It stayed dark for almost 3 weeks which is a week longer than promised. I tried competitors products and they don&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ll ONLY buy from Henna City.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure how this product would be. I have used henna products before and it was hard to work with, but with Skin-Inks Jagua Gel it was so easy and simple to use. The gel lasts a while, i have done 5 tattoos already and still have half the bottle left. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. I will definitely buy more when this runs out. The stencils were a nice added bonus to the kit.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a tattoo. I am just a really picky person and this ink helped give me a realistic feel of what a permanent tattoo would look like on me. I am tan so I think that&#x27;s why it looks dark blue (almost black) on my skin. For lighter people it tends to have a blue-ish tone to it. The different sized applicators were great for very detailed pieces. The gel has a nice thick consistency which facilitates perfect line-work. I tried this out on all of my friends and they absolutely loved it. Just be careful where the jagua gel ends up though because it won&#x27;t come off for 12-15 days. I work with this ink all the time and I have begun to order in larger amounts. I love this stuff and so far none of my (500+) customers have had any sort of allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Very, very fun and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleased at the quality and how BLACK it came out on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on week two and it&#x27;s pretty much faded, but that&#x27;s okay with me.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The ink stains a nice dark blue/blackish hue... but bleeds around the edges so it&#x27;s hard to get a clean line. I think I&#x27;ll stick with henna!</li>
    <li> Love this kind of ink. Glides right on, stains really well (and I mean really well, so watch for your fingers.) I&#x27;ve done tattoo try outs for this and just for fun stuff. You can even do layering/shading, but you gotta be really careful. Only problem with the ink, is that you have to constantly refrigerate it or else it won&#x27;t stain well, so keeping it for long periods of time is difficult (But that&#x27;s also because of the ink itself. That&#x27;s just how it works.) THe product arrives quickly, I love the applicators. It&#x27;s easy to clean. And this was a good amount for a large tribal tattoo, so if that&#x27;s your plan, this is good. Otherwise, go with a smaller bottle for smaller designs. You can maintain it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. And it&#x27;s relatively cheap. Gonna buy it again, no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> Over all great product make sure to read instructions specially if you haven&#x27;t used any kind of ink product before don&#x27;t forget to not make mistakes . Other wise you&#x27;re good! P.s you have to be careful once applies allow the ink to sit for a few hours then it&#x27;ll start to peel off you won&#x27;t see ink when it peels but it slowly starts to darken ( the stain) and then it&#x27;ll be very visible . I&#x27;m a professional tattoo artist so if you have any questions you can Kik me @capnnutelly</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good... I liked it overall. It gave a nice dark color and it was nice to freehand my creativity onto my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be cautious.. do NOT make any mistakes or try to wipe of a &amp;#34;mistake&amp;#34; because it will show the next day. I attempted to do a Henna on my daughters hand and this happened to me. Also I did it on my hand and blowed it with a blow dryer to make sure it good to go. We both fell asleep and woke up to having it printed on our face because somewhere in the middle of the night thats just how we slept at one point. It was embarrassing and didnt come off for about 4 days. So dont sleep with this stuff because even though it looks dry, it will copy itself onto whatever its pressed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway overall i did like the product, just have to be super careful with it. Lasts about 9 or 10 days</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this gel. It&#x27;s not black henna and it is completely safe for your skin (unless you are naturally allergic, of course) and it looks like a real tattoo. I got so many compliments on the dream catcher design I did on my forearm and many thought I got a tattoo for graduation. Keep in mind when applying this stuff, though, that it stains all skin it touches. I recommend wearing gloves when applying to protect you fingers from staining. Also it&#x27;s completely safe to outline your design in eyeliner before applying, I had no problem with pigmentation when I tried it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came with nice stencils. We are having fun drawing on each other. I will be purchasing this again. Wear rubber gloves to avoid staining.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s stays on great and does its job but iv done a lot on myself and it&#x27;s maybe that iv used to much on myself that after it begins to fade it leave a red irritating mark that Iches like crazy&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m allergic&lt;br /&gt;Idk but over all on other people it works great</li>
