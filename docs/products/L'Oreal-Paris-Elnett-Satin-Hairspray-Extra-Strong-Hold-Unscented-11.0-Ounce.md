<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its ok, leave your hear sticky and after you brush it look like you have dandruff</li>
    <li> I have a fragrance allergy and am thrilled to have discovered this product!  It does have a mild smell when sprayed on, which I dislike.  But the smell goes away quickly and I do not catch a wiff of any fragrance while going about my day.  So there is a mild annoyance at first but is just fine after that.  It is a 4.5 stars rather than a 5 because it does have some fragrance in the first few minutes.  It held well and did just what I wanted.  Yay!  I have hairspray after 20 years without it!  If they would ditch the fragrance altogether, it would be amazing.</li>
    <li> Combs out easily. Very light. I love that its scent is subtle.</li>
    <li> Best price available and while I would prefer my mother not know I pay over $12 for a can of hairspray, it is worth it to me. It can be brushed out and leaves my thick, baby fine hair looking neat and holding its shape without creating &amp;#34;helmet head,&amp;#34; the bain of shorter styles on women who do not want their fine hair to make them look exactly as they did at 6, but also don&#x27;t favor the ​&amp;#34;politico-wife, circa 1980s&amp;#34; look, either.</li>
    <li> This spray has no hold power despite the name.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and follow the Curly Girl shampoo-less routine, but I need a little hold once my hair dries.  I had been using a lavender scented product, but I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance in products and hate to fill the restroom at work with a scent that others might not appreciate.  This hair spray is every bit as good as the more expensive product I had been using, but at a lower price and with no scent. Subscribe and save makes it even more attractive.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this hair spray.  The only one on the market these days that is not loaded with oils that weigh my fine hair down.  Great hold and I love the unscented formula.  You can respray all day and your hair does not get hard or sticky.  Amazon sells it for a much better price than in any store.  Love it more than any Salon hairspray.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair curly without getting remotely hard/crunchy</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever!  The hold is fantastic, not stiff or sticky. There is a slight scent, but not offensive. I am pretty sensitive to scents and it&#x27;s not a problem. The regular scented version is absolutely awful, so I would avoid that.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Worth the price and you end up using less because it works so well.</li>
    <li> I like how it&#x27;s not sticky at all.  I have long hair, with not much volume, and this product does not last all day, however, it lasts longer than other products I have tried (so far).</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have come across,you can run your fingers through your hair and not get stuck....:)</li>
    <li> light weight &amp; decent hold. I would recommend this for any flowy hairstyle (body wave type hair style) and not for anything like an updo that would require a great hold. You can still brush your hair after the use of this. Four stars because I thought that it would have better hold.</li>
    <li> Truly is the best on the market; light but tough, and brushes out. Expensive, but you&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. A bit pricey but worth it. Even if I get caught in a very unusual Phoenix rain, my naturally curly hair stays soft and *almost* frizz free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been hairspray-scared, maybe bc I grew up the 80&#x27;s.  But this is not Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s hairspray.  Soft and undetectable, with solid hold, I get why the pros rave about it.</li>
    <li> Although it says it is without perfume, it does have a fragrance, which my husband loves.  Holds hair but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hairspray I have ever worked with. Being a hair stylist I use many sprays and this one is perfect. Not heavy or sticky. If I need a little lift, I can tease the roots and spray a little and it holds without being sticky. Oh, some people don&#x27;t like the smell,  it&#x27;s fine for me. I also have the unscented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hairsprays over the years and normally gravitate towards products like Big Sexy Hair Spray &#x27;n Play harder when I need something to really hold my hair.  This sounds ridiculous, but I saw one of the O.C. Housewives using this (and her hair is gorgeous and not stiff at all) so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  WOW.  Not only does it hold my hair when I curl it, it&#x27;s also totally flexible so I don&#x27;t look like I have helmet head.  AND, it brushes out completely without leaving residue.  And the biggest reason I love this product is becuase I&#x27;m a brunette and it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair chalky or cause product buildup.  If I don&#x27;t like my hair after I&#x27;ve styled and sprayed it, I can brush through it and all of this product is GONE.  No dust, no buildup.  It&#x27;s like starting from new.  It also works great when I straighten my hair.  If you run into wintertime static like I do, a few shots of this will keep your straight hair under control.  And again, it does it without making your hair look sprayed.  I actually liked this product so much that I signed up for the \\&quot;Subscription\\&quot; option (auto ship).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will say is that you want to get the UNSCENTED version of this.  I accidentally bought the scented version and the smell was horrible... it&#x27;s way too strong and as I&#x27;ve seen in many other reviews, it has an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfumed scent to it.  The smell lasts all day, and if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents like I am, the scented version will give you a killer headache.  Definitely stick with the unscented version.  It still has a slight scent but no more than other hair sprays.</li>
    <li> I read about this hair spray in Good Housekeeping magazine.  I like it better than the more expensive salon sprays.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is the VERY BEST Hair Spray I have ever used and believe me over my lifetime I have used a lot of hair spray !!!!!!  The next day after you use it you can brush out your hair and do another style and your hair always fresh (just like you have been to the hair dressers).  I even purchased a can and leave it at my beauty shop for my hair dresser to use on my hair.  I use No Other Kind !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> WOW!  I am so impressed with this hairspray.  It is worth every penny.  It holds my hair in place but you can&#x27;t feel it at all.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has great hold without being stiff. I have naturally curly hair and can count on this spray to hold down the frizzies during humid/rainy weather. I suggest purchasing the scent free version since as you may have read before, the scent of the others is not a pleasant. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. Better than any others I have found as far as holding my very limp, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. Holds hair very well without a heavy residue. You can brush through hair after applying. This is the only hairspray I use. Works great on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I may be in the minority here but I don&#x27;t like this hairspray at all.  It&#x27;s too firm for a natural look and not firm enough to truly hold an updo.  It&#x27;s somewhere in the middle and therefore mediocre.  I can&#x27;t figure out what all the hype and good reviews are about.  This product was on clearance at Walgreens, where I purchased three cans for about $4 apiece.  I thought I was getting something great for almost nothing.  However, it turned out that it wasn&#x27;t even worth the $4 I spent.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with three full cans of the stuff.  I have since found better products.  For flexible hold, nothing beats Nexxus Comb Thru or Toni and Guy Casual, both of which provide touchable, brushable hold that&#x27;s invisible.  For stronger hold, TIGI Masterpiece is genius.  It holds all day without flaking and adds shine.  It&#x27;s perfect for updos.  I have no idea what I&#x27;ll do with the three cans of Elnet.  Maybe, years from now, I&#x27;ll decide on a different hairstyle and will need a so-so product then.  But until that time, they&#x27;re just gathering dust in my hall closet.  I truly wish I could have my $12 back.  Maybe I can give them to someone.  But then again, why would I want to give someone I like a product that sucks???  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this hairspray.  Save your cash and get one of the others I&#x27;ve mentioned.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve road tested nearly every hairspray on the market, high end and drugstore and the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned are the verified winners, hands down.  Save yourself some time and money, try them out yourself.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I have super long hair (past mid back) and have a hard time keeping my hair styled when curled, specially nice long loose waves.  The sheer weight of my hair renders most hairsprays worthless within minutes.  And I despise the helmet head feeling of products like Aqua Net.  Elnett is perfect, holds the shape while allowing natural movement.  Also if you make a mistake, simply brush it out. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this Elnett hairspray..  I have gone through so many hairsprays before I got to this one (last one was TreSemme)  &amp; then came to Elnett..  Its true that I can actually brush my hair before going to bed so that all the hairsprays out..  I dont wake up with a crunchy mess of hair this way..  The hold of the spray is great too, you don&#x27;t need alot.  The sprays a bit on the costly side but depending on where you get it it can save you some $$..  I also noticed that this hairsprays is supposed to be unscented but still has fragrance in it &amp; still has a strong enough smell to it..  I made the mistake of buying the spray for colored hair &amp; whoooooo that one reeks!  I&#x27;ll just keep it for emergency backups but smell so strong gives me a headache..  Make sure you order unscented if you dont want super strong stink in the spray!  Great spray otherwise..  A+</li>
    <li> My mother in law has used this forever&lt;br /&gt;And I have to say, now I know why&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;On my second bottle</li>
    <li> I have read in numerous articles about this being the favorite hairspray of stylists, and I love it. It is very light , not at all sticky. Natural looking, and keeps your hair in place. Large can goes a long way. I like the unscented, because ,who really wants to smell hairspray on your hair? I have been using this hairspray since it became available in the US, and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Looking for something like Sebastian Shaper Hairspray. This is nearly as good and less expensive than Shaper. Fragrance fades fast.</li>
    <li> Good hold, not great, but nothing is great in the Louisiana heat and humidity, not even Jesus would have perfect hair in this state.  No scent and manageability once you attempt to drown it (it survives, always).</li>
    <li> love it.  hold is great without being sticky.  smells good</li>
    <li> Must return. Causes scalp to itch.. even with only a little bit of product</li>
    <li> Great touchable, comb-though hairspray.  Still has a slight scent, but nothing like the original.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about, except when her sister took it home with her! Then I had to order another one, which must mean then that it is good. Good bless extended families.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey for hairspray - Yes. But has great hold, not sticky and does not lay heavy on the hair. Helps to maintain volume and good in humid conditions, too.</li>
    <li> Has a barely noticeable light scent which is great but leaves the hair crispy to touch.</li>
    <li> I paid fifteen dollars for this at RiteAid and really regret it. I read the can and thought for sure with the info about it and the price, that it would keep my hair where I wanted it to be. It did just the opposite, it worked as badly as the one dollar can from the dollar store. I have thin, long hair and wanted to keep it on one side of my head, and it couldn&#x27;t even do that.</li>
    <li> I am not a &#x27;hairspray&#x27; person, but now I have a cut that looks best if I use a little spray. I tried a few different brands and seriously disliked them, mostly because of the smell. In reading Amazon reviews I decided to try this, even though it said &#x27;extra hold.&#x27;  This spray has turned out to be better than I could ever have expected. There is NO scent, and don&#x27;t worry too much about the extra hold. Yes, it may be &#x27;extra&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t look that way (no helmet head) and it nicely brushes out leaving hair feeling like no product was used. Now I am subscribed to receive it. My only wish is that there were a smaller size for travel.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in great condition.  Great product.  Especially for hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this hair spray for a long time because it is always on &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; lists I read in magazines and beauty websites.  It did not disappoint. It is light and not at all sticky.  It keeps my hair in place.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love that this hairspray is light but holds well - it doesn&#x27;t look like I have hairspray on which is exactly what I&#x27;m going for.  The unscented version is the way to go as the scented one has a very strong, overwhelming odor.</li>
    <li> Like the hairspray except that it does have an odor to it and did attract the bugs..... Even though the can says unscented it has a very strong scent to it.</li>
    <li> It is a little stiff but I am able to brush and hold style when I want a more casual look. Ii only get the unsented because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the scented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hairspray kind of girl but I&#x27;m growing my bangs out and they can be a bit pesky. This hairspray does a great job of keeping them out of my way without it looking like my hair is lacquered into place.</li>
    <li> Still the best hairspray I have found!</li>
    <li> Excellent product it does what it says only thing...kind of hard to aim the spray head maybe the bottle is to big I think ...</li>
    <li> Found! The perfect hairspray! I had read that this hairspray was a favorite of many stylist. So I bought some a couple of years ago. Loved the spray, but hated the smell. So when I saw this unscented, I jumped on it. And I love it. I plan to stock up on them so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> There is an elusive version of this very product which i prefer that is &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; This is the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version so it has some fragrance but it quickly dissipates. Otherwise this hairspray works well on my fine hair and brushes out easily, does not give me a headache.</li>
    <li> Will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I learned through a major newspaper featuring an article on the stars&#x27; preparations for the Oscars, that this hairspray&lt;br /&gt;was frequently used to ensure hair stayed in place for the long evening ahead.  My hair experience has been the same,&lt;br /&gt;thanks to this fine product which, even better, is  lightweight  and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &amp;#34;cemented&amp;#34; down. I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product claims it is unscented, but it has a very strong smell and I think the claim is actually dishonest as parfum/fragrance is listed in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray. Holds without being sticky or crunchy. It is easy to brush through. I recommend the unscented because the original scent is very strong and displeasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how L&#x27;Oreal gets away with calling this spray unscented.  It is absolutely one of the cheapest, &#x27;stinkiest&#x27; smelling hairsprays I&#x27;ve ever used.  I sprayed in on this morning, and this afternoon I&#x27;m still wondering if everyone around me wonders if I got into my Aunt Rose&#x27;s Eau de TOILET perfume from the dimestore.  Truly, to my nose, it is unbearable, and I can&#x27;t wait to get into the shower and wash it out!  As to hold and performance, I think it&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be wearing it long enough to really speak to that.  The only actually unscented hairspray I&#x27;ve found is [[ASIN:B001KYS7O6 SALON GRAFIX HR SPR SUPER HOLD Size: 10 OZ [Health and Beauty]]]. Although I&#x27;m not crazy about the hold, I&#x27;ll be going back to that tomorrow, and keep searching for my holy grail hairspray!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great. It holds my curls all day long!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but does have a scent. It even says it has a scent in the ingredients, which is weird for an &amp;#34;unscented product.&amp;#34; However, it does not irritate my scalp or make me sneeze, so I will continue using. I had to switch to all unscented products when I got pregnant. My kind of sensitive skin got wicked sensitive all of a sudden. My normal hairspray made my scalp itch like crazy. I am happy with product, but buyers who truly need an unscented product should beware that this does have a scent.</li>
    <li> I have this product shipped to me monthly. I am very particular with hair products and this is the best hair spray I have found. It holds your style without feeling stiff or sticky. I live in a very humid state and my hair gets frizzy with the slightest bit of humidity. This product holds my style all day and but is brushable if you want to restyle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The wife uses it and loves it. Happy wife; happy life.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hairspray.  It provides plenty of hold without being sticky or stiff.  I can spray it, then run my fingers through my hair, and my style will stay, but my hair can still move.  The &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; does have a bit of a scent while you are spraying, which isn&#x27;t exactly the best smell, but once it&#x27;s in my hair, I don&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
    <li> I have to use unscented due to allergies…it&#x27;s difficult to find a strong enough hold in unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray was thick and made my hair feel and act like I had sprayed glue.  Was disappointed and will keep looking as in the past I have found better alternatives.  Though the L&#x27;Oreal name would mean high quality.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and live in the humid south. My hair has become a bit wavy as I age, just enough to look frizzy, and when the air is dry, as in winter, to fly away. This hairspray locks in the style and texture, but my hair moves, shines naturally, and is not weighed down. It also lasts, but you don&#x27;t get that ripping sound you get when you comb through hair sprayed with other hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unscented is extra nice, since the fougere scent of the original clashed with some fragrances.</li>
    <li> A good product that adds shine &amp; control but does not get stiff.  I use this for styling and defining my thick, curly hair, before hitting it with a different product to lock it in.  You can also comb through this without it causing flakes.</li>
    <li> My fave hairspray!!!!</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever.  I have very fine hair, and I need hairspray as a part of my beauty routine to create volume.  Most strong hairsprays are very sticky and stiff, and end up ruining my hair.  This hairspray has good hold, but is flexible and doesn&#x27;t break down in humidity.  I use it every day and I love it.</li>
    <li> Good for important occasions when I had to do my own hair.</li>
    <li> I prefer unscented hairspray.  This is perfect for for me as perfume smells bother me.  Also the product is good.  It keeps my hair in place without any of the stiffness other hairsprays give.</li>
    <li> Light, not sticky, Holds my hair well and naturally, provides great volume.  Nice scent.  Worth the extra cost. I won&#x27;t use any other brand now.</li>
    <li> I should have believed the review that said this hairspray had a bad smell.  I am very sensitive to many scents, so that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this hairspray.  Big mistake.  Within 5 minutes I had a headache and had to go wash my hair to get rid of the scent from this product.  I like many L&#x27;Oreal products but would never use this again.  (I do appreciate Amazon&#x27;s great customer service when I called to complain.  They were very helpful.)</li>
    <li> Excellent hair spray!  The lightest, finest spray I&#x27;ve ever used, and the hold is great.  Highly recommend, especially for people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff looking.  And at the same time, it has a nice firm hold that lasts. I have tried so many hairsprays that I was beginning to think what I wanted was impossible to find.  I am so happy to have found this product.  And best of all, it is unscented!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, and without that heavy, perfumey smell that makes you cough and gag.  Also cheaper than the local drugstore ($14.99 there) so if this is the hair spray you use, this is definitely the place to save a few bucks. And having it delivered to your door makes it an even better deal.</li>
    <li> Works well for holding power, but even the unscented version has an odd odor.</li>
    <li> I had bought the original scented version which smelled like an old lady. The hold was decent but I couldnt get past the scent. When I saw this in a unscented version I decided to try it out again. Needless to say it still has a scent. It has a strange smell. I wont buy this again for the 3rd time.</li>
    <li> Great product you can&#x27;t find in regular drug stores.</li>
    <li> Worth the cult reputation?  You bet!  I prefer the unscented, but when I wore the scented spray everyone else loved it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair that never likes to hold any style. I use this hairspray when I curl or wave my hair, and it does a very good job of holding the curls/waves. However, the scent is pretty weird. If you can stand a funny smell for a little while, then it&#x27;s not a problem because the smell wears away from your hair after maybe a minute.</li>
    <li> Great product always wanted to try it glad I did it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Holds well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Not crazy about the smell though but it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had some difficulty with hair sprays actually keeping my hair style exactly where I want it. Not so with L&#x27;Oreal Elnett Extra Strong Hold. I have been buying this over and over. Actually, I can&#x27;t foresee me ever wanting to buy a different hair spray! The does not weigh my hair down or make it sticky - at all!&lt;br /&gt;The scented ones have a strange smell (to me) but most people tell me they don&#x27;t smell it at all. So I prefer the unscented formula. It holds perfectly, easy to brush through without losing curl and leaves shine. Also works well to spray at the base of your hair before teasing, or on hair before putting in Velcro rollers, etc. This is better than Big Sexy Hair which is more expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d describe it as &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;light hold&amp;#34;. It is unscented when it dries. It&#x27;s better in holding my fine hair off my face than nothing, and I don&#x27;t want to have a &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; either. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I need a strong hold hairspray. This definitely holds the style all day, however, the claim that it is &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; is not true.  Admittedly, I am sensitive to perfumes and strong odors, but this has a smell that lasts forever.  It leaves a dullness to my hair, but I still use it at times when I need a strong hold.</li>
    <li> I should start off by saying I&#x27;m a dude, not a chick, and my hair style is kind of long, hockey player hair, which I keep messy during the weekend, but slick back Gordon Gekko style during the work week.  I Bought this product for the first time at a drug store, not at Amazon (just by chance), and I love it.  I made the move from a $4 hairspray that I didn&#x27;t mind too much at all (Tresemme), but wanted to see what I would get by spending some more money on hairspray.  Did some research and came to the conclusion that the best one to try first was this stuff--and I was not disappointed!  I bought the unscented version, because of all the reviews claiming the scented extra strong version of Elnett smelled terrible.  It isn&#x27;t completely unscented, it actually has a very pleasant, light, subtle smell to it that I really like.  Compared to my old, cheap hairspray, this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy funny looking residue--it makes my hair look more natural and holds down stray pieces much better.  The most notable thing about this stuff, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s made of or the diffuser, or both, but it sprays on very nicely and evenly.  It is also kind of pliable, so you can actually spray on a layer, let it dry for a minute, and re-work your hair a bit, then finish it off with another spray layer (as opposed to other hairsprays that harden your hair, such that once you spray on a layer, you will essentially be cracking and messing up your hair style).  Until I find better, this semi-pricy stuff is where it&#x27;s at, and totally worth the extra $10!</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  It is very light and not sticky at all. Holds when you need it</li>
    <li> The best.  Natural hold, doesn&#x27;t look like hairspray.  Can be brushed.  Love the continuous spray.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance free option.  It does a good job of holding without stiffness.  It is the best hair spray I have ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about Elnett and have wanted to try it for years. I have very thick hair that is naturally wavy, but I straighten it. I normally use Matrix or Treseme. Elnett definitely has a finer mist and does not make your hair &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;. My hair was still soft after using it and the hairspray brushes out, just like it says it does. I haven&#x27;t tested it to see how it holds up in humidity yet. Regarding the smell - a lot of reviewers have complained that the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version still smells bad. It does have a slight scent, but it&#x27;s just your typical hairspray smell (the old school Aquanet was way worse!). I didn&#x27;t find it to be that bad, or at least not as bad as the other reviews lead me to believe. So unless you are just ultra sensitive to odors, you should be fine with the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version of Elnett.</li>
    <li> I need hairspray which is strong yet easy to comb through when I need to.  I also need something that will hold fine hair and that will bounce back in various situations so I don&#x27;t have to keep spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unscented version of the hairspray is definitely unscented.  It has a little bit of a chemical smell at first, but it is light and fades quickly.  It will hold my hair decently but it does not encourage curl or wave as well as a few others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For volume and flexible hold it is fabulous, however.  It has held my hair and that of people I know in the most extreme winds and humidity.  It is amazing how my hair looks completely different when I use Unscented Elnett on my hair- full and nice instead of flat.</li>
    <li> And not the best hairspray ever.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this stuff, which is supposed to be unscented.  There is definitely some sort of fragrance added to this.</li>
    <li> The best hairspray ever!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as most hairsprays.  There is still a smell but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful -- where has it been all my life? It is an excellent combination of hold and brushability. (It did not make my hair feel stiff or like cotton candy ;) I did not notice any scent (and it is listed as unscented) -- will purchase again.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  This is literally the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  I KNOW it&#x27;s aerosol and that&#x27;s bad, so I try not to use it excessively and I get the unscented one to minimize the hormone-disrupting chemicals that come with fragrance.  But, this stuff is so good, it&#x27;s like the one thing where I look the other way about the aerosol and chemicals.  Also, I use it in a well-ventilated area and never around my 2-year-old...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s great and unbeatable about this hairspray:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s a very fine mist that doesn&#x27;t show on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) It really and truly holds hair in place.  Which is major for someone with a specific bang style and a big forehead who doesn&#x27;t want everyone seeing her 6-head.&lt;br /&gt;3) Once it&#x27;s dry it brushes out so easily for re-styling.&lt;br /&gt;4) A little goes a long way and one bottle will last a really, really, really long time.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray!  Does not leave white residue and will hold your styles very nicely.</li>
    <li> This hair spray has everything I want - unscented and&lt;br /&gt;extra hold.  My husband has sneaked across the bath-&lt;br /&gt;room and borrowed it.</li>
    <li> I love the lighter hold variety of Elnett, but the smell is just too terrible. I saw in reviews that the Extra Strong Hold Unscented wasn&#x27;t really unscented, but I gave it a try anyway. It&#x27;s true that it most certainly does have a scent, but the scent is much more tolerable.  It&#x27;s more like a normal hairspray smell, which I can deal with.  So while I prefer the light hold of the lighter Elnett, I will continue to use this one. Though it&#x27;s not as light as the light hold, it still sprays in a very fine mist, making it easier to control than most other hairsprays.</li>
    <li> Love that it has no scent. Good hold.</li>
    <li> Good hairspray would love to find a cheaper alternative with a bit more hold.</li>
    <li> The best hairspray ever.  I like the unscented because the scented always smelled a bit strong.  Can&#x27;t believe this used to be so hard to find many years ago.</li>
    <li> Holds well with a scent that dissipate quickly. My favorite hairspray so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every day</li>
    <li> Great, but the nozzle was broken.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray, as described.</li>
    <li> Excelente quality as always L´Oreal. Really nice smell and doesnt leave any reside.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveda&#x27;s &amp;#34;Air Control&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Control Force&amp;#34; hairsprays for the past 2 years, but find the first to only really be good for flyaways, and the second to be too sticky. They&#x27;re also very expensive! Multiple fashion magazines rated l&#x27;Oreal Elnett hairspray #1 for flexible hold in 2012, and since it&#x27;s so reasonably priced, I decided to try it. After reading the reviews on the strange scent of the original version of this hairspray, I decided to pay a couple extra dollars for the unscented. It still has a smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;scent,&amp;#34; and it wears off quickly. I have SUPER fine hair, and this hairspray has been amazing so far at taming flyaways all day, as well as helping hold styles firmly in place. It also disappears when you brush it out, so you can start over if you change your mind about your hairstyle, without your hair being soaked in sticky product by the time you&#x27;re done. I love this hairspray, and I&#x27;m going to recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I have very straight, very fine hair, and all of my life it&#x27;s been a nightmare to style it. Nothing worked, not hairsprays and not perms. All of this changed with my first use of Elnett Extra Hold. This treatment does HOLD, and no mistake. You can decide how your hair looks, how it swings or falls. And your style choice will last, easily, into the next day. Elnett&lt;br /&gt;also has a very natural look. The hair stays soft and has a subtle gleam, not the weird plasticky shine some sprays have. As for the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; claim, there is a slight flowery&lt;br /&gt;scent when you first use it, but the smell quickly fades. All in all, Elnett is as close to perfection as you will find in a hairspray.</li>
    <li> Still has a smell even though it&#x27;s unscented.  Works pretty much the same though.  Great hairspray that won&#x27;t weigh down hair.  Does not disappear like it says... but will not make your hair hard or change the texture that much.</li>
