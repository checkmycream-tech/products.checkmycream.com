      <li>It also has a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural feeling lubricant and although this is the best I have found (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING I could find)</li>
      <li>This is a liquid and a better dispensing method would make the product a five star product.</li>
      <li>We had stuck with Astroglide because we hadn&#x27;t found anything else better than that however..</li>

      <li>fine.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy ... we did.</li>
      <li>He sells cheap products that is close to expiration.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it felt very natural and was not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>But not bad.</li>
      <li>I first tried a bit and thought it was fine.</li>
      <li>so this helps tremendously.  </li>
      <li>This lubricates without burning, and feels soft to the touch on my sexual parts.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that was all natural, would not cause any discomfort, and was still safe with condoms.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but well worth it.</li>
      <li>Although we&#x27;ve not yet opened or used this particular order, I can say that it&#x27;s a high quality product we&#x27;ve used for many years</li>
      <li>It works great, is not sticky or messy!</li>
      <li>After our previous favorite was no longer available we tried a lot of products, read a lot of reviews, and settled on Sylk as our new favorite.</li>
      <li>It was very light yet didn&#x27;t dry out as quickly as Astroglide.</li>
      <li>First, the lube expires about 6 months from the receiving date.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by a top female gynecologist, Dr. Christine Northrup, who mentions it in her book and uses it herself.</li>
      <li>intense burning!</li>
      <li>Sylk Lubricant is better than any personal lubricant I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Nothing wrong with it at all perfect thickness.</li>
      <li>but I still managed to use this one up first.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>and we MUCH preferred the  feel of the Astroglide X.</li>
      <li>It is very liquidy and comes out of the tube too fast.</li>
      <li>It was shipped in a very timely fashion, and is a pleasuse to use.  </li>
      <li>thanks again</li>
      <li>This is an absolute garbage product.</li>
      <li>You pour some on your hands and it goes straight through your fingers.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have tried numerous different lubricants, because I am very sensitive and allergic to several different lubes, but this one works great and it worth the money!</li>
      <li>Careful, as squeezing the bottle easily gives you way too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to spice up their life.</li>
      <li>it dispenses from a flip top, but beware it is SUPER THIN and will run all over the place if you are not careful.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive skin like me, I recommend you try this product.</li>
      <li>I have always had sensitive skin and this lubricant didn&#x27;t cause any irritations.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not messy or sticky, and it does not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Its more expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it because it seemed to dry out too quickly and always left a sticky residue</li>
      <li>Overall though, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I never have before when eating them, but apparently when applied, and possibly old?</li>
      <li>Sylk lasts a decent while and doesn&#x27;t dry up and get tacky.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because after extended frequent use I did finally get a bit of a skin reaction.</li>
      <li>It can be a bit messy, but definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Sylk Natural Personal Lubricant did the job and so far the last several years I keep buying it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s messy, it comes out of the tube very fast (as mentioned by others</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Astroglide and some of the synthetic lubes, but I haven&#x27;t found a natural one that does.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After going through chemo, I needed to start using a lubricant.  I needed a water-based lube, and I didn&#x27;t want any nasty chemicals.  This fit the bill perfectly and it feels great.  It does not get sticky and stays moist for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Other lubricants have caused irritation, so I shopped around for a natural product. This one never irritates my skin and feels great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, It works, It leaves no residue. We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lube and this is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever. Still find that Trojan is the best but I still managed to use this one up first. Nothing wrong with it at all perfect thickness. Just dries out a little sooner than some brands.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY personal lubricant that does NOT irritate my vaginal tissue!!  Love it!  It works great, is not sticky or messy!</li>
    <li> We love it. We can tell the difference with the other brand that we have used for a long time. The feeling is more enjoyable. But the container is somewhat inconvenience, especially if the room is not well lit it may cause some problem.</li>
    <li> After our previous favorite was no longer available we tried a lot of products, read a lot of reviews, and settled on Sylk as our new favorite. I like what it has and doesn&#x27;t have as ingredients. We like the texture and it lasts well. It is not too thin and runny, it doesn&#x27;t become sticky or need to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> I like this product for its intended purpose. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with lubes stinging me or irritating my skin. I&#x27;m happy to say that this product does neither, so if you have sensitive skin like me, I recommend you try this product. Its more expensive but worth it. It also has a nice consistency. It cleans up easily and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It is very liquidy and comes out of the tube too fast. Messy, messy. The consistency makes it unmanageable.</li>
    <li> This is a good product!  It&#x27;s not messy or sticky, and it does not irritate the skin. My boyfriend likes it too.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  easy on the body. I gave it 4 stars because after extended frequent use I did finally get a bit of a skin reaction. But otherwise texture is great - works longer and doesn&#x27;t get as sticky.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. This product is not greasy. I highly recommend this product to spice up their life.</li>
    <li> I first tried a bit and thought it was fine. Weeks later, I used it again and whoa! intense burning! Super painful. I researched online and discovered there ARE people who have that reaction to kiwi fruit. I never have before when eating them, but apparently when applied, and possibly old? (It had turned brown in the tube by then) my vagina screamed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I&#x27;d only done a test daub, that only took 3 hours for the pain to fade.</li>
    <li> First, the lube expires about 6 months from the receiving date.  This is a dishonest seller.  He sells cheap products that is close to expiration.  Second, the lube is too watery.  It caused a mess every time when I try to use it.  You pour some on your hands and it goes straight through your fingers.  Third, the lube lose its slippery properties in about 5 minutes of intercourse.  This is an absolute garbage product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural feeling lubricant and although this is the best I have found (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING I could find) it&#x27;s still not completely natural feeling. Still has ta little of hat &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; silicone feel. But not bad. And it doesn&#x27;t tend to get sticky like some of the others.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have tried numerous different lubricants, because I am very sensitive and allergic to several different lubes, but this one works great and it worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was all natural, would not cause any discomfort, and was still safe with condoms. I am glad that I bought Sylk because it serves its purpose well and I love how it isn&#x27;t smelly. It can be a bit messy, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Although we&#x27;ve not yet opened or used this particular order, I can say that it&#x27;s a high quality product we&#x27;ve used for many years and I&#x27;m hoping it hasn&#x27;t changed!</li>
    <li> Solves a lot of problems.  We are getting a little older so this helps tremendously.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Like the previous reviewer said, it left no residue and wasn&#x27;t sticky. I&#x27;ve tried a silk one by KY and felt too oily. We then switched to Astroglide upon recommendation from my doc. We had stuck with Astroglide because we hadn&#x27;t found anything else better than that however..I didn&#x27;t like it because it seemed to dry out too quickly and always left a sticky residue so I always had to rinse it off. I was skeptical about Sylk based on mixed reviews from other sources. I decided to give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. It was very light yet didn&#x27;t dry out as quickly as Astroglide. I liked the fact that it felt very natural and was not sticky at all. My partner also like it quite a bit. Although it is on the pricey side, I think I would stick to Sylk in the future (just buy a double instead of a single pack). My only gripe is the way it is bottled. I wish the bottle opening was facing upward rather than downward because it has spilled on me a couple times. Overall though, I would highly recommend this product. I have always had sensitive skin and this lubricant didn&#x27;t cause any irritations.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good and lubs fine.  I like that it dispenses from a flip top, but beware it is SUPER THIN and will run all over the place if you are not careful.  I like others better, but because of the flip top I like this one just fine.</li>
    <li> Sylk Lubricant is better than any personal lubricant I have ever used. I have tried several. This lubricates without burning, and feels soft to the touch on my sexual parts. I had a hysterectomy several years ago and dryness brought our sex life to a stop. KY jelly and others did not keep me lubricated so I kept searching for one that stayed moist and good for the both of us. Sylk Natural Personal Lubricant did the job and so far the last several years I keep buying it. I would personally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best product for post-menopausal women.  All natural ingredients.  Recommended by a top female gynecologist, Dr. Christine Northrup, who mentions it in her book and uses it herself.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were looking for paraben- and pthalate-free lubricant. Sylk lasts a decent while and doesn&#x27;t dry up and get tacky. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Astroglide and some of the synthetic lubes, but I haven&#x27;t found a natural one that does. It&#x27;s just a trade off that you make, I think. Sylk doesn&#x27;t require constant reapplication like others, so it&#x27;s our product of choice.</li>
    <li> My wife and I tried this based on the reviews here, but for us, it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s messy, it comes out of the tube very fast (as mentioned by others here)&lt;br /&gt;- it feels thin and too &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- despite being &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;, it gets dry too quickly, you constantly need to reapply or wet it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did a side by side test with Astroglide X and we MUCH preferred the  feel of the Astroglide X. It is silicone based though, so make sure you have no allergies to silicone. The Astroglide lasted forever, it stays slick even to the next morning, no kidding.</li>
    <li> This is post cancer, dry to the bone, answer to a prayer! My Dr. told me about it and I&#x27;m very happy she did. If dryness is your problem than this is the answer. It is pricey but well worth it. Get the double pack to save.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described.  It was shipped in a very timely fashion, and is a pleasuse to use.  thanks again</li>
    <li> This is a liquid and a better dispensing method would make the product a five star product. The product is very good for the desired intent.</li>
    <li> Did the trick very nicely and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality product.  Enjoy ... we did.</li>
    <li> If you are in menopause this is the best lubricant I have found to relieve the dryness.</li>
    <li> No irritation. Doesn&#x27;t cause infections like some others.&lt;br /&gt;Only a drop is enough. Careful, as squeezing the bottle easily gives you way too much.</li>
