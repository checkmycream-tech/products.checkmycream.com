      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite hair styling product.</li>
      <li>definitely felt like it helped with my dry split ends... AND smelled fantastic!!!!</li>
      <li>so I am very mindful of the ends; this product keeps them sealed and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Totally makes my hair manageable and nice when I style it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the packing is about the same, but is in plastic instead of glass.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it weekly and my hair seems really healthy</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I really love the scent not heavy</li>
      <li>Influenster sent this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>After rinsing, you will think the product is still on your hair, not in a greasy way, instead, it feels super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>product seems effective at deeply conditioning your hair more than just a regular conditioner.</li>

      <li>It nourishes and moisturizes hair leaving it feeling soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>When I used this mask for the first time, I immediately felt the change in my hair as I was rinsing it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a deep mask for my hair, so glad to know about this product.</li>
      <li>It always leaves my hair much softer and shinier!</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with this entire Fekkai Salon Tech line .</li>
      <li>I liked the pink packaging.</li>
      <li>Ive tried  pretty much every salon mask there is out there</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I received this thanks to influenster</li>
      <li>and this really hydrates well.</li>
      <li>makes my hair very manageable and shiny</li>
      <li>Technician Color Care really does preserve my hair color.</li>
      <li>The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit!</li>
      <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s been long enough to really</li>
      <li>and it still feels as soft and silky as it did when I first washed it, which my hair would start to feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; around this time.</li>
      <li>I received this a sample from the Influenster to test and I will be buying it for my new conditioner!</li>
      <li>I have been coloring my hair for 10 years, and I am always up for trying new color care products!</li>
      <li>Out of the entire line I received of the color care, I will MOST definitely be re-purchasing this mask.</li>
      <li>I liked the thick, whipped like formula of this product.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair super soft, especially if you can have a spa day and leave it on for 30-60 minutes.</li>
      <li>This product did take care of that - and better than my usual Aussie 3-minute-miracle.</li>
      <li>and my hair is lush and shiny !</li>
      <li>It does leave hair very soft with little volume but it helps restore it, it is worth it for the first day flatness.</li>
      <li>and I also use heat tools on it pretty consistently which makes my hair, especially my ends feel very dry and lacking in moisture.</li>
      <li>Each time I use it, i am thankful for the recommendation as it makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My hair is always soft and moisturized after I use it.</li>
      <li>It leaves my relaxed color treated hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft but not oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going on three day old hair</li>
      <li>Keeps color true and long lasting.</li>
      <li>The formula works even better but isn&#x27;t nearly as thick.</li>
      <li>I tried this conditioner based on a recommendation for my hair (very curly and dry).</li>

    <li> this product went on smoothly and absorbed in my hair quickly!!  I got a free sample from Influenster and I love the smell and texture that it made my wavy, color treated hair feel after use.  I have used it weekly since receiving and I definately see improvement in the quality of my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this it is a excellent conditioning masque.It makes my hair soft but not oily or greasy. I received this a sample from the Influenster to test and I will be buying it for my new conditioner! It is very reasonably priced and smells wonderful too</li>
    <li> Got this product as a sample to test for Influenster. I enjoyed it, in terms of making my hair feel smooth, soft, and looking healthy. I dye my hair about once a month, so it can get dull. This product did take care of that - and better than my usual Aussie 3-minute-miracle. However, I&#x27;d have loved a better smell. This was pretty neutral - it was so nice and pink, I would&#x27;ve loved to come out smelling sweet like I came out of a salon.</li>
    <li> I love all Federic Fekkai products.This mask is simply amazing.It leaves my relaxed color treated hair feeling moisturized and soft.Technician Color Care really does preserve my hair color.This mask is a definite winner.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase it from this seller! I bought this product in March, but started to use it in April, it smelt  very strong and caused my skin allergy, as soon I found out it was expired on April 1,2015, I send an email to the seller, there was no response at all. It broke my Amazon record that I had never had bad experiences with Amazon sellers before! I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked the pink packaging. I liked the thick, whipped like formula of this product. It has the same scent as the shampoo and conditioner but I was hoping it was different since it was the masque. It left my thick, curly hair very soft and silky. This is probably the only product out of the 3 (shampoo, conditioner, mask) that I would consider purchasing. Influenster sent this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This gives my fine hair a lot of body and bounce.  Best is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue or weigh my hair down.  I like the aroma as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using for over 3 years and when ever I need a good conditioning I use it. It does leave hair very soft with little volume but it helps restore it, it is worth it for the first day flatness.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. Great smell, keeps my long hair in great shape</li>
    <li> Keeps color true and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Hard to find!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel like I just left the salon.  I use it sometimes up to 3 times per week - and my hair is never weighed down or heavy from it.  Great value buying it on Amazon.com versus in-store!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner. My hair is always soft and moisturized after I use it. I</li>
    <li> Very little goes a long way with this product.  My hair is a fairly thick shoulder-length bob--I use a dime size amount and work it from the ends up as a conditioner after I shampoo and a quarter size amount as a masque for five minutes every two-three weeks. I color and highlight my hair so I am very mindful of the ends; this product keeps them sealed and smooth.  Be sure to rinse it very thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Best product ever...makes your hair feel so healthy !</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner</li>
    <li> I am a model and have been using this product so long, that I can&#x27;t remember the start date.  It is the best product I have ever used to keep my hair &#x27;in show room condition&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Lori</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it weekly and my hair seems really healthy but I honestly can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s been long enough to really, really know how great it is. But I&#x27;m very happy so far and the color has been lasting. I recommend it for sure. I&#x27;ll update later when I&#x27;ve used it for longer.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner based on a recommendation for my hair (very curly and dry). Each time I use it, i am thankful for the recommendation as it makes my hair so soft and manageable. The conditioner works well with any shampoo and makes my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I love all of FeKKai products..all of them.</li>
    <li> Its great, leaves your hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;smells nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Fekkai fan. This makes my hair super soft, especially if you can have a spa day and leave it on for 30-60 minutes. Your hair will be super silky. I color my hair. I have Asian hair that is thick and course and this really hydrates well.</li>
    <li> Great smoothing conditioner for color treated hair.  It always leaves my hair much softer and shinier!</li>
    <li> Have used Fekkai Technician Color product line for many years, great stuff!</li>
    <li> I received the Fekkai Salon Tech Mask to try from Influenster. With color-treated hair, it tends to dry out, especially with heat styling. I used this mask twice in two weeks, and have been very happy with the results. My hair has stayed soft and silky for days following the mask, even after repeated washing. Color me impressed!</li>
    <li> I received this mask recently as a complimentary package from Influenster and out of the entire line, this mask is my favorite. I have color treated hair and I also use heat tools on it pretty consistently which makes my hair, especially my ends feel very dry and lacking in moisture.

I&#x27;m going on three day old hair and it still feels as soft and silky as it did when I first washed it, which my hair would start to feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; around this time. Out of the entire line I received of the color care, I will MOST definitely be re-purchasing this mask.</li>
    <li> I received this thanks to influenster and I fell in love with this entire Fekkai Salon Tech line . This hair masque does the job it not too thick and a little goes a long way. I used many hair treatments on myself and my clients being I&#x27;m a hairstylist . I really love the scent not heavy and my hair is lush and shiny ! That&#x27;s what we all want and this product delivers ! Try it !</li>
    <li> definitely felt like it helped with my dry split ends... AND smelled fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> Ive tried  pretty much every salon mask there is out there and I swear by Fekkai&#x27;s tech mask- it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Loved this product that I used complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes.  Smell is great, texture of product smooth... enjoyed this product a lot.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this all the time, and it seems to be harder to find in stores. A must for anyone who colors red.</li>
    <li> Totally makes my hair manageable and nice when I style it. I just use this instead of conditioner and works wonders.</li>
    <li> Greatest conditioner!</li>
    <li> I received this product free for testing from Fekkai and Influenster and it does seem to make a difference. I love the smell of it which is a plus, but it has softened my hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the color treatments I&#x27;ve done.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT~BEST HAIR TREATMENT OUT THERE!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel thicker!</li>
    <li> I received the Fekkai Prx Reparatives Mask instead of this one and decided to try it. Is it excellent. Left my hair soft and hydrated I would recommend but be ware is not the color repair mask as it shows in the pic.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for 10 years, and I am always up for trying new color care products! The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit! I love a good smelling product to wake me up in the morning, and citrus is one of my all time favorite scents, its so refreshing! The Luxe Color Masque is very thick and luxurious, it makes your hair feel like silk! After rinsing, you will think the product is still on your hair, not in a greasy way, instead, it feels super soft and smooth. This mask doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind, only nourished hair! How easy is it to leave it on while shaving or washing your face, rinse and you&#x27;re saying goodbye to color-damaged hair!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is delicate and light but works so well. My hair feels so soft and healthy. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It nourishes and moisturizes hair leaving it feeling soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the packing is about the same, but is in plastic instead of glass. The formula works even better but isn&#x27;t nearly as thick. I have this on auto-order and continue to use it with other conditioners.</li>
    <li> Love most of their products.</li>
    <li> Purchased Felicia mask before and it worked well for me. I have color treated hair so I want to maintain it between appointments</li>
    <li> The mask is really good, leave my hair soft</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for fine colored hair</li>
    <li> I never know for sure when I buy a hair product if its outdated or altered. I will say that what I received in the mail felt gummy and left my hair sticky. Buyer beware when buying these products online. Who knows maybe I received a bad/old one???</li>
    <li> After washing my hair, I applied this wonderfully scented color care mask and wrapped my hair in a warm towel per the directions on this page. I didn&#x27;t see directions on the product, or in the box it came in. The mask has a thickish, oily texture which feels like it will soak into your hair strands well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the mask on for 10 minutes as recommended. After rinsing the mask out of my hair, my hair is smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems effective at deeply conditioning your hair more than just a regular conditioner. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a deep mask for my hair, so glad to know about this product.</li>
    <li> makes my hair very manageable and shiny</li>
    <li> Call me crazy but I slick my color treated hair back in a pony tail 90% of the time. I&#x27;ve been using this masque for a week now just to slick back strays and on the dry ends without rinising and love the grapeseed oil smoothness of it. It&#x27;s my new favorite hair styling product.</li>
    <li> Try to use this weekly...seems to be hydrating...</li>
