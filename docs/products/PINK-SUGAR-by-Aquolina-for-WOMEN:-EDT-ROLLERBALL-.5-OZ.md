      <li>It is light and sweet smelling and guys totally love the smell.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!! :)</li>
      <li>the rollerball was great because I didnt have to carry around the big bottle!</li>
      <li>Pink sugar really did a great job on this one, I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
      <li>If you like sweet scents but don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap drugstore sprays then this is for you.</li>
      <li>And  for the price it is definatley worth trying it for yourself!</li>
      <li>At the time of purchase, I found it at a really good price ($17), standard price is ($19-20).</li>
      <li>My Pink Sugar rollerball perfume just arrived and I love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>yes it&#x27;s sweet, and yes, it smells like cotton candy.  </li>
      <li>Sweet smelling:</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not too sweet in an obnoxious way.</li>
      <li>If you do not like sweet smells then skip this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>The scent in most other products in this line is simply the best</li>
      <li>It works great for travelling as well-and no, it doesn&#x27;t get sticky at all even though it is perfectly thick enough to stay on for a long time, yet it works out just perfect.  </li>
      <li>The package arrived quickly and securely and product was exactly as described appearing new.  </li>
      <li>The perfume was fresh and tastier smelling then my first spray bottle I bought.  </li>
      <li>the one large piece of glass punctured the inside of my hand.</li>
      <li>But, after wearing it, I can attest that this is the real deal, 100%.</li>
      <li>The package arrived really  fast</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume is the Augolina pink sugar.  </li>
      <li>If you like pink sugar by Aquolina, you will love the roller.</li>
      <li>I would say that my favorite \\&quot;safe\\&quot; perfume is Pink Sugar by Aquolina.  </li>
      <li>I love ALL the products in the, \\&quot;PINK SUGAR\\&quot; line and have been purchasing them for years.</li>
      <li>I love all things Pink Sugar.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Pink Sugar perfume-</li>
      <li>I really like the smell</li>
      <li>I love having this little rollerball in my purse instead of having to carry the bottle around.</li>
      <li>the packaging looked a little, cheap?!</li>
      <li>I can put some on it&#x27;s own or roll a little on under a different scent to sweeten it up a bit.  </li>
      <li>If I only knew how or where to send correspondence to this company, I would appreciate being able to send them the sharpest piece that broke off  that I still am retaining to convince them to make this product out of plastic so that nobody has to go through what I did on that day and FYI, of all things to be wearing on that day, I was wearing white pants (which as you women are aware, this can take on all sorts of other humiliating connotations).</li>
      <li>I have never been one to wear such a \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smellng fragrance, it really smells like cotton candy, but I could not resist!</li>
      <li>But not in a cheap, little girls perfume way.</li>
      <li>Not childish smelling.</li>
      <li>I got this for my 24 year old daughter as she asked for it for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Smells like what a 20 year old would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like sweet fluffy clouds made of candy and soft, bouncy puppy fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When you first put Pink Sugar on it smells just like cotton candy!</li>
      <li>With regard to the broken glass, the only large piece of glass that remained was this very sharp point coming from the very top of the bottle where the cap screws onto the bottle.</li>
      <li>It goes without saying that I would in no way endorse this product I most definitely consider to be a serious safety hazard and warn anyone from ever purchasing this product unless it  is replaced and manufactured in a plastic container vs the existing glass.</li>
      <li>I love the body lotion and had never tried this particular small roll on, but I did have an opportunity to smell it once it arrived and found it did not smell quite the same as other products in this line, but never had the opportunity to use it because the truth of the matter is, the very first time I placed it in that small zipper compartment type pocket</li>
      <li>(not long)  </li>
      <li>Even with the rollerball it could be over-applied; it seems this will last me a long time, even wearing it nearly every day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love all things Pink Sugar. This rollerball is great for my purse. Honestly, when I received it I wasn&#x27;t sure it was really Aquolina. I don&#x27;t know why...the packaging looked a little, cheap?! But, after wearing it, I can attest that this is the real deal, 100%. I love this fragrance. I get compliments everywhere I go. It smells like cotton candy. But not in a cheap, little girls perfume way. It&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!  My favorite perfume is the Augolina pink sugar.  Now I can just throw this in my purse and have it with me when ever I want!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 24 year old daughter as she asked for it for Christmas.  She is very happy with it.  It smells like cotton candy which is a nice fragrance for her.</li>
    <li> My niece loves this fragrance.  My sister often gets headaches from fragrances but has not had an issue when my niece wears this one.</li>
    <li> I love the roller.  I keep it in my purse.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  If you like pink sugar by Aquolina, you will love the roller.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly and securely and product was exactly as described appearing new.  The perfume was fresh and tastier smelling then my first spray bottle I bought.  The price makes it even more painless.  I would say that my favorite \\&quot;safe\\&quot; perfume is Pink Sugar by Aquolina.  It smells wonderful, lasts a long time without killing your coworkers.  My daughter loves it.  I bought my bf Blue Sugar which he loves and I love on him (not me)   If you do not like sweet smells then skip this.  It seems that most people like it though.   Might I repeat that at this price, this is a must buy</li>
    <li> Pink sugar is such a darling scent.  Yes, it&#x27;s simple, yes it&#x27;s sweet, and yes, it smells like cotton candy.  But it is adorable.  I love this rollerball.  I can put some on it&#x27;s own or roll a little on under a different scent to sweeten it up a bit.  I also find that as long as the fragrance doesn&#x27;t class I can freshen up with this rollerball while at work, even if I had put something else on that morning.  Unfortunately I bought mine at Nordstrom and paid the full 20 bucks!  Shame on me!  I will be keeping my eyes on amazon from now on now.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell so I bought the toilette roller ball.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, and so I have to keep putting it on.  I am wondering how long its going to last me. (not long)  Wondering if I should of just bought the bottle of perfume. I didn&#x27;t realize that the shipping cost was the same price as the 2 perfume roller ball boxes.  Not sure why shipping cost that much, because on my other packages the cost for shipping was a lot cheaper and the packages were way bigger.  Wish I would of saw that before I ordered it.  I know I will end up buying the perfume.  I got the lotion and the hair perfume. We will see how they are.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff I can not keep her stocked in enough of it. I think it smells great on her also.</li>
    <li> Delicious scent, love the rollerball. Even with the rollerball it could be over-applied; it seems this will last me a long time, even wearing it nearly every day.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend not knowing what it smelled like. Anyway, she likes it. She doesn&#x27;t wear it everyday, as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really an \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; kind of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine it smells like Katy Perry&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like sweet fluffy clouds made of candy and soft, bouncy puppy fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too sweet in an obnoxious way. Not childish smelling. Smells like what a 20 year old would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells like a strip club.</li>
    <li> I love pink sugar-and this is yet another thing that have people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing, perfect!  It works great for travelling as well-and no, it doesn&#x27;t get sticky at all even though it is perfectly thick enough to stay on for a long time, yet it works out just perfect.  Pink sugar really did a great job on this one, I&#x27;m very pleased.  And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!  Also, it goes great with the hair perfume.  Yes, I know hair perfume sounds weird-but I swear you will be smelling your hair all day!  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannah</li>
    <li> When you first put Pink Sugar on it smells just like cotton candy! After it has been on for 2 minutes it smells like powder. Overall it smells lovely!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and was delivered before the promised delivery date. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume.  I love having this little rollerball in my purse instead of having to carry the bottle around.</li>
    <li> I love ALL the products in the, \\&quot;PINK SUGAR\\&quot; line and have been purchasing them for years. When I saw this for the first time here on Amazon in a take-along perfect size for a purse, I was in heaven and literally ran to the check-out. The scent in most other products in this line is simply the best ( nasal orgasmic experience)---can I say that?  you will ever have--I love the body lotion and had never tried this particular small roll on, but I did have an opportunity to smell it once it arrived and found it did not smell quite the same as other products in this line, but never had the opportunity to use it because the truth of the matter is, the very first time I placed it in that small zipper compartment type pocket most  purses have on the interior,I found out by reaching my hand into this pocket as I was driving that it had apparently shattered into a zillion pieces for no reason whatsoever because I am not someone who throws things around or is unusually hard on my expensive purses. With regard to the broken glass, the only large piece of glass that remained was this very sharp point coming from the very top of the bottle where the cap screws onto the bottle. Yes, you guessed it, when I reached my hand into the pocket to pull out my lip gloss, my hand was cut everywhere with glass even under my fingernails and the one large piece of glass punctured the inside of my hand. You ladies know how we place our hands in these pockets to pull out something as we are driving (of course with all eyes on the road.) If my eyes hadn&#x27;t been on the road and could see what my hand was about to experience, it never would have made contact with all that shattered glass. If I only knew how or where to send correspondence to this company, I would appreciate being able to send them the sharpest piece that broke off  that I still am retaining to convince them to make this product out of plastic so that nobody has to go through what I did on that day and FYI, of all things to be wearing on that day, I was wearing white pants (which as you women are aware, this can take on all sorts of other humiliating connotations). It goes without saying that I would in no way endorse this product I most definitely consider to be a serious safety hazard and warn anyone from ever purchasing this product unless it  is replaced and manufactured in a plastic container vs the existing glass.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Pink Sugar perfume- the rollerball was great because I didnt have to carry around the big bottle!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells - the rollerball size is perfect - you can use it without the guilt of that big bottle you&#x27;ll never finish.  Right size - great fragrance.</li>
    <li> My Pink Sugar rollerball perfume just arrived and I love, love, love it. It&#x27;s sweet but not overpowering at all. If you like sweet scents but don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap drugstore sprays then this is for you. The packaging is so cute and really handy for keeping in your handbag.The rollerball perfume has sort of a gel like consistency so let it dry down on your skin.Definently a \\&quot;Girly-Girl\\&quot; perfume.Mmmm, I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist!!! Thanks Amazon!! :)</li>
    <li> This perfume smelled really nice. I didn&#x27;t know if I would  like it or not but surprisingly I do. The package arrived really  fast I believe I received it within 2 business days.</li>
    <li> Aquolina, Pink Sugar is fav of mine.  At the time of purchase, I found it at a really good price ($17), standard price is ($19-20). It&#x27;s a slender glass bottle that can be tucked away in any purse. It is light and sweet smelling and guys totally love the smell. I would totally purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to wear such a \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smellng fragrance, it really smells like cotton candy, but I could not resist! I get compliments on this ALL of the time... And  for the price it is definatley worth trying it for yourself!</li>
    <li> Sweet smelling: great for young girls newly interested in fragrances - roller ball was a great price and the scent lasts a while</li>
    <li> A gift for my sister. She is absolutely in love with the Aquolina products, from the lip gloss to the perfumes...as am I!</li>
    <li> I know your body chemistry has a lot to do with how something smells but this has a nice food smell to it, someone asked if anyone was eating cotton candy when I was wearing this, LOL.  No but I love things that smell like food.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s one of my favorites, I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great for travel or to keep in your purse for on the go scents. I love this delivery system. I wish all scents offered the rollerball versions. The scent itself is a wonderful brown sugar scent - lightly musky. Nice.</li>
