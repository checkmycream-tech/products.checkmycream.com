<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was recommended to me by a dermatologist that I use  a sunscreen on my face to help keep my skin smooth , moisturized and protected. I tried this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen SPF 50+Liquid Silk Sumshield, and I absolutely love  it! It leaves my face feeling so smooth and moist and a  very refreshing feel  on my skin . With being over 60, I normally have very dry skin, but since using this product, I can feel the moisturizing on my face each time that I apply it! I highly recommend it to be used daily  as a moisturizer as well as for protection from the sun! Great product and very affordable . I ordered this item online and had it delivered to my home in a very  quick and speedy time!  I do not have any complaints about the purchase , price or quality of this produce..  LOVE  IT!💖</li>
    <li> Best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It is very light and NON greasy. Just enough of a moisturizer and the SPF rating of 50 is a bonus.</li>
    <li> $#@!@?$!! Huh? I LOVE(d) this stuff, but guess what, I JUST discovered that the IDENTICAL ingredients are in Loreal&#x27;s Advanced Suncare Silky Sheer Face Lotion 50+, a full 3.0 oz, not 1.7 oz,  AND it is selling for $10.99!!!  Here are the ingredients, and they are the same and in identcal percentages as Amazon&#x27;s Loreal product! Read the labels and compare, this is rather astonishing, from Loreal website, http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/products/skin-care/suncare/advanced-suncare-silky-sheer-face-lotion-50.aspx#ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: AVOBENZONE 3% • HOMOSALATE 15% • OCTISALATE 5% • OCTOCRYLENE 5% • OXYBENZONE 6% INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER • CYCLOPENTASILOXANE • ALCOHOL DENAT. • SILICA • DICAPRYLYL ETHER • STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER • PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE • DIMETHICONE • CYCLOHEXASILOXANE • POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE • NYLON-12 • PEG-8 LAURATE • DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE • DODECENE • METHYLPARABEN • SODIUM CHLORIDE • VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) FRUIT EXTRACT • PHENOXYETHANOL • DISODIUM EDTA • POLOXAMER 407 • TOCOPHEROL • LAURYL PEG/PPG-18/18 METHICONE • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • ISOSTEARYL ALCOHOL • DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE • POLY C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE</li>
    <li> Very greasy. Only wore once.</li>
    <li> The best, not greasy, very silky. Will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is very light and easy to apply.. love this product! not greasy at all... and the size is is just perfect to carry around</li>
    <li> Greasy and really stings my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this L&#x27;Oreal Sublime sunscreen. Will reorder time and time again!</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly. The expiration on the Sunscreen is Mar 30, 2015 less then 30 days of receiving the product.&lt;br /&gt;I see the product use almost useless as I can only use it for a few weeks before it expires! Very disappointed indeed!</li>
    <li> I used the 30 SPF one, it was nice and light. It also gives a smooth finish to the skin. Sunscreens in general are thick, this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> First time I ever found a lotion with this degree of protection that glides on so easily.  It is perfect!</li>
    <li> I am a fair skinned red head with oily skin. I have tried a zillion  sun screens for the face. This is by far the best! It really does go on like silk. My face does not get greasy and make up goes over it beautifully. By the end of a long day my face feels great! I am not a very loyal skin product consumer. I am always looking for the next best thing. I will keep buying this over and over!!</li>
    <li> Feels like a light foundation.  Protects the skin really well.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> it does what it says.  I would reccommend it to friends and family. I will also purchase again.  great product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face sunscreen yet! Lightweight, silky, and not at all greasy, it layers beautifully under liquid or powder foundation. It also holds up well to moisture and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It really is like liquid, not a cream, not a serum, not a gel. It melts right into your skin and leaves your skin super soft. You can still use moisturizer and makeup over this. Usually SPF50 is gross on your face, greasy and clogging your pores. This is amazing. I wear this every time I&#x27;m in the sun.</li>
    <li> I like it because it protects my face from the sun and it goes on smooth I always like loreal products</li>
    <li> I love the oil free sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen. It has a thin and sleek bottle and makes a clicking sound when you shake the bottle. The foundation goes really well on top of the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I live in a really hot, humid environment.  I bought a liquid thinking it would be better than lotions, but it left a terrible shiny film behind.  Maybe if you live somewhere arid and have dry skin this would work.  If you are acne-prone and live in a humid environment, I would pass over this sunblock.</li>
    <li> I discovered this sunscreen last year at Wal Mart and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I am obsessed with facial sunscreens. I love how lightweight this feels. It blends in so smooth to my skin, and I love the high SPF! Never a sunburn with this on. It seems that they&#x27;ve discontinued this at the stores, but glad Amazon sells them!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Skin looks so good. I never used to put sun lotion because I used to get brakeouts. I can&#x27;t live without this lotion.</li>
    <li> Very light, does not clog pores, great antioxidants and high spf, noticably improves quality of skin, can reapply all day without skin irriation or clogging of pores</li>
    <li> Its perfect for Summer as it evenly soaks into your skin and protects you from the sun yet I can&#x27;t get over how it smells. Besides the smell I&#x27;d say this works well. Another negative to it though is that it can sting you if you apply make-up afterwards. Ouch!</li>
    <li> This really does feel like silk! I purchased it because I wasn&#x27;t so into the ghostly-white residue of my tried n&#x27; true sunblock. This is broad-spectrum, so you know you&#x27;re getting the best coverage. It does smell like rubbing alcohol, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I love how well it blends into my skin. I usually apply primer over it, and then apply either BB cream or tinted moisturizer, and they all work well together on my dry skin. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Best sunsreen around. Light, non-oily and will not cause your skin to breakout. This product will actual improve the condition of your skin with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is this product is expensive for only 1.7 fl. and not easy to find in regular stores. Even so I still fully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have now tried this product and its relatively similar sister product the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Suncare Sunscreen SPF 50+ Liquid Silk BB Cream. Both of them have the same very slippery, liquidy feel, and both left a remarkably greasy sheen to my face after application. The other key issue with both was their strong petroleum smell - as a consumer who is pretty concerned with the chemicals in my beauty products, I was left seriously wondering what could be in this stuff to cause it to smell like gasoline! This product also quickly broke me out, and I will be returning.</li>
    <li> It seems to work, not greasy, goes on easily, but I use it for my face, neck and chest area where I already have sun damage from not using a sunscreen in my younger days.  It very well may be a great product, but this tiny bottle is not going to last very long especially if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun and water for a long time.  Just TOO costly for the amount you get...thus the two star rating....</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is amazing, I use it every day on my face neck and chest.  It is runny so easy to apply, and is very thin and sheer so it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel sticky, which all suntan lotions do including spray on ones.  It leaves your skin feeling silky soft and is a good base for foundation application.  It definitely works.  No more burnt nose in the CA sun. I usually wear the 100SPF but can&#x27;t find it anymore so I bought the 50SPF online.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of sunscreens.  This one has everything I want and has nothing that I don&#x27;t want.  Goes on easy,  doesn&#x27;t leave a whitish cast, doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny or slippery.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It dryes quickly on contact with the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily like most regular sun-screens.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin to mix with a light gel moisturizer for the day!</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to oily products and break out from them because they are so oily. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like to wear sunscreen.  They always make my face explode with pimples; however, I needed sun protection for my face and the reviews for this product seemed legitimate.  All I can say is, if you have oily skin or are sensitive to things that have oil in them then DO NOT GET THIS.  I wish I could return it but I threw away the box in came in.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED AS PROMISED, MY WIFE LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> I bought my new step dad all golf stuff for Christmas , hat, 3 shorts and polo outfits, hand towels, balls etc. and most important sunscreen.  He plays weeks at a time every day. He liked this, stays on better through sweat does not have to keep re applying every hours like others.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen for about two weeks–it is less greasy than most sunscreens. I use is over my face lotion. I do have to blot more often than if I weren&#x27;t wearing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear during the day under my makeup but it&#x27;s very greasy and makes my skin breakout. I thought it would be a nice  light sunscreen but I&#x27;ve only been using it now if I expect direct burning sun. It does block the sun as best I can tell but otherwise I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great. Really, really great. Here&#x27;s why:  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, although it is rather dry. The only \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; thing about my skin is my eye area, which burns like the dickens if anything above SPF 15 gets around it. I decided to give this a try, though, because of the name: Liquid Silk Sunshield. How cool does that sound? The past three mornings that I&#x27;ve put this on my face (and my eyes), I&#x27;ve been blown away. There&#x27;s no stinging or burning or yelling or throwing things! It really doesn&#x27;t burn! (Okay, it did burn the first time I used it, but not the normal \\&quot;I want to die\\&quot; burn. Just a little bit of \\&quot;Meh\\&quot; burning, and it only lasted a couple of seconds.) It doesn&#x27;t even smell like sunscreen after you put it on. But make sure you pay attention to the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; part of the product name. It is seriously, 100% liquid sunscreen. It&#x27;s not a moisturizer (thankfully), and it&#x27;s not even greasy after it sinks in. It&#x27;s just pure, wonderful sun protection in a bottle.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dozens of sunscreens and have kept searching for the &#x27;perfect one&#x27; for using on the face. This one is very nice. The texture is appealing, it is absorbed well, is not greasy, works well with various foundations I use over it. There is still the silvery cast that all sunscreens seem to have, so this is not the perfect one; maybe such a thing does not and cannot exist. This is an excellent facial sunscreen for the price, and I will be buying it again. It protects well in the ferocious Australian sun, so should protect skin anywhere!  Edited 13 Feb 2015 - The use-by date was only 3 months for this product when shipped, which is not really reasonable, so I will not be reordering. [I understand that it has been discontinued, anyway.]</li>
    <li> lighter tha most sunscreens</li>
    <li> Product was mentioned in an article by Prevention magazine about the 5 best vitamins for skin.  Was skeptical about the fact that you can only find it on Amazon.  I ordered them anyway.  I find the product slightly drying to my skin, but does go on nicely.  Happened to check the dates on the bottom of the bottles.  The use by date was February 2014.  Supplier may want to check dates of remaining stock.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and live in the desert where a good sunscreen is crucial for healthy skin.  In the past I have used Regenerist lotion with SPF 50 which I can only find on Amazon.  However, I was becoming increasingly disappointed with its interaction with other face products.  It didn&#x27;t fully absorb into my skin and tended to cake up and flake with even a light luminizing primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went looking for a suncreen with at least SPF 30 but without the heavy feel of most sunscreens.  I happened to find L&#x27;Oreal Sublime liquid silk subshield in Walmart of all places.  I picked it up since the package promised a \\&quot;sheer lightweight feel\\&quot; that is \\&quot;instantly absorbed\\&quot; with SPF 50 UVA/UVB protection.  Boy does this deliver.  Completely absorbed instantly (even when applied over \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; face cream), doesn&#x27;t effect my other skin care products and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any sunscreen at all.  Note- it is important to look for the words \\&quot;liquid silk sunshield\\&quot;  since they also make Sublime Sun in a traditional lotion form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my sunscreen for as long as they make it.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a sunblock.  At this writing it is out of stock on Amazon; but I hope it eventually becomes available in their Subscribe and Save program.&lt;br /&gt;Update-  Finally available on amazon but not prime eligible.  Unfortunately the price when shipping is added is disappointing.  You can get it at Walmart for $9.99.  If you don&#x27;t want to shop at walmart (which I understand) you should be able to find it for less than the total $15 here even at a grocery or drug store.</li>
    <li> Never before have I tried a face sunscreen as fantastic as this! Light, silky, absorbs quickly into the skin (you can wear it under makeup), no white residue, no caking into wrinkles, no sunscreen \\&quot;odor\\&quot;!! Even the hubs likes it! Lasts ALL day too with no burning (I am fair-skinned). Can&#x27;t say enough about this sunscreen. They FINALLY have gotten it right!</li>
    <li> Good coverage and a nice moist feel when applying.  Works great for me</li>
    <li> With Melanoma l always need to wear a spf50. I really like this for my face.because l trust Loreal for so many things and it goes on beautifully! .One of my top ten products for my face!.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Although it is 50+ spf, it is still so smooth and does not leave a white mark. would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I liked this product if works great on your face nd I love that it is light and isn&#x27;t oily. I do think it was too small of an amount for the price I paid and because of that I will not repurchase</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight lotion sunscreen.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
    <li> My favorite so far. And I&#x27;ve tried over 25 in the last few years (high end and drug store). I like the antioxidant factor. And since I&#x27;ve learned that SPF should be your first layer, I now skip lotion and apply this directly after serum. Not good for eye area.</li>
    <li> great stuff but keep it away from the eyes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It is not greasy or messy and it does protect you skin from the sun.  There is no white streaks running down your face when you are exposed to your face. It&#x27;s great!!!!</li>
    <li> There are lot&#x27;s of sunscreens out there, and I&#x27;ve tried many of them, as someone who is very light skinned and who has had skin cancer. This product not only provides excellent protection from the sun UVA/UVB but also, upon application, doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing sunscreen. There is no smell, no oily feel. In fact, it is one of the only sunscreens I LIKE putting on. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful to have a product that is hard to find.  I am excited to have all my Loreal products match so thank you very much for sending me this awesome sunblock.</li>
    <li> love this product - goes on like silk and works well</li>
    <li> At 50 yrs old I still break out with most sunscreens or creams. I have been using this product for 2 years with excellent results. The product is so light weight it absorbs in seconds. I wear it all year long even in Chicago winters.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
    <li> I tried several facial sunscreens before finding this one. It&#x27;s exactly what I want: leaves NO glossy sheen on your face, no greasiness, no whitish haze residue.</li>
    <li> This works fine to block the sun but keep it away from your eyes.  If you sweat and who doesn&#x27;t, this stuff will burn your eyes.  It is a little runny which is maybe part of the problem.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Hard to find now at the stores</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face! Almost everything clogs my facial pores. Not this. It works and feels great, like a fine moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have to use sunscreen formulated for the face or else my skin reacts poorly and ends up with small bumps that result in super dry and flaky patches.  Even though this says it is for faces, it&#x27;s not for my face. After using it for one day, I have dry, tight and burning patches that have, so far, lasted over a week. This stuff is terrible and I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> [...]    [...]    [...]    The sunscreen from L&#x27;oreal was very painful &amp; burned my eyes and nose as you can see in the pictures. I tried a skin healing ointment but I am still in pain and now require a dermatologist to recover the damage caused.</li>
    <li> Worked great on our recent trip to Jamaica. Didn&#x27;t burn or break out and my face never felt too oily with it on. Easy to apply, though of course keep it away from your eyes. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It worked well and arrived quickly. I just didn&#x27;t like the feel of it on my face. Kinda burned a little bit but didn&#x27;t feel that way to my husband so it might&#x27;ve been just a me thing. No complaints as far as shipping, seller, or packaging. Just didn&#x27;t really LOVE the product but my hubs did so we may re-buy.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy and easy to apply the thin lotion which dries quickly.  I have had great difficulty finding it anywhere.  I finally went to a discontinued site and was able to buy five.  I absolutely love it and it is the best I have ever found.  I live in very sunny Arizona and&lt;br /&gt;I do not burn or tan on my face and neck when I use this.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t sting my eyes, but it does more so than my cheapie Neutrogena brand one. it does, however, glide on smoothly and sink into the skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face. I will use it in winter when I sweat less so there&#x27;s less chance of it ending up in my eyes.</li>
    <li> It left my skin looking like it had an uneven coating of white powder on it.  Couldn&#x27;t use at all except when gardening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fair, blue eyed blond living in SW Florida.  I already have had many skin cancers cut out and frozen off.  Due to go in for another 3 MOH surgeries in the next couple of months too.  I hate sunblock.  Actually I detest it.  That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t use it every second of the day, but the greasy, filmy, yukky feeling, having sand sticking to you, getting in your hair, running in your eyes, the smell, yep, I don&#x27;t like it one bit.  Till I met this stuff.  Now I&#x27;m an absolute convert.  It&#x27;s a liquid, not a lotion, that makes a big, big difference.  It absorbs right in instantly, you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s just like a normal moisteriser.  I put this stuff on the moment I wake up and walk the dogs, on my face, ears (having a cancer cut off there soon), neck, hands, feet and calves.  The rest of my body is covered with sun block clothing.  But yeah, I&#x27;m so happy with this that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using it forever.  I found 6 bottles of it at Bealls Outlet, $5 a bottle which worries me a touch, especially now I can&#x27;t find it at our local Walmart.  Hopefully Walmart is just out of stock.  I so hope Loreal keep making it.</li>
    <li> The greatest thing about this product is that it does what it says it will. The lotion is watery and has a sunscreen smell to it, but once rubbed in it does not leave any white sheen on my face. It is feather light; this is definitely not a moisturizer. I wear it regularly for outdoor workouts in South Florida and am happy to report that it does the trick without any issues!</li>
    <li> Very watery, be careful on opening product, once the liquidness of the product is controlled, its Ok...gives a little healthy shine which I personally like....</li>
    <li> Most makeup obsessed women like myself are constantly trying new products. We label something HG but know that something newer and shinier will come out eventually, especially when it comes to foundations and face creams. Then something so perfect comes out that we get to a level where we actually *gasp* repurchase the same product. This is one of those rare, rare products for me that has reached actual repurchasing status, up there with Nuxe oil, Nivea creme (for my face), rosewater, and hyaluronic acid. I wear this every single day, rain or shine, makeup or no makeup. It acts partially as a makeup base (yay!) and helps makeup go on smoother and last a bit longer. It never feels greasy, it has a wonderful balancing effect. My face feels velvety all over, again, like with a good primer. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird and has a lovely consistancy. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake or ball up under foundation. Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the true test is how well it performs at blocking UV rays. I can assure you, it is outstanding! I am outside a LOT in the sun. I do mean a lot. I go for long walks all the time and lounge around in the sun and normally by this time of year my normally pale as a ghost NC15 skin is at least an NC20 or 25. But this year, guess who hasn&#x27;t changed foundation shades yet? THIS lady. Despite many hours in the sun I am still alabaster white as a sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not happy with your current sunscreen, give this one a try. You might be surprised!!!</li>
    <li> Pros: good SPF, doesn&#x27;t leave any white cast, not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: contains high percentage of alcohol which stings like hell on my sensitive skin probably because of topical retinoic acid night cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I like it better than other sunscreens because it is light and not greasy on my face.  It works as well under makeup since it is so light; I put on the sunscreen then a BB cream and I&#x27;m set.  I also use this when I play sports.  I play tennis in the hot sun every summer and this gives me good protection and doesn&#x27;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the exact same formula as Kiehl&#x27;s Super Fluid UV Defense (compare the bottles).  Kiehl&#x27;s &#x3D; $40+  L&#x27;Oreal &#x3D; $10</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product - I layer it over my moisturizer and under my make up and also on my chest. The texture is very good, I think it sinks in well. My only issue is that it seems to irritate my lips, this is a common problem for me with SPF products as I have very sensitive skin and my lips can react to certain toothpastes even. It is absolutely fine on my skin though so if you don&#x27;t have the lip problem I do this will be a perfect product if you have very sensitive skin.It also works well under my primer and make up so I think it is a good product for the summer and would recommend it</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER A YEAR IT MAKES MY SKIN VERY SOFT AND MOISTURIZED(I AM 74YRS.OLD)&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NO WRINKLES BUT I HAVE rosacea which it helps with the redness</li>
