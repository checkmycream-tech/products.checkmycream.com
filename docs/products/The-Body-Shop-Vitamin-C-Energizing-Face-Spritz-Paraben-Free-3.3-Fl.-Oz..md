      <li>cool and refreshing, gives a moist glow in all degrees of weather</li>
      <li>And it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really just good for a light spray on the face when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
      <li>I live at the beach, so it&#x27;s nice to spritz on to keep the salty mist from drying out my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the dewey look this gives my skin. Great at setting make-up</li>
    <li> I bought this because I liked the reviews. It is not as great smelling as I thought it would be. I like it thought for a face refresh.</li>
    <li> I have been used it for a month. And I Can&#x27;t tell the difference. Definitely I won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this but either I spray too close or to heavy because at times it makes my normal good makeup job look orange/oily.  I&#x27;ve found that I can spray my palm and dab and it looks better after makeup.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.  Pretty fresh smelling and the smell goes away quickly.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out which is a plus!</li>
    <li> I love it. It feels very refreshing and light on the skin. The scent is very soft and clean.  Sometimes I use it to set my makeup, too.</li>
    <li> Nice product! I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I recently went on a trip and took the Energizing Face Spritz with me.  It was wonderful to feel and look refreshed.  I especially loved the way it made my face feel and the aroma.</li>
    <li> It smells so bad, like cheap air refresher</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel! Keeps my skin youthful!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, is so good. I ordered 3 bottles as I use it daily, it gives my skin a nice glow throughout the day, and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I like the spray.  It is refreshing.  I was expecting more of an orangy or citrusy smell.  I use it under or over make up and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  It is a very fine mist.</li>
    <li> This is a nice spritz with a citrus aroma. I am not sure about &amp;#34;energizing&amp;#34; but I like adding Vitamin C products to my facial care routine so this does the trick...and it doesn&#x27;t break me out in the process!</li>
    <li> I love most of the products from The Body Shop and their Vitamin C Energizing Face Spritz wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  It didn&#x27;t explain how to use it, but it did say avoid spraying in eyes.  Duh! No kidding!  I used it after I washed my face and sometimes I use a tiny bit of moisturizer afterwards. It wasn&#x27;t greasy, but The Body Shop&#x27;s spritz looked nice on my skin.  Plus it had a nice citrus smell to it and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  So, get spritz and see if you love the subtle glow!</li>
    <li> Refreshing, light, and a quick mid day pick me up for your skin. I like to use it in the summer months when I&#x27;m in the sun a lot more but I don&#x27;t like the price tag that comes along with it. I get the same &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; effect from splashing water on my face or hydrating mid day with some lotion. If you&#x27;re concerned about your make up then this is a good option.</li>
    <li> Im not sure this is an honest product. Ive used this spritz before and the smell seems different. It also came packaged without the safety cap, which also causes me to wonder how true this product is or isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Will set your makeup to a dewy finish and take away that powdery look!</li>
    <li> Ok, there are several spritz out there but this one is a winner!!  It carries a subtle scent of orange but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  You are instantly revitalized after just two sprays.  Use it in the morning after your face lotion and throughout the day as a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel like I get a splash of energy after every spray.  I recommend buying two so that you may keep one in the car.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh citrus scent this has! It&#x27;s really energizing and hydrating!</li>
    <li> The products smells very nice however it hasn&#x27;t done much for me. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few weeks and i do not feel \\&quot;energized\\&quot; and i have not noticed any change in my skin&#x27;s completion. I bought this thinking it would help to energize my skin and help bring a healthier look to it but it hasn&#x27;t done anything. For the price i would say disregard this product and look elsewhere. It&#x27;s really just good for a light spray on the face when it&#x27;s hot out or you&#x27;re done at the gym but splashing yourself with water or washing your face does the same thing.</li>
    <li> cool and refreshing, gives a moist glow in all degrees of weather</li>
    <li> I have always had a bottle of this in my purse for years.  It is so refreshing in the summer.  I live at the beach, so it&#x27;s nice to spritz on to keep the salty mist from drying out my skin.  Plus, it&#x27;s nice to spray this on after you&#x27;ve been around cigarette smoke, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used face misters before that atomized a little better than this product.The fragrance is subtle and it does provide a cooling effect.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a week ago. Tried spritzing it on my face. But it left a sticky, gunky sort of texture. Nice smell, but I had to wash it off.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Has a slight tingle and for myself has really perked up tired skin!&lt;br /&gt;On my second bottle. Recommend!</li>
    <li> lovely, it perks up your face with just a few squirts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good... doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is sensitive. It smells really nice too... which I like. I would buy this again. :)</li>
    <li> A REALLY GOOD  MAKEUP SETTING SPRAY.</li>
    <li> Excellent refreshing spray. Exactly what I was looking for. A perfect afternoon pick me up for tired skin and make up.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle and smell very good but didn&#x27;t brought any skin change. Only feel moisture for 10 sec. after spray.</li>
    <li> I love it. The smell is very good and refreshing. And it is good for sensitive skin. I will definitely purchase another one in the future.</li>
