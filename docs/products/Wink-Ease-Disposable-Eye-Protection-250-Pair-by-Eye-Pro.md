      <li>This is such a great deal.</li>

      <li>Same as the ones used at my salon, and a Loy cheaper, good bargain</li>
      <li>Try them first at the salon, but if you&#x27;re an avid tanner you will love these.</li>

      <li>super fast delivery, and</li>

      <li>Tossed her funny looking glasses started using these.  </li>
      <li>Protects eyes from UV rays pretty well, however could improve on sticking together, sticking on, and on not leaving glue residue on eye lids.</li>
      <li>does exactly what they are intended for.</li>
      <li>exactly what you get in the salons, they stay on but do not stick in a hurtful way either --</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have light coming through near the tear, and your UV protection is no longer complete.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Even if you wipe the sweat off, there will still be too much moisture, trust</li>
      <li>Work very well.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>They charge $1 a pair at my salon, certainly much cheaper and the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>) Remember that closing your eyes may only filter out around 25% of UV rays, and that you should position this cone to protect the whole eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>

<li> Everyone&#x27;s eyes are different in size, and remember that the company offers a larger-sized product if these are too small for you.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
<li> can&#x27;t use them while sweaty, takes 30 seconds to carefully pull the flap up to the line, which could make you miss a minute of your tan if you only get 2 minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall &#x3D;</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t let the foil become crushed in your pocket on the way to the gym or tanning salon, it could bend it too severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t bring that flap up to the line to create the cone for your eye, the cone might be a little too big, resulting in a slight bit of lighter skin under your eye (this does prove that it is protecting your eyes, though!).&lt;br</li>
<li> This is breaks down to 0.14 per pair.&lt;br /&gt;Smart investment</li>
<li> Tan BEFORE you workout and become sweaty, as it will cause problems keeping the adhesive tight around your eyes.</li>
<li> The patches are slightly too small.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t re-use them (bacterial growth can be dangerous, and the adhesive won&#x27;t work well anyways)&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these in 2007--still using the same box.  They charge $1 a pair at my salon, certainly much cheaper and the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> I used these today at my salon at a charge of $0.50. I went in the bed for 12 minutes, wrestled with these to stay on for 8 and finally just threw them off and layed there in the bed. I can&#x27;t wait for my actual goggles to come in. THOSE are a better investment.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, I am saving so much money! They are a dollar a pair at the salon.</li>
    <li> I use the stand up tanning bed and these are awesome!!!  They don&#x27;t slip or fall and no tan lines on nose from the goggles. Throw away after each use.  No bothersome head gear to wear. Try them first at the salon, but if you&#x27;re an avid tanner you will love these.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast service.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal. The tanning salon charges 1.00 per pair every visit. This is breaks down to 0.14 per pair.&lt;br /&gt;Smart investment</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I always have 2-3 pairs in my wallet. I was surprise that you can still see  trough it.&lt;br /&gt;  I will recommend for every one who use tanning saloon.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for our medical practice to use during chemical peels for eye protection vs the &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; eye protection that costs many, many times more.  GREAT product and fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Love these!! You can see through them and they don&#x27;t fall off like googles!</li>
    <li> Wink-ease are the best eye protection when tanning.  Easy to take with you, and easy and clean when use them.  Best of all they stay on while you are tanning, especially in a Stand-up tanning unit.  I&#x27;ve used these for years.</li>
    <li> exactly what you get in the salons, they stay on but do not stick in a hurtful way either -- does exactly what they are intended for.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a freind and she loves them.  Tossed her funny looking glasses started using these.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> They are great just don&#x27;t forget a pair in your bag because the adhesive becomes like glue in the heat. Didn&#x27;t know this. But great otherwise.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for spray tanning!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product. Work very well. Work much better than the plastic eye goggles that give you a line across your nose.</li>
    <li> As an avid tanner, purchasing disposable eye protection at $.50 a pair seemed so wasteful.  Now, at a great price, I always have my eye protection available.</li>
    <li> they work; you can see through them somewhat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before. They are wonderful!! The work just like they are supposed to. The dispenser on the box also works just as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Protects eyes from UV rays pretty well, however could improve on sticking together, sticking on, and on not leaving glue residue on eye lids.</li>
    <li> The patches are slightly too small.  I am working on adjusting, maybe it is my technique and not the product.</li>
    <li> My rules for using these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Tan BEFORE you workout and become sweaty, as it will cause problems keeping the adhesive tight around your eyes. (Even if you wipe the sweat off, there will still be too much moisture, trust me).&lt;br /&gt;2) Everyone&#x27;s eyes are different in size, and remember that the company offers a larger-sized product if these are too small for you.&lt;br /&gt;3) The instructions show that you are supposed to pull the flap to the designated line.  If you don&#x27;t bring that flap up to the line to create the cone for your eye, the cone might be a little too big, resulting in a slight bit of lighter skin under your eye (this does prove that it is protecting your eyes, though!).&lt;br /&gt;4) Make sure you can&#x27;t see light sneaking through around the edges, or you haven&#x27;t put the cone on properly, and UV rays will be entering your eyes.  It MIGHT be normal if you move your eyes all the way to the right and left and then see some ray of bright light coming through, because your eyeball movement might actually be moving the cone.&lt;br /&gt;5) Don&#x27;t re-use them (bacterial growth can be dangerous, and the adhesive won&#x27;t work well anyways)&lt;br /&gt;6) If you tear the flap at all while trying to pull it to the line, just throw it out.  You&#x27;ll have light coming through near the tear, and your UV protection is no longer complete.&lt;br /&gt;7) Remember that closing your eyes may only filter out around 25% of UV rays, and that you should position this cone to protect the whole eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;8) Don&#x27;t let the foil become crushed in your pocket on the way to the gym or tanning salon, it could bend it too severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits &#x3D; lightweight to keep in pocket, you won&#x27;t to carry goggles around for the rest of the workout.  Hygienic because you won&#x27;t wear them more than once, therefore you won&#x27;t need to spend time cleaning them.  Can be worn at the beach or tanning salon, and you won&#x27;t have bridge lines. May be easier to wear than bridgeless goggles, which could fall off if you standup during tanning sessions.&lt;br /&gt;Cons &#x3D; can&#x27;t use them while sweaty, takes 30 seconds to carefully pull the flap up to the line, which could make you miss a minute of your tan if you only get 2 minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall &#x3D; Great product when used properly</li>
    <li> super fast delivery, and I love this product! I have to pay 55 cents for a set if I use the salons, and these are so awesome, you can move all around without having to adjust. Definitely won&#x27;t be wearing goggles anymore!</li>
    <li> Same as the ones used at my salon, and a Loy cheaper, good bargain I share with my daughters. Awsome</li>
