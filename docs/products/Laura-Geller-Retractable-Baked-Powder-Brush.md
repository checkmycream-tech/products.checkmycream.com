      <li>I use it for cake blush and it applies beautifully.</li>
      <li>and it was a great price</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s a great value.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, the brush and bristles are a good quality.</li>

      <li>I bought this to compliment the Laura Geller baked highlight powder foundation and it does a good job.</li>
      <li>Really fine and easy to use, wonderful application.</li>
      <li>Can not think of applying blush without this amazing tool now.</li>
      <li>Well, I hope not, but if the brush is still functional without this feature it would still be a really nice brush.  </li>
      <li>The brush holds up nicely to washing too.</li>
      <li>but I love this brush</li>
      <li>However, I just wanted the brush, so I&#x27;m glad I can find it here.  </li>
      <li>very nice does seem a bit on the soft side but nice</li>
      <li>This is a great brush, soft and works with Laura Gellers baked correction powder.  </li>
      <li>Nice makeup brush and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and even.</li>
      <li>The storage cap is unique in that it keeps the brushes from getting all bent out of shape.  </li>
      <li>but I find it to be just right!</li>
      <li>Like it closing in top as good way to travel with and not get messy</li>
      <li>delivery of the brush was also quick.</li>
      <li>Seller willing to help with any and all problems!</li>
      <li>I think they come free with certain Laura Geller products.  </li>
      <li>These brushes stay clean so much</li>
      <li>It is a nice, fluffy, synthetic brush that fits easily in your purse for touchups.  </li>
      <li>someone* pulled the movable piece that comes from below right off of mine, but after about 10 min I was able to force it back on by rubberbanding together the bristles and using a tweezer to circumvent the plastic flange that was supposed to keep that part on on.</li>
      <li>This is a smaller brush, better for spot application rather than all over.  </li>
      <li>I like that these brushes stay clean in their case and also are very soft.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it put on just the right about of makeup not to much.  </li>
      <li>Nice little brush.  </li>
      <li>This retractable blush brush can be either as long stemmed or short and is adjustable which is nice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product as well as the baked foundation.</li>
      <li>This is retractable and brush is soft.</li>
      <li>A little small for my needs but good quality.</li>
      <li>update: A year and a half later of daily use and the retractable feature is still going strong.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals foundation and mineral veil, but find the Geller baked line wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

<li> but they actually feel a little less full than the previous brushes I had bought.  </li>
<li> I read one review on another site that said this brush was too stiff and another that said it was too soft</li>
<li> ...buuuttt the lid fits loosely and falls off in my bag.</li>
<li> I would not use any other brand.  </li>
<li> Maybe they are using less hair in the brushes</li>
<li> Very slow delivery due to a postal issue,</li>
<li> This is poorly constructed or glued.  </li>
<li> Received and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price ladies.</li>
<li> but that seems unlikely and not feasible.</li>
<li> My brush bottom part broke off and now it looks stupid</li>

    <li> Can not think of applying blush without this amazing tool now. Really fine and easy to use, wonderful application. Smooth and even. You need one...............................</li>
    <li> Very slow delivery due to a postal issue, but I love this brush and it was a great price</li>
    <li> Excellent used with baked powder blush.</li>
    <li> This retractable blush brush can be either as long stemmed or short and is adjustable which is nice. I bought this to compliment the Laura Geller baked highlight powder foundation and it does a good job. Highly recommend this product as well as the baked foundation. It has taken years off my face and I get a lot of compliments on the glow of my skin.</li>
    <li> ...buuuttt the lid fits loosely and falls off in my bag. Otherwise, the brush and bristles are a good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a smaller brush, better for spot application rather than all over.  *someone* pulled the movable piece that comes from below right off of mine, but after about 10 min I was able to force it back on by rubberbanding together the bristles and using a tweezer to circumvent the plastic flange that was supposed to keep that part on on.</li>
    <li> Nice little brush.  A little small for my needs but good quality.</li>
    <li> This is poorly constructed or glued.  My brush bottom part broke off and now it looks stupid and I have to hide it ...</li>
    <li> I have seen these brushes floating around - I think they come free with certain Laura Geller products.  However, I just wanted the brush, so I&#x27;m glad I can find it here.  It is a nice, fluffy, synthetic brush that fits easily in your purse for touchups.  I keep it in my work desk for those shiny-nose moments.</li>
    <li> Good product! Seller willing to help with any and all problems! This is retractable and brush is soft. Perfect for travel or in the purse( i have 2 one in purse n one in my makeup stuff in the bathroom) i will buy again if i need one. If unr looking forma good brush at a good price i say buy this.</li>

    <li> This is a great brush, soft and works with Laura Gellers baked correction powder.  I also&lt;br /&gt;use Bare Minerals foundation and mineral veil, but find the Geller baked line wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery of the brush was also quick. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price ladies.</li>
    <li> I read one review on another site that said this brush was too stiff and another that said it was too soft but I find it to be just right! I use it for cake blush and it applies beautifully. I also read that the retractable feature breaks. Well, I hope not, but if the brush is still functional without this feature it would still be a really nice brush.  update: A year and a half later of daily use and the retractable feature is still going strong. The brush holds up nicely to washing too.</li>
    <li> Nice makeup brush and the price is very reasonable.  I like it because it put on just the right about of makeup not to much.  For the price it&#x27;s a great value.</li>

    <li> I use the Laura Geller Baked products...and this is a really good tool for application. Great deal! I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I like that these brushes stay clean in their case and also are very soft.  I would have given 5 stars but they actually feel a little less full than the previous brushes I had bought.  Maybe they are using less hair in the brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes stay clean so much longer-- wish they would make something like this for men&#x27;s shaving brushes-- but that seems unlikely and not feasible.</li>
