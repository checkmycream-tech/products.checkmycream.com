      <li>Good product, waiting to see if time brings results.</li>
      <li>i travel a lot and the seacret products are good.</li>
      <li>so I tried it to give it a fair shake.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I love this product and love that I can find it online!  </li>
      <li>I use it on fine lines around the mouth and nose and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products for smooth, vibrant skin and this is the best I have found.</li>
      <li>and I love the feel for the serum.  </li>
      <li>I love to order more of the seacret product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that I noticed anything significant.</li>
      <li>Prefer the vitamin rich moisturizer and eye cream more.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed that combined with the moisturiser fine lines are disappearing.</li>
      <li>The product goes on my skin with a silky smooth feel.</li>
      <li>My skin is important, and using expired products is like taking expired medication.</li>
      <li>Feels very smooth on the skin but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really making a difference or not.</li>
      <li>If you buy Seacret skincare, please take my advice and buy it online instead-the prices are much more reasonable.  </li>
      <li>This product came quickly.  </li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>The one thing I liked about it is that it is fairly lightweight, so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long for it to absorb, but other than that, there is really nothing special about this serum.  </li>
      <li>makes your skin feel soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I really should have checked online first, but I got suckered in by the salesperson&#x27;s schpiel.</li>
      <li>this product is very different, makes you skin feel silky smooth</li>
      <li>Tell us where you bought it and when and how much you paid...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>they come in small size containers so they are easy for the road and priced right.</li>
      <li>Bottle or box did not have any type of wrapping like a new bottle should.</li>
      <li>This product works well and makes your skin feel moisturized and soft!</li>
      <li>Makes your skin soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I like the product itself, and have found not other product to give me the results I have been given with this.</li>
      <li>Botox-nothing topical is going to get rid of wrinkles and lines-but my usual skincare brand softens any fine lines quite a bit, and brightens and evens my skin tone, and this does none of those things.  </li>
      <li>-it was in tiny print at the bottom of the sales receipt, which of course you aren&#x27;t given until the sale is complete.</li>

    <li> item was out of date by 3 months, arrived leaking.  Should have stated item was past &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; date. misleading and dishonest.</li>
    <li> makes your skin feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Very good product. Makes your skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and every night along with the eye serum.   Amazing product. I have been using this for about 6 months now.   Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  This is a good price too!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR MY SKIN, FACE AND ALL. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE THAT HAS SKIN PROBLEMS, DRYNESS, MAKEUP PROBLEMS ETC.</li>
    <li> We found this in Budapest, and couldn&#x27;t believe it could be the same product for the price offered here.</li>
    <li> I use Seacret Age- Defying and make me looking younger i am 56 years age but over the product Seacret i am looking 32 years.I love to order more of the seacret product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and love that I can find it online!  It makes my skin feel silky.</li>
    <li> This product works well and makes your skin feel moisturized and soft!</li>
    <li> Good product, waiting to see if time brings results.</li>
    <li> Bottle or box did not have any type of wrapping like a new bottle should. Also the box was ripped open down the side</li>
    <li> Bought this and another product back in June spending triple the price then here and haven&#x27;t seen a difference. Total waste!</li>
    <li> The product goes on my skin with a silky smooth feel. I use it on fine lines around the mouth and nose and have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> Seacret needs to come up with a container that won&#x27;t leak oil on the rest of my toiletries.  Very expensive stuff. Worth it. Hate to see it gumming up stuff I have paid other money for and ending up with 1/4 to 1/3 of the bottle ($20+ worth) now sliming up my suitcase and trying to spot up my travel clothes.  For the money I spend on a bottle of this stuff, I would be silly not to pay more for a leak-proof container and Seacret would be a bunch of fools not to offer it...(I got an automated reply to my input on their Help page: Tell us where you bought it and when and how much you paid...Come on, I&#x27;m not asking for a refund...I just want a container that contains the stuff)</li>
    <li> WASTE of time! Purchased from a friend and used for months and months. Took before and after pics. ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE!</li>
    <li> My skin is important, and using expired products is like taking expired medication. You don&#x27;t know what the effects will be.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will continue to buy when I run out of it.</li>
    <li> My cousin told me about this product and just raved on and on about it so I tried it to give it a fair shake. I can&#x27;t honestly say that I noticed anything significant. Of course, I have been using extra virgin olive oil as my make up remover and moisturizer (exclusively) for 12 years now. My skin is already extremely soft, subtle and virtually wrinkle-free. Perhaps, if I had problem skin I would have noticed something. But - for the price and performance - I think I&#x27;ll stick with my olive oil!</li>
    <li> Great product everything I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Best price for this product!</li>
    <li> I am using this with a demaroller and I love the feel for the serum.  It&#x27;s EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> I still have not even received the product .  I can&#x27;t review.  Please help me get the product from the company</li>
    <li> (I actually purchased this product, with others, from a kiosk in my local mall.  If you buy Seacret skincare, please take my advice and buy it online instead-the prices are much more reasonable.  I think they charged me over $100 at their mall location-I really should have checked online first, but I got suckered in by the salesperson&#x27;s schpiel. Derp.  Plus, the kiosks will not accept returns, even if you haven&#x27;t opened the product-the one I went to had no signs or anything advertising this policy-it was in tiny print at the bottom of the sales receipt, which of course you aren&#x27;t given until the sale is complete. Go ahead and laugh-it definitely wasn&#x27;t the brightest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  Lesson learned.)  Now, the review:&lt;br /&gt;This serum was verrrrrrry expensive, and has done nothing at all to justify its price, except break me out for the first time in twenty years.  It has also clogged my pores, and milia have cropped up in some spots.  I am not foolish enough to believe the claims that the salesperson made that this product line replaces things like Juvederm and Botox-nothing topical is going to get rid of wrinkles and lines-but my usual skincare brand softens any fine lines quite a bit, and brightens and evens my skin tone, and this does none of those things.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel hydrated, or anything but greasy after using this.  The one thing I liked about it is that it is fairly lightweight, so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long for it to absorb, but other than that, there is really nothing special about this serum.  Once again, I will say that I have had similar results from drugstore products.  Save you money!</li>
    <li> Packaging is different than the photo. Feels very smooth on the skin but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really making a difference or not. Prefer the vitamin rich moisturizer and eye cream more.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> much of my expensive moisturizing products are large. i travel a lot and the seacret products are good. they come in small size containers so they are easy for the road and priced right.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly.  I have value for what I paid for.  I like the product itself, and have found not other product to give me the results I have been given with this.</li>
    <li> this product is very different, makes you skin feel silky smooth and I have noticed that combined with the moisturiser fine lines are disappearing. nothing ever game me results before.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product at an excellent price.  I have tried many products for smooth, vibrant skin and this is the best I have found.</li>
