<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Every but as sharp as I hoped!  They come in a great box to store and the seller even wrote an email on how to care for them!</li>
    <li> Not at all good couldn&#x27;t even pick a hair out.</li>
    <li> Best pair of tweezers I have ever owned. Love them. I have been tweezing for about 30 years, so I know tweezers very well. I would definitely recommend these. I love the case it comes in and the plastic tip protector. It really keeps them staight and they don&#x27;t get bent or dull being thrown around in my makeup case. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Being a guy and never having eyebrows done, I will tell you it hurts but worth it! Now my eyebrows are on fleek! Haha</li>
    <li> These tweezers are really pointy and you can pluck hair that with normal tweezers you cant. Be aware not to hurt your self, until you get accustomed to the precision of the tweezers. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I just wanted to get some tweezers that could remove some hairs in between my eyebrows. This did exactly that with as minimal pain as possible. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers I&#x27;ve owned. I have black course hair and after 40 starting getting chin hair. I also have unruly eyebrows that I shape. These tweezers are fantastic! They grab even the smallest hairs and don&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> The one positive thing that I can say about the Crave Precisio Tweezers is that the packaging is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the negatives: I have been using tweezers to shape my eyebrows for the past 20 years, and I know what I am doing very well. Now, as much as I wanted them to work, I tried and tried to get these tweezers to pull out a single hair from my eyebrows, and they just would not grip the hair. It is as if the hair slide right through them. So, I tried a different hair... same thing.  I kept this up for about 5 minutes before calling it quits. Maybe I just received a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34;, since as you can see there are many, many, glowing reviews. I don&#x27;t know, but I will warn you that I do NOT recommend these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> The quality is worth the few extra dollars.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to spend this much on a pair of tweezers, but after using them for the last month, it was worth it.  They do really well at grabbing those fine chin hairs that we all hate as we get older.  I have bought cheapo tweezers at the dollar store, as well as more expensive drug store tweezers.  It&#x27;s always hit or miss.  This was a hit.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers, grips very well compare to cheaper made in china or drugstore ones. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of tweezers and these are NO better than what you can get in the drug store. They don&#x27;t even work as good as the ones I have gotten at the drug store.  :-(    As of 12/20/14 I have a NEW review on this product. The company emailed me as to my complaint and sent me another pair of Tweezers and they work GREAT, I guess the other pair were just what they call a LEMON.  I just wanted to be fair and report the NEW pair work VERY well and it certainly was nice of the company to take such interest in their customers satisfaction with their product. Restored my faith in this company. I hope you give them a try!</li>
    <li> Love these...  well worth the money.. you would have to use them to under stand... They don&#x27;t compare to any other I have used</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve used--worth the money!</li>
    <li> This item is all that it is advertised to be.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work really well. They grip errant hairs really well. They are a major step up from any tweezer I have ever used. They totally feel worth the price. I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good tweezers, but does not get those fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Love my tweezers - definitely worth paying a few extra dollars for a good pair!</li>
    <li> Superb quality and finish - very precise point.  Nice packaging, and awesome value.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever!  Quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for nice tweezers for 2 years and these fit the bill.  Great!</li>
    <li> Do not grab hair. You are better off using your fingers...</li>
    <li> This is the best tweezers I have purchased in my long life. It is very sharp and the hairs come out on first try.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Better than most but not as &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; as what I was expecting from other reviews.  I have one pair that I&#x27;ve had for years that I love immensely, but thought I had lost them, so ordered these.  They tend to break off the hair or pinch the skin instead of &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; them....although some do okay.  Operator error?  I don&#x27;t have these issues with my other pair, so to me it&#x27;s the tweezers.  That said, the are better than many others I&#x27;ve bought that don&#x27;t seem to be able to grab hair at all, so if something does ever happen to the pair I found (yay!), then I do have these to fall back on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be particularly excited about tweezers for tweezin&#x27; body hair, but these tweezers work really well. They grip the hair well without a lot of effort. They look like a quality instrument, and they come in a handy storage case to protect them. I&#x27;m sure you could use the tweezers for all sorts of applications. I like that they are stainless steel so clean up is easier.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 due to ratings. Not a one would grab fine hairs. What a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! The &#x27;Rolls Royce&#x27; of tweezers. Great product. Great feel. I am going to love these things. They are much better than those cheap things I am replacing. I thought twice about the price, but well, I am glad I paid a little more. The quality is worth it.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Purchase for good reviews, not worth a darn... Stick with tweezerman</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve had :(</li>
    <li> i really thought these were going to work great after reading the reviews but they are actually worse then the ones i have now that i paid 4 dollars for. they do not get ingrown hair or any other facial hair except really thick hair. eyebrows.</li>
    <li> My BF &#x27;accidentally&#x27; threw away my best tweezers, which I so missed. These tweezers are EVEN BETTER!!!  And the company is superb! Advice, follow up, AND a great product to boot. Some BFs have no idea how important a great pair of tweezers is to a woman.  This company GETS IT!!! Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> These are honestly the best tweezers I have ever owned. I have been able to get the tiniest hairs without no problem and without pinching my skin. They come in a a very cute packaging that keep them nice and very safe.</li>
    <li> I really love these Precisio Tweezers by Crave Naturals. I was so thrilled to complimentary try them out to see would there be a difference between these and your average pair from a dollar store tweezers. I love the fact that they have weight to them because it helps you to grip and hold on. I use these for a lot of different things. I use them for plucking stray hairs along my face, for shaping up my brows, for placing my false lashes, and also for blackhead removal. The Precisio Tweezers are very easy to sanitize and cleanses. It also comes with a very nice and sturdy storage to place your tweezers in. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome, not to mention the precision.  I can truly say this company takes pride in their product as it works well and the packaging is perfect.</li>
    <li> So good, I actually tweeze my eyebrows.  lol.  Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Orders of magnitude better than any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned -- and that&#x27;s a fair number as I&#x27;m in my 70s.  Buy these, you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> I have been reading the reviews for these tweezers and I can&#x27;t add a thing.  They are terrific.  My daughter reviewed them for the manufacturer and, when I read the super review, I asked her about them.  She assured me that I would not find a better pair of tweezers and so I bought them.  Boy, was she right!!  Best I&#x27;ve every used!!  Don&#x27;t even hesitate - go ahead and buy them.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Not only are they effective on eyebrows, they work with the fine chin hairs.</li>
    <li> They do not grasp my facial hair very well and the tips of the tweezers are sharp! Not my favorite pair.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who would choose tweezers as one of three items to take to a deserted island. It is a must for me. I was enthusiastic about trying these tweezers out. First off, they come in a cute box, and have a plastic container to store the tweezers. The tweezers are black, which is my fav...they look great. On top of that, they are not flimsy. As far as tweezers, they get the job done. I can pluck single hairs without a hassle. These are a new favorite.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great! They grab hairs even if they are just surfacing. It came in a very cute tube that I can display when stored.</li>
    <li> Product arrive packaged well. Good quality. Precise. A bit sharp so be cautious when using. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy. A little expensive.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. Gets the small ones hiding and I definitely love the black and white case it comes with. I needed some new ones and these replaced my old ones better than I thought it would. For the price it is great.</li>
    <li> Finally a tweezer that works. Yes, they are sharp and accurate so use a magnifier if you need one. I didn&#x27;t pinch anything and had no problem with it. I wish I had bought a lifetime supply of these. I hate those flimsy cheap ones that don&#x27;t hit their mark the first time.</li>
    <li> These tweezers actually grab all size hairs. Best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> nice product, not as sharp as I would&#x27;ve liked. Was somehow expecting this to perform better than another pair I&#x27;ve had for over 2 years but so far just ok.</li>
    <li> Love love my new tweezers</li>
    <li> Tweezers work great. They get the smallest of hairs.</li>
    <li> I thought these are good pair of tweezers at first, but these just don&#x27;t grab thin fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Really good tweezers very flat and pointy! My husband loves them as well!! We&#x27;re always trying to find some that will stay flat and not open with time and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> have two, house and camping, real nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite by far. I love these, cant picture my life without them LOL</li>
    <li> Quality product. Exceptional results. Packaging provides protection for product under all conditions.</li>
    <li> I love my new tweezers! Works really well and easily grabs little stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy pair of tweezers!  These don&#x27;t have a very narrow tip, so getting out things like splinters is more challenging.  However, for eyebrows they work like a charm!</li>
    <li> These tweezers come in a protective case, with user-friendly instructions and they also work just great!  And the seller sends a nice message about how to keep them sharp and aligned.  Very professional and precise.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Grabs whatever you want to tweeze and plucks it right out. Finished plucking my eyebrows in minutes, with a lot less pain.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM!!! They are thin enough to grasp all those hard to get hairs and the fact that they arrived in a carry case is a Bonus b/c now I don&#x27;t have to worry about loosing them.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers I just got them today and plucked my eyebrows and my sisters eyebrows</li>
    <li> Very happy with my tweezers! Tweezers are sharp :-)</li>
    <li> These tweezers by crave naturals have to be one of my favorite tweezers because I only need one tool to get the job done. These slanted tweezers get those stubborn hairs, thin hairs, and the hairs that broke off at the bottom. What I do is put the more slanted side of the tweezer near the base of the hair and pull it in the direction the hair is going. When you pull out your hairs from the roots with this tweezer you are more likely to get the root out as while. The tweezer is not slippery on the handle so you won&#x27;t loose your grip. I personally feel like this one tool does the other of the flat and pointed tweezers. Let&#x27;s talk about the packaging because it is very cute and will keep your tweezer safe. Also there is a plastic tube that you can put in your bag or purse to take on the go and since it is in the tube it won&#x27;t poke you. Also there is a silicone piece that covers the tweezers as a safe precaution so you won&#x27;t poke your self. I got this tweezer free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> This is a super strong tweezer and comes in a beautiful packaging.</li>
    <li> Placed my order on a Saturday and received my order on Monday!!! This was my first time purchasing this tweezer and I&#x27;m in love! Works perfect!</li>
    <li> They do the job but not really that sharp. I have cheaper ones that work better.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers!!</li>
    <li> The absolutely best tweezers I have ever owned. They get the job done without any problems. Will purchase another pair in the near future.</li>
    <li> This tweezers are good enough for coarse hairs, long enough to be grabbed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately they do not work properly with thin hairs which are just out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The package is ok, but this tweezers don&#x27;t work with every type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The main problem is that the tip is just flat, while professional tweezers have a curved V-shape tip to grab all type of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea, the portable tweezers included in the Leatherman STYLE® PS are way better for removing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, NOT SUGGESTED FOR thin or short hair removal.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best. Nice sturdy construction and serious precision for a very fair price. I&#x27;m impressed and really grateful. Been struggling with multiple other brands that definitely don&#x27;t have the same quality and many higher prices. Well done, guys! Thanks for the excellent product!</li>
    <li> Very precise, i love it. The quality is perfect and its so worth the price that i paid for...Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I have another pair of tweezer that I purchased at Ulta, that cost me nearly $15.00. I decided to give these a try. The Crave Naturals Precisio Tweezers are not as thin as my other tweezers, but they still manage to get every single hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Solid tweezers. Plus they come with a lifetime warranty, which means I&#x27;ll never have to worry about buying another tweezer again! They also e-mailed me with tips on how to take care of the tweezers, so that was nice and useful. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I love them .... Great quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and need a pair of tweezers for any unwanted eyebrows hair. This one is a great quilty I&#x27;m happy i got them</li>
    <li> these are awesome, I got them for my eyebrows and am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Comes in small tube with protective mini-sleeve to protect super sharp tips. Shipping even faster than expected. Would buy again! Also received a 25% off promo code for a future purchase from Crave Naturals through Amazon! I really like the customer service too!</li>
    <li> I have bushy eyebrows, which means constant tweezing, plucking, waxing, threading. These services are extremely expensive! For less than the price of a typical eyebrow wax, you can receive Precisio Tweezers. Plus, if you have Amazon Prime, shipping is free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these tweezers were great. I have sensitive skin and they did not hurt my eye area or create any redness. They did a great job of picking up the unwanted hair while not disturbing the rest of my brows. I think the word “precision” absolutely describes these.</li>
    <li> I think these tweezers work really well. I was able to pluck out unwanted hairs without a lot of pain. It has a sharp end on the tweezers if you need to get something out of your skin. You can use them for splinters to. We haven&#x27;t had any of those at our house for awhile though. I love that it comes with a case to keep them protected, sanitary purposes, and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> These are great! They grab all those hard to get hairs! They are really sharp though</li>
    <li> The tweezers are not extraordinary.  I bought the tweezers based on description and reviews.  I found that drugstore tweezers are just as effective as these tweezers: maybe better.  I would not recommend them to friends.  The design is attractive, but the use is average.</li>
    <li> These are not the cheap tweezers you get from the drugstore. They meet up perfectly at the end and easily pull the hair you are trying to pull. They also come in a little tube to keep them stored nicely. I still think they are a little much to spend on tweezers, but it&#x27;s better to buy one nice pair for a little more money than a bunch of cheap tweezers that never really work the way you want them to.</li>
    <li> &amp;#62;&amp;#62;Uses: I really like these tweezers but let me tell you why. They are so easy to grip and they don&#x27;t slid in my hand. They are so precise in removing hair. I personally used these to pluck my eye brows and I really liked how they worked. They don&#x27;t pinch your skin. Obviously you can use these tweezers for what ever you like :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed on my blog:&lt;br /&gt;https://wordpress.com/post/80533465/157/</li>
    <li> This is an ok product.  I&#x27;ve had a Tweezerman for years but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  It&#x27;s not much different, and it actually doesn&#x27;t grab those pesky, short hairs too well.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me. :)  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a decent pair of tweezers and comparable to Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> These tweezers were ok. I still had to sharpen them a little. Overall you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This is a great pair of tweezers, they are very sturdy and work very well even on the littlest brow pieces. The control is great, they have great alignment. You don&#x27;t have to worry about pinching your skin with these as the slanted tip help to prevent that. the packaging is super cute, for gift or stocking stuffers. they are very sturdy and well made, heavier than your regular tweezers that I have ever used in the past. I would definitely recommend these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had received these for my review purposes. All opinions are 100% my own unbiased thoughts.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do a good job of reaching hard to get hairs.</li>
    <li> I like them! They need to be a bit sharper though, I had trouble getting the little hairs on my eyebrows. Overall they are just another pair of tweezers that get the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about a month and they were great at first, but are already losing their ability to grip stray hairs.  I prefer Tweezermans.</li>
    <li> they are great!!! never had a idea how well good tweezers work!!!! Thinking about getting another set for backup!!!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! very sharp and does the job! i would recommend these to friends.</li>
    <li> It works but the black coating and the finish of inside tip faces are low quality. It is little bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Good quality - best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;m in my 7th decade). Like the follow-up with hints. Nice company, customer oriented.</li>
    <li> These are amazing tweezers!  They work wonderfully, I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I ordered for my husband. This was fast shipping and the product it very good! would def. buy again, thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the tweezers-does the job!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love them. Gets ahold of even the smallest of hairs!</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to use these tweezers as my eyebrows take forever to grow in, but when they finally did, I am glad that these tweezers easily plucked out my fine hair. They&#x27;re easy to press together with no effort and the sharp angle picks and grabs hair easily. I&#x27;m glad I got these at an awesome price. I definitely like them better than my revlon and tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> The feel of this in my hand is nice. I got it for a great deal which makes it even nicer.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you I have been looking for a good pair of tweezers for years now....look no more! These are amazing! They pluck the hair instantly and are really durable. I&#x27;m so excited that I don&#x27;t have to spend any more money on worthless tweezers! These are the real deal!</li>
    <li> Works well, just wished it were a bit sharper.</li>
    <li> They are NOT that great. You have to move the tip back and forth to find the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; that will grab. This is frustrating.  Also pulling &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; is sorely lacking. They just do not grab and hold.  You have to try multiple times on everything except the lightest held hair.  I would just love to find a pair of decent tweezers that work across the hole tip for under, say $20.  But, these are better than the ones in the stores for just a few bucks. Now ordered second pair. $11 and they cannot make a pair of tweezers that work? This pair is even worse. Tip came bent. Sent back. Avoid!</li>
    <li> Omg! I thought the tweezers I previously owned were good,but these tweezers are brilliant! They get the job done without having to go back to tweeze hair again. They are very sturdy and are worth the price!</li>
    <li> These are good tweezers they have a good grip so its easy and faster to pull out hairs.</li>
    <li> I can say that these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve had so far! They are a little bit on the heavier side compared to others I&#x27;ve owned, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with these!</li>
    <li> It was thrilled to try these tweezers. I love the packaging &amp; I was pleasantly surprised to see a 25% coupon included for a future purchase. They arrived as scheduled on time. My only discrepancy would be that they seemed a little dull but still work pretty well. All in all I was pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are good but they don&#x27;t get every hair. I thought they would be sharper. Good for the price. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> So I have been using my tweezers for about a week to see how I like them and so far it is pretty good! I love the small container they come in that keeps them clean! I was hesitant at first to use them, but they work well. I wish they could be a little bit sharper to get those tiny hairs, but other than that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE these tweezers! The angle is perfect for singling out those brows :) I&#x27;ve had them for several months, and they have yet to dull, they are great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Tweezer is made of good material and it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! Thought I was getting a small size tweezers but they are full size. It&#x27;s nice and sharp gets all the tiny eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> My husband always ruins my tweezers by using them for things around the house. Finally I got a new pair for myself and these work great! Gets all the fine little hair with 1 pull without spending $40 for some name brand tweezers.</li>
    <li> I ordered these about two weeks ago and received them about a week after that. I have very thick dark hair so it&#x27;s necessary I always have a good pair of tweezers because I have yet to have a day of life where a stray hair didn&#x27;t need to be plucked or pulled. I was skeptical about buying these but since I value the reviews I figured id give them a shot. First off I love the compact &amp; clear black top and bottom carrying tube, definitely make it easy to spot them in my messy makeup draw. They are light weight but sturdy, ( also very sharp so be careful) and have a nice smooth black finish which makes them comfortable to hold. I was able to not only pluck the thick dark hairs with these  but also the thin light ones. I was even able to the roots that my old tweezers almost always missed or caused me to knick myself. Since these come with a lifetime guarantee you also can&#x27;t really go wrong. Personally for the price, quality, and quickness of shipping I can&#x27;t see why anyone wouldn&#x27;t give these a try.</li>
    <li> Paying 15 dollars for tweezers, I expected something a bit better. A few months into having these, I have consistently gotten the same result. The tweezers will pluck most hairs well, but simply cuts like scissors at times and leaves really short stubble. On the plus side, they come in a very nice little case and they look nice.</li>
    <li> I tried to use these as I normally would. Initially they worked OK, but the grip did not last.  I much prefer Mr Tweezerman products.</li>
    <li> This is exactly we were looking for and now we are very happy.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers ever!! I even bought a pair for my daughter. I Love them!! :)</li>
    <li> Much more effective than other brands I have tried.....</li>
    <li> This tweezers works pretty well and it has become my go to pair.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Best tweezers!</li>
    <li> I gave them a 3 because they look great and they aren&#x27;t the worst tweezers that I have ever used... They are also sharp which is quite nice. Problem is I am a wax specialist/licensed cosmetologist and when trying to actually use them I felt that that they weren&#x27;t as effective as other brands like tweezerman. Bought these to save a few bucks and I can sort of tell. Otherwise they look great. If your someone who just likes to pluck a couple hairs from time to time on your eyebrows or wherever then they are great. For professional use I say go with a better brand.</li>
    <li> A good quality product for the price; it was worth paying a little more for this one.</li>
    <li> CRAVE NATURALS have the very best products I have ever used! I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Quality tweezers. The tweezers are able to get the very small hairs. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> By far the best tweezers I have ever owned. They grip even the finest hairs on my lip and eyebrows. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers!  It was so easy to get all of the fine hairs that I always struggled with!  And I am in love with the packaging.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for them to be sharper. I sharpened them myself and they work much better. EDIT- Tamara from customer service reached out to send me a new pair becuase the first was NOT sharp and didn&#x27;t do the trick.  I recieved a second pair and I LOVE them! They are super sharp and grab even the finest hairs. They are my new favorite pair. Kudos on your great customer service and making a great product!  Thank you again!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, precise, sharp. Good tweezer</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price.  I purchased one and after trying them, bought four more for other people.</li>
    <li> Terrific tweezers; an amazing step up from cheap drugstore tweezers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to my old tweezers for 10+ years where the sharpest point was at the elevated part of the slant. These seem to be sharpest at the inferior portion of the slate - just takes getting used to. They work great I&#x27;m able to grab very fine and very short hairs. Woohoo!</li>
    <li> It slips right off of the hairs I&#x27;m trying to pluck. I can pinch the hair with the tips and it still won&#x27;t pluck the hair when I pull my hand back. Are these designed for some other use?</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Comes packaged cute, and arrives quickly. Gets those little hairs that take constant pulling with other tweezers out in just one try. Relatively painless and just gets the job done with ease. This has replaced my original go to tweezers.</li>
    <li> Around 2010, my son found tweezers this good at Walmart for only $4, however, they are no longer made. I have looked for good tweezers, meaning THIN, FINE, NARROW tips that are so slim they can slide under a sliver. Most all tweezers are made too thick. These are have very fine tips and are worth every penny, though I know they are over priced. Glad to find some that are really sturdy plus very fine and thin.</li>
    <li> It came in a nice package. The tweezers are awesome. It even grabs the tineast hairs. Love it. A must get.</li>
    <li> Love them! Best tweezers i&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
    <li> Love them!! Precision is the key word .. I cleaned up my brows sooo much quicker</li>
    <li> Everyone kept raving about these tweezers which is why I purchased. They aren&#x27;t anything special and now my most hated tweezers cause they don&#x27;t grab like they did when I first got them,  but even then I want impressed.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They feel strong and very sturdy but still capable of gripping the finest eyebrow fuzz. The day my product was supposed to arrive I received an email from Crave Naturals with tips for care and maintenance and how to make them last! How awesome! Their customer service is amazing. I&#x27;d definitely buy from them again if the need ever arises. Thank you Crave Naturals!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have a really good pair of tweezers!</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love these!! Precision, classy look. Perfect little gadget for perfect brows</li>
    <li> Probably the best tweezers I have ever used! Precise, sharp and get even the thinnest of hairs</li>
    <li> These are very nice tweezers and they are great for my purpose of hair removal. My only caution, is that they are so sharp that if you are not  careful, you can actually cut your skin if it gets caught up in the pulling. Used with care, they are very effective and I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This pair of tweezers has a firm grip for pulling facial hair.</li>
    <li> I am writing a second review about the Precisio Tweezers because the company I bought them from(Crave Naturals)sent me an email seeing if I liked them and instructions on how to clean them and keep them safe from damage.Really cool.I am even happier with my purchase.Great tweezers.</li>
    <li> UPDATED:  the company emailed me and asked how I liked these.  I explained my issues with the tweezers and they sent a replacement pair, which work much better! That&#x27;s awesome customer service!!!  I do not like these.  I am used to tweezers that easily grab tiny hairs.  These do not grab and hold onto the tiny hairs very well.  I will go back to my other brand.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great product. Unlike cheap tweezers, They Work! I&#x27;m very happy I bought these.</li>
    <li> I received these Precisio Tweezers recently and yall I&#x27;m really liking them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always feel like the tweezers I get at the store are pretty cheap. They don&#x27;t line up or pinch tightly enough to actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These...they have some nice heft to them. They pinch tightly and are the perfect size for holding comfortably for me.  I&#x27;ve used them a couple times already and really like how they feel and work. Plus they come in the cutest container. I&#x27;m all about the cute so that&#x27;s totally working for me.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging! And tweeZers work great!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They are the best!</li>
    <li> Best one I have for doing husbands eyebrows! Very precise. Will keep in case to keep that way.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I can now throw out the several mediocre tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years that simply are useless.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and i are pleased with this product. Works well. Much better than the cheap stuff from other various stores. Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> From the moment I took these out of the container/box, the black coating began chipping and flaking off. They do not grasp hard enough and there is not enough tension. Just stick to the good old drugstore pair...you will be a lot more pleased with you purchase!</li>
    <li> For years I have been a tweezerman devotee, but I have found my new favorite. These are great at getting even the smallest hairs and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I think they are great.  I feel like they can grab thin blonde hairs without a struggle.</li>
    <li> Purchased these after having a few bad experiences with cheaper models. These are really professional quality and have a great tip. My wife loves them and she insisted that i order a second one for her office. Well packaged in gift-able box.</li>
    <li> Very great quality tweezer!!</li>
    <li> Great packaging! These tweezers are very high quality. Will definitely recommend them to others.  I had to fight off my daughter when she tried to use them because if she did I would NEVER get them back.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these tweezers. Since they are comfortable to use, it is easy to maneuver to get to those tiny brows to get them on point, if you know what I mean. It is a really good quality product and you will not regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Strange product. Does decent job of removing hair but has a rough edge that can bruise skin. Not sure why it&#x27;s not beveled properly.</li>
    <li> i take these with me everywhere! favorite tweezers ever!! I even tell my friends to buy them!</li>
    <li> I have what I not so affectionately call &amp;#34;Chewbacca Brows&amp;#34;. By the time I get home from having them waxed, they have already grown back. Ok, not really, but you get the picture of what I&#x27;m dealing with here. I absolutely LOVE these tweezers. The little case is perfect for my purse to make sure they stay clean. They grab every tiny hair I can see and easily remove it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These are good tweezers for hair removal, but they are not quite as precise as some other tweezers I have used.  Overall a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is not mt favorite tweezer by far. It seems rough when plucking unlike my other tweezers. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. They get the job done.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are alright but honestly nothing special they claim to get the tiny ingrown hairs but I had a pair of Revlon tweezers that worked just as well and were half the price. I do like the packaging I see they have a lifetime warrantee to stay in perfect alignment so that&#x27;s a bonus. I do wish they had better grips they are all metal with nothing to improve gripping. I guess if you can get a new pair relatively easy if they are damaged its worth paying a little extra money I can always find something to put on the metal to improve gripping. All in all alright I guess</li>
    <li> This products works as expected pulling out fine, thin hairs but maybe not always on the first try.</li>
    <li> Love them! They work very well!</li>
    <li> Great product, stylish and functional. Will buy again &amp; recommend!</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as other tweezers I have bought previously.</li>
    <li> Works pretty great. Thanks</li>
    <li> This tweezers are the best! I&#x27;ve tried so many tweezers before from the cheap ones that you can get at the drugstores up to the high end ones that costs a lot but nothing compares to this one. The grip is nice, it is very easy to use and manipulate. It also gets those annoying little hairs.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for tweezers that grip well but don&#x27;t clip the hair. These work very well and will grip hair without breaking almost always. Have been using it for several months without much problem. Always keep it with the protective rubber tip and plastic case, so that may help keep the tips in good shape.</li>
    <li> They sent me a replacement because the first ones were defective. Great customer service! And great product</li>
    <li> Great tweezers very sharp and precise at getting those hard to get hairs out.</li>
    <li> Love them.  And they work very well very sturdy</li>
    <li> I find the tip to be too thick to see the hair precisely.</li>
    <li> Good grip on hairs, and does an excellent job with in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> Very high-quality tweezers. Would purchase again if I lose or damage these.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these tweezers,  very precise &amp; comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Simply doesn&#x27;t work!  Returned it!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are sharp, almost too sharp. Be careful while using but overall a great product</li>
    <li> i love it! it&#x27;s very easy to use and precise.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezer.  Nice balance &amp; easy to grip.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> One thing you&#x27;ll always find in my makeup case is a pair of tweezers. I use tweezers for shaping my eyebrows and also for plucking those two to three annoying stray hairs that keep regrowing underneath my chin. Many years ago after trying out several pairs, I finally found a pair of tweezers that worked well for me and I&#x27;ve guarded them ever since. However, I was recently given the opportunity to review a pair of Precisio slant tip tweezers from Crave Naturals and I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to give my old tweezers the boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precisio tweezers are professional grade tweezers designed with you in mind. Designed with a precise slanted tip, Precisio tweezers make hair removal simple and pain free by making it easy for you to get close to the root of hairs so there is less pain in hair removal. The ultra-sharp, hand filed tips are perfectly aligned so you get the job done right the first time. They are designed for comfort and easy handling with a matte finish so there is no slippage. Precisio slant tip tweezers come with a lifetime guarantee and are also guaranteed to stay sharp for life and will never require resharpening or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Precisio tweezers to be very comfortable and easy to hold on to. They are not bulky in my opinion. They are perfectly angled and made it easy for me to grab all the short and fine hairs on my brown bone, allowing me to easily reshape my eyebrows. I was able to do this quicker using the Precisio tweezers than I could using my old pair as well. They also easily grabbed those two to three annoying stray hairs underneath my chin. I never once pinched my skin while using these tweezers and it was a painless experience. These high quality surgical grade stainless steel tweezers seem to be very well made and are not just another cheap pair of tweezers. I like the contemporary design as well. I firmly believe that I will never have to buy another pair of tweezers ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I mainly use tweezers for hair removal and keep them in my makeup case, it&#x27;s also great to have a pair handy in first aid kits as they are perfect for tick removal or splinter removal. They come in a sanitary holding case so that they are not damaged or contaminated during storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in order to perform this review. However, no other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.

    <li> I absolutely loved these tweezers!</li>
    <li> Over the past few years I&#x27;ve used a lot of tweezers, and this one is one of the worst.  It&#x27;s super-bulky, too wide, too heavy and NOT sharp enough.    For self use it&#x27;s actually a disaster - it just DOESN&#x27;T work as it should.  If you use it on someone else, it gets a little more comfortable, but still - I bought a much better tweezers for 1/5th the price.    I seriously can&#x27;t believe that this product has a 5 starts rating. It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are nice and sturdy! They are definitely a great buy. The reason they get 3 stars and not 5 is because I find them to be a bit on the heavy end. Also they are a bit hard to push together. I honestly like ergonomic tweezers better, but for regular tweezers I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> These tweezers cannot even grab hairs. Its the most frustrating thing. My four year old tweezers that I was trying to replace work better than this new pair. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with Tweezers! I&#x27;m a little compulsive about plucking my eyebrows because I hate when I have stray hairs but it hurts so I don&#x27;t enjoy doing it! I like to have my eyebrows professionally waxed and plucked to get it over with at once but I really only have the time and money to do it about twice a year to help maintain their shape. In the between times, it&#x27;s me and my tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different kinds but the thing they all seem to have in common is they hurt!  Between the pinching and the poking and sometimes even cutting, it&#x27;s just not a pleasant experience. I was hoping  the Crave Precision tweezers would be different but I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a great first impression with their packaging. Companies that take care in the little things usually do the same with their product itself. The tweezers came in this cute black and white tube with another clear tube inside to protect the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could immediately feel how sharp they were and was a little worried about getting cut and poked. Luckily they did neither. I could feel the sharpness against my skin when I used them but they did not penetrate and break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s such thing as painless plucking but some are definitely more painful than others. These are somewhere in the middle. They are effective  at finding and plucking easily. I have had some where I see the hair but the tweezers won&#x27;t grab them. These do it easily but it is still pretty painful to pull them out. The price  women pay for beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the handle itself and it&#x27;s soft grip that fits comfortably in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crazve Precision Tweezers are in fact precise and a good, quality tweezer. They are more then I&#x27;ve ever paid for tweezers at $14.99 but this is one of those things where you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> These work great - they are black &amp; sleek. Great for touch ups between threading my brows. I love the container it comes in too!</li>
    <li> First, I would like to complement the packaging and the design of the product. It is very classy for its affordable price. I think it could be a perfect gift for bridal showers or for your girl friends. The tweezers is very easy to use, with its easy grip, removing hairs becomes fun. I use it on my eyebrows and armpits(lol). This product is sturdy and because it is stainless steel I won&#x27;t worry about rust. I highly recommended this for you to try. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good tweezer for a while now…and jumped at the chance to review this new item by CRAVE! First of all I LOVE that they have a LIFETIME GUARANTEE… this makes the 19.99 price tag easier to swallow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip is VERY precise! I was able to pull out or “tweeze” my eyebrow hairs very selectively and easily with these tweezers. It only took one tweeze to get a hair…with my old tweezers I usually pull and pull at a hair just to get it to come out! These went in grabbed the hair and out it come… no fussing and crying over hairs still in place! Since they work on getting hairs out the first time there is less pain while tweezing… and the tweezers actually pull the hair out by the root…no more half hairs as I call it (when the tweezer only pulls out part of the hair). BEST OF ALL THEY DO NOT PINCH MY SKIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crave Company GUARANTEES that these tweezers will stay sharp for life (no resharpening or replacement)… I will get back to you on that one…but I am HOPING that the claim is genuine (which I am sure it is!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the design is great…they are comfortable to handle and I like that they have a matte finish so that your fingers can actually grab on to the tweezer without slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course these tweezers can have a dual purpose such as first aid and tick removal. I have yet to take advantage of this option because there has been no need as of yet! However, I think these would be a great addition to any first aid kit. First of all they are made of high quality surgical grade stainless steel and come in a neat little sanitary holding case so that they are not damaged or contaminated during storage; fitting nicely into a first aid kit.</li>
    <li> I thought i had a good pair of tweezers till i bought these Crave Naturals Precisio Tweezers! I love the slanted tip. Makes them more comfortable against the skin. I also love that you don&#x27;t have to squeeze them real hard to grab the hair. No more charlie horses in the hands while tweezing my eyebrows!! They are the most precise tweezer i&#x27;ve used by far, leaving a perfect line along the brow.&lt;br /&gt;I have also found these are perfect to splinters and ingrown hairs as well. With a lifetime guarentee i couldn&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;m very impressed by the storing tube to insure sanitary conditions between uses.&lt;br /&gt;They are very easy to use and feel very comfortable in your hands. They are the perfect size! I love these tweezers and will never go back to those cheap ones that just tug the hair a few times before it finally comes out! These get the hair in just one pull every time! I can&#x27;t wait to try more Crave Naturals products.</li>
    <li> Great product! Got it from a promo on amazon. I would pay full price for this! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers awesome company! Love their products! Tweezers work perfectly! Best tweezers I have had in a long time!</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to receive what once again was a complete SUCCESS!  I love tweezers, I use them for my eyebrows and also for my crafts and nails!  I had bought a pair of tweezers that was the same as these at the end and I was overjoyed!  I could use THESE for my eyebrows and retire the others to crafts and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slant tip is perfection for eyebrow use!  There&#x27;s no struggling with trying to get the hair out, it comes out smoothly and without a lot of effort.  I had my eyebrows shaped by an electrolysis when I was a teen.  So all  I have to do is some maintenance and these tweezers make it a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precisio tweezers will last a lifetime! And I am happy to learn, with all the same accuracy and sharpness as the day I purchased them.  I am so pleased that I&#x27;m buying another pair to go in my dog&#x27;s first aid for tick removal.  I never thought I would see a tick on my beach dog, but some other dog came to our neighborhood and in close contact to my dog and transferred a tick!  So I will have these ready to go should another occurrence take place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precisio  says that &amp;#34;you can try Precisio tweezers risk free. We honor our no hassle lifetime guarantee so if you are not satisfied, contact us and we will give you a full refund or a replacement.&amp;#34;  This makes me value this product so much with a lifetime guarantee like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally these tweezers came in a sanitary container and I keep them in it and on my shelf in the bathroom for easy use!  I am so happy that I was able to try these for free and can guarantee you that I was not encouraged in anyway as to what to write for my review.  My views are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers. I&#x27;ve had some cheap $1-$5 tweezers and they are simply frustrating.&lt;br /&gt; With these tweezers I can pull even the thinest of hairs out even with the root. Highly recommend this product. Plus, they come with a lifetime guarantee</li>
    <li> The Precisio Slant Tip Tweezers by Crave Naturals are an excellent grooming tool. I love the round, recyclable cardboard tube that the tweezers are packaged in with a smaller plastics tube to keep the tweezers clean when stored away.  The tweezers are very well made and well constructed from stainless steel. The slant tip tweezers are able to grasp hair and/or splinters with a precision grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality if these tweezers far exceeds that of your everyday drugstore tweezers. These tweezers are designed for long time use and I highly recommend the Precisio Slant Tip Tweezers for every household.</li>
    <li> Finally a tweezer that works. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received this item through a promotion in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that they&#x27;d be a cheap pair of tweezers that wouldn&#x27;t be able to pluck hair, and I was very pleased to find that the product was the complete opposite of what I thought. I&#x27;ve never tried the Crave brand before this, so their products were new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers came in a cute cardboard tube, with a plastic tube inside. Inside the plastic tube was the tweezers. The packaging kept the product safe and caught my eye. This was the first pair of tweezers that I had seen come in that type of packaging. It was different, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the tweezers you could feel that they had a good quality to them. The sides were thicker, so they couldn&#x27;t be bent or misshaped easily. The tweezers had a bit of weight to it compared to cheaper, lesser quality tweezers. The Crave tweezers seemed more heavy duty. I could tell by looking at the ends that it was made with stainless steel, and the ends lined up perfectly. I have gotten a few in the past that did not line up together, so they couldn&#x27;t pluck or grab a hair for the life of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying out the product, the tweezers grabbed the hair with ease. I made the mistake of plucking a hair off my arm to test it out, since I wasn&#x27;t near a mirror. It grabbed onto the hair easily. It hurt when I pulled the hair out, but that&#x27;s anytime you pull arm hair. I mainly use tweezers to pluck my eyebrows or a few hairs that are longer on my face that bother me. The tweezers grabbed the hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at how well these tweezers worked. Honestly, I think these are the best tweezers I have ever used. Yes, these tweezers are more expensive than the ones you can find at Walmart or Walgreens, but the Crave tweezers are well worth the price. They seem like they could last a long time, and if they don&#x27;t, they have a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> when I got the chance to try out these tweezers I was very excited.  First thing I noticed when it first got here was how adorable the container they came in.  I could think of so many things for this container but unfortunately when it came hubby gave me the tweezers and took the container to carry him toothpicks in.lol so I guess he found a use.&lt;br /&gt;  The tweezers were not only adorable but very well made.  They are very strong and very easy to use.  They really helped me get those little tinny hairs that are usually very hard to get a hold of.  They just grabbed a hold of them and yanked them right out.  There tip was a little sharper and angled so they just grabbed the hairs right away.</li>
    <li> I love the Precisio Professional Grade Tweezers and they are great for getting hard to pull facial hairs . With the slanted tip makes it easier to pull / get to hairs without any trouble . Love them .</li>
    <li> I love the slant tip makes it easier for tweezing, and the size is great for a better grip.  Love the packaging.  Item arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> One thing every first aid kit should have is a pair of tweezers, especially if you have kids because they will at some point in their childhood...get a splinter. It&#x27;s gonna happen. When my daughter was little she would run outside and get splinters in her feet and without a good pair of tweezers, it&#x27;s gonna be hard to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same for men who work with wood, metal shavings and maintenance men. My husband is a maintenance man and does things around the house and sometimes when working with wood, he&#x27;ll get the occasional splinter. Since my old pair of tweezers didn&#x27;t work well at all, I would end up having to take a pair of nail clippers or a needle and dig the splinter out- not fun. Hubby just so happened to get a splinter in the side of his hand while cutting wood with his hand saw and I used this opportunity to use my new tweezers and in less than 5 seconds I had grabbed the offending piece of wood and tugged it out. The tweezers worked really well and held on great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the little tube they came in as I can store them in a first aid bag or in my medicine cabinet and know they won&#x27;t get dirty. This is a really good pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Nice Tweezers. Nothing super special but gets the job done</li>
    <li> Great packaging! love these tweezers! and they make a great gift</li>
    <li> My wife loves them. They are really nice, I actually asked her if I could take them and use them for work. She of course shot me down, I believe I will have to order some for myself to take to work.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved everything about these tweezers.  For starters, I&#x27;m a chick, so I am all about the packaging.  This packaging is really special and cute!  I love that you have a holder, and then a holder for the holder!  The smaller holder is the perfect size to carry your tweezers, in case you need to take them &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers themselves are really nice and do the job!  I mean, I don&#x27;t know how fancy I can get with this review, the tweezers are well made, they are nice quality tweezers and they do the work you would expect from a good set of tweezers!</li>
    <li> First of all, the packaging is so cute and really stands out. These tweezers work great and have the look and feel of those more expensive brands without the price tag. I would definitely recommends these to my friends who tweeze. I plan on taking good care of these and having them for awhile.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on these Tweezers and that is honestly why I initially purchased them but after using them I got a really, really great deal because I love these Tweezers!! They work great and I love that they come in a tube so that they can be kept it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find them to have the precision of Tweezerman&#x27;s, so I guess I will keep these as a backup.  Of course Tweezerman&#x27;s are a little more expensive, but I think well worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, cuts finer hairs though</li>
    <li> I have tweezers in a similar design and slant that work well, which is why I was excited to try this product. You can never have enough quality tweezers around. The tweezers work well around my eyebrows and are comfortable on my hands. I like how thin and sharp they are. The slant is perfect for grabbing stray eyebrow hairs. It also works on small, hard to grab hairs.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my bathroom in its &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; looking case and no one bothers them. In a home where everything is shared whether you want to or not, these babies are mine! Yay! They are well made and truly do a great job of getting fine hairs and even a splinter out. I don&#x27;t even have to mention how nobody wants to look like Bert from Sesame Street lol ! These are so well made they may be the last pair of tweezers I ever buy! This is a definite must have for body upkeep! This family would buy again....in fact, I maybe should order a few more so the &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34; ghost doesn&#x27;t take them. :)</li>
    <li> These tweezers are pretty awesome! I love the little case they come in as well. Very helpful because I lose tweezers so much. These don&#x27;t pull and tug at hairs, but remove them very smoothly without any issues.</li>
    <li> These have to be the best pair of tweezers I own. I have never been more pleased with tweezers and usually have to replace them because the ones I have purchased didn&#x27;t work right but these, I love these! I was able to get all my tweezing down in half the time it normally takes me because these work so well and I don&#x27;t spend forever trying to grab one little hair.  I absolutely loved the packaging that they came in. It came in a very cute cardboard tube and inside the tube there is a plastic tube and care instructions. One of the perks is that they come with a lifetime guarantee. The are about 3.5&amp;#34; long. Black and stainless steel with a hand sharpened slant tip. They are a little heavier than you regular store bought tweezers but easy to hold and easy to use. I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These were packaged well. They arrived quickly and seller was contacting me to make sure everything was fine. Excellent service and the product works great much better than a 6-10 dollar pair that I would usually buy. They are a little sharp so be careful but they grab the hair on the first try no messing around chasing it. Thank you for allowing me to test these tweezers for you, I would for sure recommend Crave tweezers to all to do eyebrows or pull a sliver out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon, or if all the 5-star reviews on here are phonies, but the tweezers I received just flat-out don&#x27;t work; they won&#x27;t grab. They don&#x27;t even work as good as the tweezers I&#x27;m trying to replace! Returning them.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, comparable to expensive brands!</li>
    <li> I was in need of some new tweezers and these had such good reviews that I decided to give them a try. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in them. The ends of the tweezers are very thick which makes it hard to get underneath small hairs to grasp them. They also would not pull out any hairs I attempted to pluck. The only positive think about them is that they do come nicely packaged. Any way, I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective pair or not, but these are being returned for a refund, and I&#x27;ll continue my search elsewhere for a new pair.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fine, because they&#x27;re tweezers, and pretty much all tweezers are fine. They&#x27;re not really $13 worth of fineness, and although it says they&#x27;re LIFETIME GUARANTEE SUPER AWESOME GREAT JOB tweezers, they still miss little hairs, and I find myself double-tweezing areas, which isn&#x27;t very fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were I you, I&#x27;d save my cash, haul my tookus down to the Kroger, and get a store brand pair of tweezers. They won&#x27;t have a fancy name or fancy tube packaging, but they&#x27;ll be equally just fine for half the price.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers and the company, Crave Naturals, has the best customer service!!!  They immediately follow up via email to make sure you are happy with the product and their service!  That&#x27;s unheard of these days...especially during the holidays!  I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> Finally great tweezers that really work.  They hold onto the finest hairs, great for tweezing brows or for first aid. They come in a cute case so they are a nice little gift or stocking stuffer, and the company sends a great customer service e mail right away, so they are responsible and nice to do business with. I would definitely buy these again</li>
    <li> I never knew I could get so excited about tweezers but these are amazing!!</li>
    <li> perfectly aligned and fitted</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers as a promotion to try out, I was expecing an adverage pair of tweezers. I was surprised when i opewned these up. They come in a nice case and they feel so nice.The design is great and is made with surgical grade stainless steel These are not your adverage tweezers. I tried them out and love them!. They work so well and have a lifetime warrentee too. I would never need to buy a new paid again! I will be sure to tell all of my freinds about these, Thanks!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a tweezers snob!  I keep tweezers everywhere!  I buy tweezers for other people!  There, I&#x27;ve said it! These tweezers are top notch.  The tips are precise.  The handle is a shiny black.  The packaging is adorable.  Really one would only need add some ribbon to give these as a gift, the packaging is that chic. I recommend these tweezers to family and friends.  Vicki</li>
    <li> I love this twizzer works great. I love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers as part of a product review.  I was very pleased with the construction of the product.  They are able to grip the hair tightly so that you only have tug lightly to remove it.  It is a nice quality product that will last a lifetime.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great.  Crave Naturals provided excellent service too</li>
    <li> Great quality tweezers and fantastic customer service from Crave Naturals.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, easy to use and works well. Thank you. :)</li>
    <li> Nice packaging and  a good set of tweezers</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great! They are comfortable to hold, have a broad slanted tip, and work great! I&#x27;ve been having trouble using my normal tweezers, and since I&#x27;ve bought these, I haven&#x27;t missed a single hair! I think they will also be great to remove a splinter. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s heavy and at times awkward to use</li>
    <li> Very good quality! Delivered on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Works really well.</li>
    <li> loved the packaging! the tweezers are a little heavier than what I am used to, but love them!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, but the tweezers themselves are nearly worthless.  Everything about these seem fine -- but they do not grip onto hair like any other tweezer I&#x27;ve owned does.  I can&#x27;t for the life of me pull out a single hair with these... and they do not appear bent or damaged in any way.  The box was nice, and if you need tweezers for something less precise than pulling hairs this may be a good bargain.  However for most, I&#x27;d say stay away.</li>
    <li> After all of the smashing reviews I was expecting the moon.  Grossly disappointed instead.  My cheap Revlon tweezers top these hands down.  I couldn&#x27;t grip any hair for brow shaping, the hair just slipped through the prongs.  When I finally did grip a hair the tweezer snapped or cut the hair in two.  The packaging was phenomenal, the tweezer looks beautiful, it just doesn&#x27;t work.  The seller seems really solicitous that I have a good experience and I appreciate that, but I won&#x27;t be pressured into leaving a positive review for a crummy product.  I have sent my tweezers back but wanted others to know an honest opinion on the product.</li>
    <li> Well made and sharp as hell. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased cheap tweezers but this time I decided to spend a little more money.  It was well worth it.  These are the best that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Love them... They are a great quality and no gaps on the blads so NO missed hairs when tweezing.. LOVE how precise they are..  Will be using these for a very long time... Uni-brows beware.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, maybe the best tweezers I have had. Fast delivery, highly professional service. Good value.</li>
    <li> The worst tweezers ever.... I bought the item because of the good reviews, but I can say that Tweezerman are much, much better. They are not worth the price, definitely.</li>
    <li> So, these are tweezers... If you&#x27;re in the market for some new tweezers, these would probably work.  They were sharp, now they&#x27;re not.  They did arrive in a fancy tube though, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is not very useful as an underwater air storage container or as a casing for a homemade M-80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I never knew what great tweezers was until I order these these tweezers are the best that I have ever had in the world and I love them and I will most definitely order me another one</li>
    <li> These tweezers didn&#x27;t work for me. Every time I try to pluck my eye brows they cut the hair instead of grab the hair so that I can pulled it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever buy on a whim, nor do I leave reviews without fully using a product. I have used this particular brand of tweezers several times now. I&#x27;ve tossed it in my purse, my makeup bag, accidentally dropped it a few times, and more. I have a busy lifestyle and several of my makeup tools simply don&#x27;t make it for very long (whether due to being misplaced or....on most occasions, breaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am a tough person to impress but these tweezers are definitely worth the money. This is one sturdy cosmetic tool. I AM impressed.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said she wouldn&#x27;t use them on her eyebrows and that she much prefers the feel and sharpness of her Tweezerman tweezers. They work just fine for me, however!</li>
    <li> Found a new favorite cosmetic tool! When it arrived it was nicely packaged in a sanitary storage case. The tension on these tweezers and the filed tips is what makes this a favorite for me. It is easy to use for removing unwanted hairs from brows and face. It also is backed by a lifetime guarantee and if not satisfied they will give refund or replacement; how cool is that! Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Doesn&#x27;t grip anything well.  Very dissatisfied.  Should have bought Tweezerman.  Want a refund.</li>
    <li> Bought this with a discounted price for a review. It was ok. The tip is thick so it doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair all the way out. I gave it to my boyfriend and he liked it. The tweezer itself is a nice size and wont pop out of your hand when you&#x27;re tweezing away.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Works great. The tweezers grip hair so well, much better than my previous pair.</li>
    <li> High quality tweezers and fabulous packaging. It is definitely sturdy, however the tip seems to be dull as it does not grip small (not tiny) hairs on my brows as another tweezer I own. I had to pull few of the same hair twice or even more.</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers to review. I absolutely love them. The tweezers are made well and sturdy. The ends are easy to push together and meet perfectly. They do pull out those stray hairs easily and grab well. The packaging was great. I love that they had the tweezers closed with a cap. I reuse the cap every time.</li>
    <li> So I have purchase all brands on tweezers.. From the highest end of tweezer makers and these live up to allll those brands. Great, Precise and overall a wonderful product and purchase.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly, not much else you can say about tweezers!</li>
    <li> comes in a great package... for long term keeping of the Tweezers... style and quality is excellent... great product</li>
    <li> I honestly can say I was somewhat skeptical about a pair of tweezers being better than any other tweezers. I mean, after all they are designed to pull or grip small things from hair to splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precisio Tweezers convinced me otherwise. The edge on these tweezers are razor thin and straight, unlike other tweezers which seem like they are made from a poured casting. These tweezers have a hand ground edge that can grip the smallest of items. While I have not have the misfortune of having to yank a splinter yet, I did manage to pull some unsightly exterior ear hair (please...don&#x27;t insert these things into your ears). I was able to get a good grip and with a slight tug...bingo hair pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these tweezers to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase these for a great deal- $1, and I am so glad I bought them.  I bought these last night- and already have them and tried them.  First of all they come in a plastic tube with a rubber piece to put over the end of the tweezers.  The plastic tube goes into a cardboard tube, black and white as pictured for storage, which I think will be nice to keep them in good condition longer and its cute!  The tweezers themselves are great quality, I was able to pluck my eyebrows easily.  They were able to grab even the tiniest hairs and were easy to grip/hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also astounded to see that there is a lifetime guarantee for these, if they break or need to be replaced you either get a replacement or refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again for gifts or to have an extra pair.</li>
    <li> These are great! Heavy duty, perfectly aligned, and they are precise. I love the look of them, very chic. They grab the hairs the 1st time and pull them out easily and without any pain. The grip on them is great too.  My fingers don&#x27;t slide down as I&#x27;m pinching them together, this was a problem with tweezers in the past as I have oily skin and my fingers would slip or I lose the grip and cant pull the hair out and it would hurt. Fantastic product.  One of my friends was at my house when the package arrived so she got to see the tweezers and she requested I buy her a pair for Christmas. I believe I will be getting more of these to give as stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are one of the best pairs that I could find! They are able to get even the smallest hairs and are a nice size that is easy to grip and handle. They work great for plucking eyebrows and getting out splinters. On the inside of the metal portion, the metal features a wavy pattern which helps tog rip onto the hair and secure it so there is no slipping when you try to pluck it out. It even works great with very fine hair which some tweezers may not be able to grip properly.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work very well.</li>
    <li> After pinching someone&#x27;s eyelid with a cheap pair of tweezers, I decided to find the best pair on the market. I found them. These are perfect, and I&#x27;ll never use another brand!</li>
    <li> these do not have a good grip, and the slant is not well angled</li>
    <li> I bought similar ones about 4 years ago and for some reason they went dull even though I just use them to pluck my eyebrows. Saw these on sale and thought I&#x27;d give them a try. I absolutely love them. They even get the shortest of hairs and pulls them out with just 1 pluck. Not to mention the plastic tube they come in makes it easy to store and I&#x27;m able to grab them when I need them without having to search my drawer.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! They work great!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are top off the line. I live them and would never use anything else!!!</li>
    <li> Tried these tweezers through a promotional offer and very glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, sharp enough and good quality.</li>
    <li> High quality tweezers!</li>
    <li> Just tried my new Precisio slant-tip tweezers for the first time. They seem to be a nice pair of tweezers, not perfectly finished, but still quite good. It seems that designing a slanted tip on an eyebrow tweezers that is sharp enough to tweeze the brow but not too sharp  (which would  harm the skin) is a tricky balancing act. Maybe that&#x27;s the reason most average priced tweezers I&#x27;ve tried turn out to be disappointing- they&#x27;re either too sharp or too dull. The Precisio seems pretty well balanced in this regard. Will it stand the test of time and stay sharp enough to warrant the guarantee that covers it? Based on past experiences I&#x27;ve found that even a seemingly well forged tweezers can turn dull quickly, so I wouldn&#x27;t venture a guess just yet.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly. They are very precise .</li>
    <li> Pretty good but not as perfect as I thought from the description.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s sharp to get those difficult hairs on the eyebrows</li>
    <li> nice tweezers.  Much better quality than what I am used to using.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these! They work great and I like having a case to keep them safe!</li>
    <li> This tweezer seemed imprecise and had poor grip on fine hairs.  I went back to the old one I bought this to replace.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I got the chance to review these tweezers by Crave Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy &amp; do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Top quality tweezers. Great packaging.</li>
    <li> No different than supermarket tweezers. Actually, supermarket tweezers last longer... I received mine in January, and its ALREADY DULL. Cant even pluck a hair off my head if I tried.</li>
    <li> So far, i&#x27;m very pleased with these tweezers. I was a little skeptical because most of the reviewers seemed to have received the product for free. I did not, and can say they work really well. I&#x27;m able to grasp the finest of hairs to pluck!</li>
    <li> Great angle, durability and cool looking!</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of tweezers, and these work the best of all and are extremely well-made. The outside package is attractive (black and white stripes) and the inside plastic container well-designed and handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the tweezers were rubber-tipped. (My skin is unusually sensitive. The average person should have no problem. This is not a quibble with the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crave Naturals sent the order immediately and the item exceeded their description. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! The best I&#x27;ve ever used. And they arrived quickly in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple weeks and I really like them there definitely a lot better then the little small ones you get from Walmart</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why Tweezerman tweezers never worked for me but after purchasing several pairs of crappy tweezers, I found these.  They work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great item, I like the tweezers very much.</li>
    <li> These are great quality and very easy to use. I absolutely love the precision!</li>
    <li> love, love , love these!!  The first thing I noticed was the cute packaging on this!  It would make a great gift!  They are sharp, and extra long.  These are the type of tweezers you hide in your drawers so your teenage daughter doesn&#x27;t find them.  LOL  Best pair of tweezers I have ever had!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are wonderful.  They are a little longer than most tweezers which makes them so much easier to use.  They come packaged in a clear protecive tube as well as a nice cardboard tube that make them great for gift giving. Would make a great stocking stuffer.  High quality product for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought some of these tweezers for myself, and to use for Christmas as stocking stuffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, the packaging is awesome and perfect for anyone who travels. I keep mine in my purse to have on hand whenever I may need them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Easily grasps the finest hairs of the body, including the invisible, tiny blackhead hairs on nose; and when you grasp and pull over the blackhead, the visible blackhead comes out with the tiny hair. Built solid; not likely to lose its grasping power over the years. It&#x27;s sharp enough to dig splinters out too. Comes with a 25% coupon for additional purchases of Crave Naturals products through Amazon; I ordered a second pair of tweezers for travel kit. Even without the coupon, the price is 35% less than quality-name brand at CVS; performance is better.</li>
    <li> These are great, stylish little case and they work great.</li>
    <li> What a great pair of Tweezers. They are so comfortable holding in my hands and they get my eyebrows perfect. I know alot of us women have many tweezers but these are amazing!! Not only are they beautiful,stylish and easy to use but they get every lil fine hair on my eyebrows.  Great Product and great quality these lil beauties are. I am so in love with them i just told my daughter who is a make up artist about them.. I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these tweezers, but I just couldn&#x27;t!  They break more hair then they actually pull out.</li>
    <li> not as good as excepted</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fantastic! Watch out though, they are sharp! I had another pair (a different kind) that were my favorite before these. These surpass the others by far.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I don&#x27;t have to spend a million years trying to pull out  hair. A must have for your beauty box.</li>
    <li> Great Packaging! Comes in a cute little tubular package and inside the tube is another clear tube that the tweezers are in. Which is great, because it keeps the tweezers from being damaged, plus you have a storage container to place them in.  Perfect size to throw in your first aid kit, makeup bag, or in your purse. These are professional quality tweezers, you can tell by not only attention to detail in packaging, but the feel and the sharpness of the tweezers.  The tips are perfectly angled to help you get those little hairs that my other tweezers just couldn’t grasp.  Plus the tweezers come with a lifetime guarantee, can’t say that my other tweezers offer that.</li>
    <li> Received the tweezers exactly as described by seller.  They are very precise and I find that the clear tube is useful for storage &amp; travel.  Remember, you get what you pay for.  With that being said, I&#x27;d definitely recommended this product!</li>
    <li> These tweezers arrived in new packaging, which even had the label &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; on it, but the tweezers themselves were CLEARLY old and used. The handles are extremely scratched and etched, and the tips of the tweezers do not line up together correctly and cannot even grab a strand of hair.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Seller sent me a second pair.  It seems the first may have had an alignment issue.  The second pair are great - best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very good quality!!! Best for eyebrows!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the tweezers. They are so cute and useful.  Buy several for gifts!</li>
    <li> These were packaged impressively, but they couldn&#x27;t manage to coax a single eyebrow hair out of my face. I don&#x27;t understand what other people have used them for so successfully, but they were the worst tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used on my eyebrows. I returned them.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are good, but not great.  I purchased some Tweezerman brand tweezers and they work better for me.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers.  I got the black one but the finish on this is poor, not a good quality paint &amp; seal job otherwise I really do like these tweezers.  I really great price too</li>
    <li> These tweezers works very well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent to have a good set of tweezers! My hand was getting cramp from garbage grocery store tweezers. I&#x27;m a guy so I&#x27;m not into eye brows but pesky hard to grab whiskers or earlobe hairs are first grab sucess</li>
    <li> Good control and very precise for those fine evasive hairs. Also, they are inexpensive compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer for my girlfriend, who honestly did not find it much better than her few years old $6 tweezer ($4 with discount). HOWEVER, Crave Naturals as a company means it when they advertise a &amp;#34;lifetime guarantee.&amp;#34; Their customer service is both outstanding and understanding, and accommodated any questions/concerns we had. From my experience with them, there really is no reason not to try this pair of tweezers at all, regardless that they weren&#x27;t the best for us (your mileage will vary, obviously).</li>
    <li> Great tweezers -- very precise and easy to hold.  The size is perfect to carry with me in my purse.  It appears that the tweezers are made well and will hold up well.</li>
    <li> Love the tweezers and even more impressed with the customer service! The first tweezers I received were defective and Crave Naturals promptly sent me another pair - I didn&#x27;t even have to bother sending the defective pair back! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Not as effective for facial hair as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have issues with my hands and these tweezers are easy to use for me! I like the angled tips for getting those hard to reach areas. They are also very well made. You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing these!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are AMAZING. I never bought slanted ones before. They have always been more flat. The cute case it comes with is great too and keeps them clean from all my other makeup.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Great value. Excellent packaging. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Tweezers seem to be out of alignment.  One side is shorter than the other.  I may send back.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned. The box is wonderful too, I&#x27;m sure that will add to them not getting lost and staying sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! With a magnifier mirror, these babies get those tiny hairs that are hard to grasp.</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers to replace my other pair that I lost. I have never been happier. I can get a better pluck of the eyebrows or the strangler that is hard to remove. Very easy to use and a nice case to store them in.</li>
    <li> Great product that&#x27;s easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these tweezers.  Your customer service is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Have you had that pair of tweezers that you are just sure belonged to your grandma when she was in her 20s? They have a duller tip than an unsharpened end of a pencil so every time you go to pluck those stray hairs on your brows, or on your ummm *cough* mustache *cough* you always seem to take a piece of your eye or lip with it? The Crave Naturals Precisio Professional Grade Tweezers has solved that problem! Thanks to a protective case and rubber tip for the head of your tweezers, they will always provide a top notch performance. You will be able to grab that stray hair and boom, “Goodbye icy hair!” Did you know that when you are able to pull a hair on the first try versus the fifth or sixth that the pain is a great deal less?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Crave Naturals Precisio Professional Grade Tweezers you can be sure that your eyebrows always look sleek, just as they should, in between your waxing. Heck, after thinking about it, you can just stop waxing thanks to the Precisio Tweezers. These tweezers allow you to pluck from the privacy of your own home without having to drive to the salon and have a strange, meaningless conversation with a lady or man who you are almost certain finds join in inflicting pain on people; it seriously puts a smile on their face! Toss out grannie’s tweezers or go ahead and slide them into your memory box for safe keeping. Whatever you do, do not use them anymore to groom your facial hair. Thanks to Crave Naturals, your browns *cough* and lip *cough* will thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received free product to facilitate this review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Perfect tweezers! I love them.  The price is extremely reasonable for superb quality. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and CUSTOMER SERVICE!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these tweezers based on the great reviews and was really disappointed.  I had a pair of tweezers that I really liked and lost them.  I had them for so long I am not sure where I got them.  Anyway, I ordered these Precisio tweezers for tweezing stray eyebrows.  It really hard to get a grip on the stray eyebrows.  The hair just slides right through.  And the ends are a little sharp and it is easy to accidentally pinch your skin with them.  I would not recommend for eyebrow tweezing!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They are amazing! Definately recommend</li>
    <li> Love these!  Just got my 2nd pair...  I&#x27;ve tried many tweezers, and I haven&#x27;t been happy with most, as they don&#x27;t get the finest hairs.  These do.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Precisio tweezers!</li>
    <li> Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. I love it</li>
    <li> Great tweezers especially for the price. I would definitely recommend them....</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! Awesome seller. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> So I was in desperate need of a new pair of tweezers and I found these.. Honestly, in the past, I&#x27;ve bought some pretty bad ones that didn&#x27;t work well so when mine stopped working I was so upset! I was skeptical about them but these work GREAT! So yes! Get these!!</li>
    <li> does not pull hairs out fully and is hard to grasp individual hairs as well</li>
    <li> Great product. Will add another start if continues to work as well with use</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The tweezers are a bit sharp for me, but they work fabulous! Definitely recommend this tweezer.</li>
    <li> These work great for those tiny hairs.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are actually pretty sharp and they grasped at the little hairs without a problem. They come in a cylindrical box, which is great at protecting the tweezers&#x27; edge. So far these worked out great!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever. They even find those pesky fine,can&#x27;t see chin hairs!</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers. For a fraction of the tweezerman price!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses tweezers as a profession and loves this item.  Do I need to say more?</li>
    <li> I just received my tweezers. Couldn&#x27;t wait to give them a try. I really did not expect them to be much different that what I had been using. What I had been using I thought were pretty good. Well, I was really pleased to quickly learn that these work so much better. For one, the grip is really nice which really plays a role in the precision part. You can really grab ahold of the very shortest of those pesky little hairs! I highly recommend! Thanks Crave Naturals!</li>
    <li> Tweezers should b able to grab the finest hair even one coated with silicone. These are tweezers! Great price.</li>
    <li> I love these! They&#x27;re perfect</li>
    <li> LOve This product!!! The best tweezer I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and definitely does the job well.</li>
    <li> These tweezers did not work at all. I have a lot of experience using tweezers but these do not grab the hair. The tweezers are useless. After spending an hour not one hair was pulled out.</li>
    <li> it has very well made tip. precise and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers, comfortable to hold.  Like everything except where they are made.  This is the kind of stuff that should be made in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers app 2 weeks ago. I wanted to try them out before reviewing them. I am very pleased. They catch even the most minute eyebrow hairs and are very substantive unlike the kazillion Tweezerman tweezers I&#x27;ve had in past which no longer work after a few months. I&#x27;m hoping these will stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> After so much frustration using bad tweezers, I am so happy to finally find a good one!  Nicely packaged, on time and good price.</li>
    <li> Great slanted tip tweezers. On the bigger side but works well and does the job!</li>
    <li> The tweezers came in a very cute packaging and it grab hair with ease. Great quality.</li>
    <li> For the first time, there is &amp;#34;NO SINGLE TEAR&amp;#34; drop while trimming my eyebrows with Precisio tweezers. I highly recommend this to everybody who is looking for a free tear trimming of your eyebrows. This is very easy to use as well. Now trimming my eyebrows is no problem. This is is best tweezers for the market. You should buy one for yourself and am sure it will work like a magic.</li>
    <li> OMG!! Where have these been all my life. I have always had bushy full brows. And no tweezer could ever get those little tiny baby eyebrow hairs that I had going on. Wax couldn&#x27;t even take them out. But let me tell you... THESE BABIES DID!! I am uber excited about them. Although at first I pinched myself a few times because I have fatty brow lids. But after getting the hang of it, I fell in love. They are so darn sharp and precise that you need nothing else. I promise you ladies. You will want these in your purses!!</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers. They are sturdy and precise. i think it&#x27;s a great idea for the carrying case and makes traveling a lot easier. Thanks</li>
    <li> Every woman needs a good pair of tweezers, and there are a lot of bad tweezers out there. The first test of a good tweezer is to see how the two tongs meet and if they meet along the total surface not just in one place. And of course, Crave Natural Tweezers do meet. It shouldn&#x27;t be of any surprise since they pay extra attention to their packaging from the stylish cardboard packaging to the little plastic coat that covers the end of the tweezers. These Crave Natural Tweezers are very high quality and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality pair.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers! They are durable, sturdy, and work really well! They arrived in a super cute cardboard case! They do also have a plastic carrying case to make them easy to store in your purse or makeup bag without them getting all dirty and gritty. They are comfortable to hold in your hand and make tweezing unwanted hairs quite easy. You can tell when you hold them how high quality they are. I love that they are black as well. It makes them look so sleek. I received these free in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> love the package it came in, very cute.. the tweezers work sometimes a little hard to grip the hairs on my chin but they work wonderful for eyebrows!!</li>
    <li> love these! and super cute packaging!</li>
    <li> If you are like me, you have had your tweezer since 6th grade...which was in the 90&#x27;s. I bought this tweezer as a replacement and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The grip is nice and the slant makes tweezing precise with a clean finish.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers. I must admit that I have been using Revlon tweezers ($8) for the past 10 years, and was thinking there was not much difference in brands or cost. So when my Revlon tweezers stopped working, the ends did not meet us any more. I bought a $4 pair from Sally Hanson- there is a difference the SH are light and the ends are thick and don&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; pair, I was looking at Tweezer man and almost took the plunge but did not want to spend $25.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I ordered these. The ends are thin/well shaped. They have good weight to them, and they are easy to hold. They grab the eye brows and remove them cleanly. I also use tweezers when my kid gets fine thorns/splinters in her foot. I think I will buy another pair to keep for that purpose. The SH tweezers will not remove a splinter the ends are too thick and dull, the Revlon won&#x27;t work any more since the ends no longer match up.</li>
    <li> This is perhaps just a matter of false advertising.  The tweezers are not sharp and not what I would consider professional grade.  Perhaps there is another term for what I want...medical grade?  I don&#x27;t know, but these tweezers are blunt instruments.  The best thing about them was the casing.</li>
    <li> Work fantastic! So glad I finally found a good pair!</li>
    <li> I have looked for a long time to find a quality pair of Tweezers , and with Crave Naturals I finally found what I was looking for. Makes plucking so much easier with  the slant tip . And there easy to hold on too , plus you don&#x27;t end up with a pair of squished together tweezers like you do with other store bought brands that can easy be squished and bent out of shape.  This is my new go to place for quality beauty products from now on !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the beast pair of tweezers I have bought by far! they get every hair , even the short fine ones. although it is really sharp at first, it dulls down after a few weeks and now I LOVE IT! Very nice packaging as well, nice Stocking Stuffer.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m returning these tweezers just minutes after opening them. They seemed like they worked great but they look unfinished and used. The black finish on them was scuffed (probably from the tube they rattle around in during transit) and the metal handle was scratched and rough. The tip was not polished or smooth either as I expected. So if you want ugly albeit functional tweezers these are great. I just expected a more refined product based on the rave reviews and price point. Back to the hunt for me...</li>
    <li> works well and just as expected. Easy to grip and closes evenly and hold hair perfectly without the need to go back and try again to pluck out any hairs. The angle to the tweezers was a necessity to me and was happy to have tweezer with this detail. I also appreciate the packaging since it is great to reuse and recycle to use for other items. I like to add bobby pins to it, while my daughter wanted to claim it for her rubber bands for her hair. She also has miniature toys/figures that I have found in the container to stash her items. Something for mommy and something for my daughter. It was like a two in one gift.</li>
    <li> very bad&lt;br /&gt;cvs brand is better</li>
    <li> They work very well. Very sharp. Great for small hairs.  Just ordered another one for my Sister in law.</li>
    <li> Wow! These are fantastic!  Accurate and precise and easy!  Good price!</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. They seem just as nice as the tweezers I replaced, that were twice as expensive. Packaging was great and they followed up on my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  They get the tiniest hairs with no problem.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great precision instrument. Pricey but worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews on this sight, I ordered these tweezers to replace the more expensive Rubis that I misplaced. I was totally disappointed..  The slanted ends are very thick, making it almost  impossible to pick up a hair.  The best thing about  this order was the case that the tweezers came in.  I will save the case to use on my new Rubis when they arrive. I would not recommend the tweezers based on what I received.</li>
    <li> these tweezers are awesome! they are a lot better than my other tweezers since the ends arent bulky.</li>
    <li> This is possibly one of the best made set of tweezers next to medical.&lt;br /&gt;Also good service makes this a stand-out deal.</li>
    <li> really sharp and easily grips tiny little hairs</li>
    <li> Love this tweezer.  Grabs even the thinnest, shortest, &amp; most stubborn hairs with no problems.  So glad I got this at a great price too!!</li>
    <li> Everything you said they were..very excellent tweezers. Am very pleased</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tweezers by far. They work wonderfully and I&#x27;m very impressed by the quality and precision that they have. Great seller! 5 star product!!</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. There is even a slight gap when holding and squeezing the ends together.  Ill stick to my tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly i must say the packaging was adorable. Its perfect for gifting too. It comes in a hard cover and then inside is a plastic cover. its very easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;The material is highly durable. The design is good easy to hold it. The blades are shaped perfectly with precise slanted tip for easy hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;I would generally own a silver color tweerzer but this black color is like a breath of fresh air. It looks really nice and regal.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t like it. Too heavy, and hard to catch hair.</li>
    <li> If you see it, you can pluck it.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received a product sample to facilitate my review however my opinions are honest. I am not compensated financially. These tweezers are fantastic! I needed to replace a set I have that doesn&#x27;t quite grab my eyebrow hair. These have a great tip. It&#x27;s slanted and grasps even the finest hairs on the first try. I haven&#x27;t noticed hairs gather at the tip like they do for some of my other tweezers and they stay clean and precise. They&#x27;re lightweight stainless steel and comfortable in my hand, even came in a really great package. I would definitely give these as a gift too, the package is really nice and I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great quality, stays sharp. I havent had to buy another pair yet its been 5 months...</li>
    <li> Does not grab my eyebrow hairs very well. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it but no luck.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. These tweezers work better than the ones I had. I felt little to no pain and it didn&#x27;t left any pink spots after. The product was smaller but it was effective and had a nice grip.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of pairs of tweezers lying around the house.  I try all kinds, and deem 95%+ useless.  I had my &amp;#34;one good pair of tweezers&amp;#34; some years ago, that lasted forever and were fabulous.  From so much using, the brand name rubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since been on an avid search to replace my &amp;#34;one good pair&amp;#34; of tweezers.  I saw these, and the reviews here.  About how they really get the fine hairs.  I snorted in disbelief.  I looked at other products.  But I kept coming back to this one.  I said, oh why not - Let&#x27;s try them.  The worse that can happen is they wind up in the useless tweezer pile and I am out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my package arrived, my hands fumbled with packaging in excited anticipation.  I admired the packaging(it&#x27;s so cute) before I ripped that sucker open and got to tweezing.  I purposely left myself in a chewbacca-like state for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They MOST CERTAINLY get those fine hairs.  These are the new love of my life.  And because of the precision, tweezing those little suckers is even more painless than with your standard decent pair of tweezers.  My eyebrows look great, and I was able to groom them the quickest I ever have(next to waxing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.  I love these.  Get them, you won&#x27;t ever look at another brand of tweezers again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m particular about tweezers and these met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough, beautiful packaging but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> product ok. nothing special. works just as good as other tweezers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I can carry my twisters in my bag in the perfect container it comes with!!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for the money! They rival far more expensive brands in quality.</li>
    <li> I am happy with how these tweezers work</li>
    <li> Finally the struggle of using tweezers that lack the ability to grip stubborn hairs is a thing of the past. I have used so many tweezers that either had really bad tension or had tips that were so rounded that they didn&#x27;t close evenly or grip hairs at all. It was a challenge to not pull out more than one hair at a time, but Crave Naturals&#x27; Precisio Tweezers ultra aligned tips helped to make gripping those single stubborn and fine hairs easy to remove in one single swoop. I would highly recommend these tweezers to anyone if you struggle with the same things I did. These are honestly the only tweezers you will ever need for life.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I purchased a similar tweezers by Revlon and it has finer ends. Go for the Revlon version.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman, you know how hard it is to find the perfect pair of tweezers to pluck your eyebrows. They either don&#x27;t pull the hair perfectly, they are too big, or they just plain don&#x27;t work. I actually just moved recently and my pair of tweezers somehow got lost in the move. They were small and even though they weren&#x27;t perfect, they did the job. When I was given the chance to review these tweezers, they couldn&#x27;t come at a better time. My eyebrows were about 2 weeks too long since I had last plucked but that changed once I opened the box (cute box at that) and found these fun tweezers. The first thing that I noticed is how sharp they are. Never thought that would be something I had to look for but it pulled the tweezers out with such ease. They literally are perfect. The only downfall I did find was that for the smaller hairs that weren&#x27;t quite grown, they are a little difficult to pull without pinching your eyelid itself. You just have to get at the right angle and it works just fine. Just know not to jump right in and try pulling because it could get a little painful. But that was me just rushing also. They come in the perfect little case that you can slip them back into. You don&#x27;t have to worry about them getting broken or lost. I can honestly say that these are the perfect tweezers. I would most definitely recommend these to any woman who is wants the perfect pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have been great and came in very cute packaging.  What I liked most is how sharp the ends were, which a lot of tweezers can lack believe it or not.  The only thing I can say that I didn&#x27;t like and it&#x27;s purely do to preference was the thickness of the tips.  I&#x27;m so used to the tips being thin that these tweezers were hard to get used to because the tops were a tad thicker than the ones I have so when I went to tweeze it was harder than normal.  Again this was purely a personal preference on my part.  Overall though I do like these tweezers and they have been well used since getting them.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 star because it really is worth five stars. I received this free for evaluation from the company and I don&#x27;t skimp on bad reviews. If i find a product not to my liking, I will voice my opinion for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers came in a cute box as pictured, that I will most likely upcycle or maybe keep them in it so I never lose them! I have a problem with misplacing these things. Though, these tweezers are much bigger than my avg ones, so I might not have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so you want to know the performance, because all of the other stuff is fluff. When I slid these babies out, they looked gorgeous, with very pointy ends and not the tiny kind you see all the time. At first, this intimidated me. I thought I&#x27;d stab myself or take out too much hair. Not so, they plucked with ease. I did take out more than usual in one pluck, but that was after I got use to them plucking one hair. I&#x27;m not going to say it hurts any less, but these are so easy to use and the hair definitely came out faster and easier than usual. I love the design of the tweezer handles. Nice and thick and easy to grab for precision when plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say about tweezers. I&#x27;ve never gushed about them until now. Despite the price being higher than usual, I think these are well worth it. They are very durable looking. Also, you get a lifetime guarantee, which is unheard of usually.</li>
    <li> I recently had to replace a pair of my old tweezers which had served me well for many years.  This set is alright.  They grasp the medium to large eyebrow hairs, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t seem to be able to grasp all the finer hairs.  I have yet to find another tweezer that can grasp really fine hairs around my eyebrows because my old one that is just too far gone to work.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging. This is the best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned. They are perfect for plucking your eyebrows or any stray hairs. I like that they have a little weight to them. I think it makes them sturdier. The slanted tip is great.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t grip well.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to my tweezers as a lot of them I have tried do not have the grasp especially for small, thin hairs. These tweezers are amazing. They are made very well and have no problems grabbing even the tiniest hairs. I would recommend these to any one looking for a great pair of tweezers that will last. I also love that they come with a little storage tube.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough. Doesn&#x27;t pull out smaller hair.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are definitely pro. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to upkeep the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> After using my new tweezers for eyebrow and facial hair removal, I have to say they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!  I read the other reviews before buying and they did not steer me wrong.  A+</li>
    <li> I thought these would be better than my tweezerman&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re about the same or worse.  Even though they&#x27;re brand new,  I think the points need to be cleaned or polished.</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied with this product. Would give it five stars but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and works great.  Nice price foe sugar a good product.</li>
    <li> These are some of the most nicely packaged grooming tools I have every purchased.  While the package is nice, it does not take away from the quality of the tool or the value of the purchase.  The tweezers are made of a very nice grade of steel, well-engineered and have a firm, straight close of the blades.  Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Terrific quality product!</li>
    <li> Oh behalf of my wife... thank you!  The other day she said,&amp;#34;I wish I could find a good pair of tweezers!&amp;#34;  After searching Amazon for something that had good ratings, I came across these precision tweezers from Crave Naturals and ordered a pair.  They arrived very quickly and after her first &#x27;plucking&#x27;, she said, &amp;#34;I love these tweezers, they&#x27;re great!!&amp;#34;..  Enough said........</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and aren&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent high end quality tweezers! Perfect slant tip, precise and tight; everything you want in a tweezing product. Even better, it comes in this seriously nifty and remarkably convenient little tube that slides easily in your purse or pocket. As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the tube is inside an incredibly gorgeous and fun graphic tube which I continue to use because it looks delightful and oh so cool in my purse. I recommend this to anyone that likes the bling to their beauty products or is looking for a functional yet adorable gift. I got a pair to try and I will definitely be looking for more products from this company because if they are all made like this then they are sure to be a treat!&lt;br /&gt;The best part about them is that they work so well. I never have issues grabbing a hold of a stray hair or tugging it out. No slippage or sliding: it effortlessly pulls it straight out. Leaving no room for error and causing no extra work from having to go back after that same one again. When you&#x27;re used to a lower quality tweezer it is surprising how much faster you can shape your wayward brows with these!</li>
    <li> These look and feel like professional quality tweezers! The slanted tip really allows for precise plucking of specific hairs. I did find that these worked better on thicker and fuller hair than on my thin, fine hair as it actually cut the hair instead of plucking it. With a lifetime guarantee, I would suggest picking these up with a discount code!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect tweezer. It does a great job! I love it very much.</li>
