      <li>and it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>I thought it&#x27;d be cheap but the thing is, I thought there&#x27;d be two dog tags.</li>
      <li>I wish someone had written a true review about the tags</li>
      <li>It is nice and solid, and the chain is strong.  </li>
      <li>Not quite like the picture, not a smooth stainless steel looking finish...but still awesome!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s about the only thing I&#x27;m happy with really.</li>
      <li>Came in quick</li>
      <li>They look amazing and are solid metal.  </li>
      <li>For a few dollars, this dog tag worked great for my son&#x27;s Wolverine costume.</li>
      <li>I really like it but be sure to order 2 and order an additional \\&quot;Stainless steel 4.5 in and 27 in.military dog tag ball chain\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This was a lot of fun to wear with my Wolverine cosplay.</li>
      <li>cuz my nic&#x27;name was Logan already, i plan to put it on my blood bead chain should turn out pretty sweet.</li>
      <li>The Wolverine \\&quot;tag\\&quot; is great, better than what I expected, however, it only came with ONE tag!</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and as described/displayed , it works pretty well for me</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and friendly customer service.</li>
      <li>, it looks exactly like the picture, it came earlier than I expected and a perfect piece to my wolverine costume.</li>
      <li>little thicker than dog tags and a good deal heavier, they look cool though</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Very cheap looking and chain is very short!</li>
      <li>It happening to me for first time.</li>
      <li>This came in promptly and looks exactly as displayed in the picture.</li>
      <li>Decent product!</li>
      <li>screen accurate, there&#x27;s only one like the one wolverine wears, the scratches and whatnot</li>
      <li>A+ fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to any Wolverine fan!</li>
      <li>this is the real deal!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Whatever metal it&#x27;s made out of is better than I expected.</li>
      <li>; is appropriate, the military gives two when you join....</li>
      <li>I wear it as a fashion statement and it works very well.</li>
      <li>Its metal of course and looks and feels like real dog tag used by Logan.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>This was actually better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Oh and one last thing they even give you a nice black pouch with a cool gold design on the front to put the tag in just in case you don&#x27;t want to always wear it...</li>
      <li>Love them, they are thick &amp; heavy and the aging effects are done very nicely.</li>
      <li>They were much better than I expected!  </li>
      <li>Nice little collectible, looks just like the picture with some great faux aging.</li>
      <li>My x-men addicted teenager is thrilled with it!</li>
      <li>They look nothing like displayed, the letters are not even the same font, the size of the numbers on the dog tag is not even the same, some numbers are smaller than others, the metal is not like displayed, super cheap!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the standard issue dog tags used by the military, but I liked the look and feel.</li>
      <li>but I suppose one can order a second and add it with the shorter chain like our own military dog tags are worn.</li>
      <li>But in any case, I highly recommend this item for a Wolverine/Xmen movie prop collector.</li>
      <li>Also, I misread the product when it says &amp;#34;Wolverine 2 necklace dogtag&amp;#34; it does NOT mean that you get two dogtags, just one.</li>
      <li>Package also came with a braided bracelet that I can only assume was complimentary, and was a surprize.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;dog tags&amp;#34; &#x27;cause there&#x27;s only one. &amp;#34;Dog tag&amp;#34; is appropriate, the military gives two when you join....</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seenit, but it should come as a apir of dog tags, not just one.  doesn&#x27;t look like his dog tag, in &amp;#34;X-Men&amp;#34; movie.</li>
    <li> The tag itsself is great but the chain is too short.</li>
    <li> This is for kids, chain size is so small that adult cannot use it.</li>
    <li> My son loves these.  They look amazing and are solid metal.  He wears them every day! :)</li>
    <li> HUGE Wolverine fan. Definitely found this by chance and I&#x27;m VERY HAPPY with my purchase. Its Great Quality, has some weight to it.</li>
    <li> My step son will be happy. I know that I am because I also got one for myself</li>
    <li> Great chain length. Good looking tag.</li>
    <li> VERY COOL!! can&#x27;t pass up for the price.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it!</li>
    <li> Great for the costume</li>
    <li> The actual product does not have the black lettering that the image has. Feels rather cheap, but will work for cosplay.</li>
    <li> Arrived before time. Very happy</li>
    <li> Nice little collectible, looks just like the picture with some great faux aging. I wear it as a fashion statement and it works very well. One thing: the metal chain is very short and so you have to fasten it around your neck; you can&#x27;t slip it over. It takes a bit longer but it will never fall off. Worth more than the price given for sure.</li>
    <li> little thicker than dog tags and a good deal heavier, they look cool though</li>
    <li> THE CHAIN WILL NOT FIT YOUR HEAD.  If you plan on wearing this, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  The distressed look is great and it&#x27;s heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This tag is fantastic I love it haven&#x27;t taken it off since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s screen accurate, there&#x27;s only one like the one wolverine wears, the scratches and whatnot on it to make it look older are wonderful. A must have for wolverine fans, since I was 19 my nickname has been wolverine so I had to get this and glad I got it, and it&#x27;s so cheap. Oh and one last thing they even give you a nice black pouch with a cool gold design on the front to put the tag in just in case you don&#x27;t want to always wear it...like I do ha ha ha ha (awkward laughing)</li>
    <li> Well I din&#x27;t get what I ask for but I&#x27;m not buying from the same ppl no more that&#x27;s simple.</li>
    <li> It served its purpose adding to my costume.</li>
    <li> An excellent addition to my son&#x27;s wolverine costume.</li>
    <li> Very good weight to it which was my concern with the price.&lt;br /&gt;But the chain is comes with it is extremely short - only 20-21\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier than the shipping estimates and was exactly what I expected. Tag is made out of aluminum, and has a nice weight. Stampings look just like the pictures with small imperfections for effect. Package also came with a braided bracelet that I can only assume was complimentary, and was a surprize. I would highly recommend this to any Wolverine fan!</li>
    <li> Love them, they are thick &amp; heavy and the aging effects are done very nicely. I would suggest they either provide a longer chain or an optional extension as anyone over 6&#x27;0 &amp; 200lbs would have trouble wearing it because the chain is short, unless they wan&#x27;t to bring chokers back..lol But nonetheless they are very nice and as far as I can tell %100 screen accurate.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, metal is cheap looking</li>
    <li> This came in promptly and looks exactly as displayed in the picture.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome I like the detail on it, it looks exactly like the picture, it came earlier than I expected and a perfect piece to my wolverine costume.</li>
    <li> AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.</li>
    <li> The dogtag looks great from the side but is way thicker than standard issue dogtags. Also, I misread the product when it says &amp;#34;Wolverine 2 necklace dogtag&amp;#34; it does NOT mean that you get two dogtags, just one.</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking and chain is very short! Came in quick but that&#x27;s about the only thing I&#x27;m happy with really. Glad it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and friendly customer service. I would definitely recommend this. the quality seems good. will right an update if I find anything wrong with it in the next 30 days.</li>
    <li> Decent product! For a few dollars, this dog tag worked great for my son&#x27;s Wolverine costume. It is just one tag, with Wolverine on one side,  and Logan on the side.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!! They look nothing like displayed, the letters are not even the same font, the size of the numbers on the dog tag is not even the same, some numbers are smaller than others, the metal is not like displayed, super cheap!, a quarter has better metal!!! It was a complete insult for them to send me such cheap and ridiculous product, NOT AS DISPLAYED!!!! I wish someone had written a true review about the tags so I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money for nothing.</li>
    <li> The chain may be considered short for some, but it works for me. The pendant is solid.</li>
    <li> A+ fast delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> This was a lot of fun to wear with my Wolverine cosplay. It&#x27;s not the standard issue dog tags used by the military, but I liked the look and feel. It would have been nice if there were two tags as well and I did consider buying the other one for sale on Amazon because of these two discrepancies. Other reviewers noted how short the chain is and they are correct. Fine for a kid, but for a grown man, I had to add length from another set of dog tags I had. Over all, I think it was well worth the small investment. It was cheaper than eBay.</li>
    <li> Only came with tag.  No toe tag.  Chain is short.  Expected a little more out of this.</li>
    <li> This is much better quality than I was expecting.  It is nice and solid, and the chain is strong.  My x-men addicted teenager is thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> Nice but thought I was getting 2 of them, one with Logan and the other with Wolverine. But still over all very nice and good delivery.</li>
    <li> This dogleg is awesome! Feels heavy &amp; even my son who we bought it for was like &amp;#34;Wow! this is the real deal!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> We bought these for a costume. They are a lightweight and look kinda cheap, but they were, so no harm done. Perfect accessory.</li>
    <li> I was afraid it may be made cheaply, but I was pleased it is real, sturdy metal with a decent chain.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Arrived way before their estimate. Craftsmanship is excellent. Made my Wolverine costume complete.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality! Awesome tag for the right price!</li>
    <li> Very cool product, looks like the photo. However if you misread it like I did you will find that there is actually only one tag. In the images following from the movie you can see Wolverine has 2, one says Logan and the other Wolverine. What you are getting here is one tag with 2 sides.</li>
    <li> The Wolverine \\&quot;tag\\&quot; is great, better than what I expected, however, it only came with ONE tag! Also, it comes with just the one long chain (which is relatively short) and not the additional small chain (which is intended for the second tag... smh). Seller should add this info to the \\&quot;details and descriptions\\&quot; sections of this product. I really like it but be sure to order 2 and order an additional \\&quot;Stainless steel 4.5 in and 27 in.military dog tag ball chain\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Not nearly as cool as the photo. Kinda cheap feeling and looking. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> These dog tags were perfect! They were much better than I expected!  Good job.</li>
    <li> price is a little high</li>
    <li> This is the perfect memento to let people know I went through the Weapon X program due to my genetic ability to heal myself.</li>
    <li> Lovely product although it scratches easily, can&#x27;t complain though since it just makes it look more badass.</li>
    <li> I imagine someday the wounds I receive will be too extensive to heal in time and when that day finally comes I want the last enemy standing to find these tags and remember just who&#x27;s long sharp adamantium claw is stuck irretrievably up his backside!</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED. BEST LOOKING DOGTAG (movie prop)IVE SEEN. JUST WAITING FOR THE SECOND 1 TO ARRIVE</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and as described/displayed , it works pretty well for me cuz my nic&#x27;name was Logan already, i plan to put it on my blood bead chain should turn out pretty sweet.</li>
    <li> Not quite like the picture, not a smooth stainless steel looking finish...but still awesome!</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of time which was great. Whatever metal it&#x27;s made out of is better than I expected. I thought it&#x27;d be cheap but the thing is, I thought there&#x27;d be two dog tags. I only got one. I thought there&#x27;d be two. Oh well I guess. Hopefully it&#x27;ll work for my cosplay. The chain is a bit short but I can deal. I have a longer chain I can use.</li>
    <li> This tag is identical to the one as portrayed in &amp;#34;Xmen Origins - Wolverine&amp;#34; movie when he requested a new one/s. Its metal of course and looks and feels like real dog tag used by Logan.&lt;br /&gt;Now my only small complaint is that it needs to come in a pairs. Its only one, here but I suppose one can order a second and add it with the shorter chain like our own military dog tags are worn. But in any case, I highly recommend this item for a Wolverine/Xmen movie prop collector.</li>
    <li> I love this! I wear it all the time and get loads of compliments;D</li>
    <li> The item is missing in the box.It happening to me for first time.I searched everywhere and nothing.Totally disapointment!</li>
    <li> This was actually better than I expected. Perfect for our costume</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected,it said 2 Necklace tags pendant not 1.</li>
    <li> Ornament is very nice ,but no sooner chain has faded</li>
    <li> Cool tag with great detail. My only complaint is dog tags are a set of two and only one tag came in the package.</li>
    <li> Broke pretty easily but lasted a fair amount of time</li>
    <li> Tag and chain are good. clasp for the chain sucks.</li>
