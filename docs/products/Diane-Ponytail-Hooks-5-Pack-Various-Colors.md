      <li>LOVE THEM.</li>

      <li>These do just that and are easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Seems fine.</li>
      <li>The very first band I used the end broke off!</li>
      <li>will purchase these from another retailer that is available, not from this seller.</li>
      <li>If you have a lot of hair, you will love - hey will make like so much easier.</li>
      <li>Perfect for thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>I should of read the reviews first, these hooks are tiny, maybe they&#x27;re good for a babys head.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my thick hair!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve been using this bungee cord and hook system your whole life!!</li>
      <li>I love these hooks, they are good for really thick hair.</li>
      <li>Would work well with someone with very straight hair.</li>
      <li>I love how i can just clip this in to the actual hair and wha la!</li>
      <li>They broke the first time I tried to use them.</li>
      <li>The hook broke on my first attempt to use one</li>
      <li>FIRST FOUND AT</li>
      <li>and it really can hold my high ponytail for one whole day!</li>
      <li>I did not feel these were made very well.</li>
      <li>and they work well in straight hair too).</li>
      <li>Very neat.</li>
      <li>Now if I do I can loosen the hook and still have a nice firm ponytail.  </li>
      <li>I have much better success with ordinary elastic loops.</li>
      <li>One down fall is that I wished they came more in a pack.</li>
      <li>I decided to try after watching a video on how to tie a high ponytail.</li>
      <li>They are so strong, unlike prior purchases from different manufacturers.</li>
      <li>They are amazing for a loose pony tail if you are not ready to fully commit to having your hair up the rest of the day</li>
      <li>I made sure that I didn&#x27;t pull so hard when putting my hair in a pony tail and the hooks still broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am natural</li>
      <li>With these I can wrap the pony once I have the hair gathered into my hand without completely flattening the area I&#x27;ve just teased.</li>
      <li>No issues so far</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural</li>
      <li>I will be buying more for my daughter who has thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>(it will catch and it will not pull your hair out) then twist the other end around, kind of like the old school stretchy band with balls on the end I used as a kid, you want to go at least one full rotation around and then hook the other hook into your hair not far from the first hook.</li>
      <li>and I love how tight or loose I can make them.</li>
      <li>and I have very fine somewhat thin hair.</li>
      <li>Works well, stays tight all day in my thick, straight hair (I note this because most reviews I read mentioned curly hair</li>
      <li>the second go round of getting all the hair in the clip so these hooks keep my hair nice and tightly pulled back.</li>
      <li>You may need a little practice on how to use them at first.</li>

<li> These 5 will last a LONG time because they don&#x27;t stretch out of shape and the hooks are sturdy and coated so no rusting.</li>
<li> THESE STRETCH AROUND THICK UNRULY HAIR AND CAN HOLD SECURELY WITHOUT BEING OVERLY TIGHT.</li>
<li> I actually have less hair loss using these than traditional rubber bands or elastics.</li>
<li> but they hold all my hair tight but they stretch out if you are not careful.</li>
<li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is because I&#x27;ve had these a little over a month now and already one of the hooks have broken off one of the ties.  </li>
<li> Ordered these because when using a regular elastic it pulls so tight that it obliterates the teasing at the crown.</li>
<li> However, I have to cover it with scrunchie because the hooks are not really uh presentable.</li>
<li> NOT WORTH THE WORK to get a few bucks back.  </li>
<li> The hooks are NOT supposed to be hooked to each other.</li>
<li> you don&#x27;t hook them to each other.</li>
<li> Instead I hope this review deters anyone else from wasting their money on this extremely defective hair tool.</li>
<li> I read other reviews before I bought them and a lot of people said to not buy them</li>
<li> I can make it as tight or as loose as I want it to be.</li>
<li> Usually the rubberbands I use can&#x27;t hold up for long and my ponytail sags after just a few hours.</li>
<li> I know some people felt that they are a bit awkward to use at first, but you get the hang of it after a while</li>
<li> no what I am talking about) or for a tight ponytail if you need to push the limits.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s a little too soon for me.</li>
<li> When I don&#x27;t detangle my hair, these little miracle workers help my hair with a half up do just keep all my hair out of my face!</li>
<li> Used a few times.</li>
<li> The hooks are not attached well to the base and snap right off even if you tug at them ever so slightly.</li>
<li> Finding something to keep them back is difficult.</li>
<li> I bought these after Sally&#x27;s stop selling the brand I usually use.</li>
<li> What a waste of money, seriously.</li>
<li> I have thick 4b/c hair</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and ponytail clips</li>
<li> Two of these have broken in the span of 4 days.</li>
<li> They were broken</li>
<li> I purchased these after watching a youtube video on how to create a high ponytail, and was very disappointed when the product was faulty.  </li>
<li> I have very thick and heavy curly hair, but I thought this was the solution :(</li>
<li> TERRIBLE QUALITY!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT FOR NATURAL HAIR. THESE STRETCH AROUND THICK UNRULY HAIR AND CAN HOLD SECURELY WITHOUT BEING OVERLY TIGHT. LOVE THEM. FIRST FOUND AT sally&#x27;s BEAUTY SUPPLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THEY HAVE SINCE STOPPED SELLING. SO HAPPY I FOUND ON AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Only last for 2-3 uses per band wouldnt repurchase</li>
    <li> Used a few times. Seems fine. No issues so far but I&#x27;ve only had them a month.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I have thick 4b/c hair and I can try my hair with this with no fuss at all.They&#x27;re quite resilient as well.</li>
    <li> Love them! I have very thick hair and ponytail clips ALWAYS break before I can do the second go round of getting all the hair in the clip so these hooks keep my hair nice and tightly pulled back. Very neat. When I don&#x27;t detangle my hair, these little miracle workers help my hair with a half up do just keep all my hair out of my face! love them!!!</li>
    <li> They work perfect. I read other reviews before I bought them and a lot of people said to not buy them but I always like to see for myself so I did and they work perfectly ,plus they ship fast</li>
    <li> I bought these after Sally&#x27;s stop selling the brand I usually use. Two of these have broken in the span of 4 days. The hooks are not attached well to the base and snap right off even if you tug at them ever so slightly. TERRIBLE QUALITY!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my thick hair! Goodbye popped hair ties!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband who has dreads. Finding something to keep them back is difficult. These do just that and are easy to put on. I will be buying more for my daughter who has thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! OMG!! OMG!! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I was looking for these in the stores and could not find them! Finally decide to look on amazon! I love how they are so versitile! With the regular hair bows they would always take my or my daughters&#x27; hair out. No matter how I would put them on or how short they were on.  I love how i can just clip this in to the actual hair and wha la! I can make it as tight or as loose as I want it to be. Which is a good thing cause I love wearing my hair up in a bun or ponytail, but would always get a headache.  Now if I do I can loosen the hook and still have a nice firm ponytail.  I could just go on and on on how much I love these hooks! One down fall is that I wished they came more in a pack. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone with curly hair. The trick to these is to anchor the hook into your hair, not connect the hooks together. They are amazing for a loose pony tail if you are not ready to fully commit to having your hair up the rest of the day (curly girls no what I am talking about) or for a tight ponytail if you need to push the limits.</li>
    <li> These are so fantastic, where have they been all my life?!?! The middle of my scalp is damaged from the elastic hair ties I used to use to put my hair up in a ponytail (my perpetual hair style).  I know some people felt that they are a bit awkward to use at first, but you get the hang of it after a while and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve been using this bungee cord and hook system your whole life!! The reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is because I&#x27;ve had these a little over a month now and already one of the hooks have broken off one of the ties.  That&#x27;s a little too soon for me.</li>
    <li> Great product - saves your hair!</li>
    <li> they do not work .... you have to wrap it around several time and then it is diffcult to hook the ends together  ....  I have much better success with ordinary elastic loops.</li>
    <li> Item as described-great shopping experience!</li>
    <li> I love these.... I am going to purchase more!</li>
    <li> After the 2nd use of  each the ponytail hooks in the pack, the hook broke off the end of the elastic. I made sure that I didn&#x27;t pull so hard when putting my hair in a pony tail and the hooks still broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase these from another retailer that is available, not from this seller.</li>
    <li> I like to tease the crown of my hair so I have a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; with my ponytail. Not a huge bump but just a little lift to make my ponytail a little more fancy then the type of ponytail you wear to the gym. Ordered these because when using a regular elastic it pulls so tight that it obliterates the teasing at the crown. With these I can wrap the pony once I have the hair gathered into my hand without completely flattening the area I&#x27;ve just teased. Works well, stays tight all day in my thick, straight hair (I note this because most reviews I read mentioned curly hair and they work well in straight hair too). Came quickly, good price</li>
    <li> The very first band I used the end broke off! I did not feel these were made very well. Will try another brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Great quality. If you have a lot of hair, you will love - hey will make like so much easier. Great for ponytails and undos.</li>
    <li> I am natural so I have to wash and condition my ponytails for protective styling often. I LOVE these. They are so strong, unlike prior purchases from different manufacturers. These 5 will last a LONG time because they don&#x27;t stretch out of shape and the hooks are sturdy and coated so no rusting. Great job on the quality!</li>
    <li> I love these hooks, they are good for really thick hair. I&#x27;m transitioning to natural and I love how tight or loose I can make them. The key is in using them correctly. The hooks are NOT supposed to be hooked to each other. Instead hold your ponytail how you want it to look and then hook one end into the hair itself (it will catch and it will not pull your hair out) then twist the other end around, kind of like the old school stretchy band with balls on the end I used as a kid, you want to go at least one full rotation around and then hook the other hook into your hair not far from the first hook. I actually have less hair loss using these than traditional rubber bands or elastics.</li>
    <li> These were garbage. The hook broke on my first attempt to use one and I have very fine somewhat thin hair. When i was finally able to use one without it breaking, it got tangled up in my curls. I thought i was gonna have to cut my hair but the hook just ripped it out for me. What a waste of money, seriously. NATURALS, BE WARNED! If you care about your hair this isn&#x27;t a good buy.</li>
    <li> I had never used these types of bungee bands before. I decided to try after watching a video on how to tie a high ponytail. Usually the rubberbands I use can&#x27;t hold up for long and my ponytail sags after just a few hours. I tried this and it really can hold my high ponytail for one whole day! However, I have to cover it with scrunchie because the hooks are not really uh presentable.</li>
    <li> They broke the first time I tried to use them. I have very thick and heavy curly hair, but I thought this was the solution :(</li>
    <li> These are so cool!!! Perfect for thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like these and they work well. You may need a little practice on how to use them at first.</li>
    <li> When trying to hook the ponytail things the hook kept getting caught in my hair.  It was a fight to use them.  Will give them away.  Would work well with someone with very straight hair.</li>
    <li> RICKYS NYC use to make their own brand. Now they sell Dianes and Amazon does too. Most people don&#x27;t even know how to use them you anchor them into your hair you don&#x27;t hook them to each other. I like them. I thought I didn&#x27;t but they hold all my hair tight but they stretch out if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Product came within the estimated date, however with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th use, the hooks broke off of the elastic part of the ponytail hook.  I purchased these after watching a youtube video on how to create a high ponytail, and was very disappointed when the product was faulty.  I tried to return the product, letting them know it was a defective item and they not only would not pay for the shipping, but will charge a restocking fee.  NOT WORTH THE WORK to get a few bucks back.  Instead I hope this review deters anyone else from wasting their money on this extremely defective hair tool.</li>
    <li> One of the hooks wasn&#x27;t on the band  They were broken</li>
    <li> I should of read the reviews first, these hooks are tiny, maybe they&#x27;re good for a babys head.</li>
