      <li>The price is right for the length of time it lasts.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best face washes I&#x27;ve tried, natural or not, and since I usually buy it from the Vitamin Shoppe at a discounted price, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>

      <li>This face wash exfoliates with fruit acid, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>my skin was starting to have more reddening to the point I thought maybe I was getting rosacea.  </li>
      <li>The Kiss My Face acne products are the first products that I have found that I can keep using and it still continues to work.</li>
      <li>In love with this face wash, bought it several times already.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure that it was specifically this product that caused such a reaction.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it at first was the strong orange smell, but I&#x27;ve grown used to it</li>
      <li>I am in my mid-20&#x27;s, and I have long since stopped proactiv (since the birth control kept it mostly under control), but a year ago</li>
      <li>I have used this face wash for years and it&#x27;s the only one that leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Great product and extremely hard to obtain everywhere!</li>

      <li>It took about 2 weeks for me to really see a noticeable difference</li>
      <li>it took me about 2 weeks to really see a change</li>
      <li>I think there is some ingredient in it that really irritates my lips.  </li>

      <li>Seems like so much to ask for these days.  </li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent.  </li>
      <li>Recently, I started looking for a more gentle, natural face wash that would work with my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I started to notice that the strong acne products I used in my teens and early twenties were becoming too harsh for my skin.  </li>
      <li>It removes my facial sunscreen and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean, without residue.</li>
      <li>This facewash was something new that I tried-- wanted to go the natural route and economical.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to others and say give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Most of the time products will work for a little while and then not work as well.</li>
      <li>This face wash leaves your skin soft to the touch, cleans your pores well, and makes your whole face feel firmer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way this exfoliates without using harsh gritty stuff!  The only thing I do not like about this product at all is that it does not remove makeup well.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems my whole life.  Not acne, thank you!, but dry skin that cracks and flakes during the late fall and winter months and horribly oily skin in the spring and summer months.  I can never figure my skin out :(  I have tried everything under the sun and still had the same issues and my skin was starting to have more reddening to the point I thought maybe I was getting rosacea.  On a whim I decided to give this product a try because I had had such success with the other KMF products that I was using.  It took about 2 weeks for me to really see a noticeable difference but now a month in and I have to say my skin looks and feels incredible.  At this time of year I have to immediately put face lotion/moisturizer on my face before my face dries straight from washing it or else it will be very tight and dry and I won&#x27;t be able to even smile without feeling the skin cracking.  If I don&#x27;t have lotion I have these visible dry peeling patches on my cheeks and forehead.  The same areas that are always shiny and oily in the summer are extremely dry and patchy in the winter.  Well, with this stuff I don&#x27;t need lotion anymore.  And I&#x27;ve noticed that at the end of the day my skin is not oily or even shiny.  This is very odd because I always have a shiny forehead and nose by the end of the day even on days where I had to apply moisturizer to keep from having dry scaly patches on my face.    My skin is soooo smooth now and even my husband noticed how much softer and healthier my skin looks.  I love this stuff and I love this company.  I have very sensitive skin and this wash doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me at all.      I highly recommend this to others and say give it a shot.  it took me about 2 weeks to really see a change but once I did it was a total transformation.  This product feels so different than your typical exfoliant because there is no grit, no scrubbers, just fruit acids and it smells great too.  Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> After months of daily use, this is my go-to face wash. It&#x27;s great for my jawline acne-prone and oily in the T-zone skin. It does exfoliate, especially if you allow the lather to sit on your skin for a few moments before washing it away. It washes away clean and doesn&#x27;t usually over-dry. A little bit goes a long way, so I&#x27;ve found it to be worth the price. Best of all, it&#x27;s rated a 2 on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this face wash, but the price is not good.  It is not consistently available in the small town that I live in so I rely on Amazon to get this product.  The price jumped from around $10 to about $15 in a couple of weeks and all of a sudden it cannot be purchased one at a time through Amazon prime but must be purchased as a completely overpriced set. The product is top drawer, but the price is exorbitant.</li>
    <li> amazing.  Safe and free of toxins. Seems like so much to ask for these days.  Thank Goodness for Kiss My Face products. So challenging just to not be poisoned these days.  This did wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser after reviewing the face washes reviewed by the Cosmetic Safety Database. I am on a mission to use only products that do not have cancer causing chemicals and do not cause damage to organs. I checked the reviews for this item on several sites and everyone seems to love it. I bought it and have used it for a couple of months and I love it. It works great, keeps my skin balanced and it smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a regular exfoliating cleanser with small particles like ground apricot seed powder, but it&#x27;s not like that at all.  It&#x27;s a gel with a strong but nice fresh citrus smell.  It cleans and rinses well, and it has made my skin quite soft.  Plus it has great natural ingredients.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a mechanical/abrasive exfoliator, this isn&#x27;t it, fair warning.    Update: This has become my favorite face wash.  I now only use &#x27;abrasive&#x27; exfoliators when my face is really grimy; otherwise, this does the trick.  It removes my facial sunscreen and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean, without residue.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this face wash!  At 28, I am still fighting stress and hormone-related breakouts, but about a year ago I started to notice that the strong acne products I used in my teens and early twenties were becoming too harsh for my skin.  Recently, I started looking for a more gentle, natural face wash that would work with my oily, acne-prone skin. After trying a few products that were too drying or not effective enough I found this face wash.  Since the description says it is exfoliating, I assumed it would have some sort of scrubby beads or ground fruit stones in it, but that&#x27;s not the case.  This face wash exfoliates with fruit acid, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  While it hasn&#x27;t yet vastly improved my stubborn complexion, I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions, and it makes my skin feel great. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it at first was the strong orange smell, but I&#x27;ve grown used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It&#x27;s one of the best face washes I&#x27;ve tried, natural or not, and since I usually buy it from the Vitamin Shoppe at a discounted price, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> My son is 9 years old and started using this because of pre puberty breakouts around the nose and forehead. His face has been clearing up since using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for over 6 years now and my husband even uses it.  It leaves your face feeling clean and never dry.  It also has a great citris scent!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have acne and hyper pigmentation I am trying to battle.  I decided acne washes do nothing and I need a gentler cleanser with not too much junk in it. Now that I am on Tazoroc this cleanser comes in handy since my face is starting to peel.  This really gets my skin clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash to rinse your face off at the end of the day. It does not act as a makeup remover at all though, so be sure to use that before this.</li>
    <li> I have used this face wash for years and it&#x27;s the only one that leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s an exfoliation wash, and you really shouldn&#x27;t exfoliate your face everyday. Other than that, this is one of my favorite products for facial care.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I love love love the Kiss my Face shaving lotion. I was needing a new face wash and I was so excited to see they had a product available. Reviews seemed good so I decided to try it. I&#x27;m not impressed at all. There is no wow factor. The smell makes me cringe a bit. The texture reminds me of watered down aloe vera. I don&#x27;t feel a tingly clean, soapy bubbles or even an indication that it has even been on my face. It&#x27;s completely useless for removing any leftover traces of makeup. I feel let down. The worst thing is that for the first time in years, I&#x27;ve developed large painful cyst acne again.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleansing face wash.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use.  I like that it foams so well and you can easily get 2-3 mos of use out of one tube.</li>
    <li> I like the citrusy scent of the face wash. I use everyday morning and night. I follow it with a toner and Kiss my face break out acne gel.</li>
    <li> Great product! My daughter has verysensitive skin ...and now some trouble wwith acne. Her skin looks great using this wash!!!!! love kmf products this one is great too.</li>
    <li> its nice. gentle and smells good. if u like citrus. i believe it actually works too. works best over a sink, otherwise it gets too wet and diluted in the shower.</li>
    <li> this product smells nice but is really small four ounces wont last a very long time, i woud purchase again if not for the price</li>
    <li> I am almost 40 and I still have blemish prone skin.  I have tried for years to find something that keeps my skin clear of break outs.  I have tried tons of things from cheap store cleansers to expensive mail order.  However I did find one that sort of works, it was filled with tons of toxic chemicals.  So which is worse...acne or cancer?!?!  I started looking into natural products and tried several with no luck until I learned of Kiss My Face.  I was skeptical, but anxious to try it after I read all the reviews.  I wanted it to work so bad.  I bought the Start Up, Balancing Toner and Cell Mate moisturizer.  I used it for three weeks and I was still breaking out.  I was disappointed again.  Then I decided to stop using the toner and I could not believe it.  Within two days my face was clearing up and it felt smooth.  It has been four weeks from then and still clear.  I love the smell and how soft my skin feels.  I love the products.  I like the smell of the Toner, but I just can&#x27;t use it.  The price is right for the length of time it lasts.  One bottle is going to last me at least two months, maybe longer.  Thank you Kiss my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this for awhile my face started breaking out agian.  I still like that it is chemical free, but I need to keep looking for something that keeps me clear.</li>
    <li> The Kiss My Face acne products are the first products that I have found that I can keep using and it still continues to work. Most of the time products will work for a little while and then not work as well. These products work awesome every time. The exfoliating wash is awesome because you can feel it exfoliating your skin, but it&#x27;s not ebrasive and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores either.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, personally for me, I like having a \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; or \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; exfoliant. This is more smooth and there is no tecture to it. So for me, not really my favorite. However! My husband LOVES this. He hates getting rasor burn and feels that this face wash is excellent for that. He actually asked me to order him one - which he never asks for anything like that. So 5 stars for men who may be looking for a good facial cleaser leaving the skin VERY soft and smooth. It really is a great product, leaves your skin feeling clean and not dried out and SUPER soft.</li>
    <li> It is okay to use it but can not fall in love with it&lt;br /&gt;because I felt It is too watery....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just liquid, no beads are abrasive qualities. Nice enough but not what I wanted. Shouldn&#x27;t be listed as an exfoliant</li>
    <li> I thought these has microbeads for extra exfoltiation but this was just a clear liquid. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> Great product and extremely hard to obtain everywhere! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and over the past 3 its become increasingly hard to find, to the degree I am now having to order it online. My only complaint is the amount of time it took to process the order for just one single tube!&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking there must be a distribution issue because every store that carries this product in GA seems to have issues getting it in and when it does arrive finally there are only a handful of tubes available. The price online is much better but the wait for the arrival kinda sux......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add, this is a long lasting product as well, you only need a dime size amount to clean your face. Its natural and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product religiously for 4 years, it arrived early &amp; the price was right!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with possible rosacea. I&#x27;m trying to go all natural with my beauty products but considering my skin has proven to be sensitive to anything with tons of plant extracts it&#x27;s been difficult. My face would turn neon red and burn. So as you can imagine I was expecting the worst from this product but was pleasantly surprised. I used it for the first time this morning and it left my face feeling clean and not stripped or tight as other reviewers have noted. I also noticed minimal irritation. There was still a little there but it paled in comparison to other products I&#x27;d used. This is a wonderful product and I can see myself using it for a good long while.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face washing product i have used.  I used it before and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This works one step above soap.  Nothing sets it apart.  My face didn&#x27;t feel exceptionally clean, and it felt like I was using cold cream to clean my face.  Not effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Something mild for the Winter and Summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after falling in love with the KMF organic pore shrink and decided to spend my money on some other types of washes/masks within the product line that had good reviews for people with acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash does not have the micro scrubbies like most exfoliants do so it&#x27;s perfect for in the morning just to get off any oil from overnight since you aren&#x27;t supposed to sleep with makeup on you shouldn&#x27;t need a hard exfoliation first thing. I used almost the whole tube so far and I just love the scent, and the way it makes my skin feel so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy even though I did start using the Jojoba and mint facial scrub since it does have the little micro beads in it. What I&#x27;ll do is use the less abbrasive one in the morning and the stronger one in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great---like all the KMF products I wish it lasted longer or was a little cheaper since I used it all within a months time.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves your skin soft to the touch, cleans your pores well, and makes your whole face feel firmer.  I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of allergies as well and I had NO allergic reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.  It is now part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and had great expectations with this exfoliating wash.  I read the ingredients and did not expect any problems.  After the first use, I had an extreme allergic reaction.  My face burned and itched for half an hour.  I wanted to make sure that it was specifically this product that caused such a reaction.  I tried it once again the next night.  Same reaction.  I returned this item fairly easily and received credit back into my account within a week.</li>
    <li> I try to follow the Environmental Working Group (EWG) for beauty products.  This one is rated well, and it&#x27;s one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  It&#x27;s a simple little face wash, almost like a gel.  Doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and like it.</li>
    <li> In love with this face wash, bought it several times already.  It&#x27;s a clear gel wash, you feel like you need a lot at first, but only need a bit to get the job done!</li>
    <li> I realize now that I have extremely sensitive skin (e.g., eczema when stressed, prone to heat rash, sunburns, bug bites, and Mac make-up, etc.).  This facewash was something new that I tried-- wanted to go the natural route and economical.  Although it did not cause any harsh reactions on the actual skin on my face, my lips had a HORRIBLE reaction to the product.  My doctor, nutritionist, acupuncturist, and I could not come to any conclusion what was causing this blistering, crusting of my lips (think, chapped from the snow plus dryness of seriously cracked lips).  It lasted for about 2 months when my doctor asked if I had tried any new products.  Although the facewash came to mind, I did not think it could be the root of the problem.  However, when I removed it from my regimen of skincare as I did with every other somewhat allergy causing product, my lips began to improve.  I tried using the facewash again one day in the shower to see if it was a fluke, and nope, my lips got extremely chapped again.  I think there is some ingredient in it that really irritates my lips.  So I did not finish the wash, and have started to use another natural facewash for sensitive skin.  Hope this helps those with skin sensitivities.  It&#x27;s probably fine for those with normal types of skin. My husband uses it and is fine (he has oily to normal skin).</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying I have fairly bad acne.  The only things that have ever cleared up my face was proativ and hormonal birth control.  I am in my mid-20&#x27;s, and I have long since stopped proactiv (since the birth control kept it mostly under control), but a year ago, I stopped the birth control.  My acne wet crazy again.  I didn&#x27;t want to go back to proactiv since it dried out my skin.  So, I decided to try something more natural, and less harsh on my sensitive skin.  The wash feels great, smells great, and leaves my skin soft.  It did help somewhat with the acne, but I&#x27;m still experimenting with different brands.  Would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t an acne problem.</li>
