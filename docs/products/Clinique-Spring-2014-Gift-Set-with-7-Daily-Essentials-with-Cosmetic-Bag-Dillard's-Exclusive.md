<li> Clinique product is second to none-- especially for those of us with very sensitive skin.</li>
<li> the product never came as is showed... came all empty inside with non of the 7 make up things.  </li>

<li> but I never have anything negative to say about the product.</li>
<li> A big disappointment.</li>
<li> The eyeliner was broken and the contents weren&#x27;t as outlined.</li>
<li> The cosmetic bag is the absolute worst I have ever encountered from Clinique.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this bag</li>
<li> I turn and turn and turn (i&#x27;ve tried both ways) and nothing happens.  :(</li>
<li> I was disappointed I did not get to choose the color of foundation!</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
<li> This is terrible.</li>
<li> However, the lipstick that came with this one is horrible.</li>

    <li> Nice way to try products....</li>

Clinique product is second to none-- especially for those of us with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The Lip Stick, Mascara, eye shadow, face soap and eye cream are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cosmetic bag is super flimsy and is way to big.  I can&#x27;t use the eye liner because it won&#x27;t lift out of the pencil thingy. I turn and turn and turn (i&#x27;ve tried both ways) and nothing happens.  :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always love Clinique cosmetic/ products. The price is great! My friend wanted a Clinique set - and so I got her one for Christmas, and she loves it! Perfect for your own use and as a gift to a mom, sister, aunt, or girlfriends.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. This is one of those &#x27;free gift packs&#x27; you get when you purchase a product.  Even inside is a slip of paper&lt;br /&gt;saying this is a FREE gift pack.  Yet they charged me 19.99 for it.  I feel so ripped off and wish I could get a refund and not have to send the product back...</li>
    <li> Again, the products included in this set are great.  They are so good on sensitive skin.  I would rather use Clinique than any other product.</li>
    <li> the product never came as is showed... came all empty inside with non of the 7 make up things.  i lost my money</li>

    <li> I have been using Clinique cosmetics for years.  I like being able to try these products - just the promotional without having to make additional purchases. I have used all of the products.  I especially liked the eye liner and lipstick..  I also liked Repair wear Laser Focus Wrinkle Correcting Eye cream and beginning to see a slight difference around my eyes.

    <li> I love these gift sets for sister and mother</li>
    <li> I love the samples in this set.  Lots of product for the price.</li>
