      <li>LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Even my kids (6 and 8) use it.</li>
      <li>I love not stepping on it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better comb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After so many snap on and snap offs, it no longer snapped on securely.  </li>

      <li>Add some leave in Enjoy conditioner and</li>
      <li>Use it on my fine hair, and my childs thick hair: Works GREAT!  </li>
      <li>Whereas the Original has a concave design that is very comfortable and gentle on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this brush so much.</li>
      <li>This great little brush has worked wonders on getting my long-haired, tender-scalped daughter to brush her hair.</li>
      <li>I do not think this is worth buying.</li>
      <li>The brush teeth are too soft and they can not go through my hair on the top of my head.</li>
      <li>I was super apprehensive about this comb at first, but my cousin who has the same kind of hair convinced me to try it.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after I went online to try to replace my original Tangle Teezer as I have dropped it one too many times, causing it to break open in to two pieces.</li>
      <li>brushing threw is sooo much nicer and doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out!</li>
      <li>My kids did not seem to think it was any better than a regular hairbrush</li>
      <li>so water passes right through and has absolutely nowhere to collect.</li>
      <li>I like this one better than the original one because it&#x27;s slightly softer on my scalp.</li>
      <li>The hard plastic feels more substantial in the hand &amp; gives you a bit more firmness to make it through thicker hair.</li>
      <li>If you have long, thick hair like me, I am sure the original tangle teezer works much better on you!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair untangled and less breakage  Love It!</li>
      <li>When I had long hair, I was able to just run a comb through my hair after my shower after using this in the shower.</li>
      <li>I do have straight hair, but for some reason no matter how much conditioner i use</li>
      <li>The shiny plastic makes it very slippery when trying to brush through conditioner, which is a very counter-intuitive.  </li>
      <li>The brush bristles are really gentle on my hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush itself also has very flexible spokes so its not tugging and stretching the hair out.</li>
      <li>THAT SHE PROBABLY WANTS CUT OFF LIKE A MARINE.</li>
      <li>Product was great packaging broken can&#x27;t gift it</li>
      <li>and she loves that it&#x27;s convex design</li>
      <li>I use it in the shower with conditioner and my hair, which can get very matted and tangled, detangles like never before.</li>
      <li>extremely fluffy cat likes to be brushed with a Tange Teezer as well, and we find that the hollow of the Aqua Splash is a great gripping place for petting him with the bristles.</li>
      <li>This brush really works wonders.</li>
      <li>very comfortable，my friend and i like it so much</li>
      <li>It is larger and much easier to hold than the original teezer.  </li>
      <li>The product came super fast (Saturday Delivery at no extra charge) just in time for my Sunday hair shampoo routine.  </li>
      <li>Problem is the classic Tangle Teezers would get flooded in this use.  </li>
      <li>It is soft and gentle with my curly hair.</li>
      <li>have very healthy, very long hair (down to my bum)</li>
      <li>I still use my natural boar bristle brushes for shining my hair after I brush with the Tangle Teezer, &amp; I think they are very complimentary to each other.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the original Tangle Teezer, which works but feels like a cheap piece of crap.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally kinky/curly hair.</li>
      <li>By the time I had finished combing it out in layers, there was as much hair in this brush as in my regular one and my arms were giving out.</li>
      <li>type - 4a, natural</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I CAN GET THROUGH MY 3YR OLD&#x27;S HAIR IN 30MINS.</li>
      <li>This makes it easy to detangle and doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair, like ordinary brushes.</li>
      <li>that is fine &amp; naturally wavy, &amp; there&#x27;s A LOT OF IT, which gives me a thick ponytail.  </li>
      <li>This might work fine for someone with less hair but the teeth are not long enough to comb through mine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tubular, completely hollow in the middle, so water goes right through it.  </li>
      <li>This new shape is much easier to hold and much less likely to go flying across the room when it encounters a tangle.</li>
      <li>I even have less hair in my brush too, another positive plus.</li>

<li> SHE SCREAMS AND TRIES TO RUN AWAY....</li>
<li> MIDDLE OF HER BACK WHEN WET AND SO THICK!</li>
<li> I have the other style in my bag when I go out for the day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shape is difficult to hold on to but the hair teasing aspect works well.</li>
    <li> FOR MY CORK SCREW CURLS, TANGLES, AND BIRDS NEST... THIS IS ESSENTIAL.. I CAN FEEL IT ON MY SCALP!  MY CURLS CLUP TOGETHER IN TANGLE FREE BEAUTY AFTER RUNNING THIS THROUGH MY HAIR IN THE SHOWER... I CAN GET THROUGH MY 3YR OLD&#x27;S HAIR IN 30MINS. FROM WAS TO CONDITION TO STYLE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HER HAIR IS TO THE UPPER PART/MIDDLE OF HER BACK WHEN WET AND SO THICK! LIKE A CHER WIG. BEAUTIFUL HAIR FOR A GROWN WOMEN!!&lt;br /&gt;SHE HAS SPRING CURLS THAT SHE PROBABLY WANTS CUT OFF LIKE A MARINE. SHE SCREAMS AND TRIES TO RUN AWAY....BUT THIS BRUSH IS MY SAVIOR FOR MY CARPUL TUNNEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU LADY&#x27;S FOR ALL YOUR REVIEWS ON THE TANGLE PRODUCTS. I EVEN REVIEWED THE MAKERS&lt;br /&gt; VIDEO TO GET SIDE THE DESIGN OF HIS PRODUCTS... THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s 2015 and this thing is still going strong. BEST in the shower, but I abuse it w/a blow dryer etc.. Now it&#x27;s not magic for my daughter who is now 6.. Hair thickness is crazy, if I let it matt(have to use conditioning cleanser w/slip, no poo now), I&#x27;m doomed and this helps w/ the tedious work, still essential</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally kinky/curly hair. I was super apprehensive about this comb at first, but my cousin who has the same kind of hair convinced me to try it. I&#x27;ve never used a better comb. I use it in the shower with conditioner and my hair, which can get very matted and tangled, detangles like never before. It also doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as I usually do with finger combing or a regular wide tooth comb. I have no idea how this product works and why it works so well, but I just go with it. It is MAGIC!!! A curly girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of hearing my hair rip when I combed it out after washing. This might work fine for someone with less hair but the teeth are not long enough to comb through mine. By the time I had finished combing it out in layers, there was as much hair in this brush as in my regular one and my arms were giving out. I will be returning this one.</li>
    <li> This new shape is much easier to hold and much less likely to go flying across the room when it encounters a tangle. This brush is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have given several as gifts that is how great I think they are.  I use mine everyday,  I have the other style in my bag when I go out for the day.</li>
    <li> This great little brush has worked wonders on getting my long-haired, tender-scalped daughter to brush her hair. She says it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and will even brush her hair wet.</li>
    <li> Feel comfortable and easy to hold when using it in the bath. I like this one better than the original one because it&#x27;s slightly softer on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Would buy again. I thought the bristles would be rubber but don&#x27;t know if that was mentioned. Any who I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is essentially a curry-comb, like the type used on the coats of horses. Its molded bristles are thin and flexible. I bought this thinking that it would easily untangle my often-matted hair, but it has not lived up to its reputation. When my fluffy hair becomes seriously matted, these bristles do not penetrate, whether I use it in the shower or when my hair is dry. I still have to use a doggy-brush-type of hairbrush to detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used! It just slides through my hair like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> I didnt ever think to use a brush while in the shower. But i noticed that my hair was so tangled  that shampoos and conditioners just didnt work in those parts of my hair. I found that brushing the conditioner in helped to both detangle the hair and at the same time allow the conditioner to be evenly dispersed. My hair is much softer now and no more tangles!! The brush itself also has very flexible spokes so its not tugging and stretching the hair out. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I think this brush would benefit with a handle.  My hair is so thick and curly,I found it hard to get through. I prefer the Wet Brush over the Tangle Teezer.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the original Tangle Teezer, which works but feels like a cheap piece of crap.  The hard plastic feels more substantial in the hand &amp; gives you a bit more firmness to make it through thicker hair. It&#x27;s tubular, completely hollow in the middle, so water goes right through it.  It&#x27;s not as ergonomic as the original, but it&#x27;s not overly uncomfortable to hold.  The shiny plastic makes it very slippery when trying to brush through conditioner, which is a very counter-intuitive.  The brush bristles are really gentle on my hair.  I wish I could remove the bristle pad &amp; put it on a different brush body.  I&#x27;m going to look into doing just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very healthy, very long hair (down to my bum) that is fine &amp; naturally wavy, &amp; there&#x27;s A LOT OF IT, which gives me a thick ponytail.  Unfortunately, this means my hair extremely prone to tangles!  For me, the claims that you can start at the scalp &amp; go down to the ends without sectioning is laughable!  I still section my hair &amp; start at the ends, working upward.  It still takes at least 10 minutes to brush &amp; I still have to clean the brush at least once during brushing &amp; once after.  That being said, this is still the best brush I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s very soothing on my scalp &amp; I lose less hair than with paddle brushes that have the little nubbies at the end of the bristles (it seems my individual strands like to tangle around those little nubs &amp; hold on for dear life.)  I still use my natural boar bristle brushes for shining my hair after I brush with the Tangle Teezer, &amp; I think they are very complimentary to each other.</li>
    <li> Loved it, really does what it promises, untangles the hair is very light and beautiful. bought two, one gave that to my sister and she loved it.</li>
    <li> It works great and does a great job at untangling my hair. I have naturally curly hair and it tangles so easily. This makes it easy to detangle and doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair, like ordinary brushes. I even have less hair in my brush too, another positive plus. Even my kids (6 and 8) use it. They brush their own hair now with no complaints. It&#x27;s a great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works okay.  the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; is better than the original, easier to grip</li>
    <li> I do have straight hair, but for some reason no matter how much conditioner i use i can hardy brush through it and i rip out half of my hair.  This brush really works wonders. I used it in the shower with conditioner and also on my dry hair. LOVE it.  You&#x27;ll only need one brush from now on, and it is this one</li>
    <li> Works equally well on dry hair, helping to disperse oil or leave-in conditioner and on just wet hair.</li>
    <li> Product was great packaging broken can&#x27;t gift it</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. It is absolutely perfect for when i get out of the pool or out of the shower. I showed it to my friends and they all got online to order it. This product is definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> Yay!!!! Finally a brush that glides threw my thin waist length hair!! Add some leave in Enjoy conditioner and brushing threw is sooo much nicer and doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out! Love it!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this. I lose less hair when shampooing. Going to get one for my poodle mix dog. Makes your scalp feel awesome.</li>
    <li> My kids did not seem to think it was any better than a regular hairbrush</li>
    <li> The brush teeth are too soft and they can not go through my hair on the top of my head. Also I am still losing hair everytime I brush. I do not think this is worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing innovation on the Tangle Teezer.  Never again will I find half a brush on the shower floor.  My spouse likes to use a Tangle Teezer in the shower to help rinse shampoo and conditioner through her thick knee length hair. Problem is the classic Tangle Teezers would get flooded in this use.  To save them from gross things that fetid water can harbor, she began snapping the bristle pad off the base and using it thusly.  After so many snap on and snap offs, it no longer snapped on securely.  The base became a soap dish and the purple porcupine would be left lurking the the bath after she was done, coveting my soles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more a terror. The Aqua Splash is hollow, like really hollow so water passes right through and has absolutely nowhere to collect. It stands on its own feet and stays nicely out of my way.  I love not stepping on it and she loves that it&#x27;s convex design is also better suited to helping rinse the hair products through.  Whereas the Original has a concave design that is very comfortable and gentle on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My extremely fluffy cat likes to be brushed with a Tange Teezer as well, and we find that the hollow of the Aqua Splash is a great gripping place for petting him with the bristles. Kitty approves. It&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
    <li> I show this in the shower daily. When I had long hair, I was able to just run a comb through my hair after my shower after using this in the shower. I recently cut my hair off, and if I use this brush in the shower, I do not have to comb or brush it again after.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after I went online to try to replace my original Tangle Teezer as I have dropped it one too many times, causing it to break open in to two pieces. The product came super fast (Saturday Delivery at no extra charge) just in time for my Sunday hair shampoo routine.  It is larger and much easier to hold than the original teezer.  Seems I lost less hair too, although I am not sure if that can be attributed to my detangling technique or the brush.  I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type - 4a, natural</li>
    <li> Use it on my fine hair, and my childs thick hair: Works GREAT!  I like to brush thru the conditioner during the shower.  Makes my hair untangled and less breakage  Love It!</li>
    <li> It is soft and gentle with my curly hair. My boyfriend noticed the difference. I wish it came with something for traveling that protected its bristles.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as the original one. If you have long, thick hair like me, I am sure the original tangle teezer works much better on you! The original one gives you a lot more volume.</li>
    <li> very comfortable，my friend and i like it so much</li>
    <li> Received as planned. Good product.</li>
