### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I love it!!!!</li>
      <li>This works great</li>
      <li>Would greatly recommend.</li>
      <li>Works amazing, best top coat nail polish ever.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, even though I do have bubbly, dented nails they have yet to chip on day three without painting the tips of my nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It provides a gorgeous shine as well.</li>
      <li>Essie Good</li>
      <li>Works really good.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this polish.</li>
      <li>I just got this yesterday and the shipping was very fast and the polish is great!</li>
      <li>My nails look as amazing as they had been on day one.</li>
      <li>This has never happened with the Good to Go top coat.  </li>
      <li>but what i do is paint my nails apply this product and then apply good to go on top</li>
      <li>I own the bottles</li>
      <li>It does a great job at protecting against chips, that&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>The paint job lasted a good week or more, so I was pleased with that aspect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i really like seche vite topcoat, and i&#x27;ve happily used essie&#x27;s good to go topcoat more than once.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Good to Go top coat, and when I received two bottles of this for Christmas I was excited to try it out.  </li>
      <li>The first time i used it was so happy with the results</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I saw an advertisement for this in a magazine, and since I LOVE Essie nail polish, aside from my manicures chipping after a day, I decided to give it a try.    </li>
      <li>I still think my manicure holds up better with it on though.</li>
      <li>This worked great on my toes, but not so much on my hands.</li>
      <li>, I was able to go about my</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Ahead top coat.  </li>
      <li>I love Essie nail color and quality</li>
      <li>Ok, I should have listened to all the reviews</li>
      <li>On top of which, it bubbles.</li>
      <li>I love wearing nail polish.</li>
      <li>Ahead top coat worked as a top coat, providing a shiny laquered hardened layer to the top coat of the polish.  </li>
      <li>It dries way faster and leaves your nails lovely and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a nail polish aficionado, and I recommend OPI top coat</li>
      <li>This top coat never dries.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and amazing...</li>
      <li>Even putting this top coat on at 11 am, and going to bed at 1am, I still had sheet marks that took away the shine.</li>
      <li>I would suggest that it might be the product you have under this top coat that might be interacting with it.</li>
      <li>I love Essie nail polish and decided to give the top coat a chance.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product after reading about it in a magazine.</li>
      <li>continue to use my bottle of top coat because, as I said, it was perfectly fine as a top coat.  </li>
      <li>i bought this product because one i love essie and two i normally use good to go as my top coat</li>
      <li>I normally get the \\&quot;good to go\\&quot; top coat, but I wanted something that was more protecting of my manicure.  </li>
      <li>Its very true about the wait time.</li>
      <li>Ahead is much thinner than Good to Go which</li>
      <li>I figured if it didn&#x27;t work as well as it claimed, I could just easily return</li>
      <li>My nails were fine all day, then I went to bed around 10 p.m.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge deal.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this top coat!</li>
      <li>The best thing you can do is to put VERY little on.</li>
      <li>Definitely just avoid this formula and go with Good to Go.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
      <li>My nails no longer \\&quot;chip\\&quot; but for some reason this base/top coat combination causes my polish to lift at the edges and then come off in full \\&quot;sheets\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>But this top coat is awesome, honestly I change my nail color after about 1.5 - 2 weeks only because I get tired of the color,</li>
      <li>I will give it 5 stars for no chipping but as for drying and being a decent top coat i give it a one.</li>
      <li>but it chips too quickly.</li>
      <li>I was sure that their no-chipping top coat would be of similar quality.  </li>
      <li>I am SO happy to finally purchase a top coat that actually works.</li>
      <li>truthfully this is such an incredible waste of $9.</li>
      <li>i figured that it had to be well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the 20 minute</li>
      <li>But TRUST me, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Again, all was fine during the day, no smudging and no chips, and I went about my business normally (I&#x27;m a student</li>
      <li>I realize that it&#x27;s not marketed as a fast dry, so I do wait a good amount of time after I put it on, but for some reason it bubbles.</li>
      <li>I am married with 2 kids, work a full time job, as most other DIY manicurists, so time is important.</li>
      <li>My nails take a lot of abuse and manicures typically last a few hours at best, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
      <li>I used to loved Essie polish - the bottles that are 4-5 years old last longer than the newer colors (perhaps a formula change??)  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time to fix my nails as often as I chip them, so lately I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any of my gorgeous new nail polish</li>
      <li>Once you apply the top coat after your nails have fully dried the top coat dries much quicker, about 30 minutes..</li>
      <li>I bought it at the store before reading any reviews, and I really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have done that!</li>
      <li>top coat is never going back to the store.</li>
      <li>I havent used it since the third try i waited a day before adding a top coat ive waited four hours before adding the top coat and either way it doesnt dry</li>
      <li>I know Essie is a good brand (I have one or two of their polishes), but I was a bit wary about spending nearly $9 on a top coat.</li>
      <li>I ended up spending more time waiting for them to dry and re-doing my nails than I would have</li>
      <li>It has great shine once dry and a super thin liquid consistency which makes it go on really smooth.</li>
      <li>I have nice nails naturally, but normally when I paint them they always chip after only a day or so.</li>
      <li>i got it for prom and planned on doing my own nails to save a little cash</li>
      <li>The trick is not to apply the top coat until your freshly polished nails have \\&quot;completely\\&quot; dried.</li>
      <li>I thought it must have been something I did wrong, so I put another coat of top coat on that morning to smooth it out and restore it to smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Who has time to paint their nails every day or wants to shell out for shellac polish?  </li>
      <li>Essie needs to be responsible and take this cr*p off the market.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t do much except takes books out of my bag and read).</li>
      <li>If used with an Essie basecoat and Essie nailpolish, my nails truly do not chip for a solid few days (which is very impressive given the abuse I put my hands through on a daily basis).</li>
      <li>I had to throw the whole bottle away.</li>
      <li>Other top coats I&#x27;ve used have softer brushes that fan out as you coat the nail which give the finish an even look.</li>
      <li>I used it in the morning and all was fine, and I thought it was dry already by the evening.</li>
      <li>I read about this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because Essie usually chips quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the most disappointing Essie product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It did prevent chipping a little longer than my faithful Revlon top coat, but at twice the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money for an additional day or two without chips.</li>
      <li>(although those bottle go fast, halfway through the bottle it becomes gloopy and unusable, but hey the Essie is completely unusable).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with the top coat completely drying following the above method..</li>
      <li>I now use other top coats, such as Seche Vite, that don&#x27;t cause bubbles and are fast drying.</li>
      <li>, if I had just let my nails chip and then painted a new color on.</li>
      <li>I am writing this review quickly because I am reading them as I am letting the product dry on my nails.</li>
      <li>I really just don&#x27;t have the time to clean up the bubbly mess.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also had small bubbles appear after applying this top coat (never had this problem before</li>
      <li>recently ran out of my regular top coat, and I went to a local store to buy another.</li>
      <li>but since then no matter how long i wait the top coat never dries and it ends up ruining the designs i spent an hour creating on my nails.</li>
      <li>does take some time to dry, so your best strategy is to do base coat and color the night before, letting them dry sufficiently, then in the morning apply the top coat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I LOVE this product. If used with an Essie basecoat and Essie nailpolish, my nails truly do not chip for a solid few days (which is very impressive given the abuse I put my hands through on a daily basis). It provides a gorgeous shine as well. Highly recommended. AND it&#x27;s cheaper online...win.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the most disappointing Essie product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Good to Go top coat, and when I received two bottles of this for Christmas I was excited to try it out.  Unfortunately, after waiting for what felt like forever, not only was this top coat still tacky but it also left several bubbles on my nails.  I do not have bubbling issues with other polishes.  On the bright side, even though I do have bubbly, dented nails they have yet to chip on day three without painting the tips of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel like the formula for No Chips Ahead is much thinner than Good to Go which I find more difficult to apply (and I&#x27;m talking thinner than freshly opened regular Essie nail polish.)  Definitely just avoid this formula and go with Good to Go.  It dries way faster and leaves your nails lovely and shiny.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the haters out there about this product! I have nice nails naturally, but normally when I paint them they always chip after only a day or so. But this top coat is awesome, honestly I change my nail color after about 1.5 - 2 weeks only because I get tired of the color, never because of my nails looking ragged! This stuff seriously gets the job done. I will give some advice though. I&#x27;ve learned that is does take some time to dry, so your best strategy is to do base coat and color the night before, letting them dry sufficiently, then in the morning apply the top coat. This works great, I applied the no chips ahead and it was dry within 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s holding up well so far. On day 4, and I&#x27;ve done dishes a couple times with no noticeable chips! Also, this is much cheaper at other sites or at your local major drugstore...</li>
    <li> I saw an advertisement for this in a magazine, and since I LOVE Essie nail polish, aside from my manicures chipping after a day, I decided to give it a try.    I do agree with the other reviewers in that it takes a LONG time to dry.  At least 20 minutes.  But TRUST me, it is worth it. I am on day five and NO CHIPS!! Let me explain something about my lifestyle to you.  I&#x27;m constantly cooking, gardening, doing dishes...oh and I&#x27;m a receptionist, so I clack and type all day long.  I also dig in my purses, scratch where it itches and use my nails as tweezers.  So day five with no chips?  It&#x27;s a huge deal.  Totally worth the 20 minute wait.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this.</li>
    <li> This top coat is terrible! I bought it at the store before reading any reviews, and I really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have done that! People aren&#x27;t lying when they say it doesn&#x27;t dry! I put this on my nails at 4pm, and by 9pm, it still wasn&#x27;t fully dry! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this polish. I hate painting my nails for it to chip later the same day or the next day. Now I have to say that I have used this product with a Nutra nail product only because my nails never get hard, no matter what polish I use. I tried Nutra Nail Flex-Hardener and I use Essie in the end. My manicure lasts 4-5 days before it begins to chip. I have never had that before. Some people said that it takes a long time to dry. I can&#x27;t speak to that since I always use spray to dry my nails quicker. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product. It actually works.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I love Essie nail polish and decided to give the top coat a chance. The problem is it doesn&#x27;t dry! I bought this stuff and painted my nails at 1 p.m. My nails were fine all day, then I went to bed around 10 p.m. When I woke up, my nails were smooshed! They didn&#x27;t completely dry even after nine hours. I figured it must be a fluke, so I tried the same thing again (in a different state and a totally different climate, no less!). The same thing happened again! I had to throw the whole bottle away. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time working on the computer and taking care of a toddler.  My nails take a lot of abuse and manicures typically last a few hours at best, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Who has time to paint their nails every day or wants to shell out for shellac polish?  The other reviewer is right that this top coat takes a long time to dry...in my case, about 30-35 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with smudging hours later, though and my nails are chip and smudge-free 3 days later.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review quickly because I am reading them as I am letting the product dry on my nails. It has been about fifteen minutes and they are not tacky but probably still impressionable, which by the standards of the negative reviews is doing pretty well. I would suggest that it might be the product you have under this top coat that might be interacting with it. I am using OPI Bubble  Bath, maybe just the formulation of that polish is working well with the No Chips Ahead. Hopefully it will last through my shower and sleeping tonight.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care if this even stops chipping, because my nails look atrocious enough that I will take the polish off right away. Even putting this top coat on at 11 am, and going to bed at 1am, I still had sheet marks that took away the shine. AWFUL. this shouldn&#x27;t even be sold. Essie Good To Go is amazing...3 minute dry, try that instead. This top coat is awful.</li>
    <li> This top coat never dries. Tried 3 times, and it never really fully dried each time. Three the bottle away, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this top coat the last few times I painted my nails, in combination with Essie&#x27;s \\&quot;first base\\&quot; base coat and assorted brand new opi polishes. It DOES take forever to dry completely, and I ALWAYS end up with smudges because I forget my nails are still not completely set yet. It works very well once it is dry. My nails no longer \\&quot;chip\\&quot; but for some reason this base/top coat combination causes my polish to lift at the edges and then come off in full \\&quot;sheets\\&quot;. Very odd but I almost prefer it coming off all at once than chipping off for days. It has great shine once dry and a super thin liquid consistency which makes it go on really smooth. I only wish it dried faster!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Essie nail polish, however, this top coat is disappointing. I realize that it&#x27;s not marketed as a fast dry, so I do wait a good amount of time after I put it on, but for some reason it bubbles. The nail polish I use is brand new, I use a base coat, I just don&#x27;t understand.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t bubble on some nails and other times it does. I really just don&#x27;t have the time to clean up the bubbly mess. I ended up spending more time waiting for them to dry and re-doing my nails than I would have, if I had just let my nails chip and then painted a new color on. I now use other top coats, such as Seche Vite, that don&#x27;t cause bubbles and are fast drying.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product is named properly, but the only drawback is how long it takes to dry.  I waited a while in between each application of base coat, color, &amp; then this top coat to ensure it would dry good, but it still has little tiny textured scratches in the color.  I&#x27;d say it is not noticeable to others because of how close I have to have my nails to see them, but I can feel that my nails are not smooth.  I do dishes &amp; my hands are on water a lot, but this made my color stay for over a week with no chips.  The only thing you could notice in my nails are where the tips started to rub down the color, but no chips at all.  I would recommend this to anyone who has the time to let it dry (I&#x27;m saying about an hour, seriously).</li>
    <li> I like essie nail polishes.  I use their reds through the fall and winter, their pales/nudes through the spring and summer.  I own the bottles and I go to my local salon for regular manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When essie came out with their &#x27;no chips ahead&#x27; i figured that it had to be well worth the price.  After all, I like the essie colors.  I was sure that their no-chipping top coat would be of similar quality.  At the very least maybe it would lessen or slow down the chipping rate (I&#x27;m a parent with active kids - nails chip.  That&#x27;s just a fact of life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the essie No Chips Ahead top coat worked as a top coat, providing a shiny laquered hardened layer to the top coat of the polish.  However, I did not notice a discernable difference in the chippage rate.  Nails still chipped, polish still flecked off, at its usually pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use my bottle of top coat because, as I said, it was perfectly fine as a top coat.  It just didn&#x27;t inhibit the chippage.</li>
    <li> I love wearing nail polish. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of those girls who can&#x27;t go an entire day without somehow chipping my nail polish. I don&#x27;t have time to fix my nails as often as I chip them, so lately I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any of my gorgeous new nail polish colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out of my regular top coat, and I went to a local store to buy another. I know Essie is a good brand (I have one or two of their polishes), but I was a bit wary about spending nearly $9 on a top coat. However, because it was a local store, I decided to try this. I figured if it didn&#x27;t work as well as it claimed, I could just easily return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat is never going back to the store. Like I said before, I usually chip my nails on the first or second day of applying nail polish. I&#x27;m going on day number four now and there are NO CHIPS. My nails look as amazing as they had been on day one. I am SO happy to finally purchase a top coat that actually works. It was expensive, but clearly worth the money. I highly recommend this top coat!</li>
    <li> I read about this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it because Essie usually chips quickly and easily. I love it. It lasted until I repainted my nails wi only a few chips.</li>
    <li> Ok, I should have listened to all the reviews but I guess I had to see it for myself.  It&#x27;s not so much that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; - that gives the impression that your nails are wet for hours on end.  The problem with this TERRIBLE product is that even when you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it has dried and you go on about your day, the slightest pressure on your nail will leave a huge indentation in your polish. It is really ridiculous.  I had my nails done at the salon and took this product to try it out. This was a 1:00pm.  I went to bed and the next day my nails were all imprinted.  Essie needs to be responsible and take this cr*p off the market.</li>
    <li> truthfully this is such an incredible waste of $9. i got it for prom and planned on doing my own nails to save a little cash so i didn&#x27;t mind the investment. it&#x27;s terrible. i painted my nails while watching TV and didn&#x27;t move or touch anything for the entire hour of the show i was watching and got up, ran my fingers through my hair and had hair stuck to my finger nails. a total waste. also these weird little bubbles pop up every time i use this topcoat. my manicure looks ridiculous. i&#x27;ve used it a handful of times since then thinking it might suck less but it doesn&#x27;t. i really like seche vite topcoat, and i&#x27;ve happily used essie&#x27;s good to go topcoat more than once. no chips ahead is the worst. spend your money somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I usually LOVE Essie&#x27;s base and top coat products, but I&#x27;m very disappointed in the No Chips Ahead top coat.  I normally get the \\&quot;good to go\\&quot; top coat, but I wanted something that was more protecting of my manicure.  I&#x27;ve used No Chips Ahead twice now and both times, even after allowing a couple hours for it to dry, my manicure gets the texture of my sheets on it when I go to bed.  This has never happened with the Good to Go top coat.  I use Essie base coat, two very thin coats of  color with about ten minutes drying time in between all coats and No Chips Ahead on top.  Perhaps some reformulation is needed??</li>
    <li> I love my Essie polishes, but this top coat/ chip resist coat is awful. The brush is too thin and stiff. Other top coats I&#x27;ve used have softer brushes that fan out as you coat the nail which give the finish an even look. This brush just pulls at the polish and leaves streaks. The worst aspect is the fact that it causes those tiny bubbles in the finish. I have never had the bubble problem prior to using this product and it&#x27;s very disappointing considering the effort put into diy manicures.</li>
    <li> So I bought this stuff figuring I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Hello, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I usually give it 20-30 min to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it dried quicker, but waiting those 20-30 min is worth it to have a long lasting manicure.&lt;br /&gt;After that, I was able to go about my day.&lt;br /&gt;Bumping into things &amp; doing my household chores did not make any dents.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers are right, this product takes forever to dry. The best thing you can do is to put VERY little on. And I mean a minuscule amount. If you put it on thickly, it will likely never dry. It does a great job at protecting against chips, that&#x27;s true. But the only way to use it is at least 4-5 hours before bed, sitting on the couch and not doing much else (to prevent nicking your nail surface on something) and using a very small amount of product. If you paint close to bed time, even if the nail surface is dry to the touch, I guarantee you will wake up with sheet marks all over your nails.</li>
    <li> I used to loved Essie polish - the bottles that are 4-5 years old last longer than the newer colors (perhaps a formula change??)  I was very excited to try this product after reading about it in a magazine. It did prevent chipping a little longer than my faithful Revlon top coat, but at twice the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money for an additional day or two without chips. By time day 5 came around, I had chips on all 10 nails. I WOULD NOT recommend this product and plan on returning it to the store I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice. The first time I let it dry for 2-3 hours because I could tell my nails weren&#x27;t dry. I went to bed and woke up with a few nails that were \\&quot;pillow pressed\\&quot;, but it was a VERY light pink (Essie&#x27;s spaghetti strap), so it was hard to see it. The paint job lasted a good week or more, so I was pleased with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I decided to go with a red (Essie&#x27;s fishnet stockings). I painted them at 7 and by 11, they were still wet. I get that this is not a quick dry, but 4 HOURS?! I am married with 2 kids, work a full time job, as most other DIY manicurists, so time is important. I can see 20 minutes, but not 4 hours. Every nail is ruined. I&#x27;m going back to Sally Hansen&#x27;s InstaDry. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying this product doesn&#x27;t dry.. The trick is not to apply the top coat until your freshly polished nails have \\&quot;completely\\&quot; dried. Nail polish drying time is one to two hours. Once you apply the top coat after your nails have fully dried the top coat dries much quicker, about 30 minutes.. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the top coat completely drying following the above method.. Hope this helps....</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a major chain drug-store. It goes on smooth and amazing...HOWEVER IT NEVER DRIES. I used it in the morning and all was fine, and I thought it was dry already by the evening. No sign of any problems. But the next morning I woke up and my nails were all smudged and scratched! I thought it must have been something I did wrong, so I put another coat of top coat on that morning to smooth it out and restore it to smooth and shiny. Again, all was fine during the day, no smudging and no chips, and I went about my business normally (I&#x27;m a student so I don&#x27;t do much except takes books out of my bag and read). But every night I went to bed, I would wake up with smudging! Even on the 4th day! Its insane. HOW IS IT SMUDGING IN MY SLEEP 4 DAYS LATER ??? this is crazy i think im going to call essie customer service and demand a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS. I&#x27;m a nail polish aficionado, and I recommend OPI top coat (although those bottle go fast, halfway through the bottle it becomes gloopy and unusable, but hey the Essie is completely unusable).</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed by this product; it doesn&#x27;t ever really dry, so you end up with imprints in your manicure. Your manicure ends up looking like crap; no shine, plus ridges or fingerprints, etc. And I don&#x27;t mean within 30 minutes; I mean hours later if you press, you&#x27;ll get it to move and smudge. I&#x27;ve woken up the next day after painting my nails a few hours before bed and found my nails looking awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money; it&#x27;s better to have no top coat than this.</li>
    <li> i bought this product because one i love essie and two i normally use good to go as my top coat but it chips too quickly. this product takes for ever to dry but what i do is paint my nails apply this product and then apply good to go on top and my nails dry fast and they dont chip. sounds like alot... but it works for me</li>
    <li> Actually keeps your polish shiny and intact for a week. A week! Through playing guitar, through hours of digging through my purse, through long dog walks, and nervous picking at my nails. Its a damned miracle product.</li>
    <li> It does prevent chipping for a substantial amount of time BUT it really does take a long time to dry. Bedsheets or any other fabric will leave an imprint hours after applied resulting in a loss of shine. I&#x27;ve also had small bubbles appear after applying this top coat (never had this problem before so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s how I&#x27;m applying). I love Essie nail color and quality but I&#x27;m going to get something else next time.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with everyone that it does its job when it comes to no chips. The first time i used it was so happy with the results but since then no matter how long i wait the top coat never dries and it ends up ruining the designs i spent an hour creating on my nails. I havent used it since the third try i waited a day before adding a top coat ive waited four hours before adding the top coat and either way it doesnt dry i even tried using the uv lamp and still nothing.  I will give it 5 stars for no chipping but as for drying and being a decent top coat i give it a one.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my toes, but not so much on my hands. I still think my manicure holds up better with it on though. Its very true about the wait time. Let this dry for 15-20 min!</li>
    <li> Works amazing, best top coat nail polish ever. I love it!!!! Would greatly recommend. My manicure lasts twice as long with minimal chipping. Works really good.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that people were wrong when they said this top coat never dries.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true.  I let it dry for several hours before going to bed and ended up with all sorts of imprints in it the next morning.  I have had it on for 4 1/2 days now and I can still make an impression in it!  Ridiculous!  It is really too bad, because I will say this: after 4 days, I still don&#x27;t have any chips in my polish.  Unfortunately my manicure doesn&#x27;t look good anyway because of all the sheet marks.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter if it prevents chipping if it doesn&#x27;t EVER dry :(</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  It takes at least a half-hour before it is no longer liquid and sticky - but it still isn&#x27;t dry. I let it dry for 2 hours, and it still got wrinkles and creases when I went to bed.  On top of which, it bubbles. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and the shipping was very fast and the polish is great! It does take a while to dry, though.</li>
