      <li>So far, this has been a great product for my baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves it feeling clean, healthy.</li>
      <li>I think the conditioner is too light for my hair - I&#x27;m doubling the application volume to make sure my hair is smooth.</li>
      <li>I ordered two pumps to go with the bottles that makes it so easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it snarls easy when we, but the conditioner helps keep it from doing that.  </li>
      <li>Works well for my fine hair, doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
      <li>This product gives my hair so much volume, I Love it!</li>
      <li>This large size is perfect to refill the smaller sized bottles and saves money.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is incredibly lite, so much so that it does not condition as completely as you might be accustomed to.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is fabulous and smells divine.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>so I give it full stars</li>
      <li>Delivered fast, love this product.</li>
      <li>I have seborrhoeic dermatitis which is aggravated by many oils, so much so that I stopped using conditioner.</li>
      <li>Im sure this particular shampoo/conditioner works wonders for some people.....</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and condition, as older age has made my hair thinner.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and also have higlights -- this is a great daily shampoo and conditioner, but I also needed to add a weekly deep conidtioning product.</li>
      <li>I have twice searched for \\&quot;Redken Fresh Curls\\&quot; and found this near the top of the search results.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise my hair is volumized, I&#x27;m just not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price for the brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but for the price I expected more.</li>
      <li>It came very fast as well</li>
      <li>I have a lot of natural body in my hair, but this duo makes it bouncy and fabulous.</li>
      <li>) you know just something to make my hair feel better or different.</li>
      <li>I decided to splurge on some Redken hoping for more body (obviously</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to constantly go buy more.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They are so large you can&#x27;t handle them with soapy hands.</li>
      <li>Nice product....seems to add a little volume.  </li>
      <li>I like lots of Redken products, but the body full shampoo and conditioner really don&#x27;t work with my fine black straight hair.</li>
      <li>I really like the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in looks, but she said it made her hair easier to manage.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to use more than other redken shampoo/conditioners to get the lather I want....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other kinds/color/products that are a lot better</li>
      <li>I like other Redken products better.</li>
      <li>Love redken, but felt needed a change after going through 3 liters of Redken Extreme</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for everyone who wants to pumper their hair.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Gets the tangles out of my 5yr old&#x27;s hair the best!</li>
    <li> A lot for your money!!</li>
    <li> I would not order again as this said shampoo and conditioner duo and i only received the shampoo :(</li>
    <li> Love Redken products. They make my hair very happy. Great price found on Amazon. Would buy again. Highly recommended for everyone who wants to pumper their hair.</li>
    <li> Love the duo and would order it again.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and also have higlights -- this is a great daily shampoo and conditioner, but I also needed to add a weekly deep conidtioning product.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been a great product for my baby fine hair. Not too heavy, and looks great when I blow dry my hair. Smells awesome. Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Makes hair dry and tangly! And to return!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that really makes a difference in the volume of my hair!  Even after putting on the conditioner, it does not take away the volume. It enhances the shine and volume.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner set. The shampoo cleans my hair thoroughly without repeating, and the conditioner makes it silky enough to run my fingers right through it, even before it&#x27;s dried. I have a lot of natural body in my hair, but this duo makes it bouncy and fabulous. I have a wonderful stylist who gives me great haircuts, and Redken adds the finishing touches. It smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> Love Redken products. Great price for a liter of redken and I don&#x27;t need to constantly go buy more. It came very fast as well so I give it full stars</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser to enhance my curly hair.  It works wonderfully well, and this size is a huge value.  Just be sure to buy the pumps with the bottles.  They are so large you can&#x27;t handle them with soapy hands.</li>
    <li> With a regular shampoo I have to wash my hair everyday, sometimes twice a day to avoid it getting greasy. This shampoo &amp; conditioner is PERFECT for me. I can actually wash my hair every other day now, without it getting greasy because of this shampoo. I love it, I don&#x27;t think I will every go back to any other product. My greasy hair has found its match!</li>
    <li> I like lots of Redken products, but the body full shampoo and conditioner really don&#x27;t work with my fine black straight hair. I have quite oily scalp and my long hair gets a bit dry at the ends. After washing my hair with this product, my hair looks super dry and unhealthy, and it dangles easily. It took me about half an hour to brush through my hair using a professional detangling brush, and it caused tons of breakage. unfortunately I bought quite a big combo.</li>
    <li> Made my hair brittle and dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned that this product may be out of code and possibly counterfeit.  No wonder the price was so low.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price. Love all Redkin hair products!!</li>
    <li> Works great and arrived fast.</li>
    <li> Was what I order is great thanks</li>
    <li> Great deal just wish it would have came with pumps. Trying to find some and not sure what&#x27;s going to work and what wouldn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> After a brief affair with John Freida volume products, I&#x27;m back to Redken.  At first I thought, &amp;#34;OK, John Freida does just as good as Redken at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;ve been throwing my money away&amp;#34;.  So I hopped enthusiastically on the John Freida train.  And, to be fair, I can&#x27;t imagine a world without the John Freida glazes.  However, I found, to my dismay, that although the John Freida products worked well at first, with continued use my hair began breaking off, severely, to the point I have several areas that are too thin to style!  Yikes!  I&#x27;m back to Redken.  The Body Full Shampoo &amp; Conditioner are great, with a herbal type smell.  However, after all this damage I am temporarily going to the &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; line until my hair gets back in shape.  I won&#x27;t stray again!</li>
    <li> Delivered fast, love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It definitely leaves your hair feeling fuller and with a shine.  I love the redken shampoos.  I would recommend this product.  I am very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> I have twice searched for \\&quot;Redken Fresh Curls\\&quot; and found this near the top of the search results.  Since the bottle color is very similar, I have accidentally ordered it.  My fiancee loves this shampoo and conditioner, which is why I give it 5 stars (Fresh Curls, which is perfect for me, also gets 5 stars).</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product if you have sensitive skin. I have seborrhoeic dermatitis which is aggravated by many oils, so much so that I stopped using conditioner. A hairdresser recommended I try this as it relied on cotton oils instead of more common natural and synthetic oils. To my great surprise and relief it has not upset my scalp at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t require these for the body effects advertised, but the lite aspect of the shampoo and conditioner are formulated to leave NO residue, so you don&#x27;t have an accumulation of deposits on your hair. The shampoo is fabulous and smells divine. The conditioner is incredibly lite, so much so that it does not condition as completely as you might be accustomed to. However, if it did, I probably couldn&#x27;t use it. So if you&#x27;re looking for a  truly lite duo that does not leave a residue, this is it.</li>
    <li> This was such a great buy!  I saved over $65 by buying this set as opposed to getting it from my beautician.  This is the best shampoo and conditioner.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how it makes my hair manageable and full.  I have very fine hair and it snarls easy when we, but the conditioner helps keep it from doing that.  Great pair and great price!!</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting something great.doesnt work for me. Try its a 10 products. Conditioner never weighs down my fine long hair. Shine plus. Good shipping here!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo! It&#x27;s the only one where I can actually see the difference in volume!!</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s just wonderful.  What would your expect from Redken products?  It always was and always will be great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t soften/condition my hair, as expected.  I like other Redken products better.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo.  It gets my hair really clean and smells great.  The problem is the conditioner.  I don&#x27;t think it has enough something because my hair is so hard to comb after I shower. This is not true with other conditioners.  I have very fine hair and it is highlighted.</li>
    <li> Really great with my fine hair. Makes it fuller without having to use styling products and heat. Leaves my hair with a healthy shine and nice clean smell. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> great shampoo &amp; Conditioner . thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy expensive shampoos (I&#x27;m more of a Pantene type of girl) I decided to splurge on some Redken hoping for more body (obviously) you know just something to make my hair feel better or different. I can&#x27;t say my hair is any fuller than what it is when I use Pantene. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great either. It&#x27;s ok but for the price I expected more.</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine hair, doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for fine hair.  It makes my hair extremely manageable and easy to style.  My hair does not look greasy when using this combo.  I know that some people feel that buying supermarket shampoo is better because it is cheaper, but I would much rather pay more and have my hair looking nice.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes your hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Recebi o produto dentro do prazo! Amo os produto da Redken!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent product</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and makes my hair very manageable. Thanks for the great price! Will buy this product again</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair so much volume, I Love it! Instead of having flat limp hair, the shampoo &amp; conditioner gives my hair body to style to my liking, or I can let my hair dry wet. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now but have been using salon quality hair products versus drug store products for much longer. I think this is the best for fine hair that needs some TLC. Please keep in mind that because it is salon quality, you do not need as much product for a great effect. In fact if you use too much your hair may get weighed  down or dry out depending on the climate you live in and your hair type. Use only about a nickel sized amount and you should be good to go. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and condition, as older age has made my hair thinner.  This large size is perfect to refill the smaller sized bottles and saves money.</li>
    <li> I think the conditioner is too light for my hair - I&#x27;m doubling the application volume to make sure my hair is smooth. Otherwise my hair is volumized, I&#x27;m just not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price for the brand.</li>
    <li> have always used only salon products on my hair. Love redken, but felt needed a change after going through 3 liters of Redken Extreme (my all time favorite!). sadly, not as impressed with this product. Made my hair look limp, and lifeless. Ended up only using for about ten days,then switched to Redken color protection duo (red bottle) Im sure this particular shampoo/conditioner works wonders for some people.....just NOT ME!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Within a week my hair went from dry and flat to soft, healthy and had tons of volume. So awesome.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this stuff. We got it on sale and she was very happy with the purchase. I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in looks, but she said it made her hair easier to manage.</li>
    <li> It smells like Herbal Essence, which I don&#x27;t care for. It seems watered down compared to the other Redken products that I&#x27;ve used. I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> Not great Redken. I&#x27;ve used other kinds/color/products that are a lot better</li>
    <li> Nice product....seems to add a little volume.  I feel like I have to use more than other redken shampoo/conditioners to get the lather I want....but it does the job!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Never dries out my hair. Leaves it feeling clean, healthy. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks to receive my shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I&#x27;m glad I waited.  It&#x27;s a wonderful saving and the products are the best.  I ordered two pumps to go with the bottles that makes it so easy to use.</li>
