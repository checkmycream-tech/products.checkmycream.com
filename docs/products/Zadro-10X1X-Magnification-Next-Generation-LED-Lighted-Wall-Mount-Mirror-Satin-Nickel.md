      <li>This was very easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Compared to all the others this by far is the BEST !!!!</li>
      <li>Also, the light is really bright and can be somewhat blinding when trying to focus on the 10x side</li>
      <li>Just Right LOL  </li>

      <li>The magnification is great and lights are very helpful.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love about that</li>
      <li>I was well satisfied with the provider.  </li>

      <li>Easy to install I chose to use batteries since it boasts a year battery life.</li>

      <li>Sturdy and easy to mount.</li>
      <li>Easy installation.</li>
      <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
      <li>But the 10X magnification is just too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Took it to a lamp repair store but they could not access the switch or light bulb.</li>
      <li>the light is blinding.</li>
      <li>light quality itself was lackluster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light output from the batteries seems to be the same as with the plug, and both are plenty bright to see all the detailed imperfections in your skin...</li>
      <li>I was so excited to have received this as a gift for Christmas.</li>
      <li>easy to use and pretty too.</li>
      <li>quick shipping</li>
      <li>The light ring is pretty blinding</li>
      <li>easy to install and performs well, my wife loves it so that is all that really matters.  </li>
      <li>so I rarely turn it on.  </li>
      <li>Light around outside of mirror is very adequate.</li>
      <li>Quality was not as good as I had previously owned with this product.  </li>
      <li>sure enough...</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>The 1st one the light went out completely.</li>
      <li>too close to put make up on but close enough to clean face and see pores!</li>
      <li>The right amount of &#x27;true&#x27; lighting (close to outside daylight lighting) and magnification at correct power to tweeze, check makeup, etc.</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves this mirror.</li>
      <li>(I had to take the batteries out because the light would come on it the middle of the night).  </li>
      <li>Bought this mirror, really looking forward to getting it.  </li>
      <li>My husband was all ready to install it, and it didnt work.  </li>
      <li>very sturdy if you can hit a stud in the wall.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>If only I had kept the packaging, we could have returned the mirror (which I had to get my brother to mail the original receipt) to Bed, Bath and Beyond where it was purchased.</li>
      <li>I am ready for a magnifying mirror, and I chose this one because it&#x27;s battery powered -- no hard wiring.</li>
      <li>We just finished putting brand new batteries in it (again!)</li>
      <li>The second worked for about 6 months, then light stated getting dim.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Too bad, because a battery operated lighted mirror was perfect for my needs!!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see how long they last in it :) seems to be built well</li>
      <li>and it was NEW, with a 90 day guarantee</li>
      <li>Not sure if you want more power or</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of the shape of the mirror I could only get a focused image when exactly 2 inches in front of it -</li>
      <li>Quality good but battery accessibility is really poor--having to dismount the whole mirror assembly from the backing plate is inconvenient and</li>
      <li>He told me it could be fixed by soldering the wires and installing a new switch but considering my brother paid over $100 for the item</li>
      <li>The cheap switch broke after about a year and a half.  </li>
      <li>but I have used it on cloudy days with little additional lighting and it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
      <li>The light also is not true spectrum</li>
      <li>Please reconsider purchasing Zadro products or at least make sure they work BEFORE disposing of the packaging</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d plug and unplug it to use which completely defeats the reason I bought it -- a battery powered 10x mirror.  </li>
      <li>and I do get natural lighting and ample sink lighting too-</li>
      <li>Light starts to dim on batteries within a few days of use.</li>
      <li>exactly what we expected it to be!</li>
      <li>Sweet spot seemed small.</li>
      <li>I found a small travel version that lights up and is just right for travel too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Recieved and a very good product. Works great!!</li>
    <li> A SEALED UNIT so when light failed after a few weeks we could not replace unit. As there is only a 90 day return policy we are stuck with it. Took it to a lamp repair store but they could not access the switch or light bulb. Would not recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> This is a poorly designed and built product! I have been wanting a bathroom mirror such as this one for a few years now especially since my eye sight has gotten worse. I was so excited to have received this as a gift for Christmas. Unfortunately, the packing was thrown out with the other holiday papers (which was a BIG mistake on my part!!!) That day, after the trash pick-up, we tried to install the mirror but realized it didn&#x27;t work. My husband is an electrical mechanic and removed the back to find the wires were NEVER welded to the board and the switch would only spin and spin. He told me it could be fixed by soldering the wires and installing a new switch but considering my brother paid over $100 for the item and it was NEW, with a 90 day guarantee, we would return to Zadro for a replacement. They wanted me to pay for shipping both ways. How ridiculous. If only I had kept the packaging, we could have returned the mirror (which I had to get my brother to mail the original receipt) to Bed, Bath and Beyond where it was purchased. After speaking (for the third time) to customer service, they say \\&quot;it is not our policy\\&quot; but the RETURN shipping will be waived...what about MY shipping charges TO the company??? Please reconsider purchasing Zadro products or at least make sure they work BEFORE disposing of the packaging so maybe, you can exchange the item or get your money back.</li>
    <li> Quality was not as good as I had previously owned with this product.  10x mirror also not as good - has some distortion.</li>
    <li> My wife is very satisfied with the mirror.  No complaints</li>
    <li> I returned this item immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the shape of the mirror I could only get a focused image when exactly 2 inches in front of it - No nearer or further. Useless to me as I can&#x27;t fit my shaver between me and the mirror, which is why I need this mirror !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Jerdon 10X/15X mirror in another bathroom - I infinitely prefer that one: I didn&#x27;t experience this focusing issue.</li>
    <li> Quality good but battery accessibility is really poor--having to dismount the whole mirror assembly from the backing plate is inconvenient and re-mounting is a bitch.</li>
    <li> stopped working with-in 9 months.  of course after return policy!  not worth the money!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this mirror. Easy to install I chose to use batteries since it boasts a year battery life. We&#x27;ll see how long they last in it :) seems to be built well and I&#x27;m hoping for it to lasts quite a few years</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a Christmas gift (7 months ago). In the beginning I found it worked great!  I liked the fact that it could run on batteries rather than being plugged in.  But then it went through a LOT of batteries!!  I started wondering if something wasn&#x27;t wrong with the wiring.  We just finished putting brand new batteries in it (again!) when I noticed some fluid coming out of the bottom and running down the wall it was mounted on.  When we opened up the battery area...sure enough...one of the batteries had blown up and I had battery acid running down my wall and peeling the paint!  Something is definitely WRONG with the wiring of this mirror!  This mirror is going back!</li>
    <li> Good but plan on using electricity. Light starts to dim on batteries within a few days of use.</li>
    <li> This was my second mirror. The 1st one the light went out completely. The second worked for about 6 months, then light stated getting dim. It was not the batteries, I had it plugged in. Will NOT buy another from Zadro! UGH!</li>
    <li> I have only had it a month but the light works perfectly and it looks great in my bathroom. done</li>
    <li> Great mirror , I love it!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I was l wanted!!  It doesn&#x27;t take up counter space and can be tucked away when not in use.  The magnification is great and lights are very helpful.  It would be even better if the batteries were rechargeable.</li>
    <li> This mirror was great for 33 days.  Then the switch failed right after the return window closed (I had to take the batteries out because the light would come on it the middle of the night).  So i&#x27;m stuck with it.  I&#x27;d plug and unplug it to use which completely defeats the reason I bought it -- a battery powered 10x mirror.  It was 5 stars for 33 days.  The return policy sucks since it the product is a lemon.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Perfect for applying eye make up and detail work.  I found a small travel version that lights up and is just right for travel too.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this as a gift from my husband and it is perfect.  There are two lighting options, I use batteries and the lighting is more than sufficient.  It is location in my master bath and I do get natural lighting and ample sink lighting too- but I have used it on cloudy days with little additional lighting and it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> The cheap switch broke after about a year and a half.  Tried to open up the base and reattach it, but one of the cheap wires inside was also broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light quality itself was lackluster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, we ended up \\&quot;renting\\&quot; a bathroom mirror for about $6/month, and now it goes in the trash like all the other cheap crap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no problems with this product. Does as advertised. Light around outside of mirror is very adequate. I don&#x27;t understand some of the complaints posted.</li>
    <li> Unusable.Not sure if you want more power or what.  Sweet spot seemed small. Would not recommend.  The search continues. thanks</li>
    <li> The right amount of &#x27;true&#x27; lighting (close to outside daylight lighting) and magnification at correct power to tweeze, check makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror, really looking forward to getting it.  My husband was all ready to install it, and it didnt work.  No light.  Although the batteries were brand new out of the package, we first thought the btteries were bad, so we plugged it in.  No light.  Is the bulb missing?  I would think it should come with a bulb, bit it doesnt say.  So its going back.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy installation.</li>
    <li> Great buy , easy installation, looks great. Has several shower style settings.  Came on time . What&#x27;s not to love about that</li>
    <li> I read all the negative reviews about this mirror stating that either the arm movement was rough or the light intensity was insufficient.  I did not experience either of those problems.  This was very easy to install.  It&#x27;s great that using the AC adapter is not a requirement.  The light output from the batteries seems to be the same as with the plug, and both are plenty bright to see all the detailed imperfections in your skin... ;)  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The mirror was a narrow, oval shape that barely shows one eye when you use it.  It is NOT the round shape pictured online.</li>
    <li> Every day I use this ,it lights up and you can see your makeup so good !!  It&#x27;s Great (Just don&#x27;t stay in it.) You have the tendency to keep looking to make sure you have your make -up Just Right LOL  Compared to all the others this by far is the BEST !!!!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Sturdy and easy to mount. 1x is good for applying make up.  10x Is extremely close....too close to put make up on but close enough to clean face and see pores! Also, the light is really bright and can be somewhat blinding when trying to focus on the 10x side</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think the fixture was well made. Before I installed it, I noticed glue smearied around the rim of mirror. It just wasn&#x27;t the quality I expected it be .</li>
    <li> I was well satisfied with the provider.  However, I did have to return the product because I could not use 10X magnification.  It was too strong for me.</li>
    <li> excellent mirror, easy to mount. quick shipping</li>
    <li> Seemed like a great idea when ordered.  I like the wall mount and the mirror choices are great.  The light ring is pretty blinding so I rarely turn it on.  The light also is not true spectrum so it is not helpful at all for checking or applying makeup.  I should have just bought one with no lights but the electric comes out and there is an off switch so I can ignore that.  OK for plucking hairs but you have to get so close the light is blinding.</li>
    <li> well made and easy to install. very sturdy if you can hit a stud in the wall.  exactly what we expected it to be!</li>
    <li> I am ready for a magnifying mirror, and I chose this one because it&#x27;s battery powered -- no hard wiring. But the 10X magnification is just too strong for me. I&#x27;ll be looking for a 5x or 7x mirror. Too bad, because a battery operated lighted mirror was perfect for my needs!!</li>
    <li> Awsome product if you don&#x27;t want to hard wire!! Brighter when plugged in and not on battery! Would recommend - expectations wee exceeded!!</li>
    <li> easy to use and pretty too.</li>
    <li> easy to install and performs well, my wife loves it so that is all that really matters.  Quality built.</li>
