      <li>It saved me $$$ being able to refill the soap dispenser instead of replacing it.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance; not the price...will use sparingly and then not buy again</li>
      <li>I feel WEALTHY just having it on our counter</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;re better off purchasing online.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this soap.  </li>
      <li>I have had this soap before in another scent (Zucchini Flower Truffle) and liked it for its subtlety and the fact that it faded quickly.</li>
      <li>They were large and looked good on the counters.  </li>
      <li>It lathers great and my hands feel soft after washing, so</li>
      <li>I like a stronger scent and this hand wash has a very mild scent.</li>
      <li>given that this is natural and does not have the dreaded Trisolan, it is remarkable....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Cucina line from Fruits &amp; Passion.</li>
      <li>They are soft and smell good.</li>
      <li>More economical and earth friendly buying the refills for the existing glass pump bottle.</li>
      <li>the smell is fresh, invigorating, engaging.....</li>
      <li>I have use CUCINA for several years and I love it and my guest love it.  </li>
      <li>Clean, fresh smelling and definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Cucina Ginger and Sicillian lemon has a gentle scent that removes kitchen odors from the hands, but isn&#x27;t so strong that it lingers.  </li>
      <li>Still, I would buy it again, but I&#x27;m not a lifelong loyal to this product, and will continue to keep my eyes peeled for more cost-effective, high-quality alternatives.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and left my hands so much softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>Repeat purchase as I love this next to our kitchen sink.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what I should&#x27;ve purchased in the first place.</li>
      <li>CUCINA Purifying Hand Wash (all fragrances) are consistent with quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know when I can buy more hand soap and especially the hand/body lotion.</li>
      <li>It smells great, has no triclosan and does a good job removing rank kitchen odors off the hands.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and is concentrated, seems to last longer than my other liquid soaps.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry hands though I love the lotion as well.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using the hand wash for the past year and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>I went through the handwash much faster than the lotion.  </li>
      <li>But when I got the bottles I realized why they cost so much.</li>
      <li>and it removes garlic and fish smells really well.</li>
      <li>Fruits &amp; Passion, the manufacturer/supplier has been out of this particular flavor for some time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s at least marginally better than the other odor-neutralizing kitchen soaps available I&#x27;ve tried, such as the Method brand&#x27;s product; however, is it so much better as to justify the degree of cost increase involved?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and I buy it again and again.</li>
      <li>Clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out</li>
      <li>It had obviously not been packed right.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find them on amazon in the larger size which should last a long long time.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hands feeling soft afterwards and not dried out.  </li>
      <li>I was under the impression that this was a natural product...</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need to use much because it lathers up quite well and, as a result, lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>This item arrived in a messy box full of goo.  </li>
      <li>Major offenders for the skin...</li>

<li> I was a little disappointed with the size of the refill.  </li>
<li> The product is it bit expensive though.</li>
<li> They did not have padding all around them and were in a flimsy box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this item through Amazon again.</li>
<li> This Ginger and Sicilian Lemon scent is very faint.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife loves this soap, and I like it as well. No store close to us stocks it, so it was nice to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Another great product which we use at home all the time.  Our specific flavor from Fruits &amp; Passion has been Ginger &amp; Sicilian Lemon but I&#x27;m now finding that it&#x27;s difficult to find any more.  Fruits &amp; Passion, the manufacturer/supplier has been out of this particular flavor for some time and they do not respond to my email on the status of the product, so I don&#x27;t know when I can buy more hand soap and especially the hand/body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Cucina line from Fruits &amp; Passion. The scent of this soap is mild yet pleasant.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not too strong.  Just sudsy enough.  My hands don&#x27;t smell like it afterwards. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have use CUCINA for several years and I love it and my guest love it.  My daughter has also started using it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap.  I use it to refill my kitchen and bathroom soap dispensers all the time.</li>
    <li> I like a stronger scent and this hand wash has a very mild scent. It lathers great and my hands feel soft after washing, so I may try another scent in the future.</li>
    <li> Great soap, fantastic smell and it removes garlic and fish smells really well. This particular scent is hard to find so you&#x27;re better off purchasing online.</li>
    <li> I have had this soap before in another scent (Zucchini Flower Truffle) and liked it for its subtlety and the fact that it faded quickly. The quality of this hand wash is the same, but this scent smells like aftershave - there is no resemblance to either ginger or lemon. And it clings to my hands.</li>
    <li> CUCINA Purifying Hand Wash (all fragrances) are consistent with quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CUCINA products also pairs a hand lotion with their hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both (hand wash and lotions) are used through out the household.</li>
    <li> Have been using Cucina products for years.  I have a kitchen soap/lotion dispenser that I use all the time and was happy to have found the soap refill.  It saved me $$$ being able to refill the soap dispenser instead of replacing it.  I love the ginger/lemon scent.  This scent removes cooking orders like onions and garlic from your hands.</li>
    <li> Procuct is great but not in this fragrance</li>
    <li> I received a set of lotion and handwash as a gift.  I went through the handwash much faster than the lotion.  Needed to buy more and came across this handy refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger and lemon smell great.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a messy box full of goo.  It had obviously not been packed right.  I was going to save the box and everything to work to get a refund, but it was such a horrible mess, that I had to get rid of it.  One of the bottles had cracked in the delivery truck.  They did not have padding all around them and were in a flimsy box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this item through Amazon again.</li>
    <li> it is THE BEST........I feel WEALTHY just having it on our counter</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never want a different hand wash in your kitchen again!  I love the scent and it cleans wonderfully.  It doesn&#x27;t dry hands though I love the lotion as well.  Perfect kitchen companions!!  I highly recommend this product and I buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> No real problem with the product.  I just didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh smelling and definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and it leaves your hands nice and smooth because of the oil.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase as I love this next to our kitchen sink.  It smells great, has no triclosan and does a good job removing rank kitchen odors off the hands.  More economical and earth friendly buying the refills for the existing glass pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I keep this nice soap and lotion in my kitchen and bathroom.  Smells great and is concentrated, seems to last longer than my other liquid soaps.</li>
    <li> The soap feels nice and smells real nice.  It leaves your hands feeling soft afterwards and not dried out.  The product is it bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance; not the price...will use sparingly and then not buy again</li>
    <li> A wonderful soap and a treat to use. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> and hopefully will never be with out it.....given that this is natural and does not have the dreaded Trisolan, it is remarkable....I have even mixed it with other soap and used it on my prize possession, my skin, all over and it is wonderful.....the smell is fresh, invigorating, engaging.....try it you&#x27;ll like it, no, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted a refill for a bottle of Cucina Coriander and Olive Tree that I had received as a gift. This Ginger and Sicilian Lemon scent is very faint. Once we use it up, I&#x27;ll definitely get the Coriander and Olive Tree. It&#x27;s what I should&#x27;ve purchased in the first place. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this was a natural product...it contains both SLS and synthetic fragrances. Major offenders for the skin...</li>
    <li> I love the Cucina products however have had trouble finding them in any other than specialty stores where they can be fairly expensive. I was happy to find them on amazon in the larger size which should last a long long time.</li>
    <li> We love Cucina hand soap. My husband asks when it is coming when we run out</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Cucina! They have many great scents---but this is my favorite. Clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out</li>
    <li> cucina&#x27;s purifying hand wash (ginger and sicilian lemon) is a great product.  the hand wash works well and smells amazing.  i&#x27;ve been using the hand wash for the past year and am very satisfied with it.  you don&#x27;t need to use much because it lathers up quite well and, as a result, lasts a long time.  the cucina hand lotion is a good compliment to the the hand wash.</li>

I don&#x27;t know. Still, I would buy it again, but I&#x27;m not a lifelong loyal to this product, and will continue to keep my eyes peeled for more cost-effective, high-quality alternatives.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and left my hands so much softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 dispenser bottles also. I was a little disappointed with the size of the refill.  I did not realize the dispenser bottles were larger than the ones at the store and quite a bit more expensive.  But when I got the bottles I realized why they cost so much. They were large and looked good on the counters.  But I don&#x27;t feel they should sell such a small refill for such large dispenser.  I do like the way my hands feel after I wash them.  They are soft and smell good.</li>
    <li> Cucina Ginger and Sicillian lemon has a gentle scent that removes kitchen odors from the hands, but isn&#x27;t so strong that it lingers.  Great product.</li>
