### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.</li>
      <li>I think I will eventually choose the best one for me.</li>
      <li>wonderful product as always...</li>
      <li>you can see which you prefer the best.</li>

      <li>And it is a great buy too.</li>
      <li>Great product all around.</li>
      <li>Great for the changing seasons.</li>
      <li>but I will say that I think this Dr Jarts set is a great place to start.  </li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using this during summer months because the colors are so fair.  </li>
      <li>but, they&#x27;re also a good travel size.</li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I can wear this even though she is extremely fair</li>
      <li>no skin tone match, but good product</li>
      <li>This set gave me a good idea of what each cream is like.</li>
      <li>Amazing set since you are getting great deluxe sized samples of them all and</li>
      <li>This set gives a lot of product for price, so if you want to just have a good travel size BB kit that is suitable for a variety of environments and seasons, this one is a good one to have.</li>
      <li>Label - my favorite of the 4!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>definitely more suited for fair skinned people.</li>
      <li>I have tried 2 of the four BB creams  and really liked both.</li>
      <li>nice travel size.  </li>
      <li>Generally speaking, I did not find BB cream to be as earth shatteringly wonderful as I was led to believe</li>
      <li>good sized samples and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>These are so handy and easy to tuck in your purse, as well.</li>
      <li>Since I am new the BB craze, I decided to order the sampler so that I could try each one and determine which was the best fit.  </li>
      <li>Medium-light skin tones may be able to use it.  </li>
      <li>I love the gold one with an SPF of 45.  </li>
      <li>Has more of a dewy finish, which I don&#x27;t like as much&lt;br /&gt;Waterfuse - basically like tinted lotion.</li>
      <li>so i got this to figure out which was my favorite.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of people love these</li>
      <li>I think I like the black label the best</li>
      <li>I found the color to be extremely light on all of these.</li>
      <li>These products are great, especially if you are going on a cruise.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this set is great if you want to try out several of BB creams in the Dr. Jart line.</li>
      <li>and I am light to medium complection</li>
      <li>The Black Label was my favorite, but the others are still great to pack in a purse or for travel.</li>
      <li>This BB cream is original and enhance and even out the tone of your skin as a primer to your favorable foundation.</li>
      <li>I ordered this when i used up my full sized Premium tube.</li>
      <li>Personally I love the red one and the original black one the best.</li>
      <li>Both are nice but the black label is better.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage, but glides on smoothly, and feels like nothing is on your skin.</li>
      <li>The containers are nice and simple to use and sanitary.</li>
      <li>it is worth trying this set out.</li>
      <li>You get 2 oz total, which is more product than a full sized tube contains.  </li>
      <li>It was a good way to try them all out and ensure that I wasn&#x27;t missing out on anything.</li>
      <li>Label - haven&#x27;t used this one as much since the shade a little too light for me, but plan to use this more in the winter.</li>
      <li>As a frequent traveler, this set is really useful to have.</li>
      <li>I love the Dr. Jart gold, but wanted to try out the other formulas, to compare.</li>
      <li>Is more moisturizing than the other labels - tend to use this on days I travel on airplanes</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to get all of the product out due to the squeeze packaging and you may not find each one as useful as the next.</li>
      <li>LOVE the black and will be purchasing that one again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used BB cream for a number of years, trying all sorts of brands, and I find that the Dr. Jart products are high quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I like the high SPF though.</li>
      <li>I have blonde hair and blue eyes and this was still too light for me.</li>
      <li>Dr Jarts is a good product and there are subtle differences between the various types so for the price</li>
      <li>/&gt;Renewalist - suited for fair skin; a little thicker in consistency than the others - more dry than the waterfuse but not as dry as the black label.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough.  I need extra moisturizer, even before applying  the blue (water) tube.  Medium-light skin tones may be able to use it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using this during summer months because the colors are so fair.  I like the high SPF though.</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped for although set was a great way to try each of the formulas.</li>
    <li> I prefer the gold one of the bunch, which is the one they sell at Sephora. It is amazing. The others are too thick or have a strange consistency and/or color. It was a good way to try them all out and ensure that I wasn&#x27;t missing out on anything.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when i used up my full sized Premium tube. Great product all around. You should know that they vary slightly in shade. From lightest to darkest it seems to be: Water Fuse, Renewalist, Premium, Black Label. However, since it&#x27;s a beauty balm they all blend in well. Great for the changing seasons.</li>
    <li> Since I am new the BB craze, I decided to order the sampler so that I could try each one and determine which was the best fit.  LOVE the black and will be purchasing that one again.  These are so handy and easy to tuck in your purse, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot about Dr. Jart BB Creams but didn&#x27;t know which one to choose. This set gave me a good idea of what each cream is like. The Black Label was my favorite, but the others are still great to pack in a purse or for travel.</li>
    <li> i bought this set because i knew i wanted to try Dr Jart+ BB Cream, but didn&#x27;t know which one to get so i got this to figure out which was my favorite. i like them all but the black and gold were the winners so i ended up buying a full-size black one. but, they&#x27;re also a good travel size.</li>
    <li> I know Dr. Jart BB cream well and I like the travel size that is convenient to carry. This BB cream is original and enhance and even out the tone of your skin as a primer to your favorable foundation.</li>
    <li> wonderful product as always...good sized samples and arrived quickly. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people love these but they were just so oily and grey looking on me. I regret ordering them because they&#x27;re really expensive, and I disliked all of them.</li>
    <li> I have tried 2 of the four BB creams  and really liked both. I think I will eventually choose the best one for me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. I found the color to be extremely light on all of these. I have blonde hair and blue eyes and this was still too light for me. I looked like a ghost after I applied it.</li>
    <li> These products are great, especially if you are going on a cruise.  I love the gold one with an SPF of 45.  And it is a great buy too. You get 2 oz total, which is more product than a full sized tube contains.  Both my daughter and I can wear this even though she is extremely fair and I am light to medium complection</li>
    <li> Hate this stuff! It is so pink and so chalky. Wort BB ever!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried both the water fuse and the black label. Both are nice but the black label is better. I only use it a couple of times a week and haven&#x27;t gotten through one tube in almost three months. You only need a little bit. It&#x27;s not quite enough to cover my redness entirely so sometimes I use a powder over it.</li>
    <li> Generally speaking, I did not find BB cream to be as earth shatteringly wonderful as I was led to believe but I will say that I think this Dr Jarts set is a great place to start.  Dr Jarts is a good product and there are subtle differences between the various types so for the price it is worth trying this set out.</li>
    <li> I love the Dr. Jart gold, but wanted to try out the other formulas, to compare. They are convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> Amazing set since you are getting great deluxe sized samples of them all and you can see which you prefer the best. Personally I love the red one and the original black one the best.</li>
    <li> As a frequent traveler, this set is really useful to have. I&#x27;ve used BB cream for a number of years, trying all sorts of brands, and I find that the Dr. Jart products are high quality for the price. Within the set here is what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Label - my favorite of the 4! The bottle is almost empty; doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, medium coverage, medium consistency-  con is that throughout the day, it is a little drying for my skin&lt;br /&gt;Premium Label - haven&#x27;t used this one as much since the shade a little too light for me, but plan to use this more in the winter. Lighter coverage than the black label and definitely more suited for fair skinned people. Has more of a dewy finish, which I don&#x27;t like as much&lt;br /&gt;Waterfuse - basically like tinted lotion. Doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage, but glides on smoothly, and feels like nothing is on your skin. Is more moisturizing than the other labels - tend to use this on days I travel on airplanes&lt;br /&gt;Renewalist - suited for fair skin; a little thicker in consistency than the others - more dry than the waterfuse but not as dry as the black label. Provides medium coverage; again a little dewy, which I don&#x27;t like (I prefer matte finishes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set is great if you want to try out several of BB creams in the Dr. Jart line. The containers are nice and simple to use and sanitary. You won&#x27;t be able to get all of the product out due to the squeeze packaging and you may not find each one as useful as the next. I sometimes use two on my face depending on the type of coverage and moisture I want. This set gives a lot of product for price, so if you want to just have a good travel size BB kit that is suitable for a variety of environments and seasons, this one is a good one to have.</li>
    <li> nice travel size.  I think I like the black label the best</li>
    <li> no skin tone match, but good product</li>
