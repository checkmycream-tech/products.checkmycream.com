<li> * Covergirl Shadowblast is good for an eyeshadow base  *</li>
<li> I didnt even leave the house and didnt lay down or barely move.</li>
<li> I found it very difficult to blend the colors (and then had to wipe my fingers off excessively) and it just didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
<li> I got annoyed that this would happen when I first got it.</li>
<li> It lasts several hours without needing to be touched up and can be worn any time of day by varying how heavily you apply it.</li>
<li> Not much pigmentation  *</li>
<li> It is not too dark where you look like a forest animal.  </li>
<li> Do not try to use as a base under powdered shadows either, the color will not hold and the product will crease even more.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; with the thin end and the &amp;#34;blunt&amp;#34; end doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
<li> , I keep it in a small baggie now.</li>
<li> I was running late.</li>
<li> I am buying this here as its no longer in stores (don&#x27;t you hate when they take stuff off the shelf too fast?).</li>
<li> Have been using it awhile and was disappointed when local stores stopped selling it.</li>
<li> Put on at 4:30pm and by 5pm it had creased so bad that all the color was gone from my eyelid.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed because I ordered two of these</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I am buying this here as its no longer in stores (don&#x27;t you hate when they take stuff off the shelf too fast?). I liked this product a lot, but as other reviewers have stated, the sticks break really easily which is annoying. The color however is wonderful and its so easy to get the smokey eye look with this product. All you have to do is roll on the bronze and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I love this! My local store doesn&#x27;t carry them any more so I have to buy them online but it is so worth it. I use Shadowblast Bronze Fire, works very as an every day type make up and accents blue eyes beautifully. It&#x27;s quick to apply and doesn&#x27;t take up much room if you carry your make up in your purse. Personally, I don&#x27;t wear this for a night out but for office or daytime eye shadow it is just enough. My favorite part about this is that it doesn&#x27;t smear so you don&#x27;t need to use primer.</li>
    <li> the ads and videos make this product look like the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, it doesn&#x27;t go on so smoothly and easily at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to constantly rub the tip back and forth for several times until you start to see the desired looks and even then, its not an all-over coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t even bother with this. just do it the old-fashioned way.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice combination eye makeup. But it was more shimmery than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> * Covergirl Shadowblast is good for an eyeshadow base  * Not much pigmentation  * Does apply smoothly, I use to keep at work since it is easy to store, does not take up room  * Still not my best buy, but enjoyed trying.</li>
    <li> Very fast service and product was great.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup of all times, sadly i can no longer find it in any stores. Thankfully amazon has everything for all my shopping needs. If you have contacts and can&#x27;t use powder eye shadow for fear of the dreadful debris stuck to your contact then this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Put on at 4:30pm and by 5pm it had creased so bad that all the color was gone from my eyelid. I didnt even leave the house and didnt lay down or barely move. The light side didnt even apply well on my eyelid. Both sides fell off as soon as I opened it. It is now completely gone from my eyelid. I didnt even go outside yet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give this a try as a time savor for mornings I was running late. Do not waste your time or money! The product color is alright, both light and dark shades, however the product consistancy is that of colored vaseline. Even with the best eye shadow primer this product will goop and crease within 30 mins of application. Do not try to use as a base under powdered shadows either, the color will not hold and the product will crease even more. A very dissapointing buy!</li>
    <li> Love it! I wish CoverGirl would put it back in stores. I can do my make up in 5 minutes with the Shadow Blast pencil.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed because I ordered two of these and they had both been melted and weren&#x27;t usable</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow; it doesn&#x27;t crease with wear and it goes on smoothly.  My only problem was that both plastic caps on the end cracked and broke apart.  I don&#x27;t know why.  I love it so much, I keep it in a small baggie now.</li>
    <li> love these, they go on easy and our just the right shades I also like the pink and plum Great!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not smokey. It goes on very easily however the color fades fast making it more of a neutral brown.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Shadowblast variety. I wear it often. It lasts several hours without needing to be touched up and can be worn any time of day by varying how heavily you apply it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; with the thin end and the &amp;#34;blunt&amp;#34; end doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  I found it very difficult to blend the colors (and then had to wipe my fingers off excessively) and it just didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> Easy and quick to apply and to remove.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow!  Have been using it awhile and was disappointed when local stores stopped selling it. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be discontinued by Cover Girl. Stays on all day and removes easily. Powders tend to end up where they don&#x27;t belong, this stays put. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye-shadow product, very hard to find in stores. Strongly recommended if you prefer creme over powder shadow.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick.  It looks so pretty and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and it goes on my lid well. But the second day that I got it one of the end just broke off!!!!! I got annoyed that this would happen when I first got it. But this is what I get from this price. It does well but just not &amp;#34;strong enough&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love how easy the CoverGirl Smoky Shadowblast is to apply.  And I love the brown tone.  It is not too dark where you look like a forest animal.  The shadows did fall out, but they still work.  I have tried many shades and this one is a winner, so the slight inconvenience is worth the great convenience of a quick application before heading out the the door!</li>
