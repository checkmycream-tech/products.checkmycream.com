      <li>Very nice and</li>
      <li>You Kindly!</li>
      <li>I could have given it 5 stars for the scent is quite good - not fruity as nowadays everything from shampoo to lotion to perfume, all smell like fruits.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully comforting and clean.</li>
      <li>It is a very pleasant smell, better than most body wash, I think.</li>
      <li>I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this scent, but I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.</li>
      <li>the stranger the better!</li>
      <li>It has a cleaner and refreshing scent and has become one of my staple favorites!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep my nose away from my wrist for most of the day!    </li>
      <li>In my opinion it is hazardous to your nose and sense of smell.  </li>
      <li>But, not the kind of soapy smell that the name suggests.</li>
      <li>Most of my boarding school mates used this detergent and I would get some from them when my beloved Klin detergent ran out (</li>
      <li>This is Amazon&#x27;s response:   \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but it did not smell like laundry to me.</li>
      <li>Clean brand warm cotton is much better!</li>
      <li>And this is a HUGE bottle for the price!</li>
      <li>Really refreshing smell</li>
      <li>those they-people sure say a lot of stuff..)  </li>
      <li>This smells more like a room fragrance than perfume.</li>
      <li>but I find the scent selection fun and charming</li>
      <li>Will buy more</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Ladies love this smell,  after my workouts and shower</li>
      <li>It reminds me of when your favorite shirt comes out of the dryer and you throw it on.</li>
      <li>I suppose this makes sense given that you use more soap when doing laundry than when showering.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sent.</li>
      <li>My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work.</li>
      <li>truly can&#x27;t understand how so many people are so AMAZED about this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Extremely refreshing</li>
      <li>( The size of the bottle is pretty good.</li>
      <li>, I really love it, it&#x27;s a easy to go smell.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a low cost alternative to the awesome Clean scents.</li>
      <li>I love how clean this scent is.</li>
      <li>I do not understand how Amazon could so easily ship it to me ...</li>
      <li>Lovely, clean fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Nice scent when you first spary it</li>
      <li>Huge bottle for the price</li>
      <li>Light and clean...not cloying or thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>smells kinda like cheap dryer sheets.  </li>
      <li>I read all the reviews before purchasing and I was very excited when I saw that it smells just like fresh laundry</li>
      <li>I mean, I have good fresh, clean fragrances that are amazing and way worth the price (and you can find them here at a great price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean.</li>
      <li>There is no way that I have a recollection of clean clothes when I put this on.</li>
      <li>I get compliments all the time on my Clean scents,  </li>
      <li>Clean has one that smells like a mans&#x27; T shirt, but that&#x27;s not the smell</li>
      <li>The smell is not off putting, just not the clean smell I wanted.</li>
      <li>This one is great soft smell and very clean smelling long lasting smell and it is one of the great smells they have.</li>
      <li>I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples.</li>
      <li>This just has a sweet smell and that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>Why no one can come up with a smell of a fresh clean shirt.</li>
      <li>It is great to spray on if you are walking out the door to give you a little splash of cologne.</li>
      <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful scent albeit HEAVILY soapy!</li>
      <li>Nothing special, very chemically.</li>
      <li>For something more conventionally soapy, Demeter Pure Soap would do though I think Laundromat is worth sampling :).</li>
      <li>fast shipping good quality Laundromat is a classic clean scent best for hot days you want to cool down cuz it can be a little sharp and headachy like walking down the laundry detergent aisle in a grocery store but good too.  </li>
      <li>Laundromat is really fabulous, the scent of soap and bubbles, clean laundry and soft comfort hugs me when I wear it, and it&#x27;s especially great when I wear anything made from cotton or anything soft and fuzzy, it makes me feel like I stepped into a fluffy blue cloud.</li>
      <li>However, this was not what I was told the first time I called</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to take a chance, smell this dish soap first to get an idea.</li>
      <li>In a nutshell, nice scent but not what I had expected.</li>
      <li>In fact, it smells exactly like the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Instead I got something more reminiscent of a Janitors Closet than a Laundromat.</li>
      <li>The scent is very clean and fresh, definitely my favorite scent form all the other brands that try to make a clean, blue fragrance, some smell too much like soap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big perfume-wearer, but I this bright scent acts as an instant pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>I am glad that at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like fruits or flowers or overwhelmingly perfumey.</li>
      <li>sprayed it on my wrist, and at first it smell like alcohol like PURE alcohol,and that smell never went away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>To me, it smells similar to Nina Ricci scent which is mild and sweet.</li>
      <li>but when I received it for Christmas and took that first sniff my high hopes were deflated.  </li>
      <li>It is available at any regular supermarket like walmart.</li>
      <li>Really a relaxing scent.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of fresh laundry I will buy just about anything  to keep the smell around for as long as possible.</li>
      <li>I still shower and wash my clothes but an extra spray of clean doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt.</li>
      <li>couldnt even smell any of top note or middle note, and I could barely smell bottom</li>
      <li>If someone who likes soapy scents gave it a few more tries to get used to the combo, I am confident they would change their minds and fall for this scent.</li>
      <li>Demeter&#x27;s &amp;#34;Laundromat&amp;#34; scent smells similar to newly washed clothing fresh from the cleaners!</li>
      <li>My advise is: Save a little more money and get a real fragrance that at least lasts more than 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>Clever Amazon.</li>
      <li>Maybe I had high expectations, who knows.</li>
      <li>It is a very light glacier green liquid dish soap.</li>
      <li>The scent is linear and stays this way even in the dry down which in this case is a good thing.</li>
      <li>I suppose in that respect Demeter might have failed with this one but imagine my surprise when I sniffed it and it smelled EXACTLY like Omo detergent powder!!!!!</li>
      <li>I wish it would last all day like some other fragrances, but since it&#x27;s such a pleasant smell, I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
      <li>While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order.</li>
      <li>The bright blue small granules of Omo!!</li>
      <li>liquid is supposed to be clear, but when I got it, it was yellowish lime</li>
      <li>While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired.</li>
      <li>This product is a bit flowery sort of old ladyish.  </li>
      <li>739 ml]]dish soap called \\&quot;soft touch with Aloe\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It does not have as much lightness/brightness as regular soapy scents</li>

    <li> This one is great soft smell and very clean smelling long lasting smell and it is one of the great smells they have.</li>
    <li> While the products are all as described, the service from Demeter Fragrance Library left much to be desired. I placed an order of 1 full sized cologne spray and two samples. My order came with a free sample which was delightful, except that one sample arrived completely shattered and the sample spray pump did not work. I contacted Demeter Fragrance Library immediately to report the issue and was advised that if I were to return the defective products they would be more than happy to exchange or replace them. I was told I would be refunded for the shipping cost for having to mail my damaged products back to them. This was not the case. While they sent me new products and refunded me for the one item I returned, I was not reimbursed shipping and it took me a week to get a hold of someone at the company who told me that they never reimburse shipping back unless you return the whole order. However, this was not what I was told the first time I called or I would have never sent it back. Now I&#x27;m out more for the shipping than I would have been just for the broken perfume sample. The woman I spoke to basically told me that no one could have possibly told me that I would be refunded unless I shipped the whole order back to them because \\&quot;It&#x27;s never been that way so I don&#x27;t know how that could be possible.\\&quot; Way to make your customer feel great. I&#x27;ll never place an order with them again. Order from an external website if you must.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing and I was very excited when I saw that it smells just like fresh laundry but when I received it for Christmas and took that first sniff my high hopes were deflated.  The scent is nice but it did not smell like laundry to me. I was hoping for a downy, snuggle or bounce type smell.  This product is a bit flowery sort of old ladyish.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective bottle or not but I just wanted to share my experience.</li>
    <li> I could have given it 5 stars for the scent is quite good - not fruity as nowadays everything from shampoo to lotion to perfume, all smell like fruits. I am glad that at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like fruits or flowers or overwhelmingly perfumey. To me, it smells similar to Nina Ricci scent which is mild and sweet. In fact, it smells exactly like the [[ASIN:B00099XLBC Palmolive Dry Skin with Aloe, 25 fl oz (1.56 pt) 739 ml]]dish soap called \\&quot;soft touch with Aloe\\&quot;. It is a very light glacier green liquid dish soap. If you don&#x27;t want to take a chance, smell this dish soap first to get an idea. It is available at any regular supermarket like walmart. It is a very pleasant smell, better than most body wash, I think. But, not the kind of soapy smell that the name suggests. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like laundry, dryer sheets, or detergent; not even close:( The size of the bottle is pretty good. The smell doesn&#x27;t last on your body unless you also spray some on your clothes. In a nutshell, nice scent but not what I had expected.</li>
    <li> When I got the sample, I kinda had ideas of what to expect. I mean, it is called Laundromat so I figured at the very least, it should smell of laundry detergent and/or dryer sheets and/ or fabric softener. Well, it does not smell like any of these to me at least not in the North American laundry/laundromat way. I suppose in that respect Demeter might have failed with this one but imagine my surprise when I sniffed it and it smelled EXACTLY like Omo detergent powder!!!!! The bright blue small granules of Omo!! Oh My Goodness!! I still can&#x27;t believe it. Most of my boarding school mates used this detergent and I would get some from them when my beloved Klin detergent ran out (gosh I miss my Klin! Nothing like it).    Anyways Omo, I mean Laundromat :P, has a non-floral, dark soapy scent if that means anything. It does not have as much lightness/brightness as regular soapy scents and I think this makes it odd to some people who reject it quickly because they don&#x27;t understand such a combination but it works!!! If someone who likes soapy scents gave it a few more tries to get used to the combo, I am confident they would change their minds and fall for this scent. It is a beautiful scent albeit HEAVILY soapy! I am talking soapiness to the MAX! I suppose this makes sense given that you use more soap when doing laundry than when showering. The scent is linear and stays this way even in the dry down which in this case is a good thing. It lasted at least 8 hours on me. For something more conventionally soapy, Demeter Pure Soap would do though I think Laundromat is worth sampling :).</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of Demeter fragrances for the past twelve years or more, my old time favorites were scents such as  Gingerale, Salt Air, Condensed Milk, Angel Food Cake...the stranger the better! I never had the inclination to wear Holy Water, Martini or Lobster but I find the scent selection fun and charming, one note wonders are very complex even though they are meant to smell like one thing.    Laundromat is really fabulous, the scent of soap and bubbles, clean laundry and soft comfort hugs me when I wear it, and it&#x27;s especially great when I wear anything made from cotton or anything soft and fuzzy, it makes me feel like I stepped into a fluffy blue cloud. The scent is very clean and fresh, definitely my favorite scent form all the other brands that try to make a clean, blue fragrance, some smell too much like soap but this is really wonderful. I still shower and wash my clothes but an extra spray of clean doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt. When I get sick of florals I always reach for Laundromat, it echoes my favorite musk scents that I grew up wearing.    - Kasia S</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this scent, but I&#x27;m so happy I bought it. It reminds me of when your favorite shirt comes out of the dryer and you throw it on. It&#x27;s wonderfully comforting and clean. I couldn&#x27;t keep my nose away from my wrist for most of the day!    The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last. I wish it would last all day like some other fragrances, but since it&#x27;s such a pleasant smell, I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it. I want it in candle form!</li>
    <li> I like the scent but the aerosol is very hard on my lungs. It makes me cough and short of breath every time I spray it on.</li>
    <li> smells kinda like cheap dryer sheets.  I was hoping for the smell of gain or tide.  The smell is not off putting, just not the clean smell I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love how clean this scent is. It is great to spray on if you are walking out the door to give you a little splash of cologne. I wish it lasted a little longer so it is definitely more like a body spray than an actual perfume that will last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always thought they should make a wearable fragrance that smells like a dryer (fabric softener) sheet.  (\\&quot;they\\&quot; being the proverbial they-people they always talk about... oops, there \\&quot;they\\&quot; are again... those they-people sure say a lot of stuff..)  anyway, back to my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells like a dryer (fabric softener) sheet!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demeter did good!  And this is a HUGE bottle for the price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sent. Extremely refreshing</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like that 60-year-old English teacher who taught you in the third grade, this is your fragrance.  It is called Laundromat. After smelling the fragrance, I do not know if they are referring to the scent of clothes that have yet to be laundered.  Buyers Beware: Once you make the mistake of buying this stinky concoction, you cannot return it to Amazon. I know, I tried. This is Amazon&#x27;s response:   \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;  I agree with the reference to \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot;. In my opinion it is hazardous to your nose and sense of smell.  I do not understand how Amazon could so easily ship it to me ... but I cannot ship it back.   Brilliant Business Model: I can ship stuff to you (and you must pay me) ... but because of \\&quot;Local, State and Federal regulations\\&quot; you cannot ship it back to me ... and I get to keep your money.  Clever Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ladies love this smell,  after my workouts and shower I go home with this smell on me and my lady just loves it, and she tells her freinds about it.</li>
    <li> It smells nothing like demeter laundromat I know.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is supposed to be clear, but when I got it, it was yellowish lime color.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on my wrist, and at first it smell like alcohol like PURE alcohol,and that smell never went away.&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt even smell any of top note or middle note, and I could barely smell bottom note.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it,  but I couldnt. According to amazon policy, we cant return this kind of liquid item because its flammable and hazrdous or something.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed in both amazon and demeter.</li>
    <li> Demeter&#x27;s &amp;#34;Laundromat&amp;#34; scent smells similar to newly washed clothing fresh from the cleaners! It has a cleaner and refreshing scent and has become one of my staple favorites!</li>
    <li> Really a relaxing scent.  Smells like the name.  Will buy more</li>
    <li> The essence of car part degreaser might be a better name for this nasty mess. I was hoping for a low cost alternative to the awesome Clean scents. Instead I got something more reminiscent of a Janitors Closet than a Laundromat. Avoid.</li>
    <li> Very nice and the price was great.. Really refreshing smell, I really love it, it&#x27;s a easy to go smell.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for the price fast shipping good quality Laundromat is a classic clean scent best for hot days you want to cool down cuz it can be a little sharp and headachy like walking down the laundry detergent aisle in a grocery store but good too.  Hard to explain.  It&#x27;s fresh.  It&#x27;s clean.</li>
    <li> The spary nozzle did not function.  I replaced the spray nozzle but this is no Laundromat by Demeter.  There is only an alcohol smell as if someone took a small amount of Laundromat and mixed it with additonal alcohol.  There is no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time user of Laundromat by Demeter and this is not it.</li>
    <li> Nice scent when you first spary it but it does not linger on your skin.  I get compliments all the time on my Clean scents,  I purchased several of the Demeter scents based on reviews.  None of the scents have staying power and I have not received a single compliment on the scents.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Like you just pulled your clothes out of the drier!</li>
    <li> Not the fragrance I was looking for, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Light and clean...not cloying or thick.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of spritzes of this in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;m not a big perfume-wearer, but I this bright scent acts as an instant pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a scent similar to my detergent or fabric softener. This reminds me of my mom&#x27;s perfume which is a gardenia scent but mixed with a citrus tone. Not to my liking whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asking myself the same question over and over : Why did I spent money on this? Not just that, I also got nFresh Ginger and Pink Grapefruit!&lt;br /&gt;They are worthless, the scent disappears after a few minutes, even body mist are stronger and long lasting than this!&lt;br /&gt;I truly can&#x27;t understand how so many people are so AMAZED about this fragrance. Maybe I had high expectations, who knows. I mean, I have good fresh, clean fragrances that are amazing and way worth the price (and you can find them here at a great price too)like Lalique White and Mugler Cologne. My advise is: Save a little more money and get a real fragrance that at least lasts more than 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a product with same brand and it was great. this one is really bad.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of fresh laundry I will buy just about anything  to keep the smell around for as long as possible. I&#x27;m so happy I have a fragrance to wear that smells like it now!!!</li>
    <li> This smells more like a room fragrance than perfume. Nothing special, very chemically. Clean brand warm cotton is much better!</li>
    <li> Seems like is has mineral oil in it. It&#x27;s like a moisturizing body spray. This consistency is not the same as the smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> Lovely, clean fragrance.  My favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Kindly!</li>
    <li> There is no way that I have a recollection of clean clothes when I put this on. Why no one can come up with a smell of a fresh clean shirt. This just has a sweet smell and that&#x27;s it. Clean has one that smells like a mans&#x27; T shirt, but that&#x27;s not the smell I want.&lt;br /&gt;And the search goes on!!!!!</li>
