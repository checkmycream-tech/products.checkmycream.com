<li> but this serum thickens my super thin hair &amp; makes it shine.</li>
<li> If your hair is dry, brittle from flat irons, highlights, etc this product truly nourishes hair!</li>
<li> Just wish the hair mask lasted as long as the serum.</li>
<li> And it gave me shine, which is harder to do because my hair is blonde.</li>
<li> I use 2-3 times a week just on lower half of hair (my hair is fairly long though)</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t build up on the hair and weigh it down.  </li>
<li> my hair is so thin</li>
<li> Nothing bad to say</li>

    <li> The hair mask is great &amp; I love it. The only reason I&#x27;d not give this five stars is I&#x27;m not a fan of the sandalwood scent in the serum. It used to have a more floral that I much preferred.</li>
