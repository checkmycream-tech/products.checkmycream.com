      <li>For 1/10th the price I could have bought something that works better.  </li>

      <li>A friend recommended this product and I decided to give it a try, and I am so glad</li>
      <li>Love this eyebrow color and filler.</li>
      <li>It is okay - but&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
      <li>brow pencil or powder is better.</li>
      <li>The Dermstore and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Many ladies like this look.</li>
      <li>I suggest an ash color that most ladies, of all skin tones, can wear.</li>
      <li>Maybe that will be better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Hope this color works better for me</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t quite water proof but stays on most of the time in the pool</li>
      <li>but it holds up better than pencilled-in fillers.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love it will buy again.</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
      <li>but, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, with some practice it can create a lovely brow.</li>
      <li>and you look a lot more polished with brows done.</li>
      <li>I am a brunette, however the color is really more reddish / light brown.  </li>
      <li>Color  too light, even if you try to apply more does not work for brunettes.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair and learned very quickly to stay away from any type of brown pencil shade - they all seem to have a reddish undertone which, to me, is almost &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34; and draws unwanted attention to your brow</li>
      <li>If you have an imperfection, easy to correct.  </li>
      <li>Find it easy to apply and has staying power.</li>
      <li>It is not as easy to use as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to use and the intensity of the color you apply is easily controlled.</li>
      <li>I feel I have come up with a solution that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and is fairly easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Takes a steady hand and a lot of practice, but this product does a good job.</li>
      <li>Groomed eyebrows don&#x27;t solve all the attendant issues with alopecia, but it helps to be able to look in the mirror and see the face you know and love :)</li>
      <li>Applying takes a steady hand and good eyes, so start off with LIGHT strokes.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy  :)</li>
      <li>Soap and water works fine.  </li>
      <li>If you ignored the directions, and just used the brush applicator to color your existing brow hairs, it might do just fine.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to draw on fine hairs with the &amp;#34;eyeliner type&amp;#34; brush sparingly...then brush the rest of the brow (if you have some hair) with the brush.</li>
      <li>It takes a little practice to make it look best though.</li>
      <li>4 stars because there should be a shade between brunette and brown/black available,</li>
      <li>Brows look great and the product actually stays put.  </li>
      <li>It does require a light touch in the application.</li>
      <li>Light color too light&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
      <li>Now I am able to use it &amp; rarely have to redo.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product in some ways – and much needed.</li>
      <li>You just need to use it lightly.  </li>
      <li>That seems to make them fuller and they don&#x27;t look like they have been filled</li>
      <li>Fantastic product - Works as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more right now.</li>
      <li>You need to practice as with any new application, but I love this stuff!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is the only eyebrow makeup that I have found that stays on my oily skin ALL day!!  Actually I found another brand that is very similar but has a very fat brush making application difficult.  My ONLY complaint is that it does not seem to last really long</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it would be. Will take some getting used to. Lots of liquid comes out on the brush so you have to be sure to wipe a lot off before applying it.</li>
    <li> Only product I&#x27;ve ever used for brows that doesn&#x27;t smear!</li>
    <li> I bought this from another retailer. I did not see any fibers as claimed.To me it was just like spreading liquid eyeliner on your brows. The reviewer who said Eddie Munster is correct. Brunette was a rust color &amp; it applies heavily, even when barely &amp;#34;dotting&amp;#34; on the brows. I had to wipe off half of it, then use the mascara-like wand. Even then it did not look natural. My eyebrow powder looks much more natural. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I can make my brows looks as good as they do when I get them done at the spa with SMARTBROW!</li>
    <li> washes right off. Terrible product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Natural looking easy to use.</li>
    <li> Mixed review.... I love how the product works however, too high of a price for so little product.... never again</li>
    <li> actually this is pretty good! Certainly far from semi-permanent, it is off by the end of the day, and I never use the liquid filler - what  amess1 BUT JUST Brush the stuff on the brows and it was very nice, it makes the brows stay put and you look a lot more polished with brows done. I wish it stayed on longer, but, whatever. It works very well. Just go slow slow slow at the start till you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS ITEM!  Takes a little practice.  I had to redo several times in the beginning.  Now I am able to use it &amp; rarely have to redo.  Much cheaper than a tattoo!  Looks like me &amp; not like the old fashioned penciled in scary eyebrows.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> It was a little dark for me. Might need to get blonde. It takes a little to get a handle on how to apply. Once I do I am sure it will be good</li>
    <li> best brow product ever. so natural. lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product was tricky for me at first. Went on too heavy and looked silly. For a while, I only used the mascara type brush applicator and that gave me plenty of coverage. When the brush started to dry out I went back to using the little wand applicator first and then brushing it out. Works great!! I didn&#x27;t love this at first but it&#x27;s grown on me. I&#x27;m ordering more right now.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect, but I do not like the brush, it is a brush usually used for mascara, way to big for eyebrows. So I use the smaller liner brush. Wish the other brush was smaller</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product.</li>
    <li> It drips and streaks and is impossible to handle and slow to dry. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> Works great but you have to very careful putting it on because it gets to heavy. Not sure what the little brush is for.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a great product for thinner brows. It sucks, video makes it look so easy, but it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> Did not work for me...is only good for drawing a line on thin brows</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the application of the product. My eyebrows are thin and patchy, I found it difficult to apply without it being to heavy and unnatural looking. Sorry</li>
    <li> To begin with, the color of this product is all wrong - not just for me, for almost anyone. It has significant red undertones&#x27; and a general ruddy color. Any of your Standard brow products&#x27; from Tarte&#x27; Anastasia of Beverly hills etc, are going to have grayish undertones, because shockingly people don&#x27;t go around with bright red eyebrows, even those of us who have red hair. The paint is thick and it does not look natural to paint ones eyebrows with a thick paint. And the setting gel is just more of the same red paint on a brush roller. Definitely does not contain any of the hair building fibers that a product like Benefits gimme brow does. The gel makeup remover that comes with this product is absolutely lovely though, so that&#x27;s positive.</li>
    <li> Finally an easier way to reform your brows after plucking them for years &amp; does not grow. These make my brows look normal again...</li>
    <li> I was expecting something better, I am really dissapointed. Going back to my old products.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product in some ways – and much needed. The filler-factor is bloody fantastic. The chemistry is amazing, and the application is easy. You will reclaim a brow for certain! However, the color is not so great. The “brunette” is a rusty color seen on very few humans – might be perfect for golden retrievers. I suggest an ash color that most ladies, of all skin tones, can wear. I think a little lab time will turn up a color that suits most women. Call it “Shadow”. The company that gets the shade right will make a million. Meanwhile, I plan to mix up the right shade in the bathroom lab. Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Use this sparingly &amp; it will look great. Isn&#x27;t quite water proof but stays on most of the time in the pool</li>
    <li> I ordered Wonderbrow last year and it was different style kit and quite frankly, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  This new version has a very thin brush that works great.  It&#x27;s small and compact so you can throw it in your purse.  It comes with the brush and spooly all in one.  It does stay on all day and into the night but I always take it off with the provided cleanser.  It&#x27;s not clumpy like their first brand was.  Not much product for the price but worth it.  Love it....will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I have Cicatricial Alopecia which initially caused complete loss of my eyebrows (not too mention what happened on top of my head.)  It is a an orphan disease with no cure and a pot-luck chance at treating the symptoms to prevent further hair loss. It is in the autoimmune realm and causes the hair follicles to &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34; and scar, thus preventing new/replacement hair.  I am one of the lucky few who has had some regrowth, however both brows have bald spots and areas of sparse growth.  After trying a variety of products and colors I feel I have come up with a solution that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and is fairly easy to apply.  I have medium brown hair and learned very quickly to stay away from any type of brown pencil shade - they all seem to have a reddish undertone which, to me, is almost &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34; and draws unwanted attention to your brow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use E.L.F&#x27;s  Eyebrow Kit in ash and Brow Wiz (best price on Amazon:) ) , also in ash.  The kit has two components - a gel like cover and powder.  Both of which when used correctly are okay, but adding the Brow Wiz makes your brows look more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34;  and helps the makeup have a little more staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First apply the ELF gel to the bald, sparse areas; then use the Brow Wiz in the same area and throughout brow to help simulate hair and even color; lastly lightly apply the ELF powder to set and finish. At times, I find I also need a  need a stiff brow brush, as well as, a firm blunt brush to tame, aim and frame :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With practice all of the above takes about one minute and makes all the difference in the world, even if you don&#x27;t put on another spot of makeup.  Overall, the combined price is right, the products work together and it doesn&#x27;t take an artist&#x27;s talent to apply!  The only drawback I have found is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, I suspect in part because I have a bad habit of putting my hands on forehead and face.  Easy enough fix for me, ELF kits fit in the palm of your hand and are reasonably priced so I carry one with me for touch-ups if I&#x27;m headed out after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely the longest comment I&#x27;ve ever written!  But, unless it happens to you, you have no idea how devastating hair loss can be.  Groomed eyebrows don&#x27;t solve all the attendant issues with alopecia, but it helps to be able to look in the mirror and see the face you know and love :)</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed. First of all the color is unnatural brown, and also it wasnt subtle enough to blend in. The brow liner brush is thin, and if you actually use it it looks like you just drew eyebrows on your face, not subtle at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really was excited to test this product out, but I didnt like it at all.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow filler is the best.Its my second time ordering it.It stays on all day and night if you want it to.</li>
    <li> love this stufffff x1000000</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed.Not worth the money.would not order again.would advise not to buy.you can get the same resulted with an eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! I have very thin and light colored brows and was hoping this would help. Even with some practice, it still looks awful! Washes completely off in the shower. Use Revlon brow fantasy instead, it&#x27;s a similar product but much cheaper and easier to work with.</li>
    <li> it takes a while to get used to applying this.  i use the color part-- then smudge it slightly w/ring finger so it doesn&#x27;t look too done.  i take my time during this phase.  then--- the spoolie application is fairly simple.  the result is better brow definition &amp; fuller, more attractive brows.  &amp; i am thrilled w/its staying power.</li>
    <li> I usually just write reviews when I&#x27;m outraged by a poor product. But, I really like this product.  I think its usefulness depends on a given person&#x27;s brow shortcomings, but, my shortcomings are that I&#x27;ve overplucked and they&#x27;re just a little thin.  This stuff does a real good job of making them look beefed up without looking drawn on or tattooed.  I don&#x27;t even use the brush.  I use the wand mascara-like side.  I&#x27;ve used other brow mascaras, because at least half of this is what that is, and they don&#x27;t even compare.  This looks natural and stays put.  It is like wearing a padded bra for your brows though.  I mean, you will look different!  One day, flat, next day, vavoom!  You got BROWS!  And, I&#x27;ve looked into tattooing, and bless anyone who has done that and is happy with it, but, tattooed brows really look like what they are, tattoos, which just seems weird.  If you haven&#x27;t any hair at all, I can see it.  But otherwise, I don&#x27;t get it.  Sorry I know that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this, except that I think this product is better than pencils, powders, and tattoos.</li>
    <li> The narrow applicator brush is so flimsy it&#x27;s hard to control. For control, I prefer the felt tip marker in Almay and even Wet n Wild eyeliner (and use it on my brows). The larger brush was even harder to control because the tip was too large to taper the outside of my brow to make a point. Result was it smudged. If I use my Almay or other tips in the Smartbrow product, the product works fine and stays all day, but I can get the same results far cheaper with any waterproof eyeliner. My recommendation: save your money and buy a waterproof eyeliner instead. If you want to brush it, use an old toothbrush. And I forgot to say the product cakes and freezes any wild eyebrow hairs in bad positions. Using eyeliner avoids this problem.</li>
    <li> This item is too expensive and goes on too thick.  Once it&#x27;s on, you can only seem to get it off by using their product to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;I have a thyroid problem that has thinned all hair, but I have used mainly powder and eyebrow pencils and wanted to try this product and hoped it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you now SAVE YOUR MONEY!  The eyebrow powders and pencils work so much better and look more natural.  This product, you CANNOT put on sparingly and again it goes on too thick and you cannot fix it once it&#x27;s already on.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself and your pocket and stick with what you already use.</li>
    <li> Goes on great!!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Really not what I thought, and not as permanent as I wished it to be. Maybe my expectations were to high. Not easy to stroke on as eyebrow pencils.</li>
    <li> I sadly have thin eyebrows. After years of enduring facial tattooing eyebrows, I now have a painless alternative. Thank you,</li>
    <li> I bought this product @ The Dermstore and I love it.  I just received my 2nd one because I didn&#x27;t want run out.  I think it all depends on your experience.  It took me a couple of times to get it right, but now I&#x27;m used to it. Everyone in my office has complimented me on my brows and they thought I had them done professionally, but  NOPE it&#x27;s lil ole me doing it all on my own with the help of the Smartbrow duo.  Just be patient and you too will master it, but I&#x27;m speaking only from my own experience. I love this product period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dottie McKown&lt;br /&gt;Miami, FL</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Smartbrow and only paid $29.00 for it.....I think it is a truly horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and clumpy and does not look realistic.&lt;br /&gt;A brow pencil or powder is better.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Brows are thinning, and this fills them in without looking over-done (after a little practice).  Lasts for 3 to 4 days.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product made a mess of my eyebrows and was way overpriced.  The liquid smudges and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  I&#x27;m sticking to Lancome.</li>
    <li> Awful. Looks just as fake, if not worse, than shadow or pencils. Except it makes your eyebrows hard from the gel. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Not really sure. Too dark. I ordered a blonde. Maybe that will be better.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. Idk if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to look good, but I followed the instructions and tried it for a few weeks. The biggest problem was the spoolie end always had way too much product on it. I thought it would be a dry spoolie but it always just wound up clumping and getting outside the lines and generally looking like I painted on my brows with thick liquid eyeliner, which is basically all this is. I went back to just using brown eye shadow and a slanted brush to fill my brows. It looks much more natural and easier to control. I&#x27;m also not really sure why they included the eyebrow makeup remover either. Who uses a special makeup remover just for their eyebrows? I&#x27;d rather it be an actual whole eye makeup remover that I can use on my whole eye. Just... Not worth 20 some dollars.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product for the cost. It is okay and I will continue to use it but I would probably find another product for a lower price before considering this one again. Not terrible just not as amazing as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works but it was not the type of product I needed since I have no eyebrows at all.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I like this product. Find it easy to apply and has staying power.</li>
    <li> Love this product! A little pricey but good stuff!</li>
    <li> Did not like it. Very hard to apply . The color didn&#x27;t match. Not natural looking.I rather use powder or pencil.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I expected.  For 1/10th the price I could have bought something that works better.  It is sloppy and hard to apply and doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I feel taken.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this, so I am  a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Smartbrow for a couple of years. It does work well and stays on even if you swim. I&#x27;ve used the other similar products also, this one is about the best in my opinion so I&#x27;ll continue to use it. It looks natural if you don&#x27;t over apply it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Brows look great and the product actually stays put.  My new brow favorite of all time; definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not too much what it is &amp;#34;cracked up&amp;#34; to be.  It is okay - but&lt;br /&gt;there are other products out there. A little difficult to get use to.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Its easy to use and the intensity of the color you apply is easily controlled. I use it more for going out with my husband rather than daily. It stiffens your brows a bit when dry so I recommend being gentle as you rub the remover in and wipe it off so as to avoid pulling out or damaging the individual hairs. It&#x27;s a bit pricey I think for daily use though.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that applying it is intricate, the product adds fullness and color to aging eyebrows. I&#x27;ll try the next lighter color when re-ordering. It&#x27;s better than a pencil and adds some texture, in the manner that &amp;#34;elongating&amp;#34; mascara does for lashes. Applying takes a steady hand and good eyes, so start off with LIGHT strokes. Now that I&#x27;ve mastered the procedure, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Takes a steady hand and a lot of practice, but this product does a good job. I definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  However a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply.Messy.</li>
    <li> I found this product messy and difficult to apply. The liquid was thick, so whether I used the thin brush or the mascara-type brush, it left blobs of liquid that I would then have to carefully remove with a Q-tip or fingertip. I&#x27;m a brunette, but my hair is on the lighter side and this was way too dark. Possibly I should have ordered the blonde instead.    I&#x27;ve gone back to my tried-and-true Maybelline Expert Eyes Brow &amp; Eye Pencil -- lasts all day, fills in my brows perfectly well and two pencils are about 1/5 the price of SmartBrow.</li>
    <li> Wow! It takes a little practice with the liner but once you get that it&#x27;s all good.  Smartbrow is amazing!! i got the brunette because I died my hair a lighter color and it&#x27;s perfect. Now I just need to order the black brown for when I go darker. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this.</li>
    <li> This product really covers well.  You just need to use it lightly.  Perfect for those times between coloring or just use it instead of dyeing your brows.</li>
    <li> Do not do it. Save your money. This is not good. I have over-plucked brows (90&#x27;s teen) and read a review that said this product worked great for another lady with the same problem. Bless her, I would love to be in her bathroom and see how she does this, because I CANNOT make this look realistic at all. My brows are dark so I ordered brunette. The color is also no good- kind of bronze-ish? The whole thing is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Dermstore.com, it is more expensive than a pencil however, it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and fills in nicely I don&#x27;t find it particularly difficult to apply either. The only downside is that the  brow brush side of the  applicator puts way too much product on.I use a plain brow brush afterwards instead to blend it nicely.Overall not a bad product just put on lightly and not too much.</li>
    <li> -The color stayed for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;-The defining liner(thin brush) is very hard to use. I have a sturdy hand and I don&#x27;t have any problem applying liquid eyeliners; however, using this brush was very hard. Also the wand that looks like a mascara applicator is very large and I had color all over.&lt;br /&gt;-Brunette color looks rusty red ( Mahogany) on me. I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;-I want just a little bit of enhancement for my brow. I love natural looking brows. I got a very strong artificial looking brows. Many ladies like this look. I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Messy formula, looks very unnatural. Amazon was great with delivery and refund. It&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s not good.</li>
    <li> I know this receives lots of praise on Professional Makeup Shows on TV and Magazines, but I never got this to work well enough to look natural.  It looked &amp;#34;painted on&amp;#34; every time.  I certainly tried the lightest application you can do, and still I think it looked clown-like.  If you ignored the directions, and just used the brush applicator to color your existing brow hairs, it might do just fine.  But heck, hair color will do that and last MUCH longer for less money maybe.</li>
    <li> It was what I ordered, but would not order again.  Did not care for the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen negative reviews on this product and although the 2nd applicator brush is not designed well, the product looks real and stays on until I decide to take it off. I wish I would have had access to this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the number of negative reviews as this is an excellent product that does exactly what it says.  Do not be discouraged from trying it.  It does require a light touch in the application. Too much product will make you look like Groucho Marx, but that is simply a matter of experimenting with how much to apply.  4 stars because there should be a shade between brunette and brown/black available, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried and will stay stocked in my cosmetics bag.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING for my look &amp; skin.  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I like the effect the fibers have.  I wish they made this in clear.  I have red hair, and I mix my own eyebrow color to match (use hair gel and eyeshadow to get the color right).  If I could get the fibers in a clear gel, so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a color that doesn&#x27;t match my hair (or anybody&#x27;s hair as far as I can tell), I would like the product better.</li>
    <li> The little brush on one end was all bent out of shape.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times and found that it did not stay on as claimed. Also it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I thought it should.</li>
    <li> Went on too thick for my thin eyebrows</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - Works as advertised.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have little to no eyebrows and I have tried various eyebrow products including gels, powders and pencils and they never looked natural. A friend recommended this product and I decided to give it a try, and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I have read some of the reviews and I can understand some of the issues.  I don&#x27;t see the actual fibers either but, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, with some practice it can create a lovely brow. Yes, it is a bit difficult to remove (without their remover)  but I don&#x27;t mind at all, especially when my eyebrows are so thin and sparse.  Even after washing my face I still have eyebrows when I wake in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the eyebrow brush it comes with so I purchased another eyebrow brush.  Also, after i use the product I smooth it out with another soft angled brush that contains a bit of brown eyeshadow.  That seems to make them fuller and they don&#x27;t look like they have been filled in.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for me and will continue using it as long as they continue making it or come up with false eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It was okay.  Lighter then I expected.  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that is smart. This color is perfect. It gives me enough pop without overt eyebrows. I can walk into a room without people noticing my eyebrows first. It lasts all day. I put it on at 7am and take it off at 10pm. I never have to retouch.</li>
    <li> Light color too light&lt;br /&gt;Dark is too dark would have liked something in between for my brown eyebrow otherwise product works extremely well</li>
    <li> Too hard to apply properly.  Maybe a professional makeup artist could use this, but not me.  It&#x27;s sitting on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Color  too light, even if you try to apply more does not work for brunettes. It just was not&lt;br /&gt;what I expected .</li>
    <li> I am a brunette, however the color is really more reddish / light brown.  It is not as easy to use as advertised.  I am not sure I am going to try another color or not.</li>
    <li> Looks very natural and adds the shape and definition to the shape of your eyebrows.  If you have an imperfection, easy to correct.  Love it will buy again.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely and is waterproof, even after swimming.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to make my eyebrows to be stiff . They looked good but just didn&#x27;t like the way they felt.</li>
    <li> Natural looking eyebrow filler.  It has two brushes - one for fine lines, and one for actually brushing over your eyebrows.  This is the second tube I&#x27;ve purchased and am pleased with the product.  SmartBrow stays on well, however you don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; to remove it.  Soap and water works fine.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d would hope, which makes it a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I thought is was great. I left it on for 3 days. It looks like real eyebrows. Fills in very nicely. Quick and easy  :)&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the brunette shade. My hair is brown black but I didn&#x27;t want my eyebrows to take over my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;The brunette was too dark for my taste so I&#x27;ve just ordered the blond. Hope this color works better for me</li>
    <li> A great product! You need to practice as with any new application, but I love this stuff!  God gave us eyebrows one hair at a time, This product looks very natural and stays all day!</li>
    <li> give you a full eye brow -gret look and natural looking</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. It works beautifully. It takes a little practice to make it look best though.</li>
    <li> I have black eyebrow but they aren&#x27;t thick. My hair is dyed  rich sandy brown. Usually I use the dark brown/black one but the brunette looks really good with the color in my hair. It makes my eyebrows look a soft brown naturally.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get the hang of application.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this eyebrow color and filler.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to learn to use, can clump up and go on really thick if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> This is not as long lasting as suggested but it holds up better than pencilled-in fillers.</li>
    <li> It has a reddish brown color and the brush part won&#x27;t open. Don&#x27;t waist money on this product.</li>
    <li> Although overpriced, I think this is the best eyebrow enhancer on the market. Nothing is going to replace real eyebrow hair and this product does take practice. I have very dark brown hair but use Brunette which is lighter because I think it gives a more natural look. The trick is to draw on fine hairs with the &amp;#34;eyeliner type&amp;#34; brush sparingly...then brush the rest of the brow (if you have some hair) with the brush. It takes some patience but the results are good with practice. I have tried everything on the market and this product by far is the best but as I said you have to practice and less is more. It is overpriced but I use on special occasions. Does not stay put as it says for days...usually lasts 1 or 2 days at most.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it. She actually purchased for herself.</li>
