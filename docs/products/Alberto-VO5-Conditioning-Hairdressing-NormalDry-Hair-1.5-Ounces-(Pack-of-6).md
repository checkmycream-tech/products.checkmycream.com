      <li>This is the best stuff if you have somewhat dry hair.</li>
      <li>Gives my hair a natural healthy look, and a great price.</li>
      <li>be sure to keep VO5 in a cool  area.</li>
      <li>It seemed having a smooth, sleek hairstyle was out of my reach, until I tried VO5;  </li>
      <li>I have always missed the smell, and now I enjoy it again.  </li>
      <li>It is weightier than a cream leave-in, but not as formative as gel; it works as a sealant, helping to protect ends of hair against split ends, provides light hold/texture, and helps reduce crunch on wash and go curly hair.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Free shipping is the, &amp;#34;icing on the cake&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and so do several of my sons, so I was happy to share.  </li>
      <li>fFor flat ironed styles, it tames fly aways without causing moisture poof.</li>
      <li>Glad to find it again as I have used it and liked it for years but can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
      <li>Just be sure not to use too much of this product.</li>
      <li>This product is a winner to manage full, curly hair.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t need to reorder for some time and that&#x27;s good since the product has a long shelf life.</li>
      <li>If you have never tried Alberto VO5 you have missed a real treat if you have fine or unruly</li>
      <li>good stuff, hard to find any more</li>
      <li>As expected, on time and always good quality.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hair right after the hair wash.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got ultra-fine, flyaway hair with no weight to it and the conditioner gives form to my waves and curls, and makes my blonde streaks look more defined, and messy up-dos look great.</li>
      <li>this product adds super shine to dry hair, I just love it, my granddaughters hair tends to get  frizzy and this product eliminates a lot of the friz..</li>
      <li>My hair looked much nicer,more manaigable for a longer time!</li>
      <li>Love it and would recommend to anyone suffering from a similar dilemma with their grooming needs.</li>
      <li>I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED.  </li>
      <li>Again, an older product bypassed by all of the &amp;#34;superior technology&amp;#34; of shampoos, conditioners and other products has proved to be the superior solution for my issues.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for a long time now and have enjoyed it since I started.&lt;br /&gt;Hairspray bothers my scalp and this keeps my hair in place and shiny in place of the hairspray.</li>
      <li>Thanks couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>You do not get an oily look unless you use to much.</li>
      <li>When used moderately (about a pea size for my whole head), my hair is transformed into a sleek wavy hairstyle that is lovely to see and soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>hair shiny, pretty much in place and very soft and does not bother my scalp.  </li>
      <li>This is an older product , and if you put it into your hair for a few hours before washing, it really conditions the hair , and it looks fantastic after the blow drying!</li>
      <li>I ordered far too many, but I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it takes only a dab, it makes your hair soft and manageable, never stiff or sticky, and gives terrific shine as well.  </li>
      <li>As with any oil based product, less is more, and it won&#x27;t hydrate, it will only change the finish and lock your hair in whatever state its in.</li>
      <li>I chose the rating because my 90 year old mother want use nothing else but this product.</li>
      <li>I have suffered for decades to try to tame my fine, frizzy, curly hair into some semblance of a hairstyle.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my wife,who use it frequently.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter has very frizzy hair, so frizzy that it barely smooths out when she goes swimming --</li>
      <li>I like Alberto VO5 for control, especially as my hair gets older and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Arnie</li>
      <li>No other product does what V05 does - keeps my wavy hair in control and adds a nice sheen to my dull grey hair.</li>
      <li>It puts back the normal oil in your hair.</li>
      <li>Then any heat appliance dried my fine hair even further.  </li>
      <li>I barely spend 2 minutes on my hair each day.  </li>
      <li>Not a single flake since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>

    <li> I have flakey scalp, I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners, but this is by far the best. Not a single flake since I&#x27;ve been using it and it makes my hair manageable. If there were 6 stars this product would get 7 of them.</li>
    <li> As expected, on time and always good quality.</li>
    <li> awesome, can&#x27;t find it in any store, been using it for years</li>
    <li> Alberto vo5 conditioning hairdressing, gives your hair a beautiful shine.  If you have dry hair give it a try it works. be sure to keep VO5 in a cool  area.</li>
    <li> Only a little does the trick</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has very frizzy hair, so frizzy that it barely smooths out when she goes swimming -- and she&#x27;s Caucasian (Irish ancestry, if that helps). She tried everything, including that crazy expensive ($500) Japanese hair-straightening procedure at the salon. It broke her hair and she lost about half of its density. It finally grew back after three years, but I won&#x27;t allow her to do that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urged her to try VO-5 conditioner to moisturize and manage the frizz. She did reluctantly and was amazed at how well it worked. Of course, she was a little older by then and a little wiser. She does use a straightening iron when she has the time and achieves beautiful waves and curls -- think: Nina Dobrev as Katherine on \\&quot;Vampire Diaries.\\&quot;  When she doesn&#x27;t have the time, her hair still looks great -- shiny and curly -- pinned or clipped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the stuff for myself, too. I&#x27;ve got ultra-fine, flyaway hair with no weight to it and the conditioner gives form to my waves and curls, and makes my blonde streaks look more defined, and messy up-dos look great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for over 20 years and love it. I have frizzy, curly hair and this stuff really helps to tame the frizz. Just be sure not to use too much of this product. A little goes a long way. Just put a little bit in your hand and rub your hands together to heat and liquefy the product. Apply to hair and dry as usual.</li>
    <li> a traditional product in use by my family for two generations, it is great to know that it can be found in quantity through Amazon</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this for my father at any of the local stores. He is delighted with it. He has been using it for years and hated switching to another product. Now he has a several year supply.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS  PRODUCT. CAN&#x27;T BET THE PRICE AND THE DELIVERY WAS EXCELLENT. WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  I have fluffy hair that is a bit wavy (natural 80s style hair).  I am a tomboy.  I barely spend 2 minutes on my hair each day.  Sometime i forget to blush my hair.  I use it on my hair right after the hair wash.  Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally bought from Target.  Target does not sell it anymore.  So happy to be able to find them online.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time now and have enjoyed it since I started.&lt;br /&gt;Hairspray bothers my scalp and this keeps my hair in place and shiny in place of the hairspray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m paying 1/4 the price retail here for this preferred brand. I have been using this VO5 for many years for my unruly hair. It is great to get this at a lower price. Free shipping is the, &amp;#34;icing on the cake&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have been using VO5 for at least 10 yrs and one day I tried the other brand what a mistake!  My hair looked much nicer,more manaigable for a longer time!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff if you have somewhat dry hair. I have used this stuff forever, no complaints other than it seems to be hard to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Thanks couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere else.  Been using it for years and looked everywhere for it  even in drugstores but to no avail</li>
    <li> This is an old product that has become difficult to find with all the newer (and more expensive) items on the market.  It is still the greatest for taming frizzy hair, and leaving it controlled and shining.  Just a little does the trick.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this hairdressing here!</li>
    <li> great product and value. Works great with permed hair. It softens and makes it shine, It does not weigh the hair down</li>
    <li> i have used this product for 45 years.  i still like it. it is getting harder to find. Walgrens is about it..</li>
    <li> Have used AlbertoVo5 Conditioner for years, and there is nothing&lt;br /&gt;like it for giving your hair a little shine and manageability.  So glad&lt;br /&gt;to find it on Amazon when I saw it was no longer in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Shelleyc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 20 years and it works great for frizzy hair adds a nice shine and to be honest I believe it has helped my hair from turning grey!!!</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with hairspray for a long time, when I found the Alberto VO5 the problem was solved.  It keeps&lt;br /&gt;my hair shiny, pretty much in place and very soft and does not bother my scalp.  I gave a tube to a friend in work&lt;br /&gt;and she is thrilled with the product also.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for 50 yrs. It puts back the normal oil in your hair. You do not get an oily look unless you use to much.</li>
    <li> This time it was my mistake.  I didn&#x27;t investigate the description closely enough.  This was not the product that I thought I was ordering and had to return it.</li>
    <li> This has been around a long time, but my husband uses it every day and I use it occasionally (especially in the summer when my hair might become dried out)</li>
    <li> Received this product on time, and in good condition. Glad to find it again as I have used it and liked it for years but can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> I love VO5, it smells so good and it works well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I was able to get what I needed through Amazon.com when I could not get what my husband had used for years and years. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED.  I ALWAYS GET THIS PRODUCT  AS A STOCKING STUFFER FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS</li>
    <li> Good product, I have been using it for years. Gives my hair a natural healthy look, and a great price.</li>
    <li> This product is a winner to manage full, curly hair. Also, it gives hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I chose the rating because my 90 year old mother want use nothing else but this product.She has used it for years nothing else will work that&#x27;s why for the rating.</li>
    <li> My dad used to use this when I was a boy and all throughout my life until he passed away.  I heard correctly, they even used it on his hair at his funeral.  I have always missed the smell, and now I enjoy it again.  It works well too.</li>
    <li> This is the conditioning my husband uses--and has used for many years.  He&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors. This is okay and I leave on all night while wearing a cap. It was recommended by my hairdresser to keep dry, permed hair moisturized.  I ordered far too many, but I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> A tiny dab rubbed into the palms then smoothed through the tresses will tame flyaways and frizz. Nice scent, conditions without product buildup. So hard to find in stores but essential for a vintage hairdo.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. Good price on Amazon. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for years.  My husband still uses it.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a long time, always works well.</li>
    <li> Great product at a greater price...this product adds super shine to dry hair, I just love it, my granddaughters hair tends to get  frizzy and this product eliminates a lot of the friz..</li>
    <li> No other product does what V05 does - keeps my wavy hair in control and adds a nice sheen to my dull grey hair. I forget my tube on a trip recently and my hair was all dull and puffy like a dandelion gone to seed.&lt;br /&gt;Local store stopped stocking it (what?) so I picked up a year supply here on Amazon. Happy guy.</li>
    <li> I got a perm and it dried my hair out pretty bad, so I purchased this product to condition the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to apply a small amount and leave on.  As soon as I opened the tube, I could smell an unpleasant odor, like an old person&#x27;s brill cream.  I decided to try it on my hair anyway.  It was greasy and stinky.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone else before they purchase it.  Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the &#x27;normal/dry&#x27; conditioner for decades.&lt;br /&gt;Now my Drug store now only handles conditioner for &#x27;silver/grey&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good to find original product!</li>
    <li> Oldest trick in the book.  It&#x27;s cheap, it takes only a dab, it makes your hair soft and manageable, never stiff or sticky, and gives terrific shine as well.  People always ask me what I do to make my hair look so great (and I&#x27;m 69).  Their jaws drop when I tell them.</li>
    <li> A great product, not too greasy and great for the hair</li>
    <li> I have suffered for decades to try to tame my fine, frizzy, curly hair into some semblance of a hairstyle. Shampooing without a conditioner turned my hair into the look and texture of a cotton ball.  With conditioner, I had greasy, limp tendrils.  There seemed no middle ground.  Then any heat appliance dried my fine hair even further.  It seemed having a smooth, sleek hairstyle was out of my reach, until I tried VO5;  Adding just a tad before styling my hair and lightly distributing it has made all of the difference in the world!  When used moderately (about a pea size for my whole head), my hair is transformed into a sleek wavy hairstyle that is lovely to see and soft to the touch.  Again, an older product bypassed by all of the &amp;#34;superior technology&amp;#34; of shampoos, conditioners and other products has proved to be the superior solution for my issues.  Love it and would recommend to anyone suffering from a similar dilemma with their grooming needs.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT I REMEMBER AS A CHILD.  I CONTINUE TO USE IT ON MY TOWEL DRIED HAIR FOR CONDITIONING.  WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT VERSUS A LIQUID CONDITIONER IS THAT IT DOES NOT STICK TO THE SCALP.</li>
    <li> perfect - works great</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;conditioning hairdressing\\&quot; is basically a small tube of lightweight classic african-american hair grease. It is weightier than a cream leave-in, but not as formative as gel; it works as a sealant, helping to protect ends of hair against split ends, provides light hold/texture, and helps reduce crunch on wash and go curly hair. fFor flat ironed styles, it tames fly aways without causing moisture poof. As with any oil based product, less is more, and it won&#x27;t hydrate, it will only change the finish and lock your hair in whatever state its in.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will help with those &amp;#34;high-humidity&amp;#34; hair days, this one&#x27;s the one!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I also will use this. I had a hard time finding it in the stores. My mom has used it for years. It has been dry here in Montana cause of the cold snaps and having to run the furnace so much. This has always been a good product</li>
    <li> I love this Alberto VO5 conditioning hairdressing.  I have been using this product for the last 20 years.  I plan on using it for many more years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years. The price is fair and the order time is great BZ</li>
    <li> If you have never tried Alberto VO5 you have missed a real treat if you have fine or unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is my understanding it was created for Marilyn Monroe because she had some many problems.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever created it I am thankful. It is the best. You use very little....</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this everyday loves it</li>
    <li> Great price and service!</li>
    <li> I have  very thick hair , and have used several very expensive conditioners.  This is an older product , and if you put it into your hair for a few hours before washing, it really conditions the hair , and it looks fantastic after the blow drying!</li>
    <li> Excellent Value...delivered just as promised.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years and because I have difficulty getting out and browsing thru the stores, I ordered the quantity of six.  I use it daily and so do several of my sons, so I was happy to share.  Great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, control those flyaway ends and is easily absorbed.  I won&#x27;t need to reorder for some time and that&#x27;s good since the product has a long shelf life.</li>
    <li> I like Alberto VO5 for control, especially as my hair gets older and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Arnie Henderson, male, age as of today: 76</li>
    <li> good stuff, hard to find any more</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife,who use it frequently. The internet was the only place I could find this product.</li>
