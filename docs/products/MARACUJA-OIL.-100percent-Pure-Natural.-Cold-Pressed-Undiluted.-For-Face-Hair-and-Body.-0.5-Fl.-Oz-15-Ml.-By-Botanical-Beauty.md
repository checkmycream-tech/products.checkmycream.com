      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>(will be better for travel) and the dropper seems quite secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This oil is very good and quick absorbing.</li>
      <li>excellent for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>top of that, if you have Amazon Prime, the 1.7 oz Tarte maracuja oil ships for free faster than this one.</li>
      <li>This is the exact same thing, and it yields excellent results.</li>
      <li>so I decided to see if alternatives were available.</li>
      <li>And I just hope that they stay in business forever, so that I could always count on them having them available.  </li>
      <li>the rest of them are fabulous and indispensable.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it does have a smell, and the best way to describe it would be earthy, but as others have said it does disappear after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good on the face as well; it has evened out my skin tone and leaves my face soft, never oily.</li>
      <li>I also like Tarte&#x27;s applicator better because it pumps the right amount</li>
      <li>I usually get 1-2 pimples a month and this product combined with retinol is awesome.</li>
      <li>My skin absorbed this stuff!  </li>
      <li>and I have really liked it so far!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, just nice and naturally moist.</li>
      <li>Skin glows and is nice and clear.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, and skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>Soaks into pores extremely quickly.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is, in my opinion a great alternative to Tarte&#x27;s maracuja oil.</li>
      <li>It is a light light yellow.</li>
      <li>Recently I purchased a bottle at Sephora and after just a couple uses the top fell apart</li>
      <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not sticky, glides on skin pretty well.</li>
      <li>This is so much more affordable, and dare I say exactly the same or better than the other brand.</li>
      <li>It is more like a dry oil.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin moist but seems less effective in preventing acne.</li>
      <li>This is also great on other target dry spots this time of year.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a buttery smooth oil, feels light on the face, and just a few drops does the trick.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I saw a difference,  and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see any improvements in my skin</li>
      <li>do want to comment that this product is not so much cheaper than the Tarte maracuja oil in the 1.7 fl.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>Almost through with the bottle and didn&#x27;t see any difference really.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why people are paying so much for a name brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and fluid.</li>
      <li>My face has cleared sooooo much using this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Tarte also sells maracuja oil but they mark it up so much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very calming and soothing to my ultra-sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>and this is pretty much the EXACT same product for a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>only negative would be that the smell is somewhat more potent than Tarte</li>
      <li>I use this on my face as a moisturizer in the evenings and I also use this smooth the ends of my hair as well as on my cuticles and severely dry patches like my elbows and knees.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Tarte Maracuja for about a year and a half and love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this oil. Hands down, this is, in my opinion a great alternative to Tarte&#x27;s maracuja oil. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is smooth, post-acne scarring have diminished, and the slight wrinkles I did have have also smoothed out. Yes, it does have a smell, and the best way to describe it would be earthy, but as others have said it does disappear after a few minutes. I use this at night after cleansing my face and also in the morning along with my facial sunscreen for that added moisture. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! works as good as the Tarte Maracuja oil. I have acne phone skin and it does not clog pores or leave an oily Face. Actually, I feel it helps heal pimples faster! I usually get 1-2 pimples a month and this product combined with retinol is awesome. Skin glows and is nice and clear. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product works just as well if not better than the oil sold by Tarte Cosmetics and at a fraction of the piece.  I use this on my face as a moisturizer in the evenings and I also use this smooth the ends of my hair as well as on my cuticles and severely dry patches like my elbows and knees.  It&#x27;s great and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use the Tarte maracuja oil for awhile then switched to this &amp; both work the same. I have very dry skin &amp; only using 3-4 drops helps keep me feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> Omg this stuff is truly a life saver. My face has cleared sooooo much using this. I wash my face, use acne clearing cream, and then about four drops of this and my face feels so good, gets rid of redness, soaks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy. I use it once a day/ maybe two. I got the .05 oz one and have had it for almost two months. Getting low, so I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one but this is seriously some amazing stuff. And the price is gold as well. :)</li>
    <li> Its a nice oil, no fragrance, absorbs well,  feels nice.  Don&#x27;t really see any improvements in my skin&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive for the amount in my opinion.  Use Alot of almond oil.  I&#x27;ll stick with the almond oil</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a few months. I have dry skin made worse by the cold, dry weather in my part of the country. I apply the oil morning and night under my creamy moisturizer and sunscreen. It absorbs well. I read that it promotes hair growth, so I started applying it to my thinning eyebrows. In about 3weeks, there was noticeable hair growth!  Now, I am applying it to my lashes and my lashes are longer-no kidding! I am going to start applying it to my hairline. I bought the large bottle and poured half of it into a Misto brand olive oil sprayer (buy on AMAZON) to spray on my body after showering; fine mist without waste. So glad I found this product!!!</li>
    <li> I can wash my face at night and put this oil on my entire face. It&#x27;s not what you think. It absorbs quickly, and skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I like this a couple of times a week.</li>
    <li> Cute little bottle. Smell is nutty but faint. Not sticky, glides on skin pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I used it as part of my night time moisturizers. Worked okay. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair or anywhere else yet.</li>
    <li> its a dry type oil like grape seed. doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin or block my pores. no break outs as of yet. i like this oil a lot!</li>
    <li> Very nice!  My skin absorbed this stuff!  After washing my face I would massage it into my skin and let it absorb for about a half hour before applying makeup.  It left my skin feeling smooth and non-greasy.  I only wish the bottle came in a larger size!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used the Tarte version and wanted a less expensive version  the Tarte oil was much better for my skin. I broke out when I used this, and did not with the Tarte brand.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is more like a dry oil. Soaks into pores extremely quickly. I have extremely oily skin and this has my skin perfectly balanced. I now know why all the hype around this miraculous oil. I only have to use two drops for whole face and neck. Mine has no smell To it at all. It is a light light yellow. I don&#x27;t understand why people are paying so much for a name brand. This is perfect!! I had a sample of Tarte Marajuca oil. This is exactly the same. Please keep this affordable. I am so happy with this. I recommended this to all of my friends. This is must have oil in your beauty routine. I was so unsure about putting oils on my.oily skin. Turns out it balances my Ph perfectly. This is a miracle in a bottle. Great for acne wrinkles nails hair and neck. My skin just looks beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 weeks now.. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin... my skin gets dry when i wake up in the mornining.  WIll give it a shot to tarte brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many oils in my lifetime, most with results that were nothing to write home about. Most are too heavy for my combo, acne-prone and rosacean skin and result in clogging, deep breakouts or general oiliness that feels gross. Through my research, I discovered that Maracuja oil is also known as Passion Fruit oil.  It&#x27;s so light and fluid. I apply 1 drop to wet hands and smooth it onto my face. Most people say 2-3 drops, but I&#x27;ve found that 1 drop is perfect for me. It&#x27;s very calming and soothing to my ultra-sensitive skin and it&#x27;s drastically improved my skin texture. My breakouts have vanished (even hormonal ones) and my skin feels incredible. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, just nice and naturally moist. My forehead, which is usually plastered with a million clogged pores, is perfectly smooth and even. It doesn&#x27;t prevent ALL blemishes from forming, but the ones I do get are very small and they go away quickly. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> the oil isn&#x27;t heavy, so far i only wear it at night but I don&#x27;t see how this would affect my makeup routine if i were to use it during the day.</li>
    <li> I had a feeling that maracuja oil is maracuja oilnso when I found this I had tomtry. I love the Tarte Maracuja oil but it&#x27;s SO expensive. I think this product is the exact same. Save your money on Tarte and get this instead!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the Tarte maracuja oil to me, as she said it completely changed her face&#x27;s skin...But being the cheap-o that I am, I felt it was way too expensive to even think about buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, there&#x27;s Botanical Beauty on Amazon and this is pretty much the EXACT same product for a fraction of the price! You really only need a couple of drops if you&#x27;re applying it to your face. Since I started using it, friends have been asking what I&#x27;ve done differently to my skin. I use it on my face almost every night with or without a moisturizer on top.</li>
    <li> Great for skin, hair - it is helping me stop my peeling from being on vacation - helped heal my chapped lips - awesome</li>
    <li> excellent for dry skin.  non greasy.  on days that are not humid, I use this oil as if it was a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Someone told me to try this for my acne, I had red painful acne on my neck jawline and chin. It helped a lot. I&#x27;ve tried Rxs, philosophy,  proactiv,  you name it. I saw a difference,  and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tarte Maracuja for about a year and a half and love it. Recently I purchased a bottle at Sephora and after just a couple uses the top fell apart and it was completely messy to use. I had had minor issues with this on prior Tarte Maracuja&#x27;s as well so I decided to see if alternatives were available. I decided to take a chance on this since i could get a small vial for not much investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I tried this. I like it better than Tarte. It absorbs into the skin immediately. I like the smaller bottle (will be better for travel) and the dropper seems quite secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative would be that the smell is somewhat more potent than Tarte but it seems to disapprer almost immediately. I don&#x27;t notice it and I have gotten no comments form my husband about a foul odor so it really is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I don&#x27;t use it every night but at least once a night alternating with other products. It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my pillow oily so it must be sinking in well. Makes my skin look more supple.</li>
    <li> Order# 47799&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast. Wonderful product. I will order from this seller again. I love this oil for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this maracuja oil for about a month now and I have really liked it so far! I use it after washing my face each day as a moisturizer and it works great. It feels a little strange to put oil on your face (especially if you are prone to break outs like I am) but since using it my skin has been super soft and free of blemishes and maybe even more even toned. I considered getting the tarte maracuja oil but it was just so expensive that I thought I would try this instead - no regrets!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works as well as Tarte&#x27;s. It keeps my skin moist but seems less effective in preventing acne. I will buy Tarte&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good and quick absorbing. I also have the Tarte one and from what I can tell there is no noticeable difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to comment that this product is not so much cheaper than the Tarte maracuja oil in the 1.7 fl. oz. bottle. That bottle sells for $43.95 which comes out to about $25.85 per oz. This bottle is $12.95 for .5 fl. oz., so $25.90 for one oz. So this actually comes out to a little more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, if you have Amazon Prime, the 1.7 oz Tarte maracuja oil ships for free faster than this one. If you do not, then Tarte is more expensive. I also like Tarte&#x27;s applicator better because it pumps the right amount and you only need 3 drop which is easy to achieve with the smaller dropper from Tarte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is good but I didn&#x27;t find a difference between this and Tarte. Given that I have Prime, this is actually more expensive for me. Their applicator is just a plus.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night.  Love it. I have seen a big difference in my skin tone. I plan on ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I&#x27;ll continue to use it :-)</li>
    <li> Love this oil!!!!  I have used this to clear eczema, dry itchy areas on my hands and arms, and a variety of other uses.  Highly recommend if you are looking for something to heal your skin.</li>
    <li> Yet another marvelous oil from this high quality company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, sometimes when you gold-mine, you strike it big.  And this is it for me and this company, I absolutely love their oils!  There is only one oil that I did not think had much of a value for the money (Coconut Tahiti Manoi)--but the rest of them are fabulous and indispensable.  And I just hope that they stay in business forever, so that I could always count on them having them available.  Also the containers are great: dark glass with a dropper.</li>
    <li> I have had several bruises and found this oil to expedite the healing process.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I ran out of my TARTE brand Maracuja oil. This is so much more affordable, and dare I say exactly the same or better than the other brand. Love it, will buy more.</li>
    <li> I used it on my face and hair and it seems to work the way it&#x27;s suppose to.  I just wonder if you pay more for the product you would get a better oil.</li>
    <li> Almost through with the bottle and didn&#x27;t see any difference really.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and I especially love the price. Tarte also sells maracuja oil but they mark it up so much it&#x27;s not worth it. This is the exact same thing, and it yields excellent results. I use it on my hair and face. It makes my hair quite soft and really helps my ends with dryness. It&#x27;s really good on the face as well; it has evened out my skin tone and leaves my face soft, never oily. If you want to try an essential oil for hair/face, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the Marajuca oil by Tarte that wasn&#x27;t as pricey. I will just stick to the name brand because I noticed a huge difference using a less expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was using the more expensive branded version for a while, and did not want to shell out the money again. I think this works just as well, if not better! It&#x27;s the ONLY product that keeps my dry spots on my face moisturized. Some people mention a weird smell, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me because, and it goes away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> too small for the price...</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have been using this for the past week or so and the results are fantastic! It&#x27;s a buttery smooth oil, feels light on the face, and just a few drops does the trick. It has nourished my skin and makes my face glow. Be careful not to use too much or you could get slimy or shiny! And that&#x27;s not good. This was a great alternative to Tarte brand, which in my opinion is a rip off. This is fantastic! This is also great on other target dry spots this time of year.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for the face - I mix it with Rose Hip Seed Oil and massage once a day into the face.  Leave it for 20 min and then wash it off.</li>
    <li> I love tarte maracuja oil but hate how costly it is. I bought this instead. It pretty much works the same but I don&#x27;t like the scent to it. To be honest it smells like cooking oil. But it is a good alternative to tarte if your on a budget</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It saved my skin this winter!  I use it at night by warming it up in my hands then applying.  My face has been noticeably softer in the mornings and counteracts the indoor heating drying effects.</li>
    <li> I was using another brand of Maracula oil for the past 6 months. I have used this brand for a week now.  It is a great value for the money.  It seems to work just as well and you get .50 oz for $12.95.  The other brand was .25 oz for $25.  So far so good.  I would recommend this oil.  I have also been using this oil for my husband scars from a recent surgery...loving the results!!</li>
    <li> 3rd day of using it on face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s okay, but it smells pretty bad. I wish that they can add some scent to it to mask.  It smells between rubber and cooking oil...&lt;br /&gt;I may add a drop or two of lavender to make it smell half way decent.&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be buying this product again as is.</li>
