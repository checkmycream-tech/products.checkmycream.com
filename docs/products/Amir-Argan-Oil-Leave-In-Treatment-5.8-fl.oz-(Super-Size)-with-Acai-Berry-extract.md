    <li> I gave it 3 stars because I think it&#x27;s an OK product for styling and not for treating damaged hair. it has a nice smell, was absorbed quickly and my hair felt very soft after applying it but it is not a treatment it&#x27;s just a temporary fix.... after you wash your hair the effect is gone. Should not be advertised as a treatment.</li>

My hair then air drys. It is like silk. No frizz, just silk and shine. I have people walk up to me and tell me how beautiful my hair is... I tell everyone about this product!!! Try it and see for yourself..</li>
