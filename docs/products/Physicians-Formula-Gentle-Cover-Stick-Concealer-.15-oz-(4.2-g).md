      <li>My favorite concealer ever!</li>
      <li>Its coverage is amazing too.</li>
      <li>This blends in so nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of oily though.</li>
      <li>It covers good and it is so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
      <li>This claims to be oil free ... NOT!  </li>
      <li>(I have more of an olive colored skin tone) but this color covers spots quite well.</li>
      <li>I bought some more makeup from Physicians Formula</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different brands of concealers and this one is PERFECT.  </li>
      <li>I love the creamy touch to skin</li>
      <li>This concealer stick was just okay, but</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The price was competitive and the \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;, I love.</li>
      <li>Mostly use it under my eyes to lighten dark circles...and it does a great job!</li>
      <li>Blends easy</li>
      <li>I love this concealer, it works great at hiding any blemishes you have and is non-comedogenic so it will not cause you to break out further or clog your pores.</li>
      <li>Covers lines and dark coloring under my eyes great!</li>
      <li>I use this for the dark circles underneath my eyes, it works perfectly with my foundation(:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always impressed with physicians formula, and was not let down on this product either</li>
      <li>Works just fine for me.</li>
      <li>I am very fair and all inconsistencies in skin tone appear unsightly and I like to cover them up.</li>
      <li>It is not very pigmented and does not provide very good coverage.</li>
      <li>Bought this a backup to see if it works as its really cheap and of course physicians formula.</li>
      <li>I love it so much though</li>
      <li>I am used to using prestige cosmetics brands, so it is not surprising that I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product so far!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be used up very fast.</li>
      <li>It does go on thick and can appear cakey, but I&#x27;ve found blending out with a damp makeup sponge takes care of this fairly well.</li>
      <li>, it fits my skin color better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever found, it doesn&#x27;t darken or leave the spots very noticeable that you have concealer.</li>
      <li>I have very dark circles under my eyes that most concealers don&#x27;t really do much for, but I&#x27;ve found that layering this really brightens my under eye area.  </li>
      <li>It does kind of stay together and it&#x27;s hard to spread out, but it does</li>
      <li>This stuff however, blends even easier than liquid and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines like the heavy liquid does.  </li>
      <li>I just make a single line under each eye and rub it right in.</li>
      <li>I like the coverage that this offers.  </li>
      <li>(Especially since I&#x27;ve gotten older).  </li>
      <li>Normally I use a liquid concealer since I find the sticks harder to blend on the sensitive skin under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>My eyes look much brighter and dark circles are about as concealed as they can be.  </li>

    <li> My favorite concealer ever! I won&#x27;t ever use another concealer! I wish it wasn&#x27;t an add-on item though :/. I love it so much though, it fits my skin color better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever found, it doesn&#x27;t darken or leave the spots very noticeable that you have concealer. Lasts long too. Ecstatic with this product. Its coverage is amazing too.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer stick I have ever used. I hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> This blends in so nice. Color works well for me. Mostly use it under my eyes to lighten dark circles...and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> Thia.works awesome I dont use  conceller this.is.all is.use.with blush eyeshadow mascara and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage that this offers.  I have very dark circles under my eyes that most concealers don&#x27;t really do much for, but I&#x27;ve found that layering this really brightens my under eye area.  It does go on thick and can appear cakey, but I&#x27;ve found blending out with a damp makeup sponge takes care of this fairly well.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Great coverage.</li>
    <li> This concealer stick was just okay, but given the price I should have expected that. I am used to using prestige cosmetics brands, so it is not surprising that I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. It is not very pigmented and does not provide very good coverage. The texture is almost waxy/sticky when applied. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really only use concealer to cover the dark circles under my eyes.  Normally I use a liquid concealer since I find the sticks harder to blend on the sensitive skin under my eyes.  This stuff however, blends even easier than liquid and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines like the heavy liquid does.  My eyes look much brighter and dark circles are about as concealed as they can be.  I love this product so far!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be used up very fast. Covers well</li>
    <li> I love this product. It covers good and it is so easy to apply. I love the creamy touch to skin</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a little pale for my skin tone (I have more of an olive colored skin tone) but this color covers spots quite well. It&#x27;s kind of oily though. It does kind of stay together and it&#x27;s hard to spread out, but it does it&#x27;s job well! I&#x27;ll consider buying this again.</li>
    <li> I use this for the dark circles underneath my eyes, it works perfectly with my foundation(:</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
    <li> Just as ordered, good price!</li>
    <li> This claims to be oil free ... NOT!  I needed to find completely oil-free cosmetics due to short-term medical issue.  A closer read of the ingredients revealed that this product was not as marketed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always impressed with physicians formula, and was not let down on this product either</li>
    <li> For the price this stuff works great. I have been using it for a few years now, and especially when I am on a budget, its the only concealer I&#x27;ll get!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different brands of concealers and this one is PERFECT.  It made my face look flawless and smooth.  It has NO chemical smell like some other brands I have used.  I bought some more makeup from Physicians Formula and I am very happy with it.  I threw my other makeup away.  I will only buy Physicians Formula from now on.  Try this concealer, you will like it.</li>
    <li> Covers lines and dark coloring under my eyes great! Blends easy I just make a single line under each eye and rub it right in. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My sister needed this concealer stick while we were visiting our mom in Sioux Falls, SD. We.couldn&#x27;t find this product in any of the local stores so I ordered it for her and, of course, it arrived in two days with your wonderful prime shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer, it works great at hiding any blemishes you have and is non-comedogenic so it will not cause you to break out further or clog your pores.</li>
    <li> Works just fine for me.</li>

    <li> This is a great concealer stick. I am very fair and all inconsistencies in skin tone appear unsightly and I like to cover them up. (Especially since I&#x27;ve gotten older).  The price was competitive and the \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;, I love.</li>
