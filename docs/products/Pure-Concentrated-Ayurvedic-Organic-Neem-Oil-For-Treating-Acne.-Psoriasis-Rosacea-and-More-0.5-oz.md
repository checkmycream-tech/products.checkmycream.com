<ol>
      <li>Awesome product!  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis, so I thought I had found the perfect product...</li>
      <li>This the best oil to use on acne, itching skin and all the body.</li>
      <li>I was insulted by the company respondent because this person insinuated that I had no idea what I was looking at and that the item was perfect - as it was approved in-house..........</li>
      <li>I am happy with day one.  </li>
      <li>know if I could stick it out this would be great for my skin.</li>
      <li>I bravely tried to use it on some rashes on my arm and feet.  </li>
      <li>Great oil to add to shampoo to prevent lice in children who attend school.</li>
      <li>i CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT,HOWEVER IT BE  GOOD FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER</li>
      <li>it might be good for somebody else</li>
      <li>The smell, isnt good, but its not supposed to be.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also started drinking more water and stopped consuming coconut oil, as dehydration seems to figure greatly into the condition of the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice.  </li>
      <li>I honestly gag when I smell this serum.  </li>
      <li>It has a very strong smell, but I guess that is the organic part.</li>
      <li>but i had great hair growth, a clean healthy scalp.</li>
      <li>With the Zaja brand, I have had great success at treating skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Neem oil is so far one of the best soothing remedies I have found and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
      <li>Be warned this is never going to be delightful like jojoba, almond oil or essential oils to your olfactory senses.</li>
      <li>I have been suffering from acne for a couple of years now and was always hesitant towards anything that would cause my skin to be more oily that it already was.</li>
      <li>Nothing better for your scalp, Skin, scars</li>
      <li>Just make sure you do not rest your head on a pillow as it will stink.</li>
      <li>I love the Zaja neem oil, my daughter has eczema and it help her allot.</li>
      <li>I am happy with it so far...  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a smelly option, but a more effective one for certain conditions, over pharmaceutical options.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have an extremely strong stomach (five boys and a bunch of dogs and chickens will do that for you) but it makes mine do flips.</li>
      <li>I have read that it also reduces pore size and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Without any accompanying written instruction, I lightly daubed it on the affected areas on consecutive evenings (when I was at home).</li>
      <li>USE MUST USE ANOTHER SCENTED OIL (LEMON/LAVENDER)TO Calm the scent!</li>
      <li>Recieved it quick.</li>
      <li>When you wash it off use a mild soap and follow up with a toner and you will have no residual smell.  </li>
      <li>I was worried about the odor being absorbed into my bedding.  </li>
      <li>I put it on my face right after dinner and washed it off right before bed.  </li>
      <li>I then used several toothpicks together and retrieved some of the Neem Oil from the bottle and placed it in a clean and sterile 10 ml amber bottle that I had also purchased from Amazon; I then had to add more of the jojoba oil to the amber bottle, I put the cap on and shook very well.  </li>
      <li>It really is offensive, and that&#x27;s an understatement!</li>
      <li>I am glad I finally did.</li>
      <li>Let me just say that I&#x27;m sure this is a solid product, but I&#x27;m leaving a review for anyone who -like me- plans on using it for a skin treatment:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>: Great for organic gardening or in a VERY dilute facial tincture but DEFINITELY not for applying neat unless you lack a sense of smell.</li>
      <li>but I did not see any positive results (perhaps it needs longer time).</li>
      <li>Thanks for the oil..</li>
      <li>It is a small bottle but it works nicely.</li>
      <li>It took me a long time to even start thinking about trying such an controversial idea.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for few weeks now and can&#x27;t tell if it helps my brake outs or not, but it definitely makes my skin feels good and heels faster.</li>
      <li>Neem oil is highly toxic to them.</li>
      <li>I even tried mixing with other oils, but it is too strong.</li>
      <li>The hydrocortisone cream I usually use, appear to give much quicker and better relief.</li>
      <li>had a very very itchy case of athlete&#x27;s foot, without traditional symptoms like peeling or odor.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t had the (dis)pleasure of experiencing that, let me try another analogy: like a soiled diaper and rotten onion in a closed car on a hot, humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a complete wash, my organic gardening expert sister tells me this stuff is fabulous for organic pest control.</li>
      <li>Neither my dogs nor my husband would come near me when I put this stuff on</li>
      <li>and this is the closest to natural I can find in this part of the world.</li>
      <li>I am using this on my face near my nose.  </li>
      <li>To help you understand, the product looked a lot like old honey or sap.</li>
      <li>He wouldn&#x27;t let it near him because of the smell.</li>
      <li>I am also sold on the product being a natural insecticide because i have used neem (not this brand) in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pet them without completely washing the oil off your hands, etc.</li>
      <li>It smells like an overripe durian in a hot car with closed windows.</li>
      <li>get this oil into your pores, rub the jojoba/neem mix into your face with a hot wet wash</li>
      <li>Above all it&#x27;s so inexpensive, natural and organic.</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling soft, not dry or oily.  </li>
      <li>I have used this with 10 parts jojoba oil to 1 part neem on my face daily for the past two months and seen a significant improvement in the condition of my skin.</li>
      <li>When I finally got them to send a new bottle, that they claimed was from the same batch, it looked TOTALLY different.</li>
      <li>First let me start off by saying the smell is DEADLY.</li>

<li> First let me start off by saying the smell is DEADLY.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it is because it smelled too bad for me to use it for the inital purpose (clearing up a rash).  </li>
<li> Maybe if you wear a haircap or something, but the smell lingers around so long.</li>
<li> I am very sensitive to smells and honestly this is one of the worst things I have ever smelled.  </li>
<li> However the smell is pretty raunchy.</li>
<li> The short story is that I was trying to explain that the product I ordered what nothing like the photo or anything I had purchased in the past.</li>
<li> so I am not sure if I gave the product enough time.  </li>
<li> In summary, the Neem oil was shipped and it arrived as promised; it had no instructions on use and the smell was as repulsive as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
<li> Get those expectations out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had itchy skin which I didn&#x27;t know if I could attribute it to bugs biting or other conditions; one dose applied with cotton swab stopped it, undiluted.</li>
<li> I finally added some jojoba oil to the bottle, stirred this using a toothpick...still to thick to get out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> I am not sure if I got an old bottle or what, but this stuff is thick like jelly.  </li>
<li> I turned the bottle upside down and vigorously shook it hoping I could get the product out that way...</li>
<li> It arrived in a sealed plastic pouch for shipping, but did not have the typical safety seal around the screw cap.</li>
<li> I used a little lavender cream under my nose to help with smell.  </li>
<li> I can now use the Neem Oil, but it is no longer concentrated and of little use to me.  </li>
<li> When I washed it off I noticed the pimples had decreased in size and the redness was starting to fade.  </li>
<li> The smell is horrible as many have mentioned, but I leave it on my scalp for a couple of hours</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t get past it</li>
<li> It smells like gasoline and I was not able to sleep with it in my hair.</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
<li> I have tried tea tree oil and that smells pretty bad is this worse than that?</li>
<li> To avoid leaving a trail of bad odor on the furniture,I used some old sheets on the couch, chair, pillows, etc.  </li>
<li> The bottle contains an eye dropper which I could not use because the product is so thick the eye dropper did not work in getting the product out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> I am however trying it out now in a VERY small volume on a mole on my shoulder, as it is supposed to help fade moles.  </li>
<li> I mean it is worse than being at a crime scene</li>
<li> No joke, because the itch was making me half mad.</li>
<li> gave 4 stars and not 5, the last star being left off not being the fault of the brand, but because neem oil, ALL neem oil, stinks (and terribly so, unless you dilute it with another carrier oil).</li>
<li> Sorry..</li>
<li> By the second week, my feet were insanely itchy again, where I couldn&#x27;t even fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I used Neem oil on my scalp to get rid of the scary seborrheic dermatitis that was growing, and it accelerated the healing process with usage of zinc pyrithione shampoo.</li>
<li> boy was I wrong.  </li>
<li> What bothers me is that it is not an oil and its difficult to use.</li>
<li> The smell is no where as bad as I have read in some of these ridiculous reviews.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t review it because it stinks so bad</li>
<li> it smells SO bad.  </li>
<li> On the label of the bottle it even warns you that it smells bad...</li>
<li> This product smells so bad you can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
<li> Yes the smell is bad but it does say it on the description.</li>
<li> While others mentioned the stinky smell, I thought that it cannot be that bad</li>

    <li> It does smell, but the odor dissipates as it works into you skin.  I put it on my face right after dinner and washed it off right before bed.  I was worried about the odor being absorbed into my bedding.  I used a little lavender cream under my nose to help with smell.  I used a cotton ball to dab it on some problem acne / redness areas I have on my face.  When I washed it off I noticed the pimples had decreased in size and the redness was starting to fade.  This was only after day 1 and leaving it on for about six hours.  I have read that it also reduces pore size and fine lines.  We will see over time how it does.  I am happy with day one.  Oh, it smells like sunflower oil.  When you wash it off use a mild soap and follow up with a toner and you will have no residual smell.  Left my skin feeling soft, not dry or oily.  I am happy with it so far...  Will update this post as times goes on.</li>
    <li> First let me start off by saying the smell is DEADLY. I mean it is worse than being at a crime scene but i had great hair growth, a clean healthy scalp. USE MUST USE ANOTHER SCENTED OIL (LEMON/LAVENDER)TO Calm the scent! My fiance would not allow me to sleep with him if I HAD THIS IN MY HAIR!</li>
    <li> Neither my dogs nor my husband would come near me when I put this stuff on it smells SO bad.  And not like how Tiger Balm smells bad...my husband suggested I smelled like rotten garlic and cloves.  Nice.  I wore it to bed and kept waking myself up in the night with the smell.    That being said...I don&#x27;t know how effective it is because it smelled too bad for me to use it for the inital purpose (clearing up a rash).  I am however trying it out now in a VERY small volume on a mole on my shoulder, as it is supposed to help fade moles.  No difference yet but it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.</li>
    <li> While others mentioned the stinky smell, I thought that it cannot be that bad and so I decided to try the Neem oil myself.  I was wrong; the stuff smells terrible.  I bravely tried to use it on some rashes on my arm and feet.  Without any accompanying written instruction, I lightly daubed it on the affected areas on consecutive evenings (when I was at home). To avoid leaving a trail of bad odor on the furniture,I used some old sheets on the couch, chair, pillows, etc.  Three days were all I (and my family) could stand so I am not sure if I gave the product enough time.  However, during the short time I used this oil, I did not notice any improvement.  The hydrocortisone cream I usually use, appear to give much quicker and better relief. In summary, the Neem oil was shipped and it arrived as promised; it had no instructions on use and the smell was as repulsive as other reviewers mentioned. I managed to try it for three days but I did not see any positive results (perhaps it needs longer time).</li>
    <li> It is a small bottle but it works nicely. It has a very strong smell, but I guess that is the organic part. Recieved it quick.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis, so I thought I had found the perfect product...boy was I wrong.  The bottle contains an eye dropper which I could not use because the product is so thick the eye dropper did not work in getting the product out of the bottle.  I turned the bottle upside down and vigorously shook it hoping I could get the product out that way...still no luck.  I finally added some jojoba oil to the bottle, stirred this using a toothpick...still to thick to get out of the bottle.  I then used several toothpicks together and retrieved some of the Neem Oil from the bottle and placed it in a clean and sterile 10 ml amber bottle that I had also purchased from Amazon; I then had to add more of the jojoba oil to the amber bottle, I put the cap on and shook very well.  I can now use the Neem Oil, but it is no longer concentrated and of little use to me.  I would not buy this product from Amazon again..I will look elsewhere for Neem Oil. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON.</li>
    <li> and this is the closest to natural I can find in this part of the world. Doesnt smell as bad as some reviewers said.</li>
    <li> I am using this on my face near my nose.  The smell is obvious but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like was the fact that the bottle did not have a &amp;#34;safety seal.&amp;#34;  It arrived in a sealed plastic pouch for shipping, but did not have the typical safety seal around the screw cap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was having horrible skin irritations. He wouldn&#x27;t let it near him because of the smell. May have worked, but he wouldn&#x27;t even try it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Nothing better for your scalp, Skin, scars etc;.........The smell is no where as bad as I have read in some of these ridiculous reviews.</li>
    <li> I love the Zaja neem oil, my daughter has eczema and it help her allot. Yes the smell is bad but it does say it on the description. Would recommend to anyone that have skin problem.</li>
    <li> This product smells so bad you can&#x27;t even use it. On the label of the bottle it even warns you that it smells bad...couldn&#x27;t use it.  They oil is in solid form and not liquid.</li>
    <li> This the best oil to use on acne, itching skin and all the body. I recommend it for any one</li>
    <li> did not work for me .....i CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT,HOWEVER IT BE  GOOD FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER&lt;br /&gt;SORRY ABOUT THAT</li>
    <li> You might want to advertise that the smell is vile.  I honestly gag when I smell this serum.  I can not use it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I got an old bottle or what, but this stuff is thick like jelly.  Its goopy.  There is an eye dropper in the bottle, but you cant use it, because its jam packed with neem goop.  The smell, isnt good, but its not supposed to be.  Its smells like rotten onions, but that doesnt bother me ...if I could use it.  What bothers me is that it is not an oil and its difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Great oil to add to shampoo to prevent lice in children who attend school.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product for my thinning hair but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. It smells like gasoline and I was not able to sleep with it in my hair. Maybe if you wear a haircap or something, but the smell lingers around so long. Sorry.. I even tried mixing with other oils, but it is too strong.</li>
    <li> I am looking into getting this to see if it will help with my sons Molluscum...I have tried tea tree oil and that smells pretty bad is this worse than that?</li>
    <li> I used Neem oil on my scalp to get rid of the scary seborrheic dermatitis that was growing, and it accelerated the healing process with usage of zinc pyrithione shampoo. The smell is horrible as many have mentioned, but I leave it on my scalp for a couple of hours then I would shampoo and the smell will be gone. Just make sure you do not rest your head on a pillow as it will stink.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review it because it stinks so bad I had to wash it off. It really is offensive, and that&#x27;s an understatement!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried another neem brand for personal use, so I can&#x27;t say if I can attribute the advantages, overall, to all neem products or specifically to this brand. With the Zaja brand, I have had great success at treating skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars and not 5, the last star being left off not being the fault of the brand, but because neem oil, ALL neem oil, stinks (and terribly so, unless you dilute it with another carrier oil). Be warned this is never going to be delightful like jojoba, almond oil or essential oils to your olfactory senses. Get those expectations out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had itchy skin which I didn&#x27;t know if I could attribute it to bugs biting or other conditions; one dose applied with cotton swab stopped it, undiluted. Marks and itch cleared up, skin was healed.&lt;br /&gt;I had a very very itchy case of athlete&#x27;s foot, without traditional symptoms like peeling or odor. I tried using Tinactin OTC. I applied it religiously for a week, twice a day, cleaned socks, even washed running shoes. By the second week, my feet were insanely itchy again, where I couldn&#x27;t even fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the neem oil with cotton swabs, and then put on cotton socks. It was like a miracle of immediate F-ing relief. No joke, because the itch was making me half mad. I have been sold on this product being an anti-fungal. I am also sold on the product being a natural insecticide because i have used neem (not this brand) in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a smelly option, but a more effective one for certain conditions, over pharmaceutical options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added note: Use caution around cats, if you have them. Neem oil is highly toxic to them. Don&#x27;t pet them without completely washing the oil off your hands, etc. Limit their exposure to you, overall, if you are leaving it on and they can breathe it in or rub against it.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from acne for a couple of years now and was always hesitant towards anything that would cause my skin to be more oily that it already was. It took me a long time to even start thinking about trying such an controversial idea. I am glad I finally did. Neem oil is so far one of the best soothing remedies I have found and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried it all. I have been using it for few weeks now and can&#x27;t tell if it helps my brake outs or not, but it definitely makes my skin feels good and heels faster. It smells like sunflower oil and I actually kinda like it. Above all it&#x27;s so inexpensive, natural and organic. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smells and honestly this is one of the worst things I have ever smelled.  I couldn&#x27;t get past it so I sold the product to a friend. The scent doesn&#x27;t bother her. If you can handle the smell, then by all means purchase it as my friend swears by this oil for your skin.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work on me just because It didn&#x27;t work for me it might be good for somebody else I HOPE</li>
    <li> I have used this with 10 parts jojoba oil to 1 part neem on my face daily for the past two months and seen a significant improvement in the condition of my skin. I&#x27;ve also started drinking more water and stopped consuming coconut oil, as dehydration seems to figure greatly into the condition of the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get this oil into your pores, rub the jojoba/neem mix into your face with a hot wet wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Raederle Phoenix&lt;br /&gt;Nutritionist, Speaker &amp; Author</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m sure this is a solid product, but I&#x27;m leaving a review for anyone who -like me- plans on using it for a skin treatment:&lt;br /&gt;I know if I could stick it out this would be great for my skin. I&#x27;ve read it does wonders for rosacea. However the smell is pretty raunchy. I have an extremely strong stomach (five boys and a bunch of dogs and chickens will do that for you) but it makes mine do flips. It smells like an overripe durian in a hot car with closed windows. If you haven&#x27;t had the (dis)pleasure of experiencing that, let me try another analogy: like a soiled diaper and rotten onion in a closed car on a hot, humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a complete wash, my organic gardening expert sister tells me this stuff is fabulous for organic pest control. I believe it. It would repel me for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great for organic gardening or in a VERY dilute facial tincture but DEFINITELY not for applying neat unless you lack a sense of smell.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the oil.. I was looking for this specific oil for my horse that has a skin cond. Worked.</li>
    <li> I wish I could upload the photo I took of the bottle I received compared to the photo you are seeing as you read this --NOTHING alike. When I requested help or assistance, I was greeted by a sassy e-mail writer for the company. The short story is that I was trying to explain that the product I ordered what nothing like the photo or anything I had purchased in the past. To help you understand, the product looked a lot like old honey or sap. When I finally got them to send a new bottle, that they claimed was from the same batch, it looked TOTALLY different. Actually, it looked like the photo above. I was insulted by the company respondent because this person insinuated that I had no idea what I was looking at and that the item was perfect - as it was approved in-house..........All I can say is that it was not what I ordered and the person I communicated with was awful. I will not purchase anything from this seller, ever again. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, I hope this review helps you learn the lesson before you purchase. I did get a refund of the purchase price - BUT NOT ON SHIPPING!</li>
