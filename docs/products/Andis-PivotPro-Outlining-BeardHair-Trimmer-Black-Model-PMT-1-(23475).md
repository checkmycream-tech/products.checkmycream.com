      <li>good clippers, easy to adjust the blades compared to higher priced clippers, the blades cut great when adjusted right, good overall price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s going strong after a year.</li>
      <li>Very fine pair of trimmers cutting my own hair with the best results I have hade.</li>
      <li>I removed the two machine screws that hold the blade assembly on to the vibration assembly to clean it.  </li>
      <li>I had better luck with a cheap Oster, which I&#x27;m going back to WalMart to purchase today.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Set the blade right</li>
      <li>i use this to shave myself up and shave my hair grow pretty fast and this clippers did a great job on my head and other parts.</li>

      <li>Very close cut too.</li>
      <li>Very competitive price.</li>
      <li>All in all its a good clipper for someone that wish a professional beard shave and a long lasting trimmer.</li>
      <li>I keep it clean and oil it regularly.</li>
      <li>and I felt I needed more power for less hassle.</li>
      <li>Replacing an older model Pivot Pro.</li>
      <li>This is a classic case of a product only being as good as it&#x27;s weakest part, and in this case, it turns out to be a small (and brittle) nub of plastic.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend spending a little more money and buying the Andis Professional T - outlining clippers....  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll look for a professional vibrating trimmer.</li>
      <li>This is not the same quality as the older models.</li>

<li> The reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because the blades are extremely sharp and on thin skinned areas (like behing the ears) they may cut you as they did him.</li>
<li> This tiny broken component caused the trimmer to completely fail.    </li>
<li> 40 times a day at least.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 7 years, and use them at least twice a week with no problems</li>
<li> It worked as promised, but I have thick curly hair and twice the unit has been lodged with hair rendering it useless.</li>
<li> Horrible Customer Service through Andis!  </li>

    <li> Horrible Customer Service through Andis!  I was hung up on and when I called back, they wouldn&#x27;t stand by there product after only 2 months of use. I used these for trimming my beard, not like it was used for commercial use. This is the second Andis product I bought and broke within a short time. I bought the Slimline 2 first and it stopped trimming. The motor will run and the blades move but it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything. By the way I regularly oiled them and maintained them-they were not used and abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say they have a 12 month Warranty but would not replace them. Because on the transformer the date code was from 2013, even though I bought them June of 2014 and the other pair August of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy an Andis Product Ever Again.</li>
    <li> In my experience I did not get a close shave with these clippers.  I was attracted to them because of the price.  I would recommend spending a little more money and buying the Andis Professional T - outlining clippers....  I ended up having to.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer two years ago because its short blades allowed me to trim my beard and cut my hair using the comb attachments (at the time it came with 4 combs). It worked as promised, but I have thick curly hair and twice the unit has been lodged with hair rendering it useless. I keep it clean and oil it regularly. I&#x27;ve already replaced the blade once and I did so because it too became clogged. I give it three stars because it worked as promised, just not for very long. I think I&#x27;ll look for a professional vibrating trimmer.</li>
    <li> good clippers, easy to adjust the blades compared to higher priced clippers, the blades cut great when adjusted right, good overall price.</li>
    <li> Good product but not the right size...</li>
    <li> I once used a tiny Wahl cordless trimmer and I felt I needed more power for less hassle. Primarily used for facial trimming, this baby does the trick!</li>
    <li> Works great, gives a real close cut. Just don&#x27;t drop them.  Even from a 12 inch drop they will be history.</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift for my son. He says they are nice, handy to have and do a good job with his regular trims. The reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because the blades are extremely sharp and on thin skinned areas (like behing the ears) they may cut you as they did him. I admit I&#x27;m ignorant about stuff like this but should blades be so sharp?</li>
    <li> good product and seller</li>
    <li> Very fine pair of trimmers cutting my own hair with the best results I have hade. The quality of the product really does matter.  This was a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well.  We wore out our last pair, but that&#x27;s because they were given as a gift to someone that&#x27;s a hair stylist.  Day in and day out they were used.  40 times a day at least.  After a year went by and dropping them, they finally started to get louder.  Shouldn&#x27;t have dropped them 6 feet onto a tile floor, but it happens.  Well worth the money.  They work great.  Commercial grade.  We&#x27;re on our second trimmer and it&#x27;s going strong after a year.</li>
    <li> Got it very fast. This is the best trimmer out there. Very close cut too. I would deffinatly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I removed the two machine screws that hold the blade assembly on to the vibration assembly to clean it.  When brushing out the accumulated hair and lint, a small piece of plastic popped out.  It turned out to be one of the little plastic nubs that moves the blade back and forth.  This tiny broken component caused the trimmer to completely fail.    This is a classic case of a product only being as good as it&#x27;s weakest part, and in this case, it turns out to be a small (and brittle) nub of plastic.  I had better luck with a cheap Oster, which I&#x27;m going back to WalMart to purchase today.</li>
    <li> i use this to shave myself up and shave my hair grow pretty fast and this clippers did a great job on my head and other parts. great clippers works well with shape up not too close of a shave up but its nice though.</li>
    <li> Great pair of trimmers. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 7 years, and use them at least twice a week with no problems</li>
    <li> RETURNED DID NOT WORK FOR ME</li>
    <li> Good trimmer . Set the blade right and you&#x27;ve got a nice liner . Kinda big but they do the job .</li>
    <li> Love my Trimmers perfect cut and didn&#x27;t have to wait long for them to come. I will be ordering soon!</li>
    <li> Was perfect but returned it for a different one because the casing seemed tampered with (had a manufacturing defect). All in all its a good clipper for someone that wish a professional beard shave and a long lasting trimmer. It might not be as 0000 like a blade but I assure you, its a trimmer to go with because it trims your beard well. Give it try folks.</li>
    <li> My son swears by this trimmer.  Very competitive price.</li>
    <li> Replacing an older model Pivot Pro. This is not the same quality as the older models. I would upgrade before purchasing this model again.</li>
