      <li>I love the smell!</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember how I encountered this product, but am glad I did!  </li>
      <li>All that said, this sounded nice, so I gave it a try, and</li>
      <li>It moisturized my skin so nice, no ash at all.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and pleasant, just a touch of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>but it lasts forever and is by far the best body cream I&#x27;ve ever run across.  </li>
      <li>This is a smooth lightly and pleasantly scented body moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>I do not wear makeup, yet get many compliments on how \\&quot;good\\&quot; my skin is.  </li>
      <li>B00113HO90 Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff -- wish they&#x27;d never taken it off the market.  </li>
      <li>think the grapefruit is better for waking up, and this, for evening.  </li>
      <li>I love this body cream.  </li>
      <li>However for the price, I want more</li>
      <li>Love its pliability, goes on your skin  with ease.</li>
      <li>This lotion is skin softening and mood altering! :)</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent because it is kind of sweet, but it&#x27;s not sickening</li>
      <li>best product I have bought for dry skin, I just hope neorogena does not stop making it.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;The body cream glides on very soft and starts to work immediately!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought it with the hand cream and both of them work perfectly well in Connecticut&#x27;s &amp;#34;never-ended&amp;#34; dry winter!</li>
      <li>I think for most people Neutrogena is fine which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful for an all over body lotion and even works extremely well on my calloused heels.</li>
      <li>It also has a slightly sweet smell, like butter cream, or creme brulee :)  </li>
      <li>and I kept looking and did fine a cream that is just the ticket, CeraVe.  </li>
      <li>this body butter will probably be fine.  </li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase and will probably buy this again, but I don&#x27;t think it can replace my $20 brand.</li>
      <li>CeraVe is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>DEEP MOISTURE-BUTTER CREAM--ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM NEUTROGENA.</li>
      <li>and I have come to really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I have found one that is reasonably priced, safe (for those of us with sensitivities) and which I like so well.  </li>
      <li>I did find that to make the scent rub off on my sheets which makes my bed smell extra nice :)  </li>
      <li>creamy soft and lovely smelling!  </li>
      <li>I used it so fast, and i need to order more.</li>
      <li>I have tried them all over 40 + years, and this is by far the best for my extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>It absorbs well and does not feel greasy and leaves my skin feeling very smooth &amp; soft.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>The price is right, so give yourself the gift of velvety skin, all day, all night.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering though and doesn&#x27;t bother me unless I put it on my hands right before bed.</li>
      <li>, Winter can leave us with dry flakey skin, I promise, your skin will drink this cream and LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin, and this makes it feel amazing.</li>
      <li>This body butter spread easily &amp; was absorbed quickly however it does NOT have lasting power.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will admit to being somewhat of a fanatic for nice bath products (my husband would eliminate the qualifier) and did write up my favorite boutique [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>creamy smooth, very soft.</li>
      <li>No greasy look or feel, just smooth and soft!</li>

      <li>I have gifted it to several people in my family and they all want to know where I got it.</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and rubs into dry skin very easily.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert where the water is SUPER HARD!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the way it mixes with certain perfumes</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>Not greasy absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>I use it at night  and find it a very soothing scent which helps me get to sleep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really have never found a Neutrogena product that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
      <li>so I need very moisturizing and long-lasting lotion.</li>
      <li>I am very sensative to fragrances and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my skin very soft-but not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.  </li>
      <li>I also tried the pink grapefruit line and like that a good  deal too (but personally Prefer this one).I</li>
      <li>My daughter, however, really likes their classic line (which is probably what brought me here as she is coming home for vacation</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this body cream...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product or any Neutrogena products to a friend.</li>
      <li>I have 2 unopened jars left, but when I open that last one, I&#x27;ll be ordering more!  </li>
      <li>and it takes just a little more rubbing  to work it into your skin.  </li>
      <li>It significantly reduced itching and irritation during the dry winter months.</li>
      <li>skin is now very girly girl soft...</li>
      <li>This lotion was not satisfactory for that, though I think people with normal skin would have no problems.</li>
      <li>Though that was a disappointed, it had a very soft and luxurious feeling, and a really pleasant, light scent (not one that triggered my allergies as many other lotions do).</li>
      <li>Fantastic for very dry skin!</li>
      <li>so I only use it right before bed after the shower.</li>
      <li>It does dry quickly and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>In fact, it reminds me quite a bit of the cream I linked above :)  If you are not familiar with that line, that may not mean anything to you.  </li>
      <li>I have allergies and chemical sensitivities, so I either go natural/ organic, or use a line like Neutrogena developed for people with allergies.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrances, and this does have one.</li>
      <li>The deep cream moisturizer \\&quot;butter cream\\&quot; really is.  </li>
      <li>B0016OCTHQ Dream Cream Body Cream by LUSH]]</li>
      <li>It does what it says, the rich deep moisturization, sinks into your skin, leaving it velvet soft, NOT a greasy cream.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;deep\\&quot; moisture, but I have other things to use on really chapped skin.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t thick like body butter from The Body Shop (which is more like a soft solid).</li>
      <li>It felt a little spa-like when putting it on, and I got several comments from others about the light scent.</li>
      <li>much much nicer than I had expected.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer</li>
    <li> While I like the cream.  The seller sent a different version, one that comes in a green container and has a different smell than the one I ordered and which is pictured.  I&#x27;m still going to use it.  Don&#x27;t feel like bothering with returning it and the hassle it will take.  I just won&#x27;t order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This smells so yummy-I love slathering it on before bed-I smell like butter cream frosting all night!  It also makes my skin very soft-but not at all greasy.  I really have never found a Neutrogena product that I don&#x27;t like.  I would highly recommend for skin softening and a little bit of aromatherapy action!</li>
    <li> My massage therapist introduced me to Neutrogena Deep Moisture body cream.  I use it daily on my face and neck.  It keeps my skin soft all day-no need for any other cream or moisturizer.  I do not wear makeup, yet get many compliments on how \\&quot;good\\&quot; my skin is.  I have been using this product for over a year</li>
    <li> creamy soft and lovely smelling!  people always say I smell like a sugar cookie or if I am in a room I hear mmm what smells so good in here!  This lotion is skin softening and mood altering! :)</li>
    <li> I had some Neutrogena cream in a similar container several years ago and was hoping that this would be the same thing. It is not. This cream is NOT what you would expect to get in this sort of tub/container. It isn&#x27;t thick like body butter from The Body Shop (which is more like a soft solid). It&#x27;s closer to regular lotion from a pump bottle that has been put into a different container. Other than that, it&#x27;s good. I am sensitive to fragrances, and this does have one. It isn&#x27;t overpowering though and doesn&#x27;t bother me unless I put it on my hands right before bed. It does dry quickly and is not greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t really call it \\&quot;deep\\&quot; moisture, but I have other things to use on really chapped skin.</li>
    <li> Not greasy absorbs fast. Best body cream ever. I am very allergic and it&#x27;s one of the few I can use. Please bring it back.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this cream because I thought it would be a thicker consistency. I have extremely dry skin, eczema, and live in a desert climate so I need very moisturizing and long-lasting lotion. This lotion was not satisfactory for that, though I think people with normal skin would have no problems. Though that was a disappointed, it had a very soft and luxurious feeling, and a really pleasant, light scent (not one that triggered my allergies as many other lotions do). It felt a little spa-like when putting it on, and I got several comments from others about the light scent. So I would highly recommend it as long as you are not looking for a very thick body cream for dryer skin.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t remember how I encountered this product, but am glad I did!  I like, but do not love the classic Neutrogena Rainbath [[ASIN:B00113HO90 Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel- 40 oz (Mega Size)]].  My daughter, however, really likes their classic line (which is probably what brought me here as she is coming home for vacation soon),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit to being somewhat of a fanatic for nice bath products (my husband would eliminate the qualifier) and did write up my favorite boutique [[ASIN:B0016OCTHQ Dream Cream Body Cream by LUSH]] some 5-10 years ago (likely not doing them justice ;)  In any event it is a somewhat dangerous obsession unless one is prepared to spend upwards of $10/ day bathing . {sigh}  would that I could.&lt;br /&gt;  Their skin care line is also very nice but.... well we get into mortgage territory here ;)  All that said, this sounded nice, so I gave it a try, and Wow! much much nicer than I had expected.  In fact, it reminds me quite a bit of the cream I linked above :)  If you are not familiar with that line, that may not mean anything to you.  The deep cream moisturizer \\&quot;butter cream\\&quot; really is.  It absorbs well and does not feel greasy and leaves my skin feeling very smooth &amp; soft.

I am glad that I have found one that is reasonably priced, safe (for those of us with sensitivities) and which I like so well.  I will be keeping this one on subscription!  I also tried the pink grapefruit line and like that a good  deal too (but personally Prefer this one).I think the grapefruit is better for waking up, and this, for evening.  (much as I like it, I think it would not go well with cologne or perfume, and would feel a little odd in a work environment smelling like butter cream.  However, as a night cream it is perfect!work environment smelling like butter cream.  However, as a night cream it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, and this makes it feel amazing. Smells great, and keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of body butters and I have been looking for something a little cheaper than the $20 brand I have gotten attached to. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent because it is kind of sweet, but it&#x27;s not sickening and I have come to really enjoy it. I don&#x27;t like the way it mixes with certain perfumes so I only use it right before bed after the shower. I did find that to make the scent rub off on my sheets which makes my bed smell extra nice :)  The only disappointing thing about it is that it&#x27;s not as thick as I like my body butter to be.   Overall I am happy with my purchase and will probably buy this again, but I don&#x27;t think it can replace my $20 brand.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great and is non greasy. I&#x27;m so sad that it is no longer available in this size.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!  I can apply it before I go to bed, and when I wake up, my elbows are still moist, without the greasy feel!  I cannot use anything else!</li>
    <li> Last fall my hands were dry, peeling, cracked and bleeding, they felt like sandpaper.  I used this and experienced relief immediately and  overnight my hands were healed.  The smell is light and pleasant, just a touch of vanilla.  I am very sensative to fragrances and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;m so thankful a friend that saw my hands shared this with me.  I ordered 4 to share as christmas gifts and will be buying them in multiples from now on!!  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> This body butter spread easily &amp; was absorbed quickly however it does NOT have lasting power.  My skin was showing &amp;#34;winter dryness&amp;#34; symptoms in less than 24 hours.  If you do not has excessively dry skin (like mine) this body butter will probably be fine.  However for the price, I want more and I kept looking and did fine a cream that is just the ticket, CeraVe.  But be warned, it is not light and it takes just a little more rubbing  to work it into your skin.  I also do not care for the Neutrogena fragrance.  CeraVe is fragrance free.  I think for most people Neutrogena is fine which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dry skin moist.  Wish it came in a bigger jar!  I would highly recommend this product or any Neutrogena products to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the best product that you will ever find. If will heal any dry skin and sores almost over night.this product does not need to be replaced with anything.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOOOOOVE this lotion!!!  Why is it no longer available anywhere!!???!!  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so overpriced but it lasts forever and is by far the best body cream I&#x27;ve ever run across.  Neutrogena- BRING IT BACK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff -- wish they&#x27;d never taken it off the market.  It is wonderful for an all over body lotion and even works extremely well on my calloused heels.</li>
    <li> A bit on the fence about this purchase, it turns out that I REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!!! It does what it says, the rich deep moisturization, sinks into your skin, leaving it velvet soft, NOT a greasy cream.  And YES it is a THICK Butter Cream, Winter can leave us with dry flakey skin, I promise, your skin will drink this cream and LOVE IT! The price is right, so give yourself the gift of velvety skin, all day, all night.  DEEP MOISTURE-BUTTER CREAM--ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM NEUTROGENA.</li>
    <li> creamy smooth, very soft. Love its pliability, goes on your skin  with ease. A plus because you can use it all over your body.</li>
    <li> Excellent item.  Love it !!!  My whole family uses it.  It goes a long way. I have gifted it to several people in my family and they all want to know where I got it.</li>
    <li> best product I have bought for dry skin, I just hope neorogena does not stop making it. I have tried other products like this but they do not match</li>
    <li> This is one of the best-kept secrets from Neutrogena!  I don&#x27;t think they even know about it, as it was never even recommended when I emailed customer service about why I preferred Neutrogena lotions, but bought Nivea instead.  Long story short, the big blue jar gave me all of the product, not just what I could squirt out of a bottle or jar!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert where the water is SUPER HARD!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about every type of lotion and cream to soften my skin, even cooking oil!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product on Amazon and I thought I would give it a try...I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;The body cream glides on very soft and starts to work immediately!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now very girly girl soft...even my elbows and heels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this body cream...Neutrogena has a winner with this one!</li>
    <li> Bought it with the hand cream and both of them work perfectly well in Connecticut&#x27;s &amp;#34;never-ended&amp;#34; dry winter! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I use it after every shower in the winter!  I have 2 unopened jars left, but when I open that last one, I&#x27;ll be ordering more!  I only hope I can still find it!</li>
    <li> This is a smooth lightly and pleasantly scented body moisturizing cream. It is not greasy and rubs into dry skin very easily. It significantly reduced itching and irritation during the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for very dry skin! I have tried them all over 40 + years, and this is by far the best for my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I used it so fast, and i need to order more. It moisturized my skin so nice, no ash at all.</li>
    <li> It was a very thick moisture cream. I would not order it again nor would I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;bought this with great expectation however I was disapointed with the product as it makes your skin drier than it was. poor product</li>
    <li> I love the smell! It&#x27;s like vanilla pudding. Very moisturizing as well.</li>
    <li> I love this body cream.  It goes on just like it says...like butter!  No greasy look or feel, just smooth and soft!</li>
