<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product. After suffering from the ugly,scaly patches for years this product was able to make my skin clear and healthy. You must use these product sparingly. A little dab will do it. In a matter of one week my skin looked 100% better. Now I only have to use it when it begins to flare up and one dose does it. Again use a tiny dab and stop when when your skin stops flaking and itching</li>
    <li> Husband broke out all over his body with eczema.  He always has some but heat with Texas humidity really brings it on and he said this ointment did help some but mostly with the itching.  I can say he is not as grouchy.  I received the order in little over two weeks.  Price is well worth the relief he got.</li>
    <li> I had eczema in my ears and this cream was the only one that worked. After only three days of treatment, my eczema was gone.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product I first purchased and used in Uganda 3 years ago...I had an allergic reaction to a mosquito bite (non-malarial-yellow fever), which this product helped so much. Highly recommend this product it may work when nothing else will.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for my father who has a very severe case of prostate cancer along with other issues.This is the only product that keeps him without scratching all over his body or getting hives. The customer services is extremely helpful and they answer your questions right away. As far as the delivery, the product was in my hand 3 days after I ordered. I will recommend this product to everyone i know</li>
    <li> Cured the psoriasis I had tried absolutely everything on.  Only had to apply for about 4 days and it was totally gone.  Whenever I feel it coming back, I just rub a little on the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; spots and it prevents recurrence.</li>
    <li> Works well for contact dermatitis or skin inflammation associated with lupus.  Not as effective as temovate cream, but still good for irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This product never fails me. I&#x27;ve had psoriasis since 14 years of age ( 26 now) and this is the product that always worked for me. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it&#x27;s not harmful like most proscription products.</li>
    <li> For all those suffering from eczema and Psoriasis, This is the best product. It works within a few day&#x27;s. No need for a prescription.. Stubborn dry itchy skin? This product will work miracles. But just be aware that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so results may Vary. But all in all it will still work.&lt;br /&gt;kudos</li>
    <li> i suffer from mild to sever plaque psoriasis, if you don&#x27;t know what its like its one of the hardest and most expensive skin conditions to treat. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many treatments if been thru, creams and ointments I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on, and having to endure photo therapy, as well as shots (enbrel) which is unreal in price if you don&#x27;t have insurance or help to pay for it. I ordered dermovate just to see if it worked ( figured didn&#x27;t have anything to lose). It works! It works! It works! After the first or second day..all I could say was WOW:-) . PS..I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your face. Do your research beforehand. Good  luck</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream. It helps with ezeama and rashes. brilliant stuff.&lt;br /&gt;light ointment but it doesnt diappear before working into your skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had the condition for a over 13 years. She has used dermovate cream for last two years and it cleared her eczema right up.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, nothing else worked; otc or prescriptions</li>
    <li> My Eczema (on the palms of my hands) was HORRIBLE! I experienced painful blisters, dry, cracked skin (sometimes i would bleed from the cracks), irritating irritation, difficulty with doing house chores, which is what triggered my hand dermatitis for NOT using gloves when washing dishes or cleaning or just unnecessarily wetting my hands. It would hurt to even close my hand into a fist or even to do something simple as taking a bath or tying my shoe laces. it got to the point where the blisters became flesh wounds and basically my flesh was open to infections.  It also kind of effected my self esteem.  My hands were ROUGH and looked like crocodile/alligator skin.  I would hide my hands and try to avoid situations where people would be able to get a glimpse of my hands for fear that they would be grossed out and think that I had something that was contagious.  I was dealing with this for almost a year.  The creams that I was using would work temporarily (cortizone, cortizoid, you name it!)  Until I googled &amp;#34;treatments for severe hand dermatitis or eczema&amp;#34;. I looked up the type of steroids (individually) that are used for severe eczema and among them I found one that is most effective for severe eczema.  I typed the name of the steroid in amazon (i dont remember the name off the top of my head) and a list of creams/ointments came up. But DERMOVATE cream stood out to me for some reason (the 5 stars DUH!).  I read the reviews and decided &amp;#34;well I have tried everything, what else do I have to lose.&amp;#34; Let me tell you....I am GREAT FULL that GOD has allowed me to find this cream.  Within 3-4 days my severe eczema was severe no more.  My hands are now smooth to the touch. No blisters, no open flesh wounds, no irritating irritation, and best of all no alligator skin.  I MOST DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who is suffering from eczema. Couldn&#x27;t give it more stars because amazon only has five.</li>
    <li> When ordered and delivered, product had only one year left of an expected two-year span. One of the two tubes already has a broken top, allowing product inside to seep out. Will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> THE DERMOVATE CREAM WAS THE ONE WE ALWAYS ORDEERED.  IT HELPS CLEAR UP&lt;br /&gt;THE  PSORIASIS.  WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE CREAM AND RECOMMENT IT.</li>
    <li> Does the work. I have used it less than a month, but the improvement in my skin is just great.</li>
    <li> For all those suffering from eczema and Psoriasis, This is the best product. It works within a few day&#x27;s. No need for a prescription.. Stubborn dry itchy skin? This product will work miracles. But just be aware that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so results may Vary. But all in all it will still work.&lt;br /&gt;kudos</li>
    <li> Within a couple of days my eczema had started to clear up.  Very effective. Using over the counter products did nothing.  So glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I placed the order for this product because I have severe eczema that I&#x27;ve seemed to grow out of for the most part however my recent stress level increase caused it to flare up. I was happy that the item would come to me fast however I was pretty upset that after a few days and countless attempts to check my tracking, the item never came needless to mention shipped. I reached out to the seller who granted me a refund and was very fast about it but I needed the product. My hands and thighs have broken out in a rash :(</li>
    <li> This worked on my psoriasis when nothing else helped....the rash went away in a week..... U can&#x27;t even tell I ever had it. I was skeptical but it has done the job</li>
    <li> I bought this product for skin bites that don&#x27;t go away. It seems to work fine for that purpose. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love love love dermovate because it makes your skin look amazing.  Ther is nothing more to say. but  simply amazing.</li>
    <li> WHAT I WANTED. IT WAS MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS KIND OF PURCHASE AND WILL KEEP DOING IT NOW. GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever! I have eczema and this cream do wonders for my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Quality Product with Superb Customer Service Experience. A+&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone in searching for this type of medication and customer service.</li>
    <li> My daughters hand were raw from washing them repeatedly!! She also has skin problems!! This stuff is strong!! Use wisely!! But it works!! She called me crying, thanking me for ordering it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because of my condition, but this does not do much for dermatitis of the scalp... I thought it could at least help.</li>
    <li> Works great,  this was used by someone who  was previously perscribed this product for psoriasis in the past.  You need to have clear direction from your doctor on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube is a little small so I recommend ordering 2 or a larger size;  recieved within a week. Started working immediately!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Father in Law. He said&amp;#34; For anyone suffering from eczema and Psoriasis, This is the best product for your money. No prescription no hassle and a great price! I will order again.&amp;#34; And I just received his second order.</li>
    <li> I did not see eny change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the see you have to try more than one i use only one</li>
    <li> It works really well for me, I actually use this for an allergy reaction in a tattoo. Just in four days and the allergy gone.</li>
    <li> when i ordered this product i thought i was getting it to treat something that it was not intended to treat. the information on line was misleading.i can&#x27;t really rate it because i couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I already tried different kinds of cream, over the counter &amp; prescription creams for my some kind of eczema on my fingers &amp; only dermovate cream works the wonder. I am so glad my sister gave me this cream to try that came from her husband who worked in UAE &amp; I&#x27;m glad it can be purchased in Amazon without prescription as well. Now my fingers are all healed up after using it for 3-4 weeks. I&#x27;ve seen some improvement after a week by applying it in the morning after shower &amp; before going to bed but totally healed it in 3-4 weeks. I also use this product for any skin itchiness due dry flaky skin &amp; it works as well. I highly recommend this product. To the makers of this product, THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I use this  cream all the time its great its the only thing that works for me and yes I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> i use this one alternatively with labidjanaise carrot cream for my legs, and the resilts can bee seen, as it&#x27;s becoming obvious</li>
    <li> It was ok, I was expecting a stronger product, but it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;But I would try a new cream before buying this again, if your skin problem is not too bad, it should works for you!</li>
