      <li>I love this color and cannot find it in stores..</li>
      <li>I got my favorite lip color...</li>
      <li>I love CoverGirl Outlast lipstick and could not beat this price.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I did, a new favorite color!!</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick -- but it was so hard to find I wonder if CoverGirl is not manufacturing it any more.  </li>
      <li>Really lasts all day.</li>
      <li>but I did find out that using my own lip balm that is natural oil based will break down the color and make it flake and chunk off.</li>
      <li>For this order, however, I was only able to get several &amp;#34;tubes,&amp;#34; and had to settle for &amp;#34;Smoothwear,&amp;#34; which I do not like nearly as much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last quit as long as most other colors of this brand that I use, but I love the color.</li>
      <li>this color, not too dark, not too light.</li>
      <li>I normally wear the raisin but thought I may as well try a different color for the price.</li>
      <li>Lipstick generally stays on for 10 hrs, but is drying.  </li>
      <li>it really does last all day, even through eating and drinking (as long as it&#x27;s not too greasy).</li>
      <li>No dry feeling or cracking.  </li>

    <li> I love these lipsticks! If you keep it moisturized it really does last all day, even through eating and drinking (as long as it&#x27;s not too greasy). Takes several swipes with a makeup remover wipe to get it all off. Color selection is awesome. Price here on Amazon is better than local stores too.</li>

    <li> I love this lipstick -- but it was so hard to find I wonder if CoverGirl is not manufacturing it any more.

    <li> Bought this as a gift.  CoverGirl Outlast stays on great &amp; very happy with color.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I did find out that using my own lip balm that is natural oil based will break down the color and make it flake and chunk off. Do not do that. Use the gloss that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I love it. One application lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and color for years.  Lipstick generally stays on for 10 hrs, but is drying.  I don&#x27;t care as long as I have coverage.  Just use lip balm at night.</li>
