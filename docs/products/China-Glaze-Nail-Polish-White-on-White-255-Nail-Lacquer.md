      <li>However if I could have gotten the color on my nails, I think I would have liked it.</li>
      <li>Nice polish.</li>
      <li>will be ordering more ! :)</li>
      <li>This is a great nail polish and very high quality</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
      <li>but I was expecting it to cover a lil better.</li>
      <li>cute Color though.</li>
      <li>The white is perfect for spring!</li>
      <li>I Love all China Glaze nail polish.</li>
      <li>I like to use it with a top layer of color.</li>
      <li>Perfect shade of white for nails.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I will buy more of this brand.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to my friends that love nail polish.</li>
      <li>One coat is enough to be opaque, but two makes it perfect.</li>
      <li>I love China Glaze.</li>
      <li>Price is pretty good since you do pay more a the beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>The polish chips off sooo easily after a top coat is put on it..</li>
      <li>I love the color very much and if your into French manicures this color is the best to have on.</li>
      <li>Product was shipped and received very quickly</li>
      <li>China glaze is the best nail polish hands down.</li>
      <li>Anyone out there know of a great white polish?</li>
      <li>This is a great nail polish it cover nail in two coat and last well.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and smooth without to much effort.</li>
      <li>This formula kind of reminds me of painting white-out on my nails in high school.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, and dries fast.</li>
      <li>True to color, goes on smooth, works great with other nail polish base/top coats.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bright white</li>
      <li>Most even with 2 coats it&#x27;s still very streaky but with this Polish</li>
      <li>Such a good deal on here.  </li>
      <li>I chose this rating because it dose an excellent job of covering my nail 1 coat is almost enough to keep it white.</li>
      <li>While it is the perfect white for the job I bought it to do, I have some problems with streaking to some degree, something I have always had  a problem with, with white polish.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>China Glaze is my new favorite</li>
      <li>I was looking for a white polish to wear under some neon and crackle polishes I own, found this and decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>so it look really nice when you put white nail polish.</li>
      <li>The color is very bold and vibrant though.</li>
      <li>Other than that, again, this is the perfect white creme color to wear under neon and crackle polish.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very nice solid white after 2 coats.  </li>
      <li>The product came very fast.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have bought this brand.</li>
      <li>This nailpolish requires shaking when you first get it</li>
      <li>It went on top of the red nail polish without any problems.  </li>
      <li>This is a really great white polish I tried other</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s no problem because it drys pretty fast by itself.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a good intense color of white this isn&#x27;t your color, I would recommend the Sally Hansen white nail polish.</li>
      <li>I live china glaze!!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping /</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really great white color &amp; it isn&#x27;t sheer &amp; doesn&#x27;t make it look like you have white out on your nails.</li>
      <li>Also this polish got very goopy on about the 4th.</li>
      <li>It takes 2 to 3 coats to get it really opaque</li>
      <li>Put seche vite topcoat on to help smooth it out before it&#x27;s dry all the way.</li>
      <li>i really do love this brand, but at my local market its like $8 and its such a rip off because nail polish is eventually going to run out !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend to buy, it&#x27;s the white like the white-out white that I love.</li>
      <li>This is looks like the perfect white for French tips-however, my bottle came in the mail broken (I could tell because my mailbox reeked of nail polish) and the brush wasnt even attached to the cap.</li>
      <li>Did not stay on for more then a few days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra dollars.</li>
      <li>especially for the price you are paying its definitely worth buying this.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t affect the look of the neon polish (especially yellow) and it does work with the crackle polish, for me, I probably would have trouble wearing it on its&#x27; own.  </li>
      <li>Also has a different smell than most other nail polishes.</li>
      <li>But it does dry quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a pretty white nail Polish for a long time.</li>
      <li>coats for a whole nail base color is great too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get smooth without a lot of coats.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as the other nail polish brands that I have.</li>
      <li>i recommend this color to anyone who is a little tan and wants to look tanner because it make your look darker.</li>

<li> I think I&#x27;m going to try one of the other white polishes from Essie or OPI.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried other white polishes yet</li>
<li> All other white nail polishes leave streaks for me..</li>
<li> Everything was as promised and expected</li>
<li> i would recommend using a nail art brush instead of the actual applicator because its quite small.</li>
<li> its not worth $8</li>
<li> This stuff went on chunky and came off while applying the glow in the dark polish.</li>
<li> Got it because a few reviews said to apply under glow in the dark nail polish to improve the glow.</li>
<li> It is a little liquids and takes 2-3 coats.</li>
<li> im a little tan</li>
<li> Not too thick like some other brands.</li>
<li> I have become a China Glaze fanatic ever since I got &#x27;Nova&#x27;</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I&#x27;d like, so you have to layer up.</li>
<li> I do usually wear a base coat to keep my acrylics from discoloration, so I thought perhaps that has something to do with it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad polish, it&#x27;s not, just that it streaks at times, which is frustrating.  </li>
<li> VERY disappointed.</li>

    <li> This formula kind of reminds me of painting white-out on my nails in high school. It&#x27;s hard to get smooth without a lot of coats. Put seche vite topcoat on to help smooth it out before it&#x27;s dry all the way.</li>
    <li> This nailpolish requires shaking when you first get it and it is a white out white.  I like to use it with a top layer of color.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a durable nail polish.  This was NOT what I was looking for.  Did not stay on for more then a few days.</li>
    <li> China glaze is the best nail polish hands down. It&#x27;s not as thick as I&#x27;d like, so you have to layer up. But it does dry quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
    <li> Does NOT have coverage, even with 2 coats. This is the first time I have bought this brand. I won&#x27;t but again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend to buy, it&#x27;s the white like the white-out white that I love. I love the color very much and if your into French manicures this color is the best to have on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this polish at all. Got it because a few reviews said to apply under glow in the dark nail polish to improve the glow. This stuff went on chunky and came off while applying the glow in the dark polish.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it dose an excellent job of covering my nail 1 coat is almost enough to keep it white. I would recommend this to my friends that love nail polish.</li>
    <li> The product came very fast. Even earlier than the estimated delivery date. The color is very good. It takes 2 to 3 coats to get it really opaque but it&#x27;s no problem because it drys pretty fast by itself. It&#x27;s a really great white color &amp; it isn&#x27;t sheer &amp; doesn&#x27;t make it look like you have white out on your nails.</li>
    <li> they have the best quality nail polish!! especially for the price you are paying its definitely worth buying this. i currently have this color on with their brand of china glaze and i love it. im a little tan so it look really nice when you put white nail polish. i recommend this color to anyone who is a little tan and wants to look tanner because it make your look darker. i hope this review helped!</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised and expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.. But it streaks, I can put 4 coats on, and you can see streaks and places where it looks like you missed spots. I live china glaze!! All my polishes are either china glaze, Essie or OPI! I think I&#x27;m going to try one of the other white polishes from Essie or OPI. Anyone out there know of a great white polish? Also this polish got very goopy on about the 4th. Time I used it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I have become a China Glaze fanatic ever since I got &#x27;Nova&#x27; This is looks like the perfect white for French tips-however, my bottle came in the mail broken (I could tell because my mailbox reeked of nail polish) and the brush wasnt even attached to the cap. VERY disappointed. However if I could have gotten the color on my nails, I think I would have liked it. Problem was not with China Glaze as a brand.</li>
    <li> A bit on the sheer side, so it requires two coats. Price is pretty good since you do pay more a the beauty supply store. But if you are looking for a good intense color of white this isn&#x27;t your color, I would recommend the Sally Hansen white nail polish.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. It is a little liquids and takes 2-3 coats. I haven&#x27;t tried other white polishes yet but I was expecting it to cover a lil better.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze. All other white nail polishes leave streaks for me.. but this one didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> One coat is enough to be opaque, but two makes it perfect. It&#x27;s very light, and dries fast. Also has a different smell than most other nail polishes. China Glaze is my new favorite</li>
    <li> i really do love this brand, but at my local market its like $8 and its such a rip off because nail polish is eventually going to run out ! its not worth $8 but it is a very good polish. i would recommend using a nail art brush instead of the actual applicator because its quite small. will be ordering more ! :)</li>
    <li> Nice polish. Not too thick like some other brands. Goes on nice and smooth without to much effort. Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a pretty white nail Polish for a long time. Most even with 2 coats it&#x27;s still very streaky but with this Polish it&#x27;s a very nice solid white after 2 coats.  Product was shipped and received very quickly</li>
    <li> For details like flowers or polka dots, this color is perfect. It&#x27;s a bright white so it can be used for french tips as well.&lt;br /&gt;Two coats for a whole nail base color is great too.</li>
    <li> The polish chips off sooo easily after a top coat is put on it.. The color is very bold and vibrant though.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail polish it cover nail in two coat and last well. This is a really great white polish I tried other this is one great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good price. Perfect shade of white for nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail polish and very high quality</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the color -_-</li>
    <li> After 2 applications its a perfect coat but it does get sticky if air gets to it for too long.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law turned me into a China Glaze junkie.  This polish is amazing.  The white is perfect for spring! Such a good deal on here.  Sallys sells these around 7 dollars.</li>
    <li> I made candy cane stripes with this product.  It went on top of the red nail polish without any problems.  Only needed two coats.  Even when I wore it by itself, it only took two coats.  It doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as the other nail polish brands that I have. I will buy more of this brand.  It&#x27;s worth the extra dollars.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this was used or open at some point. Polish crusting all around bottle. Wont buy again from this place. cute Color though.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a white polish to wear under some neon and crackle polishes I own, found this and decided to try it.  While it is the perfect white for the job I bought it to do, I have some problems with streaking to some degree, something I have always had  a problem with, with white polish.  This doesn&#x27;t affect the look of the neon polish (especially yellow) and it does work with the crackle polish, for me, I probably would have trouble wearing it on its&#x27; own.  I do usually wear a base coat to keep my acrylics from discoloration, so I thought perhaps that has something to do with it.  I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad polish, it&#x27;s not, just that it streaks at times, which is frustrating.  Other than that, again, this is the perfect white creme color to wear under neon and crackle polish.</li>
    <li> True to color, goes on smooth, works great with other nail polish base/top coats. I Love all China Glaze nail polish.</li>
