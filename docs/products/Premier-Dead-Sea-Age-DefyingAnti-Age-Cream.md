      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but love how my skin feels using it.</li>
      <li>i love this cream i have</li>
      <li>I need to do more research in that area.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not any more.</li>
      <li>- so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
      <li>they are one of my better features and now get compliments again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before, and just love the way it feels.</li>
      <li>I love that cream.</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I Think Amazon should start caring more of their full line of products</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s not unpleasant- goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>both tried several products and they allseem to work great.  </li>
      <li>it works beautifully and it doesnt clog your pores like other products I have tried..</li>
      <li>I have been using the wrinkle cream for years, and every once in a while i will see something on tv that claims to do wonders, try it and totally regret it, my husband always asks why change something that works so nicely,  good question, I ve never had any problems with this cream</li>
      <li>MUCH AND HAVE CONTINUED TO USE THEM BECAUSE THE TEXTURE FEELS SMOOTH AND VELVETY</li>
      <li>well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The wide open jar with the spatula is unique and very handy.  </li>
      <li>This cream is very light, only a hint of odor</li>
      <li>after using this cream i can now go without concealer and love how much younger my eyes look.  </li>
      <li>I dont see any positive effect  for me.</li>
      <li>Most recently though, I tried this new product that appears to be a complement to the eye cream.  </li>
      <li>VERY  </li>
      <li>All very suspicious.  </li>
      <li>Hydrates the skin and makes skin look so much softer and youger looking.</li>
      <li>at a reasonable sale price.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soley responsible for the improvements -</li>
      <li>This is very hydrating without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I find the product really, really works</li>
      <li>I like how nicely this product seems to melt into my skin, and does not leave a heavy or greasy feeling, even after a 12 hour work day.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s got all the right stuff as far as the published literature indicate that CAN help..</li>
      <li>I have used many of their products including this one, for well over 3 and a half years now.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have use this product for about 3 weeks, and am pleasantly surprised how much I like it.</li>
      <li>Far I really like this</li>
      <li>I only received it about a week ago so admittedly, I can&#x27;t really say much about the quality of the product, but I really don&#x27;t think it legitimately Premier.  </li>
      <li>Other products I have used have to be squeezed out of a tube, so I don&#x27;t get my full value.  </li>
      <li>Had a old smell to the cream.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product at a mall where I spent the most ridiculous amount of money for it that I am embarassed just thinking about it.  </li>
      <li>Especially based on a previous review saying it&#x27;s light and relatively odor-free.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have purchased a variety of dead sea products from Amazon after first purchasing some from a mall.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, I don&#x27;t quite understand why the prices for some of the  Premier Dead Sea Products fluctuate all over the place for the same item.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes I have a very slight tingling on the skin when it&#x27;s first applied.&lt;br</li>

<li> I have normal to dry skin.</li>
<li> I have purchased a variety of dead sea products from Amazon after first purchasing some from a mall.  </li>
<li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t quite understand why the prices for some of the  Premier Dead Sea Products fluctuate all over the place for the same item.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Sometimes I have a very slight tingling on the skin when it&#x27;s first applied.&lt;br</li>
<li> The cream is thick and goes directly into the skin making it dewey and soft.  </li>
<li> The foil wasn&#x27;t thightly sealed so that was strange.  </li>
<li> We first tired it a a chrismastime booth at a local mall.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
<li> Then the cream was very thick, smells waxy and there was only about half of the container full.  </li>
<li> I can not live with out it.</li>
<li> Was kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> 1/3 of the product was missing, different color and texture than the ones I previously bought...was definitly opened maybe a return.</li>
<li> I like all the other products in this line I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I still like it, but if you look at some of my other reviews, you&#x27;ll see I have been using quite a few products now for a year to evaluate them &amp; have had to make choices about what to buy again.  </li>
<li> When I opened it there was a foil sealer that I don&#x27;t recall seeing on other Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
<li> Secondly, they have quite a wide range of products, with some research behind their ingredients, but the way they market and advertise around the globe makes choosing one confusing.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nothing like the cream I previously bought.</li>
<li> slways had dark circles under the eyes and had to hide it with heavy concealer.  </li>
<li> ;  I WOULD BE IN TROUBLE-</li>
<li> not as described--came in a green container</li>
<li> SO, I RECOMMEND ALL OF THE DEAD SEA PRODUCTS!</li>
<li> /&gt;Using it on my feet.... what a waste!!</li>
<li> Not happy,</li>
<li> Rancid cream, jars seal had been broken and cream smells rancid.....</li>
<li> If your looking for an alternative to the really expensive stuff this is it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Rancid cream, jars seal had been broken and cream smells rancid.....&lt;br /&gt;Using it on my feet.... what a waste!!</li>
    <li> (Or so my wife claims.)  We first tired it a a chrismastime booth at a local mall.&lt;br /&gt;We both tried several products and they allseem to work great.  When my wife&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;supply got low, we ordered through Amazon.  Good Product Good Price.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at a mall where I spent the most ridiculous amount of money for it that I am embarassed just thinking about it.  I was elated to find it online at Amazon for an affordable price.  I find the product really, really works and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I don&#x27;t quite understand why the prices for some of the  Premier Dead Sea Products fluctuate all over the place for the same item.  Makes me wonder if they have an expiration date - and some are expired? I need to do more research in that area.&lt;br /&gt;  Secondly, they have quite a wide range of products, with some research behind their ingredients, but the way they market and advertise around the globe makes choosing one confusing.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this one - after pouring over ingredients- and cross-referencing to any published literature on said ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;  This came in a gold box- at a reasonable sale price.&lt;br /&gt;  This cream is very light, only a hint of odor that&#x27;s not unpleasant- goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I have a very slight tingling on the skin when it&#x27;s first applied.&lt;br /&gt;  It has some ingredients that should be helpful for the skin (  vit C, E &amp; A /Urea/ ) and it claims to stimulate the synthesis of collagen &amp; elastin. Wrinkles are going to need that to improve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My skin and wrinkle depth has improved since I&#x27;ve been using it - and I alternate it with a Nivea day cream I use and a Tretinoin night cream - so I can&#x27;t say for sure it&#x27;s soley responsible for the improvements - but it&#x27;s got all the right stuff as far as the published literature indicate that CAN help..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SO Far I really like this &amp; I&#x27;m going to stick with this one a while.. maybe more info later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/20/13:  This one has dropped off my re-purchase list. I still like it, but if you look at some of my other reviews, you&#x27;ll see I have been using quite a few products now for a year to evaluate them &amp; have had to make choices about what to buy again.  CeraVe PM has replaced 2 of my creams (this one, the Nivea day cream.)</li>
    <li> This product made my face break out in a rash.  My daughter also tried it and broke out in a rash.  Please refund my money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!</li>
    <li> i love this cream i have slways had dark circles under the eyes and had to hide it with heavy concealer.  Not any more. after using this cream i can now go without concealer and love how much younger my eyes look.  they are one of my better features and now get compliments again.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THESE PRODUCTS VERY  MUCH AND HAVE CONTINUED TO USE THEM BECAUSE THE TEXTURE FEELS SMOOTH AND VELVETY ON MY FACE-HOWEVER DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES-NO CREAM REMOVES OUR WRINKLES-I ALWAYS THINK-&amp;#34;WHAT IF I DID NOT&lt;br /&gt;USE A GOOD PRODUCT ON MY FACE?&amp;#34;  I WOULD BE IN TROUBLE-SO, I RECOMMEND ALL OF THE DEAD SEA PRODUCTS! JMB</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Premire products are one of the finest around.  I have used many of their products including this one, for well over 3 and a half years now.  My skin is absolutely beautiful.  I Think Amazon should start caring more of their full line of products And I think they should give their customers more vierity of day and evening mostureizing creams and add it to the array of products they have already!  Its just that outstanding.  On  a 1 to 5 star scale I rate it a 10.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Hydrates the skin and makes skin look so much softer and youger looking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The cream is thick and goes directly into the skin making it dewey and soft.  Yes, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I like how nicely this product seems to melt into my skin, and does not leave a heavy or greasy feeling, even after a 12 hour work day. Other products I have used have to be squeezed out of a tube, so I don&#x27;t get my full value.  The wide open jar with the spatula is unique and very handy.  I have use this product for about 3 weeks, and am pleasantly surprised how much I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I can not live with out it. If your looking for an alternative to the really expensive stuff this is it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I love that cream. I am using it for the last 4 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, and just love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I bought this product but it is not working the way it is advised I steel have my wrinkles no changes</li>
    <li> Was kind of disappointed. Had a old smell to the cream. I like all the other products in this line I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great price with Amazon and product is excellent.</li>
    <li> love it!!!  It works!!!  Will order again</li>
    <li> This is very hydrating without being greasy. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but love how my skin feels using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from these people before!  Always ahead of schedule, and I&#x27;m speaking from my own experience! They&#x27;re Great and will continue to use them, the prices are ALWAYS the Right Price and I Thank You for that! Now that I said that please don&#x27;t raise them...lol!  I&#x27;m a Movie Lover and a Beauty lover..lol! I Really Thank y&#x27;all for being ahead of time and Great Service!</li>
    <li> 1/3 of the product was missing, different color and texture than the ones I previously bought...was definitly opened maybe a return. Not happy, no solution offered. Returning is a hassle.</li>
    <li> I dont see any positive effect  for me. I have normal to dry skin. This cream is not for me</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like it It&#x27;s nothing like the cream I previously bought.It&#x27;s like trying to sread wax on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 2 years</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my skin always was good but this makes it fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for  a while now, no complaints and the price is wonderful  Try it and maybe it will work for you</li>
    <li> not as described--came in a green container</li>
    <li> I have been using the wrinkle cream for years, and every once in a while i will see something on tv that claims to do wonders, try it and totally regret it, my husband always asks why change something that works so nicely,  good question, I ve never had any problems with this cream it works beautifully and it doesnt clog your pores like other products I have tried..well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a variety of dead sea products from Amazon after first purchasing some from a mall.  Most recently though, I tried this new product that appears to be a complement to the eye cream.  It comes in the same packaging and I thought it would be similar except to be used over the entire face, not just eyes.  When I opened it there was a foil sealer that I don&#x27;t recall seeing on other Premier Dead Sea products.  The foil wasn&#x27;t thightly sealed so that was strange.  Then the cream was very thick, smells waxy and there was only about half of the container full.  All very suspicious.  I only received it about a week ago so admittedly, I can&#x27;t really say much about the quality of the product, but I really don&#x27;t think it legitimately Premier.  Especially based on a previous review saying it&#x27;s light and relatively odor-free.</li>
