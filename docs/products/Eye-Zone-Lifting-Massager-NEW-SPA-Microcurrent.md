<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think it would be nice if the instructions for using this tool were more explicit.  Trying to find out more information about it I went to the internet  and what I read on the pages I found was rather contradictory in the sense that one of them say  to move it around, like in a circular way, from your upper eyelid bone down to the bottom,  and others say you have to move it upwards for using it on each eyelid, other say that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you go horizontally from left to right or from right to left.  I&#x27;m still using it over my face and yes, it helps, but I think I&#x27;ll stop using it on my eyes, in spite of its name, since at my age, I cannot play with the wrinkles around my eyes if I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking: Oh what the heck, probably won&#x27;t work but let&#x27;s give it a try!, and I was pleasantly surprised that it works and works well! The lotion gave me pimples so instead I used an aloe vera gel and after a week i could see my face looks tighter and healthier! I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice, compact, inexpensive,  painless, and easy to use. Been using it almost everyday am and pm for about one month now but have yet to see the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; effect on the outer corners of my upper eyelids which are a bit droopy. I was also hoping to see a smoothing out on creepiness around the eyes and crow´s feet that are not too deep yet. Can´t really see any difference. I use it about 5 minutes each eye in an outward and up technique starting from the inner bottom corner of my eye up towards my temple. I also do the upper lid according to the simple diagram in the instructions. Was hoping this little gadget would work some and help me postpone any injections or surgery. Guess I´ll keep using it some more and hope for some results. Maybe I´m not doing it right or long enough? Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I get large under skin zits. I works great rub it on the zit where you can feel the zip or electric surge. And in 3 days it was gone. It working for my bags under my eyes slowly. the line above my mouth were i have smoked for years, yea quit 4 years ago, Very glad i purchased it.</li>
    <li> Have had micro current treatments and I can take more current than most.  My comfort level at a spa is medium to high even in sensative areas.  This machine was not powerful enough for me.  I had to return product (with no problems) BUT I am not sorry I tried it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with some reservation since it&#x27;s much less expensive than brand name products.  It works well on me after one week of daily 5-minute use.  There is no instruction but the users can easily find them online from NuFace products.  The current is a bit strong for me for I set it to low.  I am glad that I gave this a try.</li>
    <li> Battery runs down too fast.</li>
    <li> I just received it today, and I am disappointed in the quality of the devise. It&#x27;s small, lightweight and the battery cover is very cheap. I thought it was going to break just trying to put it back on. It comes with 3 sets of directions, not sure which to follow so it would be nice if they set just one set of directions. I went to their website for their FAQs section and it&#x27;s not on their website-guess I should not have been surprised. I know it say Eye Zone, but I wondering if it can be used more places on  the face and body. It doesn&#x27;t say it can&#x27;t be used on other parts, but it doesn&#x27;t say it can be either. If i would have seen this devise in person, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, but since i have it now, i am going to try it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really rate it&#x27;s performance, but you sure can feel the micro-current on this... I like it better than the bigger one I have and like the fact that you can use it around your eyes and mouth... that&#x27;s where I need it!</li>
    <li> who knows…I guess I need to use more.  If I do and it works, I will update.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price. Fast shipment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a strong little product! I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to see results, but I&#x27;m impressed with the design and glad I don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference at all. I also developed vertigo shortly after I started using this. I don&#x27;t know if thats a correlation, but I would not recommend this to anyone. Seems like junk and a waste of time in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t need any lifting but just wants to keep things tight.  If you have hooded lids, you won&#x27;t see much from this product.  I bought a Facemaster and it works much better and can be used all over the face.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but once is all you need every couple of months, this item is sleek and it works really well.</li>
    <li> nice and strong little sucker</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Easy to use and worked wonders on my face. I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and was worried about my dulling complexion and minor wrinkles around eyes and lip areas. After using the micro mini twice, my skin was rejuvenated, wrinkles were less noticeable, skin is incredibly soft and glowing,  This product has won me over and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely manner, easy to use. The verdict is still on wether it works, will see in 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of device in the past, and when mine broke (dropped it a few times), I immediately purchased this one.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this beauty device.  If you use it regularly, you will notice results.  I try to do a &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; at least 2 or 3 times a week and aloe vera gel works just fine.  Its not a surgical &amp;#34;face lift&amp;#34;, but it does help.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product arrived in quality packaging.  Everything I needed was included and product had the pleasant wow factor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this awhile back but wanted to give it some time so I could give it an honest review.  I use it almost everyday and I&#x27;ve seen some very nice changes to my skin. I just turned 58 and I have some wrinkling from age and the fact that I spent way to much time in the sun when I was younger. It amazes me that it gives my eyes such a nice lift. The lift doesn&#x27;t last at all but I knew it wouldn&#x27;t because basically its training my muscles to work again. The area that&#x27;s changed the most of my neck. It is so much smoother now and is really tightening up nicely. As time goes I&#x27;m sure the eye lift will be better and better. For the price I am very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work but I was shocked</li>
    <li> Micro current is for real.  Google it and see.  Many doctors and massage therapists are now using it.  It has been proven to promote healing in muscles and even herniated discs. This mini micro current massager works great.  It not only is working on mine &amp; my wife&#x27;s face, but is great as a muscle relaxer for back muscles, leg muscles, etc.  At this price, every household should own and use one regularly.  My ownly negative comment is it did not come with any kind of manual at all. It should come with a manual containing tips of all its many applications.</li>
    <li> has done nothing for me, been using it since 2012</li>
    <li> Works very well and saw a difference the first time was used. And am very pleased with my purchase. Am an state licensed Esthetician and will recommend this product to all my Esthetician friends.</li>
    <li> Got here fast and this baby WORKS !&lt;br /&gt;Three uses and I see a major difference around eyes and my lip lines from smoking, I am soo thrilled with this little device it packs a punch and does the job fast at a fraction of the price, just don&#x27;t forget to order aqua sonic gel as conductor it&#x27;s cheap and works great....you will not regret this purchase :)</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother with this . Facial exercises better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I should be able to rate how I want with minimum amount of letters</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 40ish african american female noticing signs of aging and fine lines around my eyes.  Love the idea of less invasive anti-aging products.  I&#x27;ve only had the eye zone lifting massager for about a week now and I&#x27;m already starting to see that my fine lines and wrinkles are being reduced.  My skin feel tighter and more supple.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.  Will definitely purchase another one to travel with and keep my first one for at home use.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star cuz it&#x27;s too soon to see any results but THIS SUCKER IS STRONG !!&lt;br /&gt;I actually felt the currents, which made me jump at first.......and had to lower the intensity. And about the intensity control, i could barely see the dial/number, i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s just the one i own or this model was made poorly that way. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but i thought i throw it out there for those who might be curious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty tiny in size, smaller than your Iphone (length)</li>
    <li> For the price this is totally worth it. I have been using this for almost a year and everytime I use it, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m getting a mini face lift. My cheeks look plumper, jawline is more defined and eyes look more awake. I also noticed as I&#x27;ve gotten a little older, my face is a little more unproportioned but this helps to fix that! I take before and after pictures so I know that it&#x27;s not just me. You can really see it.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the results that I am seeing by using the Eye Zone 3-4 times a week in the morning.  I used the setting on 4 due to 5 is to much current.</li>
    <li> I really like using this on my face.  It seems to wake up my skin and tighten it up.  It is easy to use and so small you can carry it around in your purse to use whenever you like.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say about this one.  I dont use it as much as I should, but I dont like the stinging effect of the micro current sometimes it leaves a red dot or two on my skin, luckily it goes away.  It probably helps with stimulating your skin but not crazy about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years and got it as a gift for family members too. It definitely lifts and smoothes the skin and muscle  (try using it on one side of the face to test the difference). If you dial it up high, there is a definite pinch of the current, so I keep it at a 3 setting. Works best with water or hyaluronic acid based serums. It&#x27;s not a miracle but with consistent use the skin and muscle tone is definitely improved and I can tell when I start slacking off. The instructions were none existent but I use it in combination with Eva Fraser facial exercises instruction book to isolate muscles. I don&#x27;t use it on neck or on upper eyelids, I don&#x27;t think one is supposed to. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this device. If I were more consistent I think the results would be even better. Definately worth the money!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have RF Dot Matrix and loved it. I read from some other reviewer about combining these two devices so that we could also work on smaller and delicate eye area. I only use once. I hope to continue and see what happens. I was not using high settings but it seemed to deliver enough current with mid to mid high with any problems.</li>
    <li> Eye zone has not worked for me at all. I also find it painful depending on the level chosen. If I put it on level 3 I feel nothing and it is painful on 4. I see no difference after a month. Plus once it burnt under my eye. Use with great caution. You must use a cream or gel to help it glide along your skin.</li>
    <li> This little device does work; it&#x27;s the effect that I did not like.  I experienced the unsatisfactory result after two days of use. I wondered what was going on and then it dawned on me. Here&#x27;s  the why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The device stimulates and exercises the facial muscles. As a consequence, the muscle fibers shorten and tighten. Unfortunately, the skin has lost its elasticity and can&#x27;t spring back as the muscles become firmer; hence, the skin drapes, wrinkles or creases appear more prominent.(Yikes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, this device can be used on other parts of the skin besides the eye and eyebrow areas. The mico current is strong enough to cause the muscles surrounding the mouth to twitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accompanying literature states that consistent use of the device will stimulate collagen production. This may or may not be true but one thing I know is that an increase in muscle tone takes place faster than collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If anyone disagrees with these premises, consider why botox injections work so well. The toxin paralyzes the muscles  allowing the skin to relax and the wrinkles disappear. Consider what pastic surgeons do when giving women facelifts; they cut and pull back the skin to tighten it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I should have known better....but it was an interesting science experiment, nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the device. (FYI: It comes nicely packaged with the aloe gel dispenser,batteries, and an instruction pamphlet)</li>
    <li> It works for sure. Very strong currents when On high, lower current for the more sensitive areas I can definitely tell it&#x27;s Working I have seen small improvement that I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days Will update later</li>
    <li> I have incorporate this into my beauty routine and what a wonderful addition.  It may be small but you can feel the power of this on the high speeds.  I use this over my entire face, neck and chin and like my results.  I will say thou when doing your eye area a lower level is more comfortable. I use it 3 times a week for 10min with 56,000 iu of vitamin E oil which allows it to slide across your skin smoothly and that has been working out well for me. You can use any facial serum you want but I prefer the vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this item works or not because it stopped working after only two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The green light went on, but it just didn&#x27;t work. I tried changing the batteries, but nothing.&lt;br /&gt;When it did work, I could feel the twinges on my face indicating that it was doing&lt;br /&gt;SOMETHING. I should have returned it, but I was in the middle of a divorce and, frankly,&lt;br /&gt;I had bigger problems. However, I hate that I paid for this and, by the time I got around&lt;br /&gt;to returning it, it was too late. Amazon states that it is past the return period. So, I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t recommend it. I followed all instructions. I did not drop or abuse the item in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I just think it is poorly made and not worth buying.</li>
    <li> I am combining this and micro-needling and I am seeing amazing results. I am 50 yrs old and only in the course of this past year I have noticed a change in my skin due to oncoming menopause. My smile (joker) lines and jowls were starting to make their debut as well as the crepe paper texture on my neck. Honestly, I am literally watching this disappear.  I am convinced that these two products are turning back the hands of time and give them the highest of approval. I have been treating myself for aprox 3 months now and just in the last few weeks I have had numerous comments from casual and close acquaintances re: my appearance and all favorable. Although they cannot quit put their finger on what is different (anywhere from did I change my hair to have I lost weight) I know it&#x27;s the results of using this product. I normally do not leave reviews especially lengthy ones but feel compelled to share this with my sisters/brothers out there.  Too good to keep a secret.</li>
    <li> After using this device for one month on my eyelids, forehead and cheeks I am seeing nice results. My skin feels firmer, I have less lid drooping and brighter looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;At first I broke out in some acne and noticed some tension headaches, but it&#x27;s gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;At this price I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Results may differ depending on your specific needs, but I say try it, STICK WITH IT, and see for yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a good synopsis of microcurrent technology.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bio-therapeutic.in/micro-current-technology.php</li>
    <li> it is good tool for fest results,  but not for everyone. A lot of women with health issues can not use it.</li>
    <li> This just might be working ...So I am reserving  a real opinion at this time .. but have  better  results with regular use ... need to pay attention to voltage..</li>
    <li> I have had this product for almost a year. Used it religously for 6 months and then cut back some. I do not see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times, could feel a little current, but one of the nodes fell off within two weeks.  I put it up in my bathroom and forgot about it, so I don&#x27;t know how the company would be on returns, missed my window, but would not rebuy.</li>
    <li> In one month, the &amp;#34;turkey wattle&amp;#34; hanging underneath my chin was 75% gone! Easy to use, but buy extra gel. The one that comes with it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Great little machine for the cost. If you use this product you will get results. I have actually seen my eyes lift and the skin around my eyes appears firmer and more supply. I use vitamin E oil in conjunction with the  gel provided with the product. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and highly recommend it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says Easy to use. Like it.  Is Battery Operated for use in the Eye Zone !</li>
    <li> I LOVE this and it WORKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a NuFace Trinity, which is also an excellent product, but you cannot use it around the eyes or mouth. I kept having to pull out my FaceMaster to do the eyes and mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gadget completes the effect because it is designed for the eyes - and I have also used on on the whole face, with good results. Being smaller it gets in to small spots better and is great if you are going away for a few days and do not want to lug along a larger device&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be fooled - this baby has power. Do not underestimate it, especially around the eyes. Start low and increase over time. Otherwise you can just exhaust your muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like ANY microcurrent device, you need to use it regularly over time to get the best results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have already gotten results from microcurrent I can say with confidence that the New Spa Eye Zone worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the affordable price, I even bought a second one so I can do both sides at once.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, half doubting its capabilities.  But guess what!  It actually works, and works well at that.  These persistent lines around the eyes actually slowly disappear.  You have to be faithful and keep using the device daily without fail if you want good results.  If you do that, you will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;I hightly recommend this device.  Let&#x27;s face it.  No cream will ever make lines go away.  Only exercise or micro chocks to the nerves can do that.</li>
    <li> I found this to be fairly easy to use. The cleaning instructions left alota of questions. What do you clean the massager with?  Mine got nasty after the first use, all the shiney coating came off.  Cleaned mine with alcohol since there were no instructions. Someone suggested using alovera gel which I will purchase.  Your face must be kept hydrated for better performance.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made, product had loose part in it...could hear it rattling around. Never could get it to turn on to try it</li>
    <li> As noted by a few other reviews, this item does not work, Cannot feel any current and no results of any kind from using it. Very very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the eye zone and it does it&#x27;s job, just buy it, women need this, it&#x27;s not about price or brand it&#x27;s about needing the tool made for that zone,.I&#x27;ve had plenty of massage therapists and creams and whatsoever, got this and all of that is gone, i just stay at home and do this for myself with soft music and aroma&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Setting only goes up to a 5 intensity but that is good enough for at home touch ups especially around the eye areas.</li>
    <li> So dissapointed!!! I felt completely no electric current on just my 3rd times using it, even I pushed it up to the highest electric current level. Now I realize that I have wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago and I have been using it 3 times a week I haven&#x27;t noticed any noticable changes yet. But Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to tell you if it works because I dropped it on accident and it broke in two and knocked the wires lose which won&#x27;t go back together. This product was dropped once and it&#x27;s done.  :(</li>
    <li> I do use this product, but not sure that it is of any help.  When compared to an ultrasound facial, the ultrasound facial gives me immediate results.  Frankly, I prefer using my home ultrasound unit on my face, and would be okay with never using the Eye Zone product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am able to return it for a full refund....Hopefully other people have better success with it then I did.....</li>
    <li> I have being using it for almost four months at least five times a week. Results are great. Nothing works equally good for everyone but if most of the people find it helpful then it always worth to try. This device works on muscles and we all know that you can have your workout partner in the gym doing the same exact strength exercises but results would be totally different. The same applies here. Micro current works on muscles not skin. That is why there is hard to achieve god results on under eye area. I didn&#x27;t see big improvement there BUT! I started using it on my forehead and eyebrows and have fantastic results. Before my upper lid was kind of droopy, the fold touching the eyelash line. Now there is a quarter of an inch distance! And skin on my forehead is very tight, I need to do very drastic surprised expression to get any wrinkling. And now comes the down side, yesterday I noticed that the coating on the tips of prongs is almost gone. I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t use provided gel as my skin refused it and used something else instead. That might contributed to the problem. Never less I love this device and going to order another one, just will try something different next time for gel. But even it keeps going bad I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I cant tell if this works or not because I put it in a drawer and forget to use it!</li>
    <li> I am only 32, so my skin still looks pretty youthful. My goal is to keep it that way. This thing stimulates my face in a way I can feel. Using it under my eyes has helped diminish the fine lines that have started forming. If I use it, I see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside with this product is the time it takes to use it. I would do it every day if I could, but I don&#x27;t have the time. Once per week for 15 minutes is what I can do. Even that much makes a difference. I wish there was an eye cream that could give me this result, but if there is, I haven&#x27;t found it. This works for me when I use it. Recommended to those with time, patience and a bit of a tolerance level for discomfort.</li>
    <li> Some times the massager doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything and then I raise the level of microcurrent and then I breakout in bumps on my face.  I don&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
    <li> I can see the results on my neck. My friend has a nuface and I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as that brand, but for 1/10 the price I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see or feel anything...it didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m not sure about the effectiveness so its going back!</li>
    <li> the little gadget is small but packs a punch. I would recommend it for 38 bucks can&#x27;t beat it. I like it</li>
    <li> It does pack a punch for a small massager.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month.  I don&#x27;t see any difference at all, but I think it takes a long time to actually see any difference.</li>
    <li> eh...didn&#x27;t do much.  it&#x27;s now in the back of the closet collecting dust.</li>
    <li> If I were to use this regulary it might even work better. So far my use of it has been sporadic but it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and my face is in decent shape.  I eat well, exercise, and use high quality face products (all Perricone and Bobbi Brown) and regularly get facials, peels, etc.  I bought this because I am interested in buying a larger microcurrent device (Perricone raves about them in &#x27;Forever Young&#x27;) and I wanted to first experiment with a less expensive option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for 15 minutes at a time.  I use unscented aloe vera gel as the conductivity cream and typically have to reapply it about 4 times per session.  The little monster is STRONG.  It has 5 levels, and at level 4 I get muscle twinges and at 5 I experience large contractions and burning so I don&#x27;t go up that high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply approximately 5 strokes below the eye in an outward motion, then above the eye, then switch sides, then repeat several times.  I mix it up with some strokes above and outside my mouth to give my eyes a break, but that area doesn&#x27;t seem very responsive, I think because the tissue is thicker and it requires a stronger microcurrent machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite soon after using it, I noticed the skin around my eyes and nose thickening a bit - in a good way - and my capillaries became less visible.  HOWEVER, and HERE&#x27;s MY MAIN TIP: I didn&#x27;t notice extreme eye lift benefits until I began positioning the device at the INSIDE CORNERS OF THE EYE, RESTING AGAINST THE NOSE.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but when I extended my strokes a bit, beginning at the very inside corners, with one metal probe just above the corner of my eye and the other one below - and then proceeded with the same strokes (inside corner, glide down 1 inch, glide outwards three inches)  - the results were remarkable!  It is as though the puffiness and darkness have been \\&quot;pushed\\&quot; out.  No eye cream has had this effect.  I still wake up with under-eye circles (seems like I developed there around age 31 or so; I&#x27;m hoping this will lessen as I continue using the massager), but by mid-day, once my fluids have circulated, the entire area by my eyes is smooth and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really optimistic about this product, since I&#x27;ve already seen great benefits and the results are cumulative.  My eye area hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 5 years, literally (I went back and looked at photos).  Yay!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINITELY buy the larger version.  I&#x27;m a little bit concerned that the lifting effect of the standard microcurrent will make my face look round, due to pushing up the skin.  The one thing I LIKE about aging is the newly discovered contour and shading around my cheekbones.  We&#x27;ll see.  I will certainly write another review once I&#x27;ve been using it a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing:  There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to sit there twice a day for 15 minutes without another activity going on.  I choose to listen to hypnosis and/or affirmations with headphones.  I&#x27;d imagine other people could listen to the daily news or meditate, or whatever else you&#x27;d like to incorporate into your daily &#x27;wellness&#x27; routine.  I&#x27;m single without kids, so it&#x27;s easy for me to make the extra time.  I have 2 sisters with kids and it&#x27;s a bit hard for me to imagine them finding time to incorporate this habit, but who knows?  I certainly hope it will be part of my routine for years to come!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought or used this type of product.  It was shipped within 4 days of when I ordered it... Great!  And was nicely packaged.  I have only used it twice on level 2.  I have used it with the conductive cream that I purchased at the same time.  I have a question, if anyone can help...  Both times I&#x27;ve used it, I have felt all the nerves in my forehead and around my eyes being shocked and twitching.  Is this normal?  The product states that you wouldn&#x27;t feel anything.  I&#x27;m curious as to if I am using the product correctly.  Too much lotion?  Too little?  Sensitive skin?  Just worried that I am doing something wrong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002U774PK Eye Zone Lifting Massager. Micro-mini Current. Battery Operated.]]</li>
    <li> This little gadget delivers big.  Face  feels lifted after daily use.  Cheeks are lifted again and jowls have vanished after continuous use.  Will continue to use this product faithfully.</li>
    <li> Small and compact to handle.  Wish I had purchased the larger unit, but it does work.. The directions are ok and it helps to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how strong this is.....and I am amazed how my firmer my face looks. I find myself staring at my own skin in amazement. I use it all over my face on a setting of 4 and on my neck I use it on a setting of 5.  My sister, who is 10 months younger than me has already offered me $50.00 to buy it from me. LOL. I told her NO. She can buy her own from here. &#x3D;) I really love this. I will recommend this to all my friends and family who are looking for firmer skin.</li>
    <li> Though skeptical at first, I am pretty impressed with this product and think that for the price, it is a great deal. I tend to retain a lot of water in my face, especially the eye area, and being a medical student, I get almost no sleep and have pretty constant bags under/around my eyes. This helps quite a bit if I use it in the morning, by midday the fluid in my face has really recirculated away from my eyes which is great! It is not a miracle cure, but definitely helps... I try to use it every day, I have noticed that if I forget for a day my eyes are extra puffy the next day which I take to mean that its working! I also have used this on my temples when I have a migraine, it really helps me, as well as my neck/lymph node area if i have swollen or painful lymph nodes due to a cold, sinus infection, etc. Also, if I have one of those fun under-the-skin pimples, I zap it with this a few times a day and it helps improve the time it takes to go away by a ton!  The only cautionary advice I would give is to make sure you wipe off and dry the probes after every use, or it will begin to rust. I forgot a few times, and mine is starting to wear, but I will probably buy another one since I use it so much.</li>
    <li> I was ready to return this product until I FINALLY FIGURED OUT THE SETTINGS! I have a Nuface and also a Nuface Trinity.  I bought this tool because the size was perfect for around the eyes. The product information included valuable information that my $500.00 Nuface didn&#x27;t include. (To restore the muscle tissue the best amperage is 20-40uA (the lowest), to stimulate the circulation and lymphatic drainage - 100-300uA (middle). For micro-iontophoresis (the infusion of serums) use highest settings.)  FYI:The New Spa website also has additional instructions.  The tool comes with excellent how to use information in a pamphlet inside the box. I tried using this two times.  Both times it scared me because it was way too strong. I couldn&#x27;t tell the HIGH setting from the LOW setting and I only wanted to use the low setting. On the front of the devise in the little window there are numbers for the settings.  YOU CANNOT SEE THE NUMBERS UNLESS YOU HOLD THE TOOL AT A CERTAIN ANGLE!!!!!  Both times that I tried using the tool I was using it at the highest setting which you would think stroll down for low, up for high which is the opposite. If you hold the tool at a angle the numbered settings are EASY to see! The gel that came with the devise is more like a cream which is excellent so hope the cream can be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> I am giving this massager more time as, having used Micro-current before, it do work, but it takes a while.  I think for such an inexpensive item for the eye area, it is worth spending more time before making a final judgment.</li>
    <li> I used the aloe vera gel as another customer suggested. I also looked up the YouTube videos on how to use micro-current facelift systems and this was pretty helpful. I was also very surprised on how quickly you see results. I am in the 50+ crowd and was not using it as long as the videos suggested but I did see lifting in my eye area and mouth area. I don&#x27;t have alot of saggy, so this is more proactive treatments. There is no pain involved but if you have it up too high, you will definitely feel the current and metallic taste in your mouth eventhough the device is not near your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have since changed my beauty routine to twice a day as recommended in the YouTube videos but I had already experienced positive results using it a few time a week. This is a bargain compared to going to a salon and paying high dollar.</li>
    <li> I purchased this device based upon all the positive reviews.  I so wanted it to work, but the current is really strong and practically burned my skin.  I own and have used microcurrent devices before and never had this experience.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one because of the size and wanted something for my eyes.  Maybe mine is defective but there is no way this can be used under the eye and anywhere else on the skin.  This is a very dangerous device.  Luckily my reflexes were quick enough that I removed it instantly.  I know what facial microcurrent is suppose to feel like...and this ain&#x27;t it.  I rated it a 1 because I didn&#x27;t have a zero option.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a little over a month ago in the hopes to help with bags and swelling around the eyes and have used it faithfully every day.  I spend a lot of money on products that never work so i wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  Although i am not seeing any difference in lifting nor a huge reduction (although there is a slight difference) of the bags, i have seen a signifant reduction in the swelling from day one. Not sure what my eye swelling was due too, but was so bad most days you could not only notice it but they felt swollen to me, it was pretty bad. I also tend to get an occasional deep pimple, and with this tool they are gone within a couple days.. for these two things alone it well worth the 38 dollars for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say right before writing this I read a most recent review where she stated that you have to use the lowest setting for muscle toning..  I use around 3.5 to 4 for around the eyes so maybe there is still some hope with the bags if i go lower!  This little baby packs a punch, on 5 your whole face will twitch and will shock you pretty good.  Its super easy to use and i find it actually relaxing.  I have not used the lotion that comes with it, i prefer the aloe vera gel so can&#x27;t comment on how well that works.  After a couple weeks i&#x27;ll update this review after using it on the lower setting for the toning.</li>
    <li> Too small for me to notice any differnce.  This would take hours each day and I&#x27;m simply not that enthused.</li>
    <li> This item shipped super fast.  I am a first time user of any product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I just finished using my eye zone lifting device.  I used it only on the right side of my face (because to me it looks like it&#x27;s the side that needs more work)so that I could compare sides later.&lt;br /&gt;The right side of my face is a little red at the moment and it feels slightly tingly but not in a bad way or painful way.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel by gently touching my right side, that it is a lot smoother than my left side and it definately is much tigher than my left eye area too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this a couple of times each day for the next 4 weeks. I keep a pretty good beauty routine which I rarely stray from unless I am sick and can&#x27;t get out of bed.  So, I will incorparate this into my routine, morning and night and await to see results.  I will then report back after at least one month of treatment 2x&#x27;s a day and let others know of my results using this device.&lt;br /&gt;I am 44 years old, fair skinned.&lt;br /&gt;PS. Don&#x27;t let the small size fool you, this has power.  I put it on a 3.5 and it zapped my eye good!  Didn&#x27;t really hurt but it was enough to let you know it was there.  I used it on a 2 around my eyes and slightly higher around eyebrow and forehead area, and also my nose and upper cheek area with an outward sweep to my outter cheeck and temple line.  I also pulled up a diagram on the facial muscles to see a more accurate structure of our facial muscles to really get an idea of which way our muscles extend.  I think that helps when you are trying to relax your facial muscles and keep the pattern consistance to how your muscles really are underneath your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish me luck in my new venture and ladies/gentlemen, I will let you know in a month or so how it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I just received this. I put the batteries in and then turned it on to use it. Followed all instruction and watched a video. No electrical feeling at all even on the highest setting, so I don&#x27;t think the machine works at all. I&#x27;m sending it back. I even used better brand batteries, and  no feeling at all. The good reviews must be bogus.</li>
    <li> i recommend it. good quality. good price.</li>
    <li> I did not like this @ all. Maybe user error? But I think it actually made the skin around my eyes look bad after using instead of possibly improved. Like it woreout the skin and the gel dried out the surface</li>
    <li> This machine it works,  if you can handle higher level (5) then i think it will work better.  It&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> excellent product!  I use it daily and can tell an improvement in my skin tone and texture.  I will continue to use for optimum results!</li>
    <li> I originally I wanted just one.  Somehow 2 got charged and paid for.  Then was glad I got 2 because I travel a lot so Decided to use one in my travel kit.  Once I went to use it, nIt did not work at all</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it looked safe and I read all the reviews from other people. I started using it a few days later and I feel happy with it. I has a little bite every once and a while and it seem to open my eyes a little. Will let you know better later on. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Envio a tiempo, el articulo en buen estado y de optima calidad. Lo estoy probando, apenas llevo usandolo pocos dias</li>
    <li> I think this is a fair price. It helps most with skin at first but lift has happened over time. Will continue to use and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Came on time, I have to get use to this little machine, when I first tired it, I got a shock, but I guess it will be ok down the line.</li>
    <li> It takes a few trys to get used to working this - instructions could be better - but after figuring out how to read the settings and finding a couple of videos on youtube, this is wonderful. I can definitely see a difference after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS MICROCURRENT DEVICE AROUND JUNE 2012, AND WHEN I USE IT EVERY NIGHT, I IMMEDIATELY NOTICE MY SKIN MORE TIGHT, THE AREA AROUND MY EYES LIKE MORE RESTED AND IRONED LOL, ALSO I USE IT ON MY NECK AND I NOTICE AN IMMEDIATE LIFT AND TIGHTENING AROUND THAT AREA. I USE IT WITH HYALURONIC ACID AND I ALWAYS CLEAN IT AFTER I USE IT. ALWAYS MAKE SURE U DON&#x27;T USE A STRONGER SETTINGS, IF YOU FEEL THE MUSCLE MOVING U ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING MORE WRINKLES ON YOUR FACE. AND DON&#x27;T USE IF YOU JUST HAD BOTOX BECAUSE THE EFFECT WON&#x27;T LAST.</li>
    <li> my eye area is a lot  firmer and the small lines are diminishing.</li>
    <li> I would not waste your money on this item.  I have received 2 of these and both quit working after a couple of months.  I do feel that it did do some improvement in toning my skin.  I do feel the idea is a good one but the quality of the item is bad.</li>
    <li> temp fix but stimulating.</li>
    <li> Reason for 2 stats is that I Just received product. I&#x27;m happy with the fact it&#x27;s easy to use. If doesn&#x27;t burn or zap my face like other products I have used in past. Too soon to post results. I&#x27;ll up date acts later time</li>
    <li> Just got this device, and tried it out.  So far, it feels close to microcurrent treatments I have had in the past.  I used aloe vera gel, and had to reapply a few times.  The directions are ok, if they were better, I would give it 5 stars.  I know this device is smaller than NuFace, although with NuFace, you may not use it in the eye area.  I thought it was because of the circular muscles around the eye need a different type of microcurrent machine with separate probes.  I didn&#x27;t feel any tightness in my eye area, but definitely felt it in my brow and cheek area.  If anyone knows about the circular muscle issue, I&#x27;d love to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day.  I tried a few different creams, but always go back to to aloe vera gel, as it conducts the current the best.  I keep it at 2 as anything higher is too strong for me.  I also use the NuFace pattern for the face, and it definitely works with this device.  And my eye area feels much tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of allergies, so my face can get puffy.  A few of my friends have been asking if I lost weight because my neck and face is firmer, and my eyes are much less puffy.  Truly a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is thw brand we used in school and I loved it so much I ordered my own. Its so easy to transport and easy to hold. No complaints will definitely reckons :)</li>
    <li> Just got it and used it once and Seriously huge difference . My husband even saw a improvement . I am 33 and I have under eye bags . They flattened in one use !!! Cant wait to use it consistently and see my results ! Will post an update .</li>
    <li> This item has not done anything for me. I have not seen any changes to my skin or appearance at all.</li>
    <li> I found that aloe gel works great and is good for the skin. Portable! I take this one with me on travel. I love it!</li>
    <li> After using the product 3 times, I found that my sweat had a strong metallic smell.  Weird, I know.  So I stopped using it and over time that faded away.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! The seller is great and the product is awesome!! People at work who don&#x27;t even notice when I dye my hair told me that my eyes look &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; lol. That&#x27;s how I know it is working! I feel more confident knowing that I don&#x27;t look as tired.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a taser to shock the lowly peasants, a regular taser looks too conspicuous so this was perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty powerful little device....I also use it on my frown lines, and it has really helped there.&lt;br /&gt;Still working on under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 4 times and I see a huge difference. Iam 50 yrs old and noticed the jowels starting and the lines by my mouth starting to droop down, Under eye area was starting to wrinkle as well. So I bought the neck slimmer here on amazon and have been using that for 3 weeks prior to using this. (neck slimmer 200 flexs per night regular way and 100 flexes with open mouth). My neck is getting better but jowels were still there.Heres what works for me.Theres a pattern to the pulses. It will pulse for 5 times slow followed by 5 faster pulses twice. I will start below my eyes first and keep the setting on 4. I look in the mirror to see what muscles are being worked. I dont sweep this across my face...instead I place prongs on area wait for the beeping pulse patterns to finish 5 times on each placement. I probably do 4 areas as Iam going across face . I then go back and do it same place for 4 sessions of pattern per placement of prongs. I continue working on face this way and wow what a difference! It takes me about 2 hrs per session and my face is totally worked out. Yeah, I know who has a few hrs but I find the time. My jowels are almost completly gone. Eyes look excellent and mouth lines diminishing. I am so happy I bought this. Look in the mirror while doing this and you can see what muscles are working. This little guy really works!!!</li>
    <li> I finally got up the nerve to use this. I could see improvement the next day. I do suggest that one set the level at the lowest one can feel.  The higher level was uncomfortable.  Now I use it at bare minimum with success.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use this product. I can not say for sure if it will work or not.  I had to return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> i bought this cause its small for travel. works aaround the eye area like Suzanne somers facemaster. exercises the muscles. has differen settings hi to low . and use water and like ultrasonic gel... on high you can feel it really good. use low to start at first.. it works pretty well and glad I bought it.  good for antiaging!  haven&#x27;t use it for that long. but it seems to work the eye area as well as facemaster. and feels good on the face. instructions enclosed . this unit is better for travel since it is more compact.. may buy another for an extra one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for less than a week, and I can see noticible changes.  I use it on my husband, he loves the benefits of this little machine.  Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> If I were able to give NO STARS I would have!!!!  and if I could have returned this product I WOULD HAVE!!!  unfortunately, I made the mistake of missing the print were it states no refunds or exchanges on this item!  SUCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is non-efficient in every way, shape or form. How can a company market such a waste of prodcut and sell it to the public with the claim/s that it does this and that and will give you amazing results.....Sure learned my lesson!  from now on if any product/item I buy does not permit us(the consumers) to return or exchange I&#x27;M NOT BUYING IT!</li>
    <li> Paid a lot for treatments that I wish now I had that cash. It was a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy and I can sit in bed and watch tv and make my face look better.&lt;br /&gt;Need to do it now.&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
    <li> This was a great product with firming when it worked. I had to return mine since the little metal part became loose.</li>
    <li> I actually bought it for my husband to use and it has helped with the problems as mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I can really tell when he slacks off using it too it&#x27;s so noticeable the changes it makes in the appearance of his eyes.</li>
    <li> I waited to give this review to see if there were any differences in my face after usage, and there was. This thing gives off a powerful current which you can really feel, so be careful to keep on low if you do not like noticeable twitches. On the result end. It works, I don&#x27;t know about long term yet, but I am using it mainly around the mouth parenthesis that you may begin to see around fifty years of age, I found a marked difference and the lines plumped and filled out, however this seems to be a short term effect, so I&#x27;m guessing for long term you may have to keep at it. But wonderful for those special occasions when you need that youthful appearance when you show up. I&#x27;m am going to step up my regimen to see if I can get long term results, but so far I am satisfied with this purchase and I feel it can only enhance my efforts, if you&#x27;re not looking for a miracle and only help, I recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work! But I noticed after 3 uses that my skins started to develop red spots. First I thought it was acne but then I noticed they appeared exactly where I had applied the micro-current system. I am going to return it as it is just making me look worse than before!</li>
    <li> It really was not what I expected, not good quality and I probably would not recommend this item for professions</li>
    <li> I have been using for over a month,per the instructions in the leaflet enclosed, with no visible change other than to my wallet. I will give it another month to see if there is any  improvement given more time-that is why the 2 star rating. I will update in a month if it shows improvement in that time.</li>
    <li> it irritated my face somehow with like an itchy, stingy, pulse, i dint like it so i returned it and decided to for a photo facial instead.</li>
    <li> Okay folks.. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one but when I read the reviews..and the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous...So I ordered it.  I&#x27;ve already figured out a great trick for treatment with it.  I tried the lotion included in the kit..kinda slimy...  I tried aquaphor...too thick...  i tried a personal lubrican jelly...too messy and became sticky...(don&#x27;t laugh)...  the best thing I tried...ZERO MESS....  are you ready????  a wet wash cloth ...  wring it out to keep it from dripping everywhere.... but keep it &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; wet...  wipe it on the area to be treated and touch - touch - touch - touch...  wipe the next area and repeat....  my skin feels wonderful...has a tingly pink glow...but I&#x27;m not gonna O.D. on it....  I don&#x27;t expect overnight miracles...(it&#x27;s not plastic surgery)...  at setting 5 - it packs a punch.  found 3-4 good for the majority of the face... used a 2 around the eyes as the skin is more sensitive there.  I could visibly see muscles moving that otherwise would just be dormant (or sagging)..they don&#x27;t make barbells for your face (unfortunately)...I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars today because it&#x27;s just been one treatment...we&#x27;ll see in a week or two if I raise it to 4 stars...</li>
    <li> I have both Derma Wand and Face Master, which are good products; however, this small machine accomplishes more in less time, and results are quick.  Hardest area is skin over the eyes, in the crease, where hatching begins.  That tightened the skin, and certainly reduced the &amp;#34;hatching&amp;#34; appearance or &amp;#34;tick tack lines&amp;#34;.  Forehead seems lifted. Use it on frown lines. Lines don&#x27;t disappear entirely or at all, of course, but if used, even for short periods, improvement will result. Easy to bring along and use during idle moments.  Wiould like to see more powerful or other micr&#x3D;mini current products from this company.</li>
    <li> I currently own a Nuface device and have been very pleased with the results; however, it is too bulky to use in the eye area.  I bought this device hoping it would help tighten things up under my eyes but I have yet to notice any difference. I will keep using it in conjunction with my Nuface, for now, but will re-evaluate after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i think i would have liked this, but unfortunately, it disappeared in the house fire</li>
    <li> Have had this spa treatment several times over the last 10 years.  Works well for me and have noticed eye improvement over my first month of using this product.  Aloe vera gel works great as a conductor. I am 65 yrs. old but am usually tagged in my 50&#x27;s.  So happy to find this product.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  I know it&#x27;s for the eye zone but I am using it on my face too, and I notice a difference!</li>
    <li> I havent really noticed any changes after 4 weeks of using it. I should have bought something else. I am sure the cream is good for my face.</li>
    <li> This little device is resculpting my face. My face is lifting, and my mouth parenthesis are disappearing. I was sceptic after using the face master which destroyed my face. The key is to use the device at the lowest setting. If you use micro current above 500au it will diminish collagen. My results are slow, but well worth it. The price is amazing for the results. I was contemplating plastic surgery. No more. I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother since she wanted it, despite the bad reviews. Today when I asked her how she likes it she said she didn&#x27;t. She&#x27;s been using it 3 times a week and said that it hurts and hasn&#x27;t seen results. She was using it for bags under her eyes and decided surgery is the best option.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, it function very good.</li>
    <li> This device is pretty much what I expected for the price and the fact that it runs on small batteries. It is pretty powerful on 5 (top setting), but the other settings are mild. I can hardly feel 1 or 2. Nothing is a miracle cure.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT THINK THE PRODUCT CAN DO WHAT THEY CLAIM /I SHOLD HAVE MY HEAD EXAM BEFORE I ORDER IT /BUT HEY SOME YOU LOOSE /HOPEFULLY IT WIL BE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE</li>
    <li> seems like it&#x27;s helping some</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift, but kept it for myself.  It is a smaller version of NuForm and can be used following the NuForm instructions for the rest  of the face.  I have not used it regularly, so I have not seen the full benefits, although you can definitely feel it working. Cons: The dial is hard to see and adjust for the amount of power you are applying - and make sure you stay away from under the eye socket, as you will see a bright flash (meaning you have hit the optic nerve).  This product requires regular use to see results, but you can definitely see the results after a few uses. I will continue to use it, particularly on jowls and along the cheekbone area to promote collagen production and definition in the cheekbone.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin but I don&#x27;t use it regularly. I do feel the electrodes working under my skin. Worth a try. Good price. Don&#x27;t expect drastic results.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I did not see any real discernible results after four weeks of use.</li>
    <li> But this massager didnt change anything on my face ( area around the eyes) and im using it for about 3 weeks, 15 min. every day. Lifting? what lifting? Nada</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and thought I made a good decision.  Based on the reviews I have to guess the quality of the product is very inconsistent.  I put it on the lowest setting and it zapped the heck out of me.</li>
    <li> It really works i noticed fine lines deminishing  after about three treatments and it also is helping my dark circles under my eyes</li>
    <li> I have had this device for 3 months and wanted to wait a few months before reviewing it. After reading some poor reviews today, I wanted to weigh in on actually how to use the device to get great results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, if you research Microcurrent Facial therapy, you will see that oil and Microcurrent dont mix - so using oil-based creams or Aquaphor will prevent conductivity. Use the gel that it comes with, a water-based serum or just a lot of water on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the NuFace diagrams for contouring - always lifting the device in an upwards motion, never down. Using the previous reviewed top of placing the nodes close to the inside of the orbital bone (close to your nose - but never on your eyeball - place on the bone) and sweeping the device in an upwards motion to your temple will sculpt the eye/brow area beautifully. The smaller size of this device really lets you get into the eye area, the NuFace device does not. Holding it in place for 5 seconds over an area you really want to lift, to train those muscles, is also helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of using this device over the past 3 months have been truly amazing - lifted jowels, high cheekbones and a tighter, smoother skin appearance. The skin around my eyes is tight and lifted as well. The benefits of using it 3/4 times a week have been decreased pore size and fresh, wide-awake look that is naturally...me! Not a frozen version that looks unnatural. I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have been asked \\&quot;What are you doing to your face\\&quot; lately by close friends and family! The stimulation of collagen and muscles that were slack have now lifted my face and have changed the surface of my face and neck dramatically. This is something that I will use forever to fight gravity and keep the collagen renewal process going - it is a wonderful, natural complement to any skincare regimen....from the inside out.</li>
    <li> I love this item! It works great! It has 5 settings. The last setting is the strongest. You will feel some electrical current throughout your face when using #5 setting. I use it over my entire face, not just for the eye area. I can feel a difference in the muscles in my face. They feel tightened and toned. Im glad I purchased this item. Some reviewers have said that it works as well as treatments at spas. Im really addicted to the results! If you are sensitive, you may want to use the lower settings. You can use gels or water to conduct the current effectively. Really a great price for such an exceptional antiagaing device. Fast shipping and comes in a nice box with instructions.....</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would help the tighten up the under eye bags and dark circles. Not only did it not help, it caused my eyes to swell up and the next morning the dark circles were so bad it looked like some one had punched me.  I tried using on other areas such as the jaw line and brow area and all it did was irritate the my skin and left terrible red burn marks that lasted for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a good product to help with puffy eyes and sagging skin look for a jade facial roller.  It&#x27;s more effective, costs less and doesn&#x27;t require batteries.  This wasn&#x27;t even worth trying return.  This went straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> This machine really works! I have been using this little machine since April and can&#x27;t believe how much time it has erased from my face. Deeper lines have softened, and more shallow lines have completely gone away. This is a tiny machine, but that&#x27;s meaningless....it&#x27;s the power of the pulse that matters. It CAN feel like a pinch (a small shock) if you skimp on the gel or have the electrodes incorrectly placed on the skin. That isn&#x27;t the machine&#x27;s fault. It works just fine, and it&#x27;s small size is perfect for travel. Give yourself at least a couple of weeks to see a difference if you have more mature skin. Patience really is the key! It will work even faster if you&#x27;re doing peels, are using retin-a, or use strivectin. All will help the collagen/elastin tissue build up &amp; fill in better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-14-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using this device for a little over 3 yr and it&#x27;s still going strong. I do take good care of it and make sure I don&#x27;t drop it. I use the Nuface on the rest of my face and this little bugger on my eyes.I have deep set \\&quot;hooded eyes\\&quot; that tend to ptosis (droopiness). My poor dad&#x27;s eyelids actually impaired his vision they were so bad....so it&#x27;s hereditary. This machine has done a spectacular job of lifting those droopy lids. It looks as if I had eye surgery. My lids definitely look different from how they were (Renee Zellwegger eyelids are gone) but I love how they look so it&#x27;s alright. It happened gradually so it wasn&#x27;t so shocking to me. It took a good 6 mo of dedicated usage to get my lids looking good and I boost it with some facial exercise as well. A friend who hadn&#x27;t seen me for almost a year commented about how much younger my face looks and \\&quot;bigger\\&quot; (more wide open) my eyes look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it under &amp; on top of the brow bone / eyebrows (horizontal position) then go over my lids from corner to corner vertically. Lifting the forehead muscles (with this device or another) also helps as the muscles are related. It&#x27;s better to start on a lower setting to really build the muscles, then increase intensity GRADUALLY. Using it on a higher setting only damages the skin and muscles and can break blood vessels, don&#x27;t be tempted to \\&quot;speed it up\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Make sure to use enough gel (!) otherwise it&#x27;s painful. If you look at a good muscle diagram of the face (plenty on google images) it will help you understand how muscles work, and a better idea of which direction to go (with the muscles natural direction and upward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On lower intensity levels this device can be used for \\&quot;microcurrent\\&quot;, on higher intensity levels it behaves more like EMS (electronic muscle stimulation). Either can tone the skin, they work differently. Microcurrent primarily stimulates ATP (which in turn stimulates collagen &amp; elastin production) and EMS actually tones the muscles themselves the way exercise would. More info here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish everyone luck, this little gadget really works but it takes commitment &amp; proper usage. If you&#x27;re interested in facial exercise try Facerobics by Peta Prior from Australia, she has done an incredible job of lifting her face (her before and after photos are truly amazing) and her training is FREE on youtube. She also does an excellent job of explaining how to properly treat the muscles so you don&#x27;t end up with poor results or more wrinkles, which also applies to microcurrent. Toning the face can inadvertently cause skin wrinkles because it takes TIME for the skin to respond and catch up with more toned muscle structure underneath, especially if you have mature skin. Patience is key, and if this concerns you, application of retinol or vit C in theses areas can boost collagen production and soften these lines until the skin adapts to the newly toned muscles. If you&#x27;ve lost weight, this doubly applies. Again, you must hang in there to see the end results (!), many people give up too soon and claim these treatments don&#x27;t work. They do, but it&#x27;s notan instant gratification situation, that&#x27;s what plastic surgery is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine lines on the skin try a smoothing type of serum or eye cream, a device like this won&#x27;t really help with that until months have gone by and the skin is significantly tightened.an instant gratification situation, that&#x27;s what plastic surgery is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine lines on the skin try a smoothing type of serum or eye cream, a device like this won&#x27;t really help with that until months have gone by and the skin is significantly tightened.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews about this product, looked at the utube videos and thought this might work. I have used as directed for 10 days and no change at all. Even took photos before using, and it seems that the undereye bags are worse. Tried the aloe as some have stated it works better, but with no change. I will give it a couple more weeks and respond if there are any changes. As of now, no change in the eye area at all. And being that there is only a 7 day full refund if product if UNUSED and 25% restocking fee if returned within 45 days, USED or UNUSED, plus the shipping, makes no since to send it back. and it does not state if the 7 days means &amp;#34;back in their hands&amp;#34; within 7 days of receipt. The seller did ship fast, no problem there at all.</li>
    <li> This little micro current device is small but has BIG power. I did not think that it would be this powerful. It is excellent for the eye area. Setting it to the power you want to use is a little hard to see. You have to hold it at an angle. If you catch the light just right you can see it perfectly. However, I wished that it was made a little easier. I accidentially had it on 4 and it was really powerful. I could feel the current going through my forehead. I have dark circles under and in the corners of my eyes. I swear I can see a small improvement in the darkness under my eyes. My goal is to use it at least 3 to 4 times per week. I will keep the setting on 3. I will continue to use it and hope that I see a VERY NOTICABLE improvement in the next 6 months to an year. I do not expect miracles bcuz dark circles are almost impossible to get rid of. I think this little device is worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> agree w/other reviewers-- this little gizmo definitely does something.  love that it is battery operated, as i also have a dermawand which is effective and seems more powerful, but annoying to plug in each time it&#x27;s used.  from my research,i&#x27;ve learned one must view the use of these devices like toothbrushing-- they must become a habit to maintain (and improve) results. btw i got mine from the world&#x27;s largest auction site (starts w/an e and ends in a y) for less than half the price here. it is identical to the one pictured and came w/instructions (tho no plastic case) i think it is sold by the manufacturer and came directly from china in a week.</li>
    <li> This takes some getting used to.  You have to play with the setting to find your comfort level.  I do see a difference.</li>
    <li> I used it once, put it in my suitcase in a cosmetic bag to travel, it broke. If you pack it, put it in it&#x27;s box. Plastic top is apparently very fragile.</li>
    <li> Well chickies and doodles, this little gadget really does what it says.  This is the second one I&#x27;m buying as I gave one as a gift to my esthetician.  I showed her how to use it in her office and she was amazed.  I only did one side of my face (like what you see on tv) and she was going \\&quot;oh yeah\\&quot;.  She has a reunion coming up and wanted to look fantastic of course!  High school, it&#x27;s so nice to go back and look great.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s this woman named Christine Byer on youtube.  She is a microcurrent whiz.  Watch her videos for more info on how to work it.  I started out on setting 2 and noticed a difference.  Go slow and avoid the temple area as it will cause a headache.  Start out with 15 seconds in each area always going up.  Before you know it you will get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews of people it didn&#x27;t work for.  Maybe they were trying for something miraculous, I&#x27;m not sure.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for maybe you should consider surgery.  This is a good product but it will take dedication and time.  Good luck kids.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say whether this thing works or not.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference.  What I can tell you is that it shocks the heck out of me if I get the dial set to 3 or over (it goes up to 5).  Not only do I feel the electric shocks, it makes my eye twitch like crazy when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wanted to try it, I&#x27;d be happy to give them mine and hope they had a better experience with it than what I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note, I use a TENS unit to help control back pain, so I&#x27;m not a wimp with things that offer electric impulses, in case anyone was thinking that I don&#x27;t understand how things like this work.</li>
    <li> I guess I just like to waste my money. Does not work as described. Would not recomend any one buy</li>
    <li> broke with in two weeks</li>
    <li> I have to give this 5 stars due to the low price and the overall quality of this little gadget. I wanted to buy the more expensive larger version of this device which costs close to 10 times the price but started to look around the internet and saw this. I noticed it got quite a lot of favorable reviews. This was my first purchase ever on Amazon. I used this with the aloe vera gel sold normally by the suntan products. I didn&#x27;t like the conductor lotion it came with so much so I decided to use the aloe gel and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this on my entire face except for closely around the eyes. It scares me to get it too close to the eyes but I suppose that is what this is intended for. Upon using this device for a few weeks, to be honest, I was not seeing results. None really. I was disappointed. Then one day after possibly 10-15 times of use, I noticed a considerable difference in the tone of my skin. My cheeks seemed tighter and the lines going downward by the mouth seemed to be much less noticeable. I also use the neckline slimmer but these results were not like I&#x27;d seen before and I have been using the neckline slimmer for a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really feel this current and I am still experimenting with different ways to use it. I thought this might work after trying it for the first time since the jolt you get is a lot like one formerly popular \\&quot;smoothbeam\\&quot; laser. I got several sessions of that to the tune of 1000 or more and the main thing I noticed was that it really tightened my skin. Possibly the jolting of the microcurrent causes the muscles to tighten or something. Not as strong as the smoothbeam of course. Don&#x27;t give up on this quickly because it took over 10 sessions before I saw improvements. I do think I want to save up for the larger one now that I think my skin will benefit from this. This one is very strong but the probes are smallish and I am unsure but think possibly the larger probes might be easier to use. Great product for the price. I am very happy with it.roduct for the price. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good. I would&#x27;ve liked better results. But I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and love it! I especially use it in the morning. I honestly think it&#x27;s better than Botox! I use it on the #2 setting. It truly wakes up my eyes! I also use it on my jaw line. This is a great little tool for the amount of money.  The tone and texture of my skin has improved. The key is to be have to be faithful in using it...just like brushing your teeth!</li>
    <li> I used it for over a month and had absolutely no results. Skin looked the same, wrinkles looked the same, and there is no massaging action to it unless you consider moving it over your skin as a message.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this massager for 2 mths but notice no improvement to my eye area..especially my eyebags (main readon of me buying)..there&#x27;s even no lifting effect..quite disappointed with product..but i&#x27;m still putting sone hope &amp; still continuing using it..perhaps might make me happy soon..</li>
    <li> I did not see improvement</li>
    <li> I must be doing something wrong, because I can&#x27;t feel any tingling. When I touch it to my tongue to test it, I feel the tingle then, but can&#x27;t feel anything in my face. I have used the cream that came with it and tried aloe-Vera gel. Still nothing.</li>
    <li> A constant short electrical impulse when I applied to my skin, causing a jerking hot sensation even at the lowest setting.Like other reviewers of this product I agree that there should have been better instructions on how to use. I have very fair skin not sure if this was the problem.  I did not see any improvement whatsoever.</li>
</ol>
