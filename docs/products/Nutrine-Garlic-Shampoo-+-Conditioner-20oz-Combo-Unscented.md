    <li> This is just personal. I had order this product before and got different product which we didn&#x27;t return and loved it so I re-order it and get the real thing from the picture except that my husband didn&#x27;t like this product he got a lot of flakes.</li>
    <li> My hair stopped falling  out. it works for me.</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves your hair with very little slip. It takes more to moisturize your hair back into condition. I find myself adding coconut oil and rose water to the conditioner. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the amount of shedding. This product is suppose to deter hair loss. The hair loss is still the same.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Just ensure you purchase the unscented.</li>
    <li> I have been using shampoo for 3 weeks and have not seen positive results. Will keep using it to see what happens.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so clean and soft. Not harsh and buy it having this garlic name I thought it would at lease smell like a lil garlic, the smell is Outstanding Good.</li>

    <li> Did not like this at all made my hair heard</li>
    <li> Well I have mixed thought on this product! It does help with hair loss I have noticed. But there are A lot of cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very strong flower smell&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner has the texture of a shampoo and even foams like soap&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very dry and had to manage after washing but very oily 8-10 hours after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Works as it claims but not something I&#x27;ll buy again or recommend to anyone</li>
