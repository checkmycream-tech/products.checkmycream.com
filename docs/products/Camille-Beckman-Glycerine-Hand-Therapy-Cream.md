      <li>/&gt;The scent is phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>Love the product; Tuscan Honey fragrance is a bit strong.</li>
      <li>Love the rich consistency.  </li>
      <li>I took a chance on this one, mostly because I love honey, and Tuscany is such a lovely place.  </li>
      <li>I have tried numerous products but this is by far the best for healing hands.</li>
      <li>All of the hand therapies are amazing for softening super-dry skin or for regular use, and the Tuscan Honey scent is wonderful...sweet and light without being cloying.</li>
      <li>is by far one of my favorite vanilla-y scents ever.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find the large tub.</li>
      <li>Pretty container, smells good, seems to work as expected for hand cream.</li>
      <li>This is the best hand cream..light, non-greasy, long lasting, gentle scent (very).  </li>
      <li>I bought the large size because I have loved the other products from Camille Beckman, but I have to throw this out.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it the first time I used it, so I had to buy a bigger container!  </li>

      <li>Wife really likes it - she has &#x27;working&#x27; hands and says it makes them tingle and feel softer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very soft and creamy scent.  </li>
      <li>It makes, and keeps, my hands SO SOFT!  </li>
      <li>Only way I&#x27;ve had pretty nails were acrylic.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would try a different fragrance because I really liked the jar, but the consistency is way different from the other Camille Beckmans I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The glycerin helps it stay on  little longer making my hand feel silky &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>I recently found that the Camille Beckman company headquarters are a short drive from my home and have been enjoying several of their products in recent months.  </li>
      <li>This cream was like medicine I that it cured her hands to the point they are soft again.</li>
      <li>Keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
      <li>My hands feel so soft, and the skin looks resilient, literally glows.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Completely out if the blue...</li>
      <li>Since I was a kid I have struggled with dry hands and feet and the normal supermarket lotions and creams just do not do the trick.  </li>
      <li>This tub is huge, and will probably last at least 6 months.</li>

    <li> This product gave me goddess hands.  My hands feel so soft, and the skin looks resilient, literally glows.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is phenomenal.  I love vanilla-y scents, and \\&quot;Tuscan Honey\\&quot; is by far one of my favorite vanilla-y scents ever.  Like a blend of almonds, honey, vanilla, lilacs ... it&#x27;s a very soft and creamy scent.  It&#x27;s a deeper floral scent - not bright or crisp, but smooth - mesmerizing:)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of the greatest vanilla-y scented products out there!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in my birchbox. I fell in love with it the first time I used it, so I had to buy a bigger container!  It makes my hands so soft expecually now that it&#x27;s cold out it helps my hands from cracking. The smell is so heavenly as well, and it lasts all day even when washing multiple times a day.</li>
    <li> Love Love this stuff! It goes on very thick but dries quickly. I have tried numerous products but this is by far the best for healing hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who was suffering from very dry hands. This cream was like medicine I that it cured her hands to the point they are soft again.

    <li> I love it.  It makes my hands beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this scent &amp; so do the men. It is great. But what happened to the scent Almond( Vanilla) I think. I loved that scent. I wish U would bring it back. They always say stick with what U like &amp; what works. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;Yorkeyhall271954@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere I&#x27;ve use this handcream in the past and there is nothing like it. Was glad to find it on Amazon and would buy it again over and over</li>
    <li> works and smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
    <li> Pretty container, smells good, seems to work as expected for hand cream. Wife really likes it - she has &#x27;working&#x27; hands and says it makes them tingle and feel softer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. GREAT smell and really works to soften hands!</li>
    <li> I cannot use this product. I am terribly allergic to the scent or some other ingredient in it. I bought the large size because I have loved the other products from Camille Beckman, but I have to throw this out. I got sinus headaches after using it.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best hand cream in the world - leaves skin soft but not one bit greasy.  Love the rich consistency.  Comes in many wonderful fragrances.  I took a chance on this one, mostly because I love honey, and Tuscany is such a lovely place.  Don&#x27;t know how to describe the fragrance, but I LOVE it - smells heavenly and instantly relaxes me.  Mmmm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes in fragrance are very personal.  If you are lucky enough to find a store selling this, you will be treated to a smorgasbord of samples and can find the fragrance that most appeals to you as an individual.  At one time, it also came fragrance-free (good for people with allergic reactions to smells); hopefully, that is still available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever get filthy rich, I will buy enough of this to use as often as I like, instead of rationing myself.

    <li> I ordered this for my daughter since we cannot find it easily in local stores and had it sent to her in another part of the country.  This is the best hand cream..light, non-greasy, long lasting, gentle scent (very).  What else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great productime.  Non-greasy aND very long lasting.  Ony guy acceptable scent</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents and I love how it makes my hands and feet feel- moisturized and protected. I have even been know to give this product as a gift to my friends!</li>
    <li> Camille Beckman Tuscan Honey Glycerine Hand Therapy is the best.  I use all of camelle beckman hand and body cream.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this for me at the gift shop of our hospital when I had my son 2 years ago. I was so glad to have found this as I love the smell and it brings back such a special memory for me :)</li>
    <li> Feels nice on your skin. The glycerin helps it stay on  little longer making my hand feel silky &amp; smooth. Great for overnight use.</li>
    <li> I received a tube of this at Xmas, kept it by my computer and used it several times per day.  Completely out if the blue... I stopped picking nails and cuticles; a habit I have had for so many years!  Only way I&#x27;ve had pretty nails were acrylic.  It has to be this cream!  I was excited to find the large tub. I highly recommend this affordable and luxurious product!</li>
    <li> I love Camille Beckman. Best hand cream I have ever used</li>
    <li> I thought I would try a different fragrance because I really liked the jar, but the consistency is way different from the other Camille Beckmans I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing, and the jar arrived cracked!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Works great...jst like all Camille Beckman products!</li>
    <li> This is great for your hands. It seems to make the wrinkles just disappear</li>
    <li> I recently found that the Camille Beckman company headquarters are a short drive from my home and have been enjoying several of their products in recent months.  All of the hand therapies are amazing for softening super-dry skin or for regular use, and the Tuscan Honey scent is wonderful...sweet and light without being cloying.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an organic hand cream for a while and this is it. Absorbs into skin immediately and softens hands without a greasy residue. I will not use anything else now that I have used Camille Beckman.</li>
    <li> Love the product; Tuscan Honey fragrance is a bit strong. Will order the unscented next time so my husband can also use.</li>
    <li> Would LOVE to be able to get a lot more of this product ...</li>
    <li> I have been using Camille Beckman glycerine hand therapy since the mid 1990&#x27;s.  Since I was a kid I have struggled with dry hands and feet and the normal supermarket lotions and creams just do not do the trick.  Then I found Camille Beckman and I have never looked back.  It has a great texture, its really well made and they all smell great!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  It is worth every penny!!!!!</li>
