      <li>I love Plant Therapy and all  of their products.</li>
      <li>Love this pine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy that I was choosen to test and review this pine essential oil.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to give it a try in our house.</li>
      <li>but if you want it for its natural properties &amp; uses, this is a great one to have.</li>
      <li>I have pinus sylvestris oil from one of the most reputable essential oil suppliers in the industry, and this smells as good or better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s and excellent essential oil with a strong, pleasant scent of a live, fresh pine tree.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the smell that you would have if you were out in the woods, but not as strong.</li>
      <li>It was not as strong as some I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil and look forward to exploring more Plant Therapy oils - I may have found a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>knew that getting pure essential oil would the perfect solution</li>
      <li>I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products.</li>
      <li>I love having the fresh scent of pine in my home during the Christmas season.</li>
      <li>received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
      <li>I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
      <li>pine essential oil is also great to make a home made gel air freshener.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Just go get you a unflavored gelatine, water and some salt, then add some of this essential oil, and you will have your very own home made gel freshener</li>
      <li>This essential oil smells amazing!</li>
      <li>July and August are more consistent weather-wise and a lot of us use our ACs around the clock for weeks on end.</li>
      <li>I made this choice because they espouse safe usage (have hired one of the go to people on using EOs safety as a consultant who also developed their &amp;#34;kids safe&amp;#34; line), have trained aromatherapists on staff to answer questions, support a fabulous FB page on safe usage, etc.</li>
      <li>After a afternoon of cleaning the whole house smells nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>This can also be used to make your own natural cleaning products.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a Pine-Sol smell, but it isn&#x27;t really at all.</li>
      <li>I use it in my diffuser,  smells like a pine forest, fresh an clean sent,  </li>
      <li>so being able to have an essential oil that has that smell is fantastic to me!</li>
      <li>etc.. to try to get a Christmas/Holiday pine scent in my home but the fragrance always dissipates too quickly.</li>
      <li>The odor is strong, but doesn&#x27;t smell much of pine and dissipates in 8 hours or so.</li>
      <li>I try, whenever I can, to stay away from over-the-counter medications and have become adept over the years at finding new and better ways of managing health related challenges.</li>
      <li>Blends nicely with Lemongrass essential oil, too.</li>
      <li>Just a smell of fresh, just cut pine trees.</li>
      <li>They have a lot of positive feedback that seems to be true and holistic.</li>
      <li>(you know the kind, it has pine in the name), I also use it to make toilet bombs, and wash the walls.  </li>
      <li>The pine is no exception, it has a very rich and powerful smell just like standing in the middle of the mountains.</li>
      <li>Plant therapy has not failed me yet.</li>
      <li>Like relaxing in a peaceful forest.  </li>
      <li>I love it and use it on my back as I have pimples</li>
      <li>I received this essential oil at a promotional cost for a real evaluation and an unbiased review and I love the warm, nostalgic scent of this pine oil and love the health benefits I get from using it!</li>
      <li>This is my first Pine essential oil, but I&#x27;m very familiar with oils as a whole.</li>
      <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
      <li>While they do have the child safe line, they are now going to indicate which other individual oils and synergies are child safe.</li>
      <li>This pine fragrance reminds me of my childhood memories of having a fresh cut or live Christmas tree during the holidays .I</li>
      <li>Just make sure they dry through, or they&#x27;ll break.  </li>
      <li>you can also add a few drops in to a spray bottle and clean counters and  sinks,  quite happy with it,  and pine scent  </li>
      <li>At night a few drops of Pine Oil mixed with unscented lotion and applied on my back and chest before I fall asleep pretty much guarantees that I won’t wake up with any stuffiness and no headache (plus, my bed smells awesome!)!</li>
      <li>Would absolutely recommend this for a fresh, natural oil!</li>
      <li>I can really say that it&#x27;s a very high quality oil.</li>
      <li>Also with the holiday season upon us soon this oil will definitely be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It gives out a very relaxing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Trust me, it really makes it easier to find what you want/need as your collection grows.  </li>
      <li>This is a genuine and high quality essential oil.</li>
      <li>The bottle this Pine Essential oil comes in is a pretty good size and depending on how often you use it and how much you use at a time will depend on how long it&#x27;ll last.</li>
      <li>I paid way more than this for my other brand!).</li>
      <li>PT really thinks of the little touches, the bottles have labels on the top with the names of the oils/synergies.</li>
      <li>Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Plant Therapy and all their oils</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it to all of my family and friends.</li>
      <li>The product is a high quality</li>
      <li>I use this (and really all my EO&#x27;s) exclusively for natural health in rollerballs, &amp; mix with a carrier oil which I have no problem with loss of scent, etc.  </li>
      <li>So far it works really well and mosquitoes haven&#x27;t bothered us while wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Open the bottle and it smells like a Christmas tree--that fresh, clean, sharp smell.</li>
      <li>I have found that for my sinus headaches a few drops of Plant Therapy Pine Essential Oil mixed well with almond oil and rubbed lightly on my chest significantly reduces the intensity and the duration.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy gives me a peace of mine that the oil I am using is One hundred percent certified pure therapeutic grade essential oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Living in Pennsylvania is a daily game of weather-roulette. I often use both the heater, and the AC, on the same day. July and August are more consistent weather-wise and a lot of us use our ACs around the clock for weeks on end. Going in and out of air conditioned cars or buildings, wild swings in temperature and the insane fluctuations in humidity can, at times, give me nasty sinus headaches. I try, whenever I can, to stay away from over-the-counter medications and have become adept over the years at finding new and better ways of managing health related challenges. I have found that for my sinus headaches a few drops of Plant Therapy Pine Essential Oil mixed well with almond oil and rubbed lightly on my chest significantly reduces the intensity and the duration. At night a few drops of Pine Oil mixed with unscented lotion and applied on my back and chest before I fall asleep pretty much guarantees that I won’t wake up with any stuffiness and no headache (plus, my bed smells awesome!)! I received this essential oil at a promotional cost for a real evaluation and an unbiased review and I love the warm, nostalgic scent of this pine oil and love the health benefits I get from using it!</li>
    <li> Still on the hunt to refresh my holiday pine cones. These products could be good. But they don&#x27;t last. Unless you just want a couple hours, skip it.</li>
    <li> The aroma is truer to pine scent than I expected so it&#x27;s not as flowery smelling. But I like it .</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy and all  of their products. The pine is no exception, it has a very rich and powerful smell just like standing in the middle of the mountains. This oil has a nice feel and I have already used it in a roller with almond oil for muscle pain for my son who is a rock climber and it worked great. I highly recommend Plant Therapy and all their oils</li>
    <li> I use it in my diffuser,  smells like a pine forest, fresh an clean sent,  you can also add a few drops in to a spray bottle and clean counters and  sinks,  quite happy with it,  and pine scent  has health benefits as well. would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a genuine and high quality essential oil. I have pinus sylvestris oil from one of the most reputable essential oil suppliers in the industry, and this smells as good or better (hint - I paid way more than this for my other brand!). There are no signs it has been diluted. It smells like fresh-crushed pine foliage. I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil and look forward to exploring more Plant Therapy oils - I may have found a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> The odor is strong, but doesn&#x27;t smell much of pine and dissipates in 8 hours or so. Not too impressed.</li>
    <li> When I saw this Pine Essential Oil I ordered it immediately! I love having the fresh scent of pine in my home during the Christmas season. I have spent so much money on air freshners ,sprays,potpourri diffusers etc.. to try to get a Christmas/Holiday pine scent in my home but the fragrance always dissipates too quickly. This pine fragrance reminds me of my childhood memories of having a fresh cut or live Christmas tree during the holidays .I knew that getting pure essential oil would the perfect solution and it was! It smells amazing and now I will have that wonderful exhilarating pine scent whenever I want!&lt;br /&gt;* I was given a promotional discount for providing honest feedback on this item. All thoughts and opinions are my own *</li>
    <li> I came on to reorder and was curious of all the less than stellar reviews. I have been thoroughly happy with strength, medicinical qualities and scent of this oil.  It is in my top EOs that I use most.  I use this (and really all my EO&#x27;s) exclusively for natural health in rollerballs, &amp; mix with a carrier oil which I have no problem with loss of scent, etc.  I also use it in cleaning products.  It is my go to oil in all recipes for cough, colds, sinus, cuts and i could go on.  It&#x27;s antibacterial, antiseptic, analgesic, anti fungal, antibiotic and an antiviral!  I guess if you are just wanting a Christmas tree smell, you might want to buy a fragrance oil....but if you want it for its natural properties &amp; uses, this is a great one to have.</li>
    <li> I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it. I purchased three bottles of different scents from Plant Therapy Essentials Oils and they smell nothing like what they are labeled. I have used both Young Living and DoTerra in the past and will be switching back. Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them. I have requested a refund/credit, but if that doesn&#x27;t happen I will be throwing these oils out.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this before, when i just smelled it out of the bottle. It had an &#x27;after odor&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have poured a few drops on a cotton ball and the bad smell has gone away. One little cotton ball w three drops of this oil scents the whole room, and it smells just like pine. I bought this after reading about forrest therapy in japan. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This essential oil smells amazing! This is my first Pine essential oil, but I&#x27;m very familiar with oils as a whole. I thought this might have a cleaner/chemically smell and there was nothing like that. Just a smell of fresh, just cut pine trees. I added this to my diffuser and the smell is wonderful and natural once diluted for use. Would absolutely recommend this for a fresh, natural oil!</li>
    <li> It was not as strong as some I have tried. I use them on dried pinecones I keep in my mudroom.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I started my EO journey a little over 3 months ago. After attending a disappointing presentation by a rep from an mlm company. It spurred me on to do my own research. I came across Plant Therapy (PT) and choose it as my go to company for essential oils. I made this choice because they espouse safe usage (have hired one of the go to people on using EOs safety as a consultant who also developed their &amp;#34;kids safe&amp;#34; line), have trained aromatherapists on staff to answer questions, support a fabulous FB page on safe usage, etc. PT really thinks of the little touches, the bottles have labels on the top with the names of the oils/synergies. Trust me, it really makes it easier to find what you want/need as your collection grows.  Open the bottle and it smells like a Christmas tree--that fresh, clean, sharp smell. There&#x27;s nothing fake about it. Pine is most commonly known for its ability to help with symptoms caused from an illness. Inhale it to help ease congestion. When properly diluted in a carrier oil, you can apply to affected area to help reduce pain caused from arthritis, joint and muscle pain and rheumatism.  My other thought is to use it in the shower like a vaporizer when you&#x27;re congested.  You can put a few drops on the shower floor, or make shower discs--a baking soda, cornstarch and water mixture that hardens by baking at a low temperature in silicone mold. You put them in the shower with a few drops of EOs and they add to the steam. Just do a web search to find a recipe. Very easy. Just make sure they dry through, or they&#x27;ll break.  I received this product at a discount for an honest review because PT is in process of changing all of it&#x27;s labels. While they do have the child safe line, they are now going to indicate which other individual oils and synergies are child safe. I checked and this oil is child safe.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it on my back as I have pimples&lt;br /&gt; and my  on my feet my feet are energized!!</li>
    <li> I am very glad to have found a Pine oil that not adulterated. I have read somewhere before that pine essential oil is one of those oils that are frequently adulterated and Turpentine is used as an inexpensive filler. That sounds scary, right? Plant Therapy gives me a peace of mine that the oil I am using is One hundred percent certified pure therapeutic grade essential oil. It has no fillers, additives, bases or carriers added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pine essential oil is a very relaxing oil It is great for after exercising. But never use it without a carrier oil because the skin can get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pine is also great for diffusing. It gives out a very relaxing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pine essential oil is also great to make a home made gel air freshener. Just go get you a unflavored gelatine, water and some salt, then add some of this essential oil, and you will have your very own home made gel freshener (pls. use google for recipes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy that I was choosen to test and review this pine essential oil. I can really say that it&#x27;s a very high quality oil. Plant therapy has not failed me yet. I am so far very impressed with their oils and I highly recommend it to all of my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Nice and pine-y.  Like relaxing in a peaceful forest.  Blends nicely with Lemongrass essential oil, too.</li>
    <li> Actual essential oil without being obscenely priced.</li>
    <li> I use this when I use my bissell symphony steam vacuum mop</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s and excellent essential oil with a strong, pleasant scent of a live, fresh pine tree. It clears my nasal passages and relieves cough. Seems even that my lungs are working better, the breathing is easier after having inhaled it slowly and deeply for a couple of minutes into each nostril. Fir needle essential oil by the same company is very similar to this one, which is understandable as both trees are closely related.</li>
    <li> Our family has only started using Essential Oils in the last few months as we are moving more into a health lifestyle. Pine essential oil is not one that I have had any experience with prior to this oil. I was very excited to give it a try in our house. To me and my wife both, this oil did not have a very strong smell at all. I was expecting more of a Pine-Sol smell, but it isn&#x27;t really at all. It reminds me of the smell that you would have if you were out in the woods, but not as strong. We have diffused this in our house and have also used it in a mix with water, lavender, and tea tree oil to spray around our house. We have used Plant Therapy products before in our house and they are a brand that I trust. I decided to do a review in exchange for getting this product for a discount so that I could see if Pine Essential Oil was something that we would use often. The product is a high quality and I would recommend for anyone that uses Pine Essential Oil to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of pine. I&#x27;ve mixing this oil with others for aromatherapy purposes. This can also be used to make your own natural cleaning products. Can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can use it for.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve also added this to make an all natural bug spray with sage and tea tree oil. Just a few drops of each mixed with witch hazel in a small spray bottle! So far it works really well and mosquitoes haven&#x27;t bothered us while wearing it.  I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Plant therapy Is my go to essential oil company. Love this pine. I received a discount for my review and I was very fortunate for that. I love the smell of this pine!! Very nice!</li>
    <li> I have recently been on an essential oil kick and have been trying a ton of different scents so when I came across this Pine Essential Oil I knew I had to get it! I use this in my oil diffuser and the smell is amazing and perfect but you do have to make sure you don&#x27;t do too many drops as it can get pretty strong. I only use about 3-4 drops in my oil diffuser. I&#x27;ve always loved the way Pine trees smell so being able to have an essential oil that has that smell is fantastic to me! The bottle this Pine Essential oil comes in is a pretty good size and depending on how often you use it and how much you use at a time will depend on how long it&#x27;ll last. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I just recently started using essential oils. They have a lot of positive feedback that seems to be true and holistic. I suggest doing research and get an oil diffuser. I tried this product a discounted price for a review.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of pine oil certainly packs a punch.  The pine oil is made my Plant Therapy and I really like it.  It comes in a small bottle and has 1 oz. of product.  The smell is so strong you only need a few drops so a little bit can go a long way.  I purchased this pine oil because I love to use it for cleaning.  I use the pine to make my own household cleaner, (you know the kind, it has pine in the name), I also use it to make toilet bombs, and wash the walls.  After a afternoon of cleaning the whole house smells nice and fresh. Also with the holiday season upon us soon this oil will definitely be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pine oil also has health benefits.  You can add a few drops to a bath, oil diffuser, face steamer or even a cotton ball and smell periodically throughout the day to help with asthma, coughing, and bronchitis.  You can also add the pine oil to a carrier oil for pain relief from arthritis and sore muscles.  I love that pine oil scent and it&#x27;s great because it has a multitude of uses.  I think it is a household staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
    <li> When I did a search for pine scented oil for warmers, this product came up. Well, it can&#x27;t be used that way. It evaporates in just a few minutes, so I guess it is to be used for something other than warmers.</li>
