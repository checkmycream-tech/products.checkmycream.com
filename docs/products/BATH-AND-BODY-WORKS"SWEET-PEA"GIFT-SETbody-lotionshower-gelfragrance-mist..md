    <li> I received the Bath and Body Works &amp;#34;Sweet Pea Gift Set (body lotion, shower gel and fragrance) as a Mother&#x27;s Day Gift.  I was impressed the gift came before Mothers Day, the packaging is excellent from the company it was ordered.  The product size was larger than I had anticipated, and the company had included a card since this was a gift.  The company delivered and packaged this item perfectly.  I am impressed with the service, and doubly impressed with this gift.  The scent is &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and I am definitely enjoying my experience with this gift set.  I would definitely purchase another &amp;#34;Sweet Pea Gift Set.  I noticed the price is very reasonable for the set.  I love it and the person who gave me such a lovely &amp;#34;pamper me&amp;#34; gift!!!  I would recommend this gift set for many other women who love packages, savings, and a great product.</li>
