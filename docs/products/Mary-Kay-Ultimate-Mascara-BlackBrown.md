      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara from Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that this product has maintained high quality.  </li>
      <li>I know each time that it will perform perfectly and lasts all day long without smudging or smearing or running.</li>
      <li>But I had better luck purchasing from seller Pinksunshine, who accurately described the color, than ebestbuys who did not.  </li>
      <li>It is buildable, comes off easy and didn&#x27;t run.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer!</li>
      <li>Smooth application...</li>
      <li>and i love it its a brown dark color its beautiful</li>
      <li>Best if you let it dry between applications (it dries fast).  </li>
      <li>It stays on and cleans off pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly, well packaged.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much!</li>
      <li>I liked it, I should have ordered it in black and would have worked better for me</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite Mascara.</li>
      <li>corporate sees this and fixes the mascara tube, because the brush is really nice</li>
      <li>It goes on quickly as you only need a couple of coats for fabulous lashes!  </li>
      <li>At first didnt know the package had arrived.</li>
      <li>Love Mary Kay ultimate mascara.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this product as it was recommended by a friend.  </li>

      <li>I have always loved Mary Kay Mascaras but haven&#x27;t gotten any in quite a few years now.  </li>
      <li>Knowing the quality of Mary Kay&#x27;s products makes it easy to always purchase the same.  </li>
      <li>Expected more from Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The brush separates and elongates my lashes better than any other I&#x27;ve used with no clumping.</li>
      <li>This product, if new, goes on smoothly and separates, lengthens, AND adds volume to your lashes at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it is NOT black and because it does not irritate my eyes even after a long day.  </li>
      <li>You could try ordering it, but be prepared to send it back or just discard fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Even though I ordered the wrong color, the brown turned out great anyways.  </li>
      <li>I will be trying the new Mary Kay \\&quot;Lash</li>
      <li>and i bought this new one because i was running out of my old one</li>
      <li>If you purchase this and it flakes or clumps on you, then someone sold you an old tube.  </li>
      <li>I was given a small size of ultimate mascara in a gift bag and I was so impressed that I purchased the regular size when the small size was gone.  </li>
      <li>This is the season for browns so as I rinse my hair natural tone</li>
      <li>Looks natural.</li>
      <li>Bought this mascara, paid for one day shipping, and it&#x27;s old.</li>
      <li>this is just fine for mascara - nothing special - nothing wrong with it either.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my eyes in the least, important because I don&#x27;t wear mascara all the time now.  </li>
      <li>I have tried them all even 90 dollar tubes, this is by far the ultimate!</li>
      <li>I love the mascara, it gives almost false lash type of results.</li>

<li> Brown is the new black.</li>
<li> If you want drama, let your second coat dry and hit your lashes up a third time.  </li>

<li> I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve been a longtime Lancome user, but this was a fantastic replacement at half the price.  </li>
<li> I ordered two packages, and both tubes seem a little old or dried out.  </li>
<li> I do not buy any other mascara but Mary Kay.  </li>

<li> I perfer the black for my lashes.</li>
<li> blonde and black/brown is hard to find lately.</li>
<li> However the seller sent me the wrong color.  </li>
<li> but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the quality of the mascara, even though I have been buying this brand and type for a couple of years.</li>

    <li> This is by far my favorite Mascara. The brush separates and elongates my lashes better than any other I&#x27;ve used with no clumping. I&#x27;m a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> I love the mascara, it gives almost false lash type of results. However the seller sent me the wrong color.  I wanted black not black - brown.</li>
    <li> Great, great mascara.  If you purchase this and it flakes or clumps on you, then someone sold you an old tube.  This product, if new, goes on smoothly and separates, lengthens, AND adds volume to your lashes at the same time.  It goes on quickly as you only need a couple of coats for fabulous lashes!  Best if you let it dry between applications (it dries fast).  If you want drama, let your second coat dry and hit your lashes up a third time.  But one or two coats are plenty for daytime use.  I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve been a longtime Lancome user, but this was a fantastic replacement at half the price.  Lasts about 2 months of use, 4-5x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the \\&quot;black/brown\\&quot; color seems just as black as any other \\&quot;black\\&quot; mascara I&#x27;ve bought, perhaps just a tad softer.  But I had better luck purchasing from seller Pinksunshine, who accurately described the color, than ebestbuys who did not.  Buyers take note.</li>
    <li> I ordered two packages, and both tubes seem a little old or dried out.  You could try ordering it, but be prepared to send it back or just discard fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Pricey and not different from cheaper ones</li>
    <li> Love this brand. I wear gas permeable contact lenses. This mascara does not irritate my eyes. It washes off beautifully with water.</li>
    <li> Knowing the quality of Mary Kay&#x27;s products makes it easy to always purchase the same.  I do not buy any other mascara but Mary Kay.  I know each time that it will perform perfectly and lasts all day long without smudging or smearing or running.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years and prefer to use nothing else.  It lasts and lasts and does not ever smear, run or clump.&lt;br /&gt;It was so nice to be able to click a button and order it.  It arrived quickly, well packaged.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the season for browns so as I rinse my hair natural tone I like the brown. Brown is the new black.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara from Mary Kay. It does not clump like other mascaras.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it is NOT black and because it does not irritate my eyes even after a long day.  I used it for a while a couple of years back and could no longer find Mary Kay locally so tried about three or four other and much more expensive mascaras.  They all irritated my eyes.  I discovered I could order Mary Kay through Amazon and am back using it again.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product as it was recommended by a friend.  I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Smooth application...no clumping</li>
    <li> I wanted to change what I wrote last time, because I made the mistake not the buyer. At first didnt know the package had arrived. I appologize for the last notice, so please disregard the previous.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Mary Kay Mascaras but haven&#x27;t gotten any in quite a few years now.  I am happy to report that this product has maintained high quality.  It does not irritate my eyes in the least, important because I don&#x27;t wear mascara all the time now.  It separates and it doesn&#x27;t clump going on or crumble after it dries.  It stays on and cleans off pretty easily.  A great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> this is just fine for mascara - nothing special - nothing wrong with it either.</li>
    <li> I previously bought from a Mary Kay dealer. I was very disappointed with the quality of the mascara, even though I have been buying this brand and type for a couple of years. I will not do it again.</li>
    <li> I was given a small size of ultimate mascara in a gift bag and I was so impressed that I purchased the regular size when the small size was gone.  My eyelashes seem longer and the brush separates the lashes nicely.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the only one that thickens my lashes without clumping. Love it!</li>
    <li> The is the best I have ever used. It is buildable, comes off easy and didn&#x27;t run. I have tried them all even 90 dollar tubes, this is by far the ultimate!</li>
    <li> This mascara is dried out and old product. It doesn&#x27;t measure up to the product bought from a Mary Kay rep. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay ultimate mascara.  This is voted the # 1 mascara in a number of magazines.  Long wearing and no clumping.</li>
    <li> love the mascara, hate that too much product comes out on the tip of the brush.  I don&#x27;t want to have to wipe it everytime I use it.  I use this product for daily use and for modeling shoots so I need it to work properly everytime!  Although it is very nice and sensitive to the eyes and looks great on I will be trying the new Mary Kay \\&quot;Lash Love\\&quot;  on my next purchase.  I hope someone from Mary Kay corporate sees this and fixes the mascara tube, because the brush is really nice and so is the product!</li>
    <li> Goes on evenly, stays nice, it works exceptionally well if applied after the Mary Kay eyeliner primer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it looks</li>
    <li> After using many brands of Mascara I have found Mary Kay to be the best one no caking no flaking.</li>
