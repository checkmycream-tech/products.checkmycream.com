<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just for me hair milk detangler and leave in conditioner is all I use in my daughters hair then air dry. I Love this stuff, it Leaves my daughters curls looking healthy and shiny. My daughter is black/white and has thick curly hair. This is all I have ever used on my 3 yr olds hair</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed with black and white her hair can get hard to comb but after spraying this is her hair its so much easier I use all of products in her hair the shampoo conditioner</li>
    <li> I have been using this detangler on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a few weeks now and I must say that I am really liking it. I&#x27;ve had issues with other products from this particular Just For Me brand but this seems to be one of the best. I like that the scent is very fresh and not overpowering...smells similar to baby powder which is very light. The way that the bottle is made is also a plus....the coke bottle shape makes it very easy to grip and dispense at the same time. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair that always looks like a bird&#x27;s nest. She hates having it brushed because the tangles are so bad. We tried this a number of times and it helps very slightly with brushing but doesn&#x27;t have that same conditioner quality that other detanglers have. It does get rid of some of the flyaways and fuzziness but it seems to make her hair look dirty as well. It actually feels like there is a high water content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it helps marginally, I am not impressed with this detangler.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to put in a review for this product to let people know it work wonders for my girls fine thin hair.  It smells wonderful and makes it so soft.  So even if you aren&#x27;t the target market for this product, don&#x27;t let that sway you.  It is a good detangler and smells great too (reminds me of babies..).  We purchase it at Target in the African American hair care product section.</li>
    <li> I was looking for afforable price of hair milk . I dislike most hair milks has un-neccesary ingredients nowday. Carol daughter&#x27;s hair milk has natural and greatly ingredients but you can do better than wasting pocketful money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to walmart and bought \\&quot;Just for me\\&quot; hair milk for $1 or 2 . I read ingredients carefully then compare them to Carol daughter hair milk.  They are almost similar. It is a great price for hair product that has great ingredient, I use them as \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot; it is a must in summer! I stay moist all day after using water and glycerin. My hair is big and thick curly.&lt;br /&gt;  I am gotta keeping going back to this one , because i keeping hearing Carol Daughter products are \\&quot;waste\\&quot;. I never had tried them, ma did until I taught her she can make anything like her .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I will use this again as a detangler as it didn&#x27;t seem to do much to help me  detangle my curls. I recommend [[ASIN:B0013JSK7M Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner 8oz]] a lot more if you are looking for a product to help get the knots out!</li>
    <li> This product works well on my fine hair. They are damaged and it&#x27;s hard to brush them in the morning without loosing bunch of hair. I have to be really careful. Just for me detangler smooths hair and I can see the difference in combing, the comb goes easier through hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not greasy but has nice shine, not over the top, hair looks refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only minus is smell, too sweet and strong but it disappears fast once I stop spraying so I can live with that.</li>
    <li> happy with it on hair for kids</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I love the shampoo from this brand, but I think this detangler isn&#x27;t a whole lot better than the conditioner. It does detangle, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it leaves an icky-feeling residue in my hair, even with only a few sprays. I thought perhaps I used too much the first time, and used less the second time, and holding it further from my hair. I still got the same icky feeling in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. There are better nourishing leave-in products and detanglers on the market than this. I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The detangler works well, however after applying this to your hair when it is wet (per the instructions) it then dries shiny, leaving a somewhat &#x27;greasy&#x27; residue in your hair.  Would prefer to have product leave residue behind.  Appears to be geared towards thicker/courser hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought a zillion products for my son&#x27;s ever changing hair texture.  It seems that every time we find something good, his hair becomes &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; to it.  This spray so far has worked well for a few months. I even ordered the subscription.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent or make his hair crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it with the curl smoother by the same company.</li>
    <li> I tried this detangler both on me (shoulder-length hair that doesn&#x27;t get too tangled) and my daughter (long, curly hair that&#x27;s very prone to knots and tangles). I noticed only a slight improvement in ease of brushing for both of us. I tried waiting for about 30 seconds to let it dry as one reviewer suggested, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference (of course, it wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;dry,\\&quot; as I was using it on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the scent, but it&#x27;s not my cuppa tea. Fairly light scent that does fade once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a significant enough difference for me to order this again.</li>
    <li> This has a very similar scent to baby powder.  It worked well and kept my daughter&#x27;s hair tangle free -  no mean feat in the morning.  She hates to brush her hair and short of having her running wild and free like a wild child, I need an excellent detangler.  However, the dealbreaker on this is that she felt it made her smell like a &#x27;toddler&#x27;s diaper&#x27; because of the baby powder. So I had a hard time getting her to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole product line seems to be very good, especially for thick wirey hair, but we haven&#x27;t really liked any of the scents so far.</li>
    <li> I was previously using Johnson&#x27;s detangler on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, but I like this product much better.  It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as greasy as Johnson&#x27;s, and doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.  She has light blonde hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t make it look darker or dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works best if you spray lightly, and then let the product sit for about 30-40 seconds before combing it through.  The light scent of the product is pleasant, and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at my local Walmart for less then what amazon is selling this product for. It works really good. I recommend this product to everyone! I bought this product for $5.00! It smells AMAZING! Not only that but it truly does its job! It leaves my little ones hair silky smooth and very healthy looking. My little one has normal thin hair and it works great! Definitely give this product a try!</li>
    <li> Just for Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler has a pleasant, mild scent. The pump makes a nice fine misty spray. It only takes a few squirts and then it helps to work it through the hair with the fingers thoroughly before brushing. It works surprisingly well as a detangler and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.</li>
    <li> Due to my little sister being mixed we have a hard time locating products that will help her with tangles but not leave her hair weighed down or greasy. The Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler, 10-Ounce Bottle works miracles on her hair! It leaves it easy to brush but still light weight so the curls are bouncy without that greasy feeling. I love the Just For Me products and will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece and it smells really nice (vanilla smell) but not at all overpowering.  My brother usually does my niece&#x27;s hair and he said it makes a difference with tangles and you can see how much healthier her hair looks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my 2 year old whose hair can get a little wild. I have been using this for about a year, it smells good, has good ingredients, and leaves no residue on her hair. Her hair is super soft after use. My teenage son loved it so much he took her bottle so I came back to get another!</li>
    <li> I have a niece with waist length hair. If she ever had it cut short it would be naturally very curly, and it also has the course texture sometimes associated with naturally curly hair. Due to the length tendency to curl and/or frizz in humidity, it&#x27;s a major battle to keep her hair tangle free. It usually ends up braided or in a pony tail just to keep it as manageable as possible. Products like Frizz-ease help, but we have to use so much due to the length of her hair that it gets outrageously expensive. When talking with my hair stylist, she recommended this line. Though it&#x27;s marketed for African-American hair, she said it should work for my niece&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, the shampoo, and conditioner, her hair is now incredibly smooth and almost completely tangle free. The spray doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, waxy, or greasy residue, which is wonderful, and it smells of baby powder. We got a couple of little travel sized spray bottles so her hair can be spritzed on the go when it starts to tangle up. The only downside, and the reason for taking off a star, is the price. Depending on the store you find this at, it can range from $8.50 to $12.00. It may be a miracle in a bottle, but it&#x27;s a costly one. Is it worth it? Yes, if you&#x27;re at the end of your rope looking for something to tame uber-tangled manes. An alternative might be spritzable Moroccan or argan oil, but make sure it&#x27;s not cut with silicone or glycerin to avoid build-up.</li>
    <li> Holy cow.... I have tried so many de-tanglers... This has them beat.  I have really fine hair and most products I use don&#x27;t seem to help much.  This not only helps detangle really well, but it leaves my hair not oily, super soft and almost feels like you came back from the Salon, even though it is 2nd day unwashed hair.</li>
    <li> With a nice light scent, this detangler had quickly become one of my favorite products to use. I no longer had tangles and the comb when through so easily! This seemed to be the perfect product, especially used along with the [[ASIN:B002MO780W Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]] and [[ASIN:B002MO9BW0 Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]. This line left my hair soft and manageable. Unfortunately, I ended up discontinuing use when I found a large amount of hair in the drain after each shower. My daughter was also trying out the Just For Me line and noticed an unusual amount of hair loss as well. We had both used the products for two weeks and decided to go back to our regular shampoo and conditioner. Within just a few days, our hair loss was back to minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I liked how the detangler and the Just For Me Hair Milk line made my hair feel, I sadly had to discontinue use.</li>
    <li> I generally have bad luck with detanglers, particularly comb-in ones. I bought this for my daughter but I&#x27;ve been using it as well. The scent is lovely and it works quickly and well.</li>
    <li> I like just for me products, but I feel that this did not do much for my hair. I will stick to the regular detangler from now on. Plus the shape is not ideal, my hand starts to slide and cramp after a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is natural and smells heavenly and does not irritate my children&#x27;s sensitive scalps. Great price too</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it will be great for my daughter, since she has curly hair. I decided to give it a try since my hair is pretty long and curly too, and gets extremely tangled after I wash it. I LOVED it!! I should have got this long ago since I am always going crazy brushing my hair and breaking some of it.</li>
    <li> i just started using this for my 3 year old daughter. She has long straight hair and it gets tangled easy. It was a problem when i tried combing her hair she would scream, pull and all that so i decided to look for a detangler. From the first use i could tell the difference. No craying there was a little tangling but after the first time it has been smooth saling. It smells good and leaves hair soft and straight for her hair. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this for my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I didn&#x27;t realize it is specially formulated for and targeted at African American children as I am a middle aged Caucasian.  Despite that I am not part of the main demographic this detangler is aimed at it did do a decent job taming my thick but fine hair that is very prone to knots and tangles  after washing or even after a very windy day.  The product has a nice smell and I like that it is made from natural sources like soy milk and honey.</li>
    <li> I use this anytime I style my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes it much easier to brush/comb through. My daughter has exceptionally soft natural hair with a very nice curl pattern, however those curls get tangled and because my daughter is only two I need a quick and easy solution... this detangler provides that.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my daughters hair and the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair detangler that I have found yet. I have very, very thick hair that gets pretty bad knots in it. I use this when I am in the shower, as that is the best place to me to comb my hair. After I shampoo, I will condition my hair and then spray this on, while the conditioner is still on my hair. I&#x27;ll let it sit for a minute or two and then go to work combing out the knots. This makes my hair softer and definitely easier to comb through. It&#x27;s not a miracle product and does not make the knots disappear, but it does help a lot when I&#x27;m trying to yank all of the knots out. I think the bottle says to leave the product in your hair, but I like to rinse it out as I don&#x27;t like leaving any products in my hair. The scent is fine, it&#x27;s no overpowering. The bottle also says that you can use this on dry hair, but I have not tried that as combing my hair when it&#x27;s dry is a disaster.</li>
    <li> I really like this detangler. Although the bottle shape is difficult to use. It does not leave my daughters curly hair with residue, which I though it would.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr. old daughter is constantly struggling with tangles in her long hair.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a detangler that helps her, and gave Just For Me a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misting on dry hair and letting it sit a minute before attempting to comb/brush was suggested by other reviewers, so we tried it.  We tried this at the end of the day a few times.  This does seem to help a little, but not much, certainly not worth the extra effort of applying and waiting..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying to wet hair after a shower doesn&#x27;t help at all, no matter how much we use, it&#x27;s almost as if we&#x27;re just misting on more water.  If you look at the ingredient list, you&#x27;ll see why - number one is water.  A good, deep rinse-out conditioner is the only thing so far to help her, detangler just hasn&#x27;t been enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final test was the pool.  We are really trying to find ways to help with how difficult it is to comb her hair out after swimming.  It&#x27;s so bad, sometimes she says she doesn&#x27;t want to go swimming just because of how hard it is to take care of her hair after we get home.  Along with our regular regimen of braiding it and a swim cap, we tried soaking it with this detangler before she got in the pool the last time we went.  We used a lot of this product afterward as well, but it was still was so difficult to detangle her hair, it wasn&#x27;t any different than when we don&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a truly effective detangler, because this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This product seems to effectively help detangle my daughters hair. We simply spray it on after a bath, let it sit for a couple of minutes and then brush it out. My girls love the smell and so do I. I recommend this if you are looking for a good smelling, detangling solution.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely long and when it gets past a certain point - which it is now - it starts to tangle bad.  I used this in the tub with my hair wet spraying it until the tangles came out.  I managed to get this huge &#x27;rat&#x27;s nest&#x27; out that was what felt like a big matted dredd lock much easier than without any product, or with using regular conditioner, or with the Johnson&#x27;s product that I have used.  After I got the doggone thing out, I washed my hair - usually my tangles involve lint and I know this isn&#x27;t what the bottle will say to do, but with having long hair most of my life, this is what I&#x27;ve found works for me so that I don&#x27;t lose a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, and worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for anythign to detangle and tame my Taiwanese daughter&#x27;s hair, to no avail. This is our miracle product! Too much does weigh her hair down, but just the right amount smooths and detangles and tames it like nothing else. So many friends have commented about how different her hair looks now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I tried it on doll hair that was a mess and the results were similar. We have a bunch of dolls and My Little Ponies who have had new life breathed into them with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters hair. She rarely say ouch any more! Also leaves her hair super soft without being goopy or wet feeling. Best detangler by far (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot)</li>
    <li> This Just For Me Hair Milk smells good, but often leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling sticky. The mist is really fine which is acceptable, but you have to pump it a lot because of that. It works better for minor tangles, but if you&#x27;ve got bad knots it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much. Overall, there are better detanglers out there. I would only buy this if it were on sale for a really good price.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried no less than a dozen detanglers for my daughter&#x27;s tangly hair.  This one actually works, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells lovely: pleasant and not too perfumy.  The fact that my daughter tolerates hair brushing, even after daily swimming at summer camp, is a testament to how well it works.</li>
    <li> works great in my 2 year old daughter hair</li>
    <li> This spray is great at detangling my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair without leaving any gross residue. The smell is too strong, though. I&#x27;ll look for something a little more natural next time, even if I have to pay a bit more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is thick, frizzy and wavy. After about two weeks of use I can attest that her hair is incredibly softer, shinier, looks to have less breakage and smells wonderful. I thought it might weigh her thick hair down and flatten out her waves but it really doesn&#x27;t. We use it once or twice a day whenever we brush/style her hair and it&#x27;s incredible. She&#x27;s also super tender-headed and this truly helps to keep her from crying out.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle shape. It&#x27;s difficult for me to spray the nozzle with the thin neck of the bottle in my hand. I usually have to hold it with two hands to be able to spray. Overall, the spray itself is great and I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Continue to manufacture.</li>
    <li> I planned to use this to straighten out a section of my hair that is tangled and unlike most other parts that are straight. The scent of this product is very offensive to me. I decided to read the reviews and found that most of them use it for children of a different chromosome type than mine. Other research also indicates that the target group for this product is young girls ages 4 to 7 who belong to a different cultural group than the one to which I belong. So, my conclusion is that although this product is not for me, and I threw in into the trash, the fact that my preferences are not the same as those of the targeted group is no major surprise. I do not intend to imply that my preferences are any better or any worse but just that they are different.</li>
    <li> This product does detangle but I don&#x27;t like the way my hair felt afterwards.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long and thick hair.  I couldn&#x27;t comb her hair without this product.  It works very well and the price is good.  It does have a strong smell, but it isn&#x27;t offensive.  They could tone down the scent a bit.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product from other media, and decided to buy it anyway. It did pretty well, but not as well as all the hype. I thought it did better than some of the products I previously bought, but I still haven&#x27;t found the one!</li>
    <li> The smell is good and it keep her hair moist as I braid.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and it distinguishes the curls in my daughters fine hair. People are always complementing the smell and asking us where we got it.</li>
    <li> Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler with Shea butter, soymilk and honey. The Just for me Hair Detangler is a must have especially if your little girl or boy has thick, curly or wavy hair. My little girl has all three and this new detangler has made combing her hair a much more enjoyable process for the both of us. I wouldn&#x27;t comb her hair again without it.</li>
    <li> The smell is great but this does not work well on my hair.  I have to drown myself in it to get any tangle relief and even then it is still pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this on my hair (4c) , my daughter (4a), and my son ( 3c). Wash days are much easier with no more screaming or difficulty combing. This is a must have in my house. Very pleased with this detangler. This also does not weigh hair down or cause flakes.</li>
    <li> Just For Me Hair Milk Detangler has a nice clean scent, helps with tangles and moisture! This detangler is comparable to others I&#x27;ve own and works great! I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s this emphasis on \\&quot;hair milk\\&quot; for the product line for some of the items as if they were creamy and super-moisturizing. They are about the same as other products. Good, though!</li>
    <li> As some other posters have mentioned, if you are patient and leave the spray on the hair for a minute before combing or brushing it seems to work better.  It smells very nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well on tangled hair. My Grand daughter has fine hair &amp; now there&#x27;s no more crying when we brush it out.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve started using it on mornings when my hair looks like I had a rough night.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for giving the hair a little bit of moisture it also smells okay. My girls love using this item and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. It is the perfect detangler. Just for Me detangler smells heavenly. The pump disperses the detangler evenly. The detangler works great. The snarls come out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part of this detangler is what it does not do. It does not make the hair dirty or gross when you have to use a lot to prevent breaking. And, the hair doesn&#x27;t have to be rewashed to avoid more tangles, then needing more detangler, then needing to be rewashed.  It is just perfect. I can brush out the nape of the neck with no problem and it stays smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome.</li>
    <li> My family enjoys the outdoors so our hair tend to dry out and become brittle.  This \\&quot;Just for Me Hair Milk\\&quot; nourishing detangler was exactly what we needed while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Enriched with nutrients: shea butter, soymilk, and honey to detangle and nourish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Easy to use pump-spray top to dispense detangler and control the amount used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use while traveling (following the instructions of spraying directly on dry or wet hair and don&#x27;t need t rinse out), my family&#x27;s hair were noticeably softer, detangled, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The conditioner has a nice butter, milk, and honey scent that&#x27;s OK with all of our family members but some folks may find the scent resembling ladies hand lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Seem to work well on my family&#x27;s straight/slightly wavy, medium to coarse, wet or dry hair.  May work differently on other hair texture types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A good on the go hair detangler enriched with essential natural ingredients, butter, soymilk, and honey to works well to detangle and moisturize weather damaged hair for all family members.</li>
    <li> My hair tangles easily, so I was happy to try out this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on dry hair, waited a few moments, and then combed through my hair. It wasn&#x27;t totally effortless, but it was certainly easier with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit strong, but I was pleased with how my hair looked and how it stayed manageable throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 4 year old&#x27;s tangles.  Has a great smell too!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says and smells great!</li>
    <li> We got this detangler for my daughter who has thick wavy hair that tangles easily! One of the things my daughter loves about it is the smell, she is 11 and most of the other detangler products on the market are geared towards younger children and don&#x27;t have a sophisticated smell.  I love that we can use it on wet or dry hair without the greasy residue many of the other detanglers on the market do.  This detangler leaves her hair soft and silky, while making the combing experience easy and tear free!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to detangle one&#x27;s hair.  Just about 6 or 7 small squirts.  At this rate, the product will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray has amodemthicone.  That&#x27;s a type of silicone, an amine-funcitonalized silicone.  The aqueous solution makes the amodemthicone an inorganic polymer that has electrostatic attraction to hair, coating it and having the effect of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this spray actually acts as a conditioner, locking in hair&#x27;s moisture.  It also detangles as a result of the conditioning.  Once dried, it is NOT water soluble.  That&#x27;s why it lasts through one or more washings.</li>
