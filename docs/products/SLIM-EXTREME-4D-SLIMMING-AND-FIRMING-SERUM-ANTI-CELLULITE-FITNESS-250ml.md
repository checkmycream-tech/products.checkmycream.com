    <li> This stuff is amazing! Combined with clean eating, it has done wonders! I am kicking myself in the rear for not taking before and after pictures. This cream smells nice, goes on easily and with twice daily application, I noticed results within 1 week! I&#x27;ve shed inches and my skin looks flawless! I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Really good product! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Started using this product and I have seen results I apply it before I start excrising and I apply my waist trimmer I do this 5 days a week and I have seen inchs come off my waist and water weight, It also tightens and tones. I will be definitely purchasing more of this product. Plus it was shipped in a timely manner very pleased.</li>
    <li> So I am on my second bottle of this stuff, both my wife and I use it, and we both like it quite a lot. To be fair, I started using this stuff about two months ago at the same time I also started a lot of supplements from Max Muscle and doing Crossfit. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a general slimming down and toning of my entire body, but can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s entirely caused by this. It&#x27;s absolutely got a correlation though. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helped keep my skin tight as I&#x27;ve lost about 20 pounds and don&#x27;t seem to have any issues with my belly area being stretched or otherwise flabby. I like the smell (some people were complaining) and I like the cool, tingling feeling when you apply it (again something others complained of). I plan to keep on using it for the time being and maybe someday when the budget isn&#x27;t so tight branch out and try their other creams to go with it. Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It helped me with my stomach hanging over my jeans and stretch marks from my 2 children. My stretch marks did not go away but they are not as big as they were. My husband did not know I was using this cream and he noticed the difference in the way I looked as well.So I will continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Seems to actually be helping!!! Will keep using combined with exercise. Price seems fair for product which is lasting longer than expected...Yay!</li>
    <li> it cause burn in my arm..this is my arm photo. I don&#x27;t recommend it.and nothing changed on my body.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it before woking out and it does what it says.  I see and feel a difference in two weeks.  If you are trying to tone and firm, thi is the best serum I have used on the market.  Use it on love handles and abs and I see a difference,  Will use again because it works!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I started using it about 2 months ago on my stomach and thighs and the results are truly amazing! I used to use the itworks defining gel which cost three times more and this product blows it out of the water. I will be using this product continuously. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I used this on my belly, wrapped myself in a waist trimmer, and worked out for 30 min. I sweat so hard on my abdomen I could feel the water running down my legs. My belly was visibly flatter and I cant wait to see how my tummy will look after a month of using it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Was very skeptical at first because i have tried many products,but i can see a big difference on my love handles and my thighs. Deff gonna continue purchasing. Use it twice a day. I use it with a waist cincher while working out. I also use it as soon as i get out the shower in the AM. Nice cool feeling. Love love love</li>
    <li> I recommend this product 100% if you want real results  in a short time, this is the ideal product 😊😊😊😊👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. I took before pictures to compare the &amp;#34;drastic&amp;#34; change I was expecting to see. I used it twice a day faithfully. To my disappointment, it was a waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> Just as described,  good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eveline products which I purchased on Amazon.  All their products I have used are superior compared to other Expensive products, which had so so results. I was using the 3d Contouring with nice results.  Now I am using this 4d slimming/contouring formula.  Wow!  I choose non thermal because I hate the heat feeling.  This new 4d product worked from the first day of use.  I use on my stomach/waist &amp; my loose skin is firming nicely.  I have scars from surgery &amp; post pregnancy stretch marks &amp; they seem less noticeable.  The upper thigh area below my butt &amp; my thighs are firming up even if I use once a day.  I use very little &amp; no noticeable odors, nor slimey feeling.  I definitely will stick with this product.  I highly recommend even though I don&#x27;t exercise I can tell you it IS WORKING FOR ME.  Thank you Eveline for making these USA products, with safe, quick results I am looking for &amp; receiving.  Superior results compared to anything else I have used over the years!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. :-(</li>
    <li> I am not seeing results yet.  I have been using this product for about 5 days now.  Maybe I am just too critical.  I am also using this with a workout regimen.</li>
    <li> This product works, but like the other reviewer said, you must also diet and excersize to loose weight.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference yet. It&#x27;s only been a week, but nothing g has changed and I&#x27;m increasing my workouts.</li>
    <li> So far, i am not impressed.  It does leave tongling sensation when applied.  Doesnt have a strong smell or anything but i apply twice a day, once before workout and i fail to notice changes others are reporting.  I will keep using until gone but i am not impressed</li>
    <li> So far so good. Noticing a difference and has very smooth skin!</li>
    <li> I feel the menthol feeling like bin gay, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change just yet. I&#x27;s been about a week now. I don&#x27;t know how soon you see changes.</li>
    <li> I use it with a sweatband and sleep in it. It&#x27;s better then any wrap or cream. It helps with the loose skin below my belly button from having kids it has help tighten the skin up.</li>
