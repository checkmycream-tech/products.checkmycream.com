      <li>I liked the Yes</li>
      <li>Nice feel, speedy shipping</li>
      <li>Much better than anything you can find in a fancy department store.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite image product</li>
      <li>Used for years, so much better than over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day, not every 5 minutes</li>
      <li>if I remembered to apply it every day, I&#x27;d never have chapped lips, but as it is, when I do use it, my lips are almost instantly better.</li>

      <li>Great product, immediate  results, very moisturizing,  ingredients are safe and beneficial.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m sure there are many</li>
      <li>I first used this at a spa and loved it.</li>
      <li>but my lips are very full already.</li>
      <li>I can easily apply this twice a day</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best lip treatment product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This product has been great to help lessen the fine lines on my upper lip.</li>
      <li>Works great for dry lips.  </li>
      <li>I count on reviews for everything I buy and when it&#x27;s special I want to share.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it during the day, but the evening application keeps my lips good throughout the next day.</li>
      <li>There is simply no other product better than this one!  </li>
      <li>This product also works great under any other lip color.</li>
      <li>It smooths the surface the lips and is super hydrating.</li>
      <li>I believe that  only precious metals and gem stones cost more per weight unit.  </li>
      <li>It smells very good and goes on thick.</li>
      <li>So, for its QUALITY, it certainly deserves 5 full stars.  </li>
      <li>it really just made them very smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>Nice subtle scent and flavor too :).</li>
      <li>First was given to me when I visited a spa</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s make them soft and smooth as well as hydrated and Bette</li>
      <li>I love the Image line of products but this is a total ripoff!</li>
      <li>No need to buy an unnatural lip plumper, this will naturally make your lips full (as full as your natural lip will go).</li>
      <li>Really smooths the lips, and cures chronic chapped lips.</li>
      <li>so I really put it to the test.  </li>
      <li>I can put it on in the morning then eat, drink, brush my teeth and it stays on and feels very hydrating.</li>
      <li>Not so much for the &#x27;lip</li>
      <li>it really decreases any lines around the lips and very moisturizing -</li>
      <li>I really like it while I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>had high hopes for this product-and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not thick</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say based on the suggested promise it enhances the volume of your lips with continued use, it smells</li>
      <li>Adds a bit of shine to natural lips while moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>They stay soft.</li>
      <li>For example I&#x27;m 28yrs old; however, my 52 yrs old mother uses this as well and her lips look rejuvenated.</li>
      <li>Regular lip gloss is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I was excited about Clinique because I like a few of there products</li>
      <li>It does not do anything spectacular or noticeably dramatic to my lips.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m convinced that it actually &amp;#34;enhances&amp;#34; lips</li>
<li> Nothing else stays on as long and penetrates the outer layers of your dry, chapped lips as well as Ormedic&#x27;s Image Skin Care Lip Enhancement Complex.  </li>
<li> My only wish is that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive &amp; came in larger quantities.</li>
<li> but they were still heavy.</li>
<li> DO NOT WORK AT ALL A WASTE OF TIME</li>
<li> This is an unbelievable find.</li>
<li> one small tube lasts forever.  </li>
<li> I usually put this on once in the morning and once at night before bed.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve bought dozens over the past year,</li>
<li> I know that&#x27;s hard to believe</li>
<li> I use it at night and put a thick coat and during the day I apply a thin coat, just for looks.</li>
<li> 65 and reclaiming your lips is tough business.</li>
<li> But ... can you say EXPENSIVE ?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it really decreases any lines around the lips and very moisturizing - I use it at night before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, speedy shipping</li>
    <li> The only lip balm I will buy. Much better than anything you can find in a fancy department store. I apply before I go to bed at night and if my lips are extra dry i apply throughout the day. But i am more than obsessed with this lip product.</li>
    <li> This product has been great to help lessen the fine lines on my upper lip.</li>
    <li> Great product, immediate  results, very moisturizing,  ingredients are safe and beneficial. I have researched many anti-aging lip balms and this one has the best ratings from users and skin specialists.</li>
    <li> I bought one and fell in love with this product, so I bought 4 more and put it in every bag. I just wish I had found it before the winter!</li>
    <li> BEST lip treatment ever.  Works great for dry lips.  Stays on and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I am a lip product guru. THIS is amazing stuff. I can put it on in the morning then eat, drink, brush my teeth and it stays on and feels very hydrating. I can easily apply this twice a day and that&#x27;s it! My lips felt better just after day one. This is a must have product. So happy I dicovered it!!!</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable find. I ordered several lip care products from Amazon, just to keep my lips from drying. I liked the Yes To products but they were still heavy. I haven&#x27;t found but three products and I&#x27;ve bought dozens over the past year, that weren&#x27;t in a stick or tube.  Now I&#x27;m sure there are many but I&#x27;m just reporting my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Clinique All about lips at the same time I ordered this product. I was excited about Clinique because I like a few of there products and I read good stuff. Image skin care beat the stuffing out of Clinique in this case.&lt;br /&gt;This product changes the look and feel of your lips immediately. I know that&#x27;s hard to believe and I never do when I read that but it&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s make them soft and smooth as well as hydrated and Bette looking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 65 and reclaiming your lips is tough business. I&#x27;m on a quest to do do and I&#x27;m doing it with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Try this and you won&#x27;t think of using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I am in any way affiliated with this product or company nor was I paid or asked to write a review. I count on reviews for everything I buy and when it&#x27;s special I want to share.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product.</li>
    <li> I have used plumpers before and I can tell you that this product does nothing! I love the Image line of products but this is a total ripoff!</li>
    <li> The best lip product out there.</li>
    <li> Color not an issue with this cosmetic.  Works great!  Use is twice a day for years.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite image product</li>
    <li> I first used this at a spa and loved it. I was very pleased to see it&#x27;s sold on Amazon for about 1/3 of the cost of the spa! I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I really like it while I&#x27;m wearing it. It does not do anything spectacular or noticeably dramatic to my lips. Just seems like just another lip gloss. It smells very good and goes on thick. If you have long hair you might be irritated if you are outside and the wind is blowing, because your hair will stick to your lips. It&#x27;s been a while since I bought it and still have it in my purse. I use it when I run across it, but other than that it&#x27;s not a product that I would buy again especially since it does not plump my lips at all. Regular lip gloss is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I used to get chapped, dry lips from time to time. I usually put this on once in the morning and once at night before bed. My never have dryness now. My lips look and feel great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! First was given to me when I visited a spa &amp; I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  My only wish is that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive &amp; came in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> This is a product that truly works. I use this to keep my lips hydrated, moist, and pump. I use it during the use of a facial mask, to keep my lips hydrated and I use it for daily use. This product also works great under any other lip color. I use it at night and put a thick coat and during the day I apply a thin coat, just for looks. No need to buy an unnatural lip plumper, this will naturally make your lips full (as full as your natural lip will go). For example I&#x27;m 28yrs old; however, my 52 yrs old mother uses this as well and her lips look rejuvenated. I swear by this product and if it was ever discontinue I would be at a great loss. I will never leave home with out it, yet unlike chap stick this product does not create a dependence. FYI, I have not been paid to post this, everything I said is base on my own person experience.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Really smooths the lips, and cures chronic chapped lips.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WORK AT ALL A WASTE OF TIME</li>
    <li> best lip balm i&#x27;ve ever used.  if I remembered to apply it every day, I&#x27;d never have chapped lips, but as it is, when I do use it, my lips are almost instantly better.</li>
    <li> The only positive thing I can say based on the suggested promise it enhances the volume of your lips with continued use, it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing changed in my lip volume-and for that price and all it did was taste good, there are plenty of OTC glosses that cost a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this product-and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, being honest.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It is not &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not thick but when it&#x27;s applied, it moisturizes your lips for hours! They stay soft. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m convinced that it actually &amp;#34;enhances&amp;#34; lips but my lips are very full already. Will be buying the product again.</li>
    <li> Used for years, so much better than over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day, not every 5 minutes</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Feels so good going on and works. I use it all day lon. It works</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best lip treatment product I have ever used. It smooths the surface the lips and is super hydrating.</li>
    <li> There is simply no other product better than this one!  Period.  Nothing else stays on as long and penetrates the outer layers of your dry, chapped lips as well as Ormedic&#x27;s Image Skin Care Lip Enhancement Complex.  So, for its QUALITY, it certainly deserves 5 full stars.  But ... can you say EXPENSIVE ?  $15 - $16 bucks for a quarter ounce !?  Outch!  That&#x27;s $64 dollars for one ounce.  I believe that  only precious metals and gem stones cost more per weight unit.  Ormedic should really shave a few dollars off the price.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product ! Not so much for the &#x27;lip plumping&#x27;...it really just made them very smooth and soft! Nice subtle scent and flavor too :). Also a really great price!</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips before I go to bed and it is till on and moisturizing when I wake up.  It is the best lip healing solution I have ever used and one small tube lasts forever.  We live in a climate that&#x27;s typically less than 15% humidity so I really put it to the test.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day, but the evening application keeps my lips good throughout the next day.</li>
    <li> Adds a bit of shine to natural lips while moisturizing.  Love it.</li>
