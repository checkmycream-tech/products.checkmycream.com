      <li>It quickly builds smooth, creamy lather which facilitates a great shave with DE razor of your choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using  the Omega Pure Badger (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFELY/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) for a couple of years and thought it was great.</li>
      <li>I do not know about the $100 and $200 brushes, but I do not see how they could be any better than this</li>
      <li>but more of a comment/observatiom:  </li>
      <li>He likes the look and the feel of both the handle and the bristles - but it seems that most reviews were written soon after receiving the brush.</li>
      <li>I still like it, but the feel of these silvertip badger hairs is leaps and bounds better.  </li>
      <li>and I could not be more pleased.</li>
      <li>It will cost more</li>
      <li>This brush works well with my Proraso shaving soap and feels as light as a warm breeze blowing across my face when I am applying the shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Been using this for over a year--makes shaving enjoyable every day.  </li>
      <li>I use it with a variety of quality shaving soaps and get great shaves, and the brushing action has a nice massaging effect as well.  </li>
      <li>I also love the metal grab handle which helps with your grip while shaving.  </li>
      <li>MAKES SHAVING ENJOYABLE.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>This product is just ok .</li>
      <li>and i still love it.  </li>
      <li>It is of better quality badger hair (silvertip), handle (wood) and accents (chrome) than anything we found at Art of Shaving.</li>
      <li>Considering the price of the brush, a nicer stand would have seemed more appropriate.</li>
      <li>Many comment on the smell-</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure you:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
      <li>this Shaving Brush is my favorite one of 4 I have.  </li>
      <li>Works as advertised, haven&#x27;t seen too many hairs come off of this.</li>
      <li>It holds a nice lather and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Unsure initially when I ordered this brush, but after just two shaves I AM IMPRESSED!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a head shaver &amp; have tried numerous methods &amp; products over the years &amp; this brush along with a good shaving soap delivers a great head &amp; face shave.</li>
      <li>After three month&#x27;s use of this brush, I am still pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I kept thinking that I needed a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it.  </li>
      <li>I heard that silvertip is better</li>
      <li>I am able to make a pretty good lather with the shave soap, would be even better if I had better water at my house.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t shed, holds water, blooms nicely, works up a good lather, and it&#x27;s very soft.   </li>
      <li>I thought after the first week&#x27;s losses, like a good varnish brush, this shaving brush would stop hemorrhaging.</li>
      <li>of the above have worked great together and each of them I give 5 out 5 stars on their own reviews.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush, its soft but hold its shape well &amp; builds a great lather.</li>
      <li>This is great, and so very soft on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an attractive shave brush, and I am fond of the heavy handle, which was not the case on my previous shave brush (a vulfix for the same price, but with a simple plastic handle). I have noticed that the silvertip is extremely soft and creates a thick lather with ease. A few stray hairs have fallen out, but it has been solid for the most part. The stand is very cheap in quality, and mine broke after falling off a four foot shelf.</li>
    <li> Fresh out of the box, this was the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. The heavyweight knot shows sturdiness, and the bristles paint your face like a Van Gogh piece of art. No doubt about it, best upgrade to my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This brush was good at first, although it lost a few hairs every time I used it for the first week or so. After that, it was great for several months. Then about a month ago, it began shedding hairs like crazy. There is nothing more annoying than having to pluck brush hairs off your face, off the razor, and have them wash down and clog up the drain. After a few weeks of this, I have taken the only step left: threw it out. And good riddance. Wish I could get my $70 bucks back though. Really a disgraceful ripoff.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day and I could not be more pleased. This brush works well with my Proraso shaving soap and feels as light as a warm breeze blowing across my face when I am applying the shaving soap. Now that&#x27;s soft.</li>
    <li> Silvertip Badger. That&#x27;s really all that needs to be said. I chose the natural wood look cuz it&#x27;s pretty old school.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant brush for use with shaving creams.  It quickly builds smooth, creamy lather which facilitates a great shave with DE razor of your choice. I reccomend this product if you are looking for a silvertip badger hair shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush the other day (not on Amazon). I found it at a local shave shop and was able to handle it in person. This brush has some nice weight to it. The plume of badger hair was soft, wide and the hairs where a bit longer than most of the other brushes I was looking at. This brush was right on par with the other high end brushes I was looking at, and for a fraction on the cost...especially for a silvertip! I&#x27;ve been shaving with an entry level brush for a couple years now and I always thought it was soft enough that I didn&#x27;t need a silvertip or anything of the sort. Boy was I wrong. It can be hard to tell the different between brushes until you actually apply it to your face with soap or cream. There was a huge difference in the feel and the quality of the shave. It felt like I was lathering my face with a cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say if I ever buy more brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t settle for anything less than a silvertip.</li>
    <li> After a few rinsings, the bristles started loosening up, and I am now getting a steady lather when I don&#x27;t whisk most of the water out of the brush.</li>
    <li> Buy a lot from Amazon, but was in a local knife shop and saw this. Talked to the owner and asked why all of his brushes but a couple were Parker. He said he only carried the one or two from the other brand because people ask for them but he likes to compare them. The other brand was twice the price and no better quality at all. I tried it. I&#x27;ve been using  the Omega Pure Badger (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFELY/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) for a couple of years and thought it was great. Until I splurged and bought this one. Wow, what a difference. The shop owner uses this brush himself. Knowing he could have any brush he wants, but chooses this one, told me it was good. Feeling it the first time told me it was great.  I&#x27;ve had it two months and only lost a hair or two the first time I used it. It is twice the size it was when I bought it. It holds heat well, and holds water well. It makes a fantastic lather with soap with very little effort and makes what looks like an edible dessert out of shaving cream with a little more effort than soap. I&#x27;ve seen reviews about an odor when it is first wet but I don&#x27;t recall that. All it smells like to me is my shaving soap.  I have to assume the reason this brush is half the cost of other silvertip brushes is due to being made in China.</li>
    <li> What a great brush and unbelievable value. First off..the knot is huge!! the brush didn&#x27;t have the traditional wet dog smell.  I like the stand that came with it. It is perfectly functional.  Not flimsy, not too ornate either. It does what it is supposed to do.  The weight of the brush was heavier than I though it would be..A nice surprise bonus.  I&#x27;ve not had a hair go stray on me yet.  I think what was extremely helpful ( and very much appreciated) was the followup email I got from Howie, the owner of Super Safety Razor with tips on caring for the brush.  I destroyed my old way too expensive ShaveMac brush by not properly caring for it.  Lesson learned.  Just like a well made razor, a well made brush will last for years if properly taken care of.  Thank you Howie for the tips!!!  You cannot go wrong with this brush if you are looking to get a really high quality silvertip badger brush (or if you were about to drop a pile of cash on an overpriced brush) at at great price.  Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent value.  Lost bristles for the first couple weeks (two or three bristles at a time). This stopped after being used regularly.  Creates a great lather, far surpassing my last brush, which was just a regular badger brush.</li>
    <li> great brush holds soap and water until you decide it&#x27;s time to attack that morning face with brush strokes of natures best</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year--makes shaving enjoyable every day.  I use it with a variety of quality shaving soaps and get great shaves, and the brushing action has a nice massaging effect as well.  Very minor bristle loss the first couple of months, but certainly nothing to complain about. I rinse it thoroughly and hang it inverted each day for drying--expect to get years of use from it.</li>
    <li> ** Update **   Before your read the review, i would like to note that the seller called me very soon after i left the initial review and worked diligently to replace my brush. The customer support i received speaks volumes to the company and in fact influenced me to buy another brush for my father. I received a replacement brush within 2 days of the discussion. The new brush did NOT smell and feels fantastic.     ** Original **   I&#x27;ve used an entry level badger brush before for 2 years from the \\&quot;Art of Shave\\&quot; and i loved it. They say your supposed to replace your brush every year so i finally decided to get a new one. I heard that silvertip is better so i opted to get this.    Pros  1) The quality of the hairs are very good. Its soft and feels great on my face.  2) After a month of use, the hairs are not coming out.  3) The weight of the brush is good. It feels solid in the hands.      There are 2 cons.  1) It smelled! Not sure why but the hair smells. I tried washing it with soap, but the smell doesn&#x27;t come out.  2) The holder that comes with the brush does not fit. The holder is supposed to hold up the brush upside down between the silver base and the wooden body, but it is just too short. The only way this holder works is if you put it so the grip is between the hair and the wooden body, though then the heaviness of the silver base makes it imbalanced.     In short the product does what it is supposed to do but smells a bit and comes with a worthless plastic flimsy holder.</li>
    <li> After three month&#x27;s use of this brush, I am still pleased with it.  I soak it in a scuttle mug with really hot water while I shower.  It swells up, softens, and holds shaving cream really well.  Feels great on the face, and looks great on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable value for a silver tip brush. This one is very high quality, as well. Hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles after months of regular use, is very soft, and holds a ton of water. I have used it with many creams and soaps, and it consistently performs well.</li>
    <li> Other than the fact that I wish I would have gotten a different handle, this brush is wonderful for the money.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Losing an insane amount of hair every time I use it 10 approx. They stick to my face or end up kinda clogging the sink. Other than that I like the design and colors. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and soft</li>
    <li> Great brush. Doesn&#x27;t shed, holds water, blooms nicely, works up a good lather, and it&#x27;s very soft.   Didn&#x27;t like it at first, smelled, clumped up. Which is typical of new brushes. Retailer got back with me right away and offered money back, exchange, etc. After a couple uses, I began to appreciate it. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Forms very good lather, works great. Great deal for the price. Holder is a plus, so the brush dries up nice.</li>
    <li> Holding up very well after two years.  Take good care of it and it will be an heirloom. No shedding ever!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, haven&#x27;t seen too many hairs come off of this. There are probably better brushes out there, but for what I paid I think its more than fair and a huge upgrade over the entry level badger stuff here on Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this brush, its soft but hold its shape well &amp; builds a great lather. I&#x27;m a head shaver &amp; have tried numerous methods &amp; products over the years &amp; this brush along with a good shaving soap delivers a great head &amp; face shave. It also appears to be holding up well with no loss of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush to all non-electric razor shavers.</li>
    <li> I kept thinking that I needed a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;The following brush was $60 in April 2014&lt;br /&gt;Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Black Handle)&lt;br /&gt;This brush that I am reviewing was $70 in April 2014&lt;br /&gt;This brush is  the Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Deluxe with Olive Wood Handle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have the $60 brush, there is NO NEED to upgrade to the Olive Wood handle brush.&lt;br /&gt;The difference is NOT WORTH the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let it be known that the Olive Wood Handle brush is a better brush and worth the extra $10 - $15.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are softer, thicker, and makes an excellent lather.&lt;br /&gt;The brush overall may be a quarter inch longer than the black handle one.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little bit smaller in the diameter direction thus there is less clanking when stirring or mixing the lather.&lt;br /&gt;And I like better the overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it and you only want to buy ONE BRUSH and you want to buy one brush and forget about brushes forever, then this is the one to get. I do not know about the $100 and $200 brushes, but I do not see how they could be any better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said the black handle brush is excellent also and $10 cheaper. But if you are only going to get one brush and forget about it, this Olive Wood Handle one is the brush to get.</li>
    <li> This is a great silver tip brush, especially considering the cost of other st brushes.  The Parker logo washed off within a week, so that&#x27;s a bit of a negative.  Many comment on the smell-it went away after a couple days worth of use with creams.  Lost a few bristles in the first week or two, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any new brush.  Now I lose maybe one a week.  The brush feels good in the hand and does a good job of creating lather.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> After reading time again the great shave you get using a brush, I bought this one, which would probably be considered middle-to-upper tier.  I had heard the silvertip badger is the best type of hair.  This being my first brush, I cant say how it relates to other bristle types.  However, I really like it, it feels pretty good on the skin, and makes applying cream that much easier.  And for me, because I shave my head also, it cuts applying time in half.  Now, I wouldnt go so far as to say you get a BETTER shave with this, or any, brush.  But what you do get is more even coverage of cream, so you are less likely to have missed spots.  After using this a few weeks, the shave feels about as close, despite claims that brushes \\&quot;lift the hair\\&quot;.  If it does, I cant really tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives?  Well the only one that really dissappointed me was the fact that the brush came detached from the handle after only a few weeks.  Now, this is probably not enough for me to return the item, as I can fairly easily fix it myself.  But it seems like they skimped on the quality/strength of the glue used. And not a complaint but more of a comment/observatiom:  the tip of the brush is BIG.  While still able to get where I need to without too much issue, it just seems a little too flared out for the average face.  Not really an issue.  Overall good product, with a fixable design flaw.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this shaving brush for my husband. He likes the look and the feel of both the handle and the bristles - but it seems that most reviews were written soon after receiving the brush. For the first month or so it works great, but after two months, the bristles are falling out at an astonishing rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website of the company has absolutely no contact information, and seems to be a company that doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that if you want a brush that will last a long time, do not purchase anything from Parker. If anyone from Parker keeps tabs on these reviews, I&#x27;d love to hear from you - a small bit of customer service goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My husdand was previously given a full silver badger brush, but left it in a hotel..  Despite a request for return, it was not recovered by the hotel.  He&#x27;s as happy wiith the replacement as the original.  After all, it&#x27;s the tip that counts.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. I have been using it for 2 weeks and it is great I have not lost bristles</li>
    <li> fantastic brush been using it for over a year. i do not feel like i will ever need another one as long as i take care of this one. barring accident or misuse/abuse this is the last brush you will ever need.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on the face, after using about 20 times maybe lost 3-4 hairs MAX. The handle feels very sturdy, just make sure after using to get all the water! Awesome would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok . My first bruch was less expensive and did the job just has good</li>
    <li> My first badger brush.  I&#x27;m hooked.    I&#x27;ve been using an inexpensive but sturdy boar brush for more than 7 years, and a couple of weeks ago it just started shedding bristles like crazy. After shopping around a couple of high-end shops in the mall and feeling for myself how much nicer badger bristles feel than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, I decided to compare prices on-line.  The High End Mall Store had an amazing Silvertip brush that felt like angel wings fluttering on my skin--and it cost $180.  After reading the reviews for the Silvertip brushes from Parker, I felt comfortable giving this one a try.  The Olivewood handle feels warm, has wonderful heft and gives great control.  After one week, the brush has dropped only two bristles, smells like my shaving soap instead of a wet badger, and has bloomed to twice its original size--giving my face great coverage.  It may not feel like angel wings on my face, but it&#x27;s close.  Maybe the tender caresses of really gentle, saintly nurses.  The kind you&#x27;d like to see again after you&#x27;ve been discharged and maybe bring them home to meet mom at Sunday dinner.  This brush feels great.    This brush holds so much water that the first time I used it, I had to start over because I forgot to shake it out before I tried to work up a lather. I ended up with broth.  On the re-do, a very modest amount of shaving cream worked up enough lather to make three passes across my face.  There was plenty left in the brush, too.  I have consistently for the past week gotten the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had using this brush.    The stand is dinky and tips over easily, but it was free with the brush so it&#x27;ll do until I convince my wife that I need a nicer brush &amp; razor stand to match our bathroom fixtures.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, nice lather and soft on your face.</li>
    <li> Initial performance great, but breaks down weeks after the return policy expires. I really liked the performance of this brush when I first received it. However, after just two months it has started shedding so much it is difficult to shave with all the brush hairs it leaves on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot return it because I am outside the 30 day return. Do not buy this brush as it will not last long enough to justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing... :-(</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for just under a year and have been using it a few times a week. I think its an excellent brush for the price. I think the wood handle gives an elegant look and the metal base adds some nice weight to the brush. The lettering did wipe off mine within a few days but I think it looks better with out the branding on the front personally.</li>
    <li> Looks and works good for 6 months, but has lot of shedding. You will need a new one in a year.</li>
    <li> Decided to upgrade from a Pure Badger brush to a Silvertip Badger brush and found this one on sale.Boy what a step up! There is no comparison in the way a silvertip brush feels on your face vs a pure badger brush.Heavenly soft. Nice full brush with a good weighty handle.After about a week of use the brush has \\&quot;bloomed\\&quot; and is about 50% larger than original size so some may feel it too large but i don&#x27;t mind it.Free stand is plastic, but hey, it&#x27;s free and does the job.</li>
    <li> Stepping up from a low quality cheap brush, even the cheapest badger hair brush, to this Parker is like trading in a 69 Beetle for a 2013 Porsche. I read some reviews that complain about losing hairs. I&#x27;ve had no such issues to date. Pair this with a high quality DE razor, shaving soap, and aftershave, and shaving will transform from a ritual chore to a luxuriation. Shave time may increase a bit, but well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I thought after the first week&#x27;s losses, like a good varnish brush, this shaving brush would stop hemorrhaging. It seems like it only got worse.  Gave up on it.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent.  I had a regular badger hair brush before and it was nice.  I still like it, but the feel of these silvertip badger hairs is leaps and bounds better.  You can&#x27;t describe how much nicer it feels when you brush the lather on your face with this brush.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my first silvertip so I can&#x27;t compare it to other silvertip brushes, however , it&#x27;s a Lamborgini compared to pure badger and boar brushes I&#x27;ve used.  The brush has a nice weight to it and whips up lather FAST.  If your looking for luxury without breaking the bank, look no further.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Brush for a little over a year now.  It works great.  I bought it along with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paperback version of \\&quot;Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving, Fourth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable\\&quot; by Michael Ham&lt;br /&gt;Paperback version of \\&quot;The Art of Manliness: Classic Skills and Manners for the Modern Man\\&quot; by Brett McKay, Kate McKay&lt;br /&gt;Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;100 Double Edge Razor Blade Sample Pack&lt;br /&gt;Deluxe Stainless Steel 4 Prong Safety Razor and Shave Brush Shave Stand&lt;br /&gt;Geo F. Trumper Violet Hard Shaving Soap in Wooden Bowl&lt;br /&gt;Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the above have worked great together and each of them I give 5 out 5 stars on their own reviews.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush.  I lost a few hairs when I used it the first time but it was nothing to get alarmed over.  I haven&#x27;t had any strange odors and it has held up very well.  I am able to make a pretty good lather with the shave soap, would be even better if I had better water at my house.  Since I do have very hard water I have started making lather in a bowl with some shaving cream and the shaving soap listed above.  The seems to help out quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I replaced a cheap entry levels starter brush with this one. That means I&#x27;m no expert since this is my second brush but I can also tell you the difference is noticeable. The quality of construction is apparent at once. Nice heft, perfect balance, and sturdy.  The bristles are secure and I only lost about three total in the first few uses, which I hear is not unusual even for nice brushes like this one. It holds a nice lather and goes on smoothly. I hesitate to give it five stars for only two reasons. It does not come with any manner of manual to give a rookie like me guidance on care (which is no big deal since it can be could online with a little searching) and the stand is cheaply made. No matter as I already bought a quality bowl/razor/brush stand elsewhere but none the less. The Parker logo on the handle has flaked off somewhat but nothing that bothers me really. Overall a quality product for the money. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is great, and so very soft on my face. It lathers well, holds water good, and blooms to about double size after about three uses. Unfortunately it has the lingering scent of wet animal even after 15 uses. I wish this could be rectified, but it is still a shaving brush. Oh and the base is actually metal. Has EXCELLENT heft. Stand is a little cheap and falls over easy, you will have to have it backed up against something (for me it was the back of the counter). Recommended. Highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Gets shaving soap to my beard with little effort.</li>
    <li> A great brush for the price. This brush looses a few too many hairs over time, but you can&#x27;t beat the price for a silver tip. The lost hairs are only an annoyance, the lather is great.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had a few pure grade and silvertip brushes, including my last used brush being a [[ASIN:B002ESYH5K Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Faux Petrified Wood Handle &amp; Free Brush Stand]].  But I must say, this brush is really special.  First off, I believe the wood is olive wood.  I also love the metal grab handle which helps with your grip while shaving.  This brush is much heavier than my previous Parker brush.  Although I haven&#x27;t ventured into Kent, Simpson, Vulfix, Rooney, or any of the other luxury shaving brushes, I imagine this must be comparable.  I&#x27;ve only used this brush on shaving cream and it whips up a nice fluffy concoction on your face in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough of the PROS, here comes the CON: I lost quiet a few hairs ever since I started shaving with this.  Seems like at fist I was losing 2-3 hairs a day.  Now I am losing a hair maybe once a week or every other week.  For the price, you may want to get into some of the other more reputable luxury brands I mentioned above.  It will cost more but you get what you pay for in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a GREAT TIP for you to take this brush with you while traveling.  Rather than buying a small, hard to lather travel brush, buy a Muhle Pinsel Round Shave Brush Travel Holder.  I didn&#x27;t include a link because at the time of writing this review it is no longer available on Amazon by the seller so search the web and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it.  I hate small travel brushes as you will need cartoon hands to lather with them.  I like the comforts of home while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving.</li>
    <li> Unsure initially when I ordered this brush, but after just two shaves I AM IMPRESSED!!! Well worth the $ and well made. Shaves followed breaking it in with 5 hand lathers, 5 bowl lathers and leaving it over night loaded with soap.</li>
    <li> Great brush but bristles have continued to fall out even a year later.</li>
    <li> I bought this for by boyfriend a couple months ago, overall, he loves it. He hasn&#x27;t had any of the lost bristles that some warned about and overall it&#x27;s a good, sturdy brush. The only reason for the 4/5 is because the stand pictured is not the actual stand that the brush came with. Considering the price of the brush, a nicer stand would have seemed more appropriate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new at the whole shaving brush/soap thing but i&#x27;m already getting closer shaves. This works very well, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush a year ago and i still love it.  It has lost maybe three hairs since then.  It makes a rich creamy lather when used with a good-quality cream or soap.  Only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because they sent me a brush with a cheap plastic handle, not the nice wood one in the picture.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVING BRUSH. BUILDS UP TONS OF LATHER. MAKES SHAVING ENJOYABLE. VERY SOFT ON MY FACE. I HAVNT NOTICED ANY BRISTLES THAT HAVE FALLEN OUT.</li>
    <li> First of all, an olivewood handle? YES PLEASE! That is the same wood that the Temple Doors were crafted out of! Bam! Hello Holy Shaving! The brush is huge and feels great! I hope this brush last 15 years, but if it only last two it was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily or over a year and it is still holding up.  Good purchas.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. No complaints and it looks very classy.</li>
    <li> At first I was mostly very satisfied with my purchase of this brush.  Aside from the &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; smell of the brush when it&#x27;s wet, I was getting a good lather and very smooth shave.  A month later, the bristles are starting to fall out, indicating a lack of quality of workmanship and/or materials used in the brush&#x27;s production.  It&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;m doing wrong.  I have years of experience with several different shaving brushes.  I&#x27;m still getting a decent shave, but if the bristles continue fall out at the current rate I suspect that would end in the not so distant future.</li>
    <li> It is a nice brush that I personally really like!  The bristles are so soft and it holds the perfect amount of water to make a very nice hot lather.  There few things that you should know is that since it&#x27;s wood and not metal it&#x27;s not quite as heavy as the parker chrome one.  I prefer the wood look so I like that but if you like a heavy weight then the metal one is bette.  Also, the parker logo that you see on the handle washed off.  I agin like the wood look so I was happy with this but you should be aware of it. Great brush!</li>
    <li> You have to take good care of it, but it is holding together well.  No badger brush will last if you abuse it.  Make sure you:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wash it off with cold water when you are done.  Glue weakens with heat.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Swing it dry.  Get as much water out of it as possible.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Hang it upside down to store it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do that every day, and I&#x27;ve only found one hair in my soap bowl.  You can&#x27;t get better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are soft and work up a good lather.</li>
    <li> It is a very good brush.  I have used it for the last two weeks, and it works great.  The handle is not however olive wood as described, but is rather well made overall.  Solid brush, but wish the description was more accurate.</li>
    <li> It loses more hairs than I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s a good performer. The heavy base gives it balance and feels good in the hand. It works shaving soap into a great lather. AND there was no offensive stench like some badger brushes have.  It has some funk--it&#x27;s a natural hair brush after all but that fades with a couple uses. Great beginner brush.</li>
    <li> Good but package may not perfect</li>
    <li> I love this Badger!!!  The quality of the badger fur is amazing...The wood handle is nice and heavy,feels and looks.  The metal knob at the bottom just adds to its coolness.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say is that the Badger fur has a wet animal odor to it.  I have been using this for about two weeks now and the odor seems to still be there faintly. Its not very pleasant especially when your going over your upper lip with it.  Hopefully over time it will go away.  Other than the odor this Shaving Brush is my favorite one of 4 I have.  And I paid more for the other 3.  I would have given this 5 stars and then some if it didnt have that odor.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is super soft, and has a great feel to it when you hold it and use it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t shed hairs like a lot of cheaper brushes. It fits well in my brush holder, and It works up a great lather. I highly reccomend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had bought my husband a fancy badger shaving brush from the Art of Shaving at our local shopping mall, and it was like $160 or $200. Due to the price, that was one of his bigger Christmas gifts for Dec 2012. Before he used it, however, I decided to check Amazon for comparison&#x27;s sake. I ended up finding this better quality, and much cheaper brush here! My husband has been using this brush for the last month and absolutely loves it! It is of better quality badger hair (silvertip), handle (wood) and accents (chrome) than anything we found at Art of Shaving. So save your money and skip the overpriced wares at the store, and go for this awesome product!</li>
