      <li>ironically it does not work as well on my nails which are normal thickness but to be able to cut my MOm&#x27;s nails at home when she needs it is worth its weight in gold.............</li>
      <li>On the positive side- the light, the grips, and the clippers themselves all worked well.</li>
      <li>the clippings stay in the holder nicely and you just empty them when its full.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Liked them so much I bought some for myself even though I&#x27;m not arthritic.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
      <li>I have only opened one and when I turned the light on the switch could not be turned off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to try the product and was very surpised how well it worked on her nails...........</li>
      <li>the magnifier lined up so you can see the nail you are cutting, but it&#x27;s very nice to have the light.</li>

      <li>For a number of years now I have to take my 94 year old Mother to the podiatrist to have her toenails cut.</li>
      <li>they were both broke as far as the catcher goes</li>
      <li>Person who received it was thrilled because he had broken his.  </li>
      <li>As far as catching the clippings you have to let gravity help you a little by holding the clippers a little below the fingers or toes.</li>
      <li>The handles are big and precise, so they have much less of a tendency to twist</li>
      <li>Although I must say, I was wonderfully surprised that it did actually capture the clipped nails, so less clean up.</li>
      <li>They are so thick that I could not cut them with any scissor or nail clipper and a podiatrist used a special surgical cutter and charged $120 each time he cut her nails.</li>
      <li>This is a great clipper for tough thick toe mails, especially for an elder person.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>This was so clumsy to try to use on my nice hard nails - both hands &amp; feet.</li>

    <li> This clipper works better than any that I have used before. I gave the extra one to a friend and they love it as well. The wide grips are my favorite feature; I no longer have to deal with thin metal clippers slipping.</li>
    <li> This is the finest Nail Clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are easy to use, and give an excellent nail clipping.  With the magnifying glass, and light you will be amazed at how clean and easy this clipper is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always order two, as the cost for an additional Clipper is only the shipping &amp; handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Clipping,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WNCWriter</li>
    <li> I like everything about these clippers. The handles are big and precise, so they have much less of a tendency to twist while clipping, which can easily tear your nails - very painful. The magnifying glass has a great LED light built in (with on/off switch), and I was delighted to discover that it&#x27;s removable. I use it by itself for all sorts of things now. It&#x27;s fantastic for checking for splinters, or seeing if you have something stuck in your eye, that sort of thing. There is even a compartment on the clippers that holds fingernail clippings, with a nifty little \\&quot;door\\&quot; for emptying the contents. I really appreciate the sturdiness of these babies. I&#x27;ll bet we&#x27;re going to have them for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I stupidly ordered this item over the phone,  Instead of sending me the one clipper I ordered, they send me&lt;br /&gt;2 plus some nail buffers.&lt;br /&gt; They charged me 6.98 shipping 3x, once for each of the 3 items. A total of almost 21.00 in shipping!&lt;br /&gt;(beware of those extra charges they tack on!)&lt;br /&gt;I could not get through to the company by phone to ask them to correct these charges it was busy whenever i called!&lt;br /&gt;So for the 14$ clipper I ordered, I ended up paying a total of 52$!&lt;br /&gt;I will not do business with Sure Clip again thats for sure!</li>
    <li> What a gimmick! If you are an able bodied, non athritic and not vision impaired, you have no need to purchase this item.  If you have small fingers, this item is not for you, you will find it very difficult to use and maneuver.  Although I must say, I was wonderfully surprised that it did actually capture the clipped nails, so less clean up.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first, but I just used them for the first time and I love it. The clippers seem high-grade and work well. The light and magnifying glass work well. You can get it at Bed Bath and Beyond. With a 20% coupon in the mail as always that brings the price to 8 bucks. My grandfather who had diabetes got a foot infection from cutting his toenails. This should help people with this sort of risk.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to gt the magnifier lined up so you can see the nail you are cutting, but it&#x27;s very nice to have the light. Iit shipped quickly and we&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
    <li> For a number of years now I have to take my 94 year old Mother to the podiatrist to have her toenails cut. They are so thick that I could not cut them with any scissor or nail clipper and a podiatrist used a special surgical cutter and charged $120 each time he cut her nails. (He told me I could find a similar cutter but had to be very careful so I was afraid to try it)&lt;br /&gt;After hearing an informercial on TV I decided to try the product and was very surpised how well it worked on her nails...........ironically it does not work as well on my nails which are normal thickness but to be able to cut my MOm&#x27;s nails at home when she needs it is worth its weight in gold.............the clippings stay in the holder nicely and you just empty them when its full. I don&#x27;t use the magnifier so I just move it aside and get to work................its easy to use.</li>
    <li> Big disappointment!  Clumsy, ineffective and not the strong sure clipper it is advertised to be.  I did as well with a low priced clipper from the drug store.  The magnifying glass did magnify, but it was in the way of the clipping operation, so could not be used</li>
    <li> Purchased for very thick and difficult-to-cut toenails.  They cut these nails with ease like a \\&quot;hot knife through butter\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use with the led light on the magnifying lens, plus the tidy storage of the clips. Well thought out &amp; well made.</li>
    <li> Cliping nails is easy now.  With the sure grip handles, brightly lit magnifier, and great quality nail clipper, this is the BEST nail clipper by far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some thing like this. the lite works fine and I can see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT ITEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg Rsendez</li>
    <li> I am a small, not over weight person. This was so clumsy to try to use on my nice hard nails - both hands &amp; feet. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 n they were both broke as far as the catcher goes n the lights didn&#x27; t work, but the clippers were great.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are fantastic!  I don&#x27;t know what the issues were with some people, and maybe I just got lucky, but these are great!  I love the magnification and the little light!  I even gave the others as gifts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for the last couple of years and just ordered this one to keep in my travel bag. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. The magnifier and the light work perfect for me. I have smaller thinner fingers than most and have no trouble with the nice big surface of the handle. As far as catching the clippings you have to let gravity help you a little by holding the clippers a little below the fingers or toes. If you hold the clippers above then of course the clippings are going to fall out. DUH!&lt;br /&gt;I can see where the larger size might be a little awkward  to get used to for some but it allows you to cut those big thick toe nails. I still use the traditional smaller TRIM type clippers to cut off those pieces of skin called hang-nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer.  Person who received it was thrilled because he had broken his.  He likes the box to collect the nail clippings.</li>
    <li> I have only opened one and when I turned the light on the switch could not be turned off.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Harry Nelson</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the magnifier to line up to see my toenails, which was the reason I bought the product in the first place. It needed to either be adjustable or moved back some to work for me. The nail catcher did not work at all. The file was also usless. On the positive side- the light, the grips, and the clippers themselves all worked well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s difficult to see all angle through from magnifying when use it to cut toenail.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper for tough thick toe mails, especially for an elder person.&lt;br /&gt;Got these for my Mother, which enabled her to continue clipping her nails herself.&lt;br /&gt;One caution - an elder, or anyone for that matter must stay aware of what their clipping.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers mouth opens 1/8\\&quot; as opposed to the 1/16\\&quot; of a regular size clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked them so much I bought some for myself even though I&#x27;m not arthritic.&lt;br /&gt;Use them often, love em&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DO make clipping tough nails a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;The lighted magnifier can be turned out of the way, or wiggled off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powered by two, easy access, (watch type) replaceable CR 1220 3v Lithium batteries,&lt;br /&gt;which lasted me about 3 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the handle there&#x27;s a very handy, built in stationary fingernail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use these for clipping our cats nails which makes that chore much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Happened to find these at a local drug store.</li>
    <li> easy to use, I got these to replace the one I had. and lost .</li>
