      <li>but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>but this is amazing!</li>
      <li>It looks good for days which is unusual!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product ever!</li>
      <li>makes the magic happen!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Used once and fell in love!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this mostly WITHOUT blow drying</li>
      <li>My husband told me that my hair looked shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>Most products leave my hair greasy looking</li>
      <li>I immediately purchased full bottle!</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s fine, it tangles easily.</li>
      <li>Nothing that comes in a cream can be put on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>how light it makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always looking to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so cheap</li>
      <li>My fine hair blows out non frizzy and looks full.  </li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got a sample of this first.  </li>
      <li>Blow Dry Creme smells great and smooths my hair out.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
      <li>Nice scent as well and no heavy buildup</li>
      <li>I received a sample tube in my IPSY bag and have been looking to purchase a full size tube since.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m going to be a loyal buyer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of dark magic is in this tube</li>
      <li>I guess you really should buy salon products from a salon!!</li>
      <li>My hair has a really nice finish and the next day it still looks shiny and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>So far it definitely seems like a miracle product lol.</li>
      <li>If I use a curling wand I can get away with only shampooing every 3 days which is a major win since I&#x27;m trying to keep my color from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only does this wonderful cream do what they say and make you hair feel good, look good and cut down on oil, but what they may have forgotten about is that it cuts dry time in half!</li>
      <li>and I love it just the same.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product when it came in my December</li>
      <li>I bought this at a local salon... not even sure why I picked it up.</li>
      <li>My hair looks fuller, thicker and does exactly what I want it to.  </li>
      <li>Nice blow dry aid, does not weigh my very fine hair down at all.</li>
      <li>Most dry shampoo makes my hair feel chalky</li>
      <li>Got it in my ipsy bag and I am looking forward to buying a large thing of this once I return from my vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes it so much simpler to fix my hair.</li>
      <li>But I did, and after a week, I&#x27;m really really liking it.</li>
      <li>I love that you apply while wet then blow drying</li>
      <li>but I had to finally spring for the full size version of this because it really, really works!</li>
      <li>I have long, straight, fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, my hair is fuller, shinier and fluffy!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets frizzy, this didn&#x27;t hold my blow dry at all and made my hair even frissyer!</li>
      <li>I have had so many countless and expensive hair products that look great, when put on my hair by the stylist, but never gives the same result when I apply it.</li>
      <li>3/4ths the way down my back and need a dime size or a little more to do its magic.</li>
      <li>This is actually the first product I have repurchased from an Ipsy shipment</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, flat hair that has never held a curl(it would be fine in an hour).</li>
      <li>It did not work the same, I&#x27;m wondering if this is even the real product??</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat hidden beneath my more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, but you can see it when I wear my hair down.  </li>
      <li>I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s fine and gets oily after skipping a day of washing</li>
      <li>Anything that can cut dry time in half and not leave you oily is worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>hair feels amazing, and my curl doesnt go crazy when I blow dry my hair straight.</li>
      <li>Speeds up dry time and no heavy residue!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry every day, but when I do blow dry with this product I can really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I tried it several times just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t something I did, same bad result.</li>
<li> I have been having trouble with thinning hair and this product perks it up and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
<li> so I wait to use it as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have longish straight hair that isn&#x27;t as thick and luxurious as I would like.</li>
<li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other oils and creams and this one is definitely a keeper for me!</li>
<li> This creme holds my curls and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry.  </li>
<li> This product, while expensive, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, but what I LOVE, is that it keeps the oil away</li>
<li> All-Style Blow Dry Creme does it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My hair seemed fuller after blow dry.</li>
<li> (just past shoulder length) when I blow dry and it majorly cuts down on the frizz.</li>
<li> is long lasting even with my thick locks.</li>
<li> I received this from Ipsy like the other reviewers.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever spent $30 on hair cream before, but I won&#x27;t ever let myself run out of this stuff!</li>
<li> I can now shower, wash, run a little of this through my hair, blow dry and curl and it will stay ALL WEEK.</li>
<li> My hair is extremely oily, I wash it in the morning, I look like a greaseball at 2pm!</li>
<li> When I use this stuff and ONLY when I use this stuff, I have a seriously &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I got a sample in my Ipsy bag a few months ago</li>
<li> so I no longer need to wash my hair everyday.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not easy to style.</li>
<li> Ridiculously expensive</li>
<li> This is the worst hair product I have ever tried!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Makes my hair extremely flat and greasy looking.  I didn&#x27;t use a lot of the product.  I&#x27;ll be washing my hair again immediately.  I&#x27;m glad I got a sample of this first.  Another product sold on lies.  Nothing that comes in a cream can be put on fine hair.  Not unless &amp;#34;I just fried bacon in my hair&amp;#34; is the look you&#x27;re going for. Boo!</li>
    <li> Got it in my ipsy bag and I am looking forward to buying a large thing of this once I return from my vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels amazing, and my curl doesnt go crazy when I blow dry my hair straight. It looks good for days which is unusual!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS! BUY IT NOW! I have hair 3/4ths the way down my back and need a dime size or a little more to do its magic. In heaven.</li>
    <li> Most products leave my hair greasy looking but this is amazing! Speeds up dry time and no heavy residue! Expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> This creme holds my curls and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, flat hair that has never held a curl(it would be fine in an hour). I can now shower, wash, run a little of this through my hair, blow dry and curl and it will stay ALL WEEK. That&#x27;s not a joke. $30 on hair cream? YES. The best $30 you will spend this month. Do it.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. It absorbs excess oil to make your shampoos last longer. Nice scent as well and no heavy buildup</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> It makes it so much simpler to fix my hair. It only takes a little, put it in while damp, and my hair is much smoother after I dry it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever tried! I have fine hair that gets frizzy, this didn&#x27;t hold my blow dry at all and made my hair even frissyer! It looked like a crows nest the next day... I tried it several times just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t something I did, same bad result.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of dark magic is in this tube but it works. I got a sample in my Ipsy bag a few months ago and I can&#x27;t explain the results. I have fine, wavy hair and it&#x27;s not easy to style. When I use this stuff and ONLY when I use this stuff, I have a seriously &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m so cheap but I had to finally spring for the full size version of this because it really, really works! My hair looks fuller, thicker and does exactly what I want it to.  This is actually the first product I have repurchased from an Ipsy shipment and I&#x27;m going to be a loyal buyer.</li>
    <li> keeps the frizz away as well as maintain softness and volume!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample tube in my IPSY bag and have been looking to purchase a full size tube since.  The product aids your hair in staying fresher longer.  Builds volume and hold is long lasting even with my thick locks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been having trouble with thinning hair and this product perks it up and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I like the fullness I get and how light it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local salon... not even sure why I picked it up. But I did, and after a week, I&#x27;m really really liking it. I have long, straight, fine hair, but a lot of it. Because it&#x27;s fine, it tangles easily. I have been using this mostly WITHOUT blow drying and I love it just the same. My hair is shiny for days after, and sleek - yet not greasy. So far it definitely seems like a miracle product lol.</li>
    <li> It did not work the same, I&#x27;m wondering if this is even the real product?? I guess you really should buy salon products from a salon!!</li>
    <li> I received this from Ipsy like the other reviewers. Not only does this wonderful cream do what they say and make you hair feel good, look good and cut down on oil, but what they may have forgotten about is that it cuts dry time in half! I immediately purchased it just for that reason. Anything that can cut dry time in half and not leave you oily is worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Received a sample in the mail from Ipsy. Used once and fell in love! My hair seemed fuller after blow dry. I immediately purchased full bottle!</li>
    <li> I just received a sample of this in my ipsy bag, used it this morning and as soon as I got to my office I was searching for it to get a big bottle. My hair is extremely oily, I wash it in the morning, I look like a greaseball at 2pm! This product is amazing, my hair is fuller, shinier and fluffy! Buy buy buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product ever! I have longish straight hair that isn&#x27;t as thick and luxurious as I would like. Bumble and Bumbles product builds body and smoothes the texture of my hair. My husband told me that my hair looked shiny and healthy. I love that you apply while wet then blow drying makes the magic happen!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I have fine thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product! I love it!</li>
    <li> Like others have said, I don&#x27;t know what the heck they put in this tube but it&#x27;s great. Ridiculously expensive and I hide it from my kids to make it last longer.  My fine hair blows out non frizzy and looks full.  It also keeps my sprouting gray hairs under control!</li>
    <li> I have a layer of frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s somewhat hidden beneath my more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, but you can see it when I wear my hair down.  I don&#x27;t like it and I&#x27;m always looking to smooth it out.  All-Style Blow Dry Creme does it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Blow Dry Creme smells great and smooths my hair out.  All day.  I don&#x27;t blow dry every day, but when I do blow dry with this product I can really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other oils and creams and this one is definitely a keeper for me!</li>
    <li> I have had so many countless and expensive hair products that look great, when put on my hair by the stylist, but never gives the same result when I apply it.

    <li> I first tried this product when it came in my December Ipsy bag. I noticed a difference right away! I have thick hair, but it&#x27;s fine and gets oily after skipping a day of washing so I do anything I can to extend my shampoos. Most dry shampoo makes my hair feel chalky so I wait to use it as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a nickel size of this for my hair (just past shoulder length) when I blow dry and it majorly cuts down on the frizz. My hair has a really nice finish and the next day it still looks shiny and isn&#x27;t greasy. If I use a curling wand I can get away with only shampooing every 3 days which is a major win since I&#x27;m trying to keep my color from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend this product enough. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever spent $30 on hair cream before, but I won&#x27;t ever let myself run out of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice blow dry aid, does not weigh my very fine hair down at all. Just wish is was a bit cheaper.</li>
