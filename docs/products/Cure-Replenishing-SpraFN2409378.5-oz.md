      <li>, I have the ombre color with a very light blonde</li>
      <li>I first started using this after my hairdresser used it on me.  </li>
      <li>I always worry about authenticity of product, but I&#x27;m surd this one is authentic from icon because it is exactly the same quality and everything as the ones I got before from the icon site.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend that product for everybody!!</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but other than that, I&#x27;m at a loss.</li>
      <li>fast deliver only wish it was free shipping!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past before and have always loved it</li>
      <li>Being a licensed professional I have come across many leave in conditioners, I am not only a product freak and love to try everything, but I also only recommend what works.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for some time now and really like what it does for my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly appreciated that</li>
      <li>if you have curly hair and want it straight, this will work very well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found that this spray is particularly &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; or that it really does a whole lot of anything.</li>
      <li>just clean, natural, shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>After reading rave reviews and having this recommended to me, I had really high hopes.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>(I live in the Caribbean and you have to get the right daily product if you dont want to damage your hair).</li>
      <li>and they are in the process of sending it back to my current address  for free..</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and tons of it and still it manages to not weigh my hair down</li>
      <li>However, the product dispenser did not work from the first time, which means every time I use it I must open the bottle to take product out.</li>
      <li>Although I use rinse out conditioner on my fine and fragile hair, I follow with this leave-in conditioner, both while my hair is damp and when it is fully dry.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and it is hard to find.  </li>
      <li>It makes hair soft and manageable, not oily.</li>
      <li>It makes my waves soft and hair youthful looking.</li>
      <li>It only takes a couple of spritzs of this conditioner in your wet hair, comb out and dry as usual to leave it nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Humidity gives me very big hair, but this product sure helps tame it.  </li>
      <li>Ordering from here is about half the price of other sights:)</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this stuff, I don&#x27;t usually buy hair care off of here, I do feel proffesional products sold in places other than salons Should not always be trusted, Stores that sell proffesional products do not get them legally as they are only sold to salons,</li>
      <li>I do have a bottle from my salon but at a much steeper price, so I bought one off here as well for over half off what I paid in a salon</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re suffering from dry or damaged hair this would be your secret potion of magic.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  This keeps my hair very healthy and silky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve beem using ICON products about 1 year and 1/2 and its been a miracle to my hair since I go daily to the gym and wash it almost every day (I live in the Caribbean and you have to get the right daily product if you dont want to damage your hair). I used to have a lot of freeze before but not anymore. And this leave in is exraordinary... hidrates but doesn&#x27;t get your hsir feeling oily... just clean, natural, shinny and soft. Recommended! Fast and secure shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> if you have curly hair and want it straight, this will work very well. I&#x27;m just afraid it makes my face break-out with pimples</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6years.  Nothing works as well.  I use it as a next day refresher and at the end of my styling process when it is starting to dry. It is great for the keeping the frizz down, conditioning and allows for nice natural looking ringlets. I get complements on my hair all the time.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing and smells divine, my hair loves it. However, the product dispenser did not work from the first time, which means every time I use it I must open the bottle to take product out. It is a hassle and that&#x27;s why I took a star away, packaging should be reviewed by the company to improve the experience. Aside from that, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It only takes a couple of spritzs of this conditioner in your wet hair, comb out and dry as usual to leave it nice and smooth.  Humidity gives me very big hair, but this product sure helps tame it.  Great for going through those tangles when hair is wet!</li>
    <li> Clogs up and I have to toss some.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff, I don&#x27;t usually buy hair care off of here, I do feel proffesional products sold in places other than salons Should not always be trusted, Stores that sell proffesional products do not get them legally as they are only sold to salons, this stuff though I had to go for it I do have a bottle from my salon but at a much steeper price, so I bought one off here as well for over half off what I paid in a salon, I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> The spray bottle is easy to use and the product does an incredible job of detangling and moisturizing my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past before and have always loved it but it was too expensive to buy regularly.  Now thag its been on the markey so long and there&#x27;s a lot of competition with new advanced products, this is cheaper in cost and I&#x27;m happy! Product delivers the softest, nicest hair. I use it on my 4 year old ocassionally and her curls just get so nice and soft. It makes my waves soft and hair youthful looking. I love it. I always worry about authenticity of product, but I&#x27;m surd this one is authentic from icon because it is exactly the same quality and everything as the ones I got before from the icon site.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time now and really like what it does for my hair. My hair is highlighted heavily with very pale blonde and gets dry. This product helps to put the moisture back in my hair. Also, I found it to be much more reasonable at Amazon cost wise.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend.  She loves it and I was glad to find it on Amazon for a lower price than most sites.</li>
    <li> I first started using this after my hairdresser used it on me.  It&#x27;s simply amazing and a bit cheaper here on Amazon too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair smelling awesome and feeling oh-so-soft, no greasy residue or flaky leftovers.</li>
    <li> Product! I started using this about 8 years ago, when my hair started thinning and breaking off from menopause now I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t live without it! Ordering from here is about half the price of other sights:) fast deliver only wish it was free shipping!</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews and having this recommended to me, I had really high hopes. I haven&#x27;t found that this spray is particularly &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; or that it really does a whole lot of anything. It smells nice, but other than that, I&#x27;m at a loss. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel healthier or stronger.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Although I use rinse out conditioner on my fine and fragile hair, I follow with this leave-in conditioner, both while my hair is damp and when it is fully dry.  A spritz or two does wonders in nourishing my hair and calming frizzes.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it is hard to find.  What a great price!!!</li>
    <li> the product is a miracle for your hair it totally changes your hair!!!the service is really nice.. i gave them a wrong address and they are in the process of sending it back to my current address  for free..so guys really bravo for that!! I highly appreciated that and I highly recommend that product for everybody!! it&#x27;s just amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Is just perfect, my hair is curly and a bit dry, I started use the I.C.O.N line for an acquaintance and the results are wonderful, this leave control the frizz of my hair, still curly but most beautiful, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so helpful for long hair that is dry and needs combing</li>
    <li> awesome product; it keeps my curly hair soft all day long</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product. Hard to find when I changed hairdresser.  Will recommend to others. It makes hair soft and manageable, not oily.</li>
    <li> The best leave in treatment on the planet!</li>
    <li> Being a licensed professional I have come across many leave in conditioners, I am not only a product freak and love to try everything, but I also only recommend what works. I have used some of the best brands in the market and still there is no comparison to what this truly does. I have fine hair and tons of it and still it manages to not weigh my hair down, I have the ombre color with a very light blonde and I still manage to repair my hair in about a week of just using this when I get out of hand with the bleach and with all of the color changing. If you&#x27;re suffering from dry or damaged hair this would be your secret potion of magic.</li>
