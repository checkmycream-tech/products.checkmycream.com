### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect if you want to mix polishes.</li>
      <li>The thickness of the bottles is great.  </li>
      <li>These were perfect for making the glue mixture to put around your nails to help clean up  nail polish mistakes!</li>
      <li>These are good for the price.  </li>
      <li>Good, comes with the mixing bead inside</li>
      <li>but besides that love them!</li>
      <li>I sometimes like to mix my own color nail lacquer and these bottles come in</li>
      <li>Perfect size I only need 1 but 2 extra is great.</li>
      <li>The bottles seemed fine</li>
      <li>Essential for mixing your own nail polish colors.  </li>
      <li>just right for the purpose.  </li>
      <li>Then you can clean it again and pop it right back into the original bottle without changing the color of the original polish.  </li>
      <li>They are small but great.</li>
      <li>The brushes are nice and long so they reach the bottom of the bottles.  </li>
      <li>Everything I expected nice size also.</li>
      <li>Bottles are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>At first I was worried about it.</li>
      <li>These bottles are excellent for mixing, especially with the little steel ball in it that tells you that you&#x27;re mixing the polish, but steer clear of using the brush because it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and intact.  </li>
      <li>What I suggest is that after you&#x27;ve mixed your desired color, take the brush of the original nail polish, clean it off with a nail polish remover, and use it to apply the mixed nail polish.  </li>
      <li>One of the bottles does not have the brush attached to the lid, but other than that they are fine.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that the brushes are way to thin, too sparse, for a really good polishing job in my experience.  </li>
      <li>Glass bottles were fine, however the brushes were VERY stiff and didn&#x27;t coat evenly.</li>

    <li> I sometimes like to mix my own color nail lacquer and these bottles come in just right for the purpose.  The only problem is that the brushes are way to thin, too sparse, for a really good polishing job in my experience.  What I suggest is that after you&#x27;ve mixed your desired color, take the brush of the original nail polish, clean it off with a nail polish remover, and use it to apply the mixed nail polish.  Then you can clean it again and pop it right back into the original bottle without changing the color of the original polish.  These bottles are excellent for mixing, especially with the little steel ball in it that tells you that you&#x27;re mixing the polish, but steer clear of using the brush because it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Good, comes with the mixing bead inside</li>
    <li> Bought these to store cuticle oil. The bottles are fine for the purpose but the brushes are the worst! It&#x27;s hard, too stiff, bends in all directions which is totally useless. It&#x27;s like they used a cheapest type of plastic like straw plastic for brush.</li>
    <li> Glass bottles were fine, however the brushes were VERY stiff and didn&#x27;t coat evenly. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you want to mix polishes. Arrived fast and intact.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected nice size also.</li>
    <li> The thickness of the bottles is great.  They are small but great. They also come with a metal marble inside if you need one otherwise you can remove it.</li>
    <li> Bottles are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> At first I was worried about it. .. you know maybe they break but they arrived intact and on time.</li>
    <li> Essential for mixing your own nail polish colors.  The brushes are nice and long so they reach the bottom of the bottles.  A mixing bead is in each bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottles seemed fine but they didn&#x27;t come with any mixing balls which pretty much makes them useless.</li>
    <li> These are good for the price.  The brush is a bit stiff but I&#x27;m using for cuticle oil so it works for me.  It came with a mixing bead in each bottle.</li>
    <li> I need a empty bottle for olive oil to use on my nails. I hate soaking my nails in a bowl. Perfect size I only need 1 but 2 extra is great.</li>
    <li> I just got these to day it was a pack of 3 I only got 2 and they didn&#x27;t come with mixing balls like it said</li>
    <li> 1 of the 3 came broken but besides that love them!</li>
    <li> One of the bottles does not have the brush attached to the lid, but other than that they are fine.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles were broken when I rec&#x27;d the box</li>
    <li> Ordered 12 bottles. Half were broken and there were no mixing balls included.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for making the glue mixture to put around your nails to help clean up  nail polish mistakes!</li>
