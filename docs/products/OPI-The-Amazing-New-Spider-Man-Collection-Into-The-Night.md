<li> so my polish does not last that long on my hands-usually 2 weeks.</li>
<li> I tend to like blue polishes so ordered this color (in addition to several other colors in this collection).  </li>
<li> , the ball bearings were VERY loose when shaking up the polish compared to numerous bottles of polish I&#x27;ve used by this brand and others.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed because I thought that it would be a beautiful color.</li>
<li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition.  </li>
<li> , I&#x27;ve been using polish for 20+ some odd years and can tell that this polish was thinned out with nail polish thinner</li>
<li> The polish looks a little darker than in the picture, but you should usually expect that when buying nail polish online.</li>
<li> NOT HAPPY 1 stars for timely delivery.</li>
<li> Amazon sent me the wrong nail polish.</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a pedicure using this color and have received so many compliments. It&#x27;s a cross between purple and blue. I bought bottles for my 2 best friends as they also fell in love with the color.</li>
    <li> Love the color but I have to knock off a star because it takes four coats to achieve.</li>
    <li> The nail polish was wrapped in bubble wrap which protected it really well.  The box was the right size for the item, so it didn&#x27;t roll around in transport.  AND, best of all, I received the polish in almost the blink of an eye!  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller, and it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
    <li> Per the picture, I was expecting a dark, bold blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats left it looking purple/blue! I don&#x27;t want to have to do four coats on every nail to get this color.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the nail polish I just bought. My purchase came two days after I placed the order (way earlier then Amazon&#x27;s delivery estimate). The polish looks a little darker than in the picture, but you should usually expect that when buying nail polish online. Overall, I love it!</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t worn this color yet, it looks very vibrant in the bottle and seems like a color that will look good on.</li>
    <li> Favorite color. Nowhere to be found. Thanks</li>
    <li> This polish will deceive you at first.  It is very fluid so you may think it is not the color pictured.  You will need 2 to 3 coats and then you will have the color pictured.  It goes on very nicely as OPI brand is a great brand.  I love blue color polish and this has become my favorite way above any others I have tried.  (and that is a lot!)</li>
    <li> I tend to like blue polishes so ordered this color (in addition to several other colors in this collection).  I haven&#x27;t tried it with more than 2 coats, but with 2 coats it seems to be a blue/purple to me, which I really like.  I think a 3rd coat might darken it up to a color similar to one pictured. OPI is my favorite polish and this one did not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Fun color, had it put on while in for a manicure. Loved it so much i purchased my Own....Great product, fast deliver, which i love</li>
    <li> I order this because I liked the color, it came at a reasonable time but when I opened it was not the color I ordered I water the blue color in the photo it came as a purple color! NOT HAPPY 1 stars for timely delivery. I want  the color I ordered....</li>
    <li> No problems.  Great color.  The color is a year around color that is absolutely beautiful.  I have received many compliments on the color.</li>
    <li> This color is GORGEOUS! It varies between a blue, purple, and pewter giving it a unique soectrum. Still pictures do not do it justice.</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty color but not as dark as the bottle. OPI polish is really great and lasts a long time. Use a good base coat and top coat and the polish can last 4 weeks on the toes. I was dishes by hand so my polish does not last that long on my hands-usually 2 weeks. I wanted to attach a picture but there was no link.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this nail polish. It&#x27;s super creamy, opaque with 2 coats, and the color is just gorgeous. If you&#x27;re looking into getting just one color from the Spider Man Collection, definitely get Into The Night. I love it and I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Like always, great quality nail polish and color is great too.</li>
    <li> The color was so vibrant on-line and in person not at ALL!!!, I&#x27;ve been using polish for 20+ some odd years and can tell that this polish was thinned out with nail polish thinner, the ball bearings were VERY loose when shaking up the polish compared to numerous bottles of polish I&#x27;ve used by this brand and others.  I began to polish one nail and it was extremely watery, I would have to put more than 5 to 6 coats for it to look anywhere remotely close to what I saw and thougt it would be.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really a great cool blue purple.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition.  Get it while you can.  My new fave :-)</li>
    <li> fabulous color!!  love it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazon sent me the wrong nail polish. I was very disappointed because I thought that it would be a beautiful color.</li>
