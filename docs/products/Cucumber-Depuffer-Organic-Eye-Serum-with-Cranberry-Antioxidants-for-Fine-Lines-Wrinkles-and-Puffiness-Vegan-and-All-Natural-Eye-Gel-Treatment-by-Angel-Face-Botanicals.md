      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>smell is refreshing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Bought many bottles.</li>
      <li>Love Angel Face products.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your results!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year and it is the best thing at combating my eye puffiness in the last 17 years.</li>
      <li>no animal cruelty, no horrible ingredients.</li>
      <li>smell is fine to me because I like cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product,  but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything but leave a whitish, shiny residue under my eyes that I have to wipe off.  </li>
      <li>I keep mine in the refrigerator so that it is soothingly cool when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>the scent is fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>I love them and they are so gentle and so effective and so cheap compared to other cosmetic lines...  </li>
      <li>(I have the most sensitive eyes and 99 percent of eye creams/products make my eyes water and sting and even affect them for days!  </li>
      <li>have finished my first bottle, but I am reordering it now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it, and totally works.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your eye area all greasy, and it absorbs pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I certainly won&#x27;t repurchase or recommend, unless you don&#x27;t have a sense of smell.</li>
      <li>This was my &amp;#34;gateway&amp;#34; product to the whole Angelface line which I -and now my friends - adore.</li>
      <li>Did not notice much difference</li>
      <li>I like using natural products, so this is why I bought this in the first</li>
      <li>It is thick enough for serum and feels great.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use your ring finger and apply in a circular pattern clockwise (on the entire orb of your left eye) and the opposite on the right.  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t helped smooth down any wrinkles, either.</li>
      <li>As a general moisturizer, it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t put make-up over top of the crud that it leaves behind.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I expected anything radical since most eye creams make ridiculous claims that can never be achieved.</li>

<li> It shows less dark circle and less puff around my eyes after using it.</li>

<li> who would not enjoy that?  </li>
<li> I have purchased a few items from Angel Face</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t really know if the product works or not since the smell was so bad, I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I will not order again.  </li>

<li> those ugly bags!...</li>

    <li> Did not notice much difference</li>
    <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I look forward to using at night not only because it works but it&#x27;s cooling and relaxing - now who would not enjoy that?  Be sure to use your ring finger and apply in a circular pattern clockwise (on the entire orb of your left eye) and the opposite on the right.  Guess what? You are giving yourself an accupressure lymphatic massage.  Facial acupressure takes advantage of allowing additional blood and oxygen to flow to these areas.  Enjoy your results!</li>
    <li> It worked for me. I kept mine in the fridge and I loved it. It did not irritate my eyes. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have puff eyes. It shows less dark circle and less puff around my eyes after using it. Love Angel Face products.</li>
    <li> It leaves a white crusty ring where applied around the eyes, I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it is the best thing at combating my eye puffiness in the last 17 years. This was my &amp;#34;gateway&amp;#34; product to the whole Angelface line which I -and now my friends - adore.</li>
    <li> Great price for this wonderful product.  It is thick enough for serum and feels great.  I don&#x27;t know if see any difference but It makes me feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Massage this into the under eye and reduce the puffiness noticeably. I will continue to use this regularly....and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Love it, and totally works. Bought many bottles.</li>
    <li> This is one of those times I read other folks reviews and tried some products.  I love them and they are so gentle and so effective and so cheap compared to other cosmetic lines...  (I have the most sensitive eyes and 99 percent of eye creams/products make my eyes water and sting and even affect them for days!  These do not!)&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying and trying all of the products in the Angel Face Botanicals line!</li>
    <li> does work but you can&#x27;t put anything on over it.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!  I don&#x27;t understand what the 1 star reviewer had a problem with....the scent is fresh and clean smelling.  The product does what it claims...it de-puffs those ugly bags!...I keep mine in the refrigerator so that it is soothingly cool when I put it on.  I would definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> These products feel good, smell good, and are good....no animal cruelty, no horrible ingredients. I joyfully continue to add to my collection of this line!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if the product works or not since the smell was so bad, I can&#x27;t use it.  I certainly won&#x27;t repurchase or recommend, unless you don&#x27;t have a sense of smell.</li>
    <li> great to use for an afternoon pick me up after reading from the computer all day</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few items from Angel Face and I&#x27;m extremely happy with every one.  I recommend their products because they are gentle and feel wonderful on my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while now hoping for results. I always have bags, puffy eyes, and dark circles. Still have them. Hoped to eliminate one with this product, but I still have puffiness.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product,  but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything but leave a whitish, shiny residue under my eyes that I have to wipe off.  I just don&#x27;t understand some of the other reviews.  You can&#x27;t put make-up over top of the crud that it leaves behind. And how well can it work when I have to wipe it back off?</li>
    <li> I love this product !!!</li>
    <li> This eye moisturizer has a pleasant cucumber scent and is very easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t leave your eye area all greasy, and it absorbs pretty fast. As a general moisturizer, it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve noticed zero improvement in eye puffing following application. It hasn&#x27;t helped smooth down any wrinkles, either. I can&#x27;t say that I expected anything radical since most eye creams make ridiculous claims that can never be achieved. However, I was hoping for some improvement in terms of de-puffing (since cold cucumbers always seem to help) but I was sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking for a fast-absorbing moisturizer, this might be a nice product to use. But if you are hoping to de-bag in the morning, this might not produce the results you are hoping for.</li>
    <li> I like using natural products, so this is why I bought this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it every evening after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;That way, it has time to absorb into the skin and I can peel off the white stuff that sometimes forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and you can feel the skin tightening after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells of cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine to me because I like cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is refreshing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finished my first bottle, but I am reordering it now.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I like this product and it works for me.</li>
    <li> The product did not work as well as I thought it would.  Unfortunately, I will not order again.  I will probably try another product.</li>
