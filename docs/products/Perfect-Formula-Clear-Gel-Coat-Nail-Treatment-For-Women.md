      <li>I love it !!</li>
      <li>I love perfect formula gel coat.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have used to strengthen my nails &amp; I have tried many.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll admit I just got this, but I love it!</li>
      <li>I have nice nails when I take care of them.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t feel the ridges or split nails it covers, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I can now go around 5-7 days without repainting, which is pretty much my ideal</li>
      <li>Could not be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
      <li>this product makes them better and they look nice again.</li>
      <li>(I actually kind of enjoy painting my nails and have a TON of polishes, so need to paint a lot to make that investment worth it, lol).</li>
      <li>Better for your nails than tips and gels.</li>
      <li>Later that day I put on another coat, 2 layers of colored polish, and Perfect Formula as a top coat.  </li>
      <li>This manicure lasted more than a week, also.  </li>
      <li>coat of pf then two coats of your color (I love anything OPI).  </li>
      <li>My nail polish stayed chip free for almost 6 days (a record for me!</li>
      <li>It will take a month or more to be able to evaluate the product.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I will wait awhile longer to be sure it is not the fault of the Postal Service.  </li>
      <li>Have tried many nail strengtheners that didn&#x27;t improve my nails..  </li>
      <li>This product is ok.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, and the nail polish industry will be making a mint off of me buying every fun color I can find!  </li>
      <li>The pink gel and top coat are also excellent.</li>
      <li>The formula works well, but not quite as good as from the retailers who would have a very high turnover and a fresher supply.  </li>
      <li>The polish stays on and remains shiny, yet it is easily removed with nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Application is easy.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used for more than 2 weeks, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I have naturally strong nails, but trying to support one&#x27;s business</li>
      <li>I really had high hopes because the product reviews were really great.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apple &amp; dries quickly</li>
      <li>Kind of a high rent problem to have, but I&#x27;ll suffer through somehow.  </li>
      <li>Perfect Formula helps to get them past this point...</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping my nails looking all cool and hip!!</li>
      <li>Love the sparkling (not too much) color.</li>
      <li>-- gel polish doesn&#x27;t work without UV light to cure it, right?  </li>
      <li>They will grow long and beautiful but once they hit a certain length they crack and break off.  </li>
      <li>Sure there are necessary minor repairs here and there, but generally I have been REALLY impressed with the staying power of this top</li>
      <li>This product makes my nails look smooth and consistent...</li>
      <li>I use an undercoat and a top coat and am able to grow my nails to a fairly long length with it.</li>
      <li>After using acryllic nails for 15-20 years, my natural nails took forever to grow out and look healthy.  </li>
      <li>Far better than the baked-on gel polishes.</li>
      <li>They are worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is worth every penny</li>
      <li>The clear gel was a better match for her skin tone.</li>
      <li>The top must be placed properly every time because it will evaporate the polish quickly otherwise.</li>
      <li>My nails grow healthy and long fast !!</li>
      <li>This product is too expensive but it is the best I have found for keeping your nails stronger and the fact that they grow faster with product, I have used this product before purchasing it on Amazon and knew what it was like.</li>
      <li>This top coat added around 3-4 days extra wear to my manicure!</li>
      <li>However, this stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>I will forever have my own natural long nails now..</li>
      <li>This gel coat is great for my weak peeling nails .</li>
      <li>I put one layer layer Perfect Formula on, with tiny touchups a few days later.  </li>
      <li>did not do much for my nails.  </li>
      <li>you just have to know how to really use it.  </li>
      <li>well\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve been abusing my nails because they are so much stronger.</li>
      <li>That softens the layers, and it goes much faster.</li>
      <li>I expected a lot more.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this did much at all to strengthen my nails.  </li>
      <li>My nails are almost back to where they should be except my free edges.</li>
      <li>I think people believe that just because they buy something they don&#x27;t have to use it with reasonable expectations.  </li>
      <li>It comes with a crystal file that is so much better for your nails than any other file that you have ever used before.</li>
      <li>I will stick with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails, seems to work better and a lot cheaper!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty passionate about my nails, and thought I had tried everything (I had finally settled on Sally Hansen&#x27;s salon manicure complete as my go-to top coat).  </li>
      <li>Much better coverage than any other clear polish I have tried.  </li>
      <li>If your nails peel at the end and need a little more strength, this product will do it.  </li>
      <li>but it OBVIOUSLY isn&#x27;t going to last a week if you wash dishes, clean, or garden without gloves on!</li>
      <li>You should put another coat of pf on between manicures (normal at home manicure is once a week) and</li>
      <li>IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THESE ARE FIRST PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY ARE SU[POSE TO DO, GIVE STRENGTH TO MY NAILS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I put one coat on and the second one before the first coat dries .</li>
      <li>This polish is more difficult to take off, but I just filled an old babyfood jar with acetone and soaked my nails in that for a minute or two.  </li>
      <li>I have found this true but you can still use it until the bottle is empty.</li>
      <li>Description wasn&#x27;t clear, so I bought and paid a lot of money</li>
      <li>I will correct review once I try again after getting done professionally for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>A thinner coat is better than a thick one.</li>
      <li>I like it very much too, but it is more expensive.  </li>
      <li>Hope it really improves the breaking long term.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need to cut my nails down and start fresh.  </li>
      <li>This kept my nails looking nice even though they were thin and clipped short.  </li>
      <li>and then I use Seche Vite fast drying polish for a really crazy fast dry and shine(available on Amazon and in many salons).  </li>
      <li>Usually polish lasts about a day if I&#x27;m lucky).</li>
      <li>I am 57 years old, and I have never had all my nails grown out to the same length at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter who preferred the clear gel  instead of the pink tinted.</li>

<li> Really helped my weak and damaged nails since removing acrylic nails 2 years ago.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on basic grooming, which includes time wasted in hair and nail salons.</li>
<li> I have also used the pink formula, which filters out yellowness and makes the whites brighter.  </li>
<li> Will try to post pic on pink version&#x27;s sight.</li>
<li> THE FIRST BOTTLE I ORDERED TURNED INTO  THICK GOO AFTER A MONTH TOO THICK TO APPLIE TO NAILS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really had high hopes because the product reviews were really great. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my nails.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. did not do much for my nails.  I expected a lot more.</li>
    <li> Could not be more pleased with this purchase! I have been using it for two weeks and have not had a broken nail since I started applying it. I use it as a base and top coat with a color OPI polish. My nail polish stayed chip free for almost 6 days (a record for me! Usually polish lasts about a day if I&#x27;m lucky). Try it out! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product...easy to work with...fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product is too expensive but it is the best I have found for keeping your nails stronger and the fact that they grow faster with product, I have used this product before purchasing it on Amazon and knew what it was like. I would recommend this product if you have weak nails and if they break often.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this came in a two step process.  Description wasn&#x27;t clear, so I bought and paid a lot of money and it didn&#x27;t work.  If anything it would peel and it was so adhered to my nails, my nails peeled along with it!  A costly lesson.  I will stick with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails, seems to work better and a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Perfect Formula products are amazing; I have never had nails that don&#x27;t break and this product makes my nails so much better.  The pink gel and top coat are also excellent.</li>
    <li> This product works well. The top must be placed properly every time because it will evaporate the polish quickly otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old, and I have never had all my nails grown out to the same length at the same time.  Not until now, that is.  I put one layer layer Perfect Formula on, with tiny touchups a few days later.  This stuff lasted for about ten days before it began to dull, at which point I took it off.  Later that day I put on another coat, 2 layers of colored polish, and Perfect Formula as a top coat.  This manicure lasted more than a week, also.  I could actually use a fingernail to open boxes of pasta and the like WITH NO DAMAGE!  By the end of about 20 days my nails had grown beyond the tips of my fingers.  By about 30 days my nails needed to be trimmed back because they were too long. Kind of a high rent problem to have, but I&#x27;ll suffer through somehow.  I have also used the pink formula, which filters out yellowness and makes the whites brighter.  I like it very much too, but it is more expensive.  This stuff is amazing, and the nail polish industry will be making a mint off of me buying every fun color I can find!  This polish is more difficult to take off, but I just filled an old babyfood jar with acetone and soaked my nails in that for a minute or two.  That softens the layers, and it goes much faster.</li>
    <li> THE FIRST BOTTLE I ORDERED TURNED INTO  THICK GOO AFTER A MONTH TOO THICK TO APPLIE TO NAILS. THE SECOND ONE IS HOLDING BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE ALL OF THESE PRUCTS. IN MY ENTIRE LIFE THESE ARE FIRST PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY ARE SU[POSE TO DO, GIVE STRENGTH TO MY NAILS.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS LONG NAILS WITHOUT BREAKING AT THE WICK&lt;br /&gt;NAILS ARE SUPER LONG, HARD AND HEALTHY.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD STUFF.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I just got this, but I love it! I have naturally strong nails, but trying to support one&#x27;s business I was talked into doing gel shellac. It thinned out my nails, and I work in the medical field where it calls for a lot of hand washing...and the gel would chip after a day of work. I did the gel shellac thing for a few months, and since had removed now for a few months. My nails are almost back to where they should be except my free edges. This product makes my nails look smooth and consistent...and now I can where color polish without it chipping off due to thin, brittle, damage nails... So yes I&#x27;m a fan and will be a returning customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty passionate about my nails, and thought I had tried everything (I had finally settled on Sally Hansen&#x27;s salon manicure complete as my go-to top coat).  A friend got this for me for my birthday, and I had never heard of it so was a little skeptical -- gel polish doesn&#x27;t work without UV light to cure it, right?  WRONG.  This top coat added around 3-4 days extra wear to my manicure! I can now go around 5-7 days without repainting, which is pretty much my ideal (I actually kind of enjoy painting my nails and have a TON of polishes, so need to paint a lot to make that investment worth it, lol). Sure there are necessary minor repairs here and there, but generally I have been REALLY impressed with the staying power of this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to consider though, to all the 1 star reviews out there:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t expect this to work miracles when you are using it over low quality nail polish that you picked up from the bin next to the checkout line at Claire&#x27;s. For optimal results, use with quality polishes (OPI, Essie, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Take care of your nails for best results. If you don&#x27;t have a crystal/glass nail file, GET ONE. They are worth the money. Those sandpaper nail files are basically a chainsaw and are not doing you any favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If your lifestyle is hard on your nails, don&#x27;t expect miracles, either. This top coat is great but it OBVIOUSLY isn&#x27;t going to last a week if you wash dishes, clean, or garden without gloves on! Duh people.</li>
    <li> This was NOT worth the money that was charged for this product. It perls off in a day. I wont buy again</li>
    <li> It makes my nails peel.  Maybe I need to cut my nails down and start fresh.  I will continue to see if there are any results ,  but I&#x27;ve been trying weekly and nothing as yet.  I will correct review once I try again after getting done professionally for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This gel coat is great for my weak peeling nails . I just couldn&#x27;t  get my nails to grow without peeling and splitting . I put one coat on and the second one before the first coat dries . I find that it stays on longer . A thinner coat is better than a thick one. I love perfect formula gel coat. Try it, I bet your nails will be stronger than with any other product out there.  It comes with a crystal file that is so much better for your nails than any other file that you have ever used before.</li>
    <li> Really helped my weak and damaged nails since removing acrylic nails 2 years ago.</li>
    <li> Have always purchased this from another leading TV / online company.  This one was less expensive but from a company I didn&#x27;t know.  The formula works well, but not quite as good as from the retailers who would have a very high turnover and a fresher supply.  However, this stuff really works!  Can&#x27;t stop and start it, but if used regularly, it does work.</li>
    <li> This was due to be here two days ago and I have not gotten it.  I will wait awhile longer to be sure it is not the fault of the Postal Service.  It will take a month or more to be able to evaluate the product.[[ASIN:B003XMUIE0 Perfect Formula Gel Coat 0.6 oz]]</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the only product that STRENGTHENS my nails so I can grow them to the end of my finger.  Otherwise, when I use a \\&quot;hardener\\&quot; all they do it chip &amp; tear!  Thanks for keeping my nails looking all cool and hip!!</li>
    <li> The polish stays on and remains shiny, yet it is easily removed with nail polish remover. Far better than the baked-on gel polishes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  After using acryllic nails for 15-20 years, my natural nails took forever to grow out and look healthy.  I started using this product so that they would stop peeling and breaking.  This kept my nails looking nice even though they were thin and clipped short.  If your nails peel at the end and need a little more strength, this product will do it.  I use an undercoat and a top coat and am able to grow my nails to a fairly long length with it.</li>
    <li> I only say this works \\&quot;TOO well\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve been abusing my nails because they are so much stronger. I use the clear as a base coat and the pink version as the second coat. Highly recommend. Will try to post pic on pink version&#x27;s sight.</li>
    <li> Have tried many nail strengtheners that didn&#x27;t improve my nails..  This really works and I would recommend it to anyone with thin weak nails.</li>
    <li> I have nice nails when I take care of them.  They will grow long and beautiful but once they hit a certain length they crack and break off.  Perfect Formula helps to get them past this point...you just have to know how to really use it.  It will not magically cure your nail issues all by itself.  I think people believe that just because they buy something they don&#x27;t have to use it with reasonable expectations.  You cant just slap it on and expect it to last for a week or two without maintenance.  And just because its a strengthener doesn&#x27;t mean that you can or should be using your nails to peel open cans or scrape things off of surfaces.  You don&#x27;t wax your car and then expect it to repel hail or withstand a front end collision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base coat of pf then two coats of your color (I love anything OPI).  Another coat of pf and then I use Seche Vite fast drying polish for a really crazy fast dry and shine(available on Amazon and in many salons).  You should put another coat of pf on between manicures (normal at home manicure is once a week) and then another coat of Seche Vite.  If you chip a nail you need to do a touch up!  Once the barrier is broken, like any paint, the polish will peel.  People have actually stopped me to ask who does my nails and if I take vitamins for them!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend, that like me has a hard time growing nails.  Haven&#x27;t used for more than 2 weeks, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This does what it says to strengthen the nails! Apply daily; it works. Better for your nails than tips and gels.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell whether it will improve my nails over time, but the product goes on with a thick enough smooth layer to last almost a week with hard use.  I can&#x27;t feel the ridges or split nails it covers, which is nice.  No clothing snags.  No breaks the entire week.  Nails feel really hard. Only slight negative is that is starts to turn a bit gray after 6 days from UV.  Much better coverage than any other clear polish I have tried.  Hope it really improves the breaking long term.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who preferred the clear gel  instead of the pink tinted. The clear gel was a better match for her skin tone. She loved it.</li>
    <li> This product is brilliant ... I love it !! I will forever have my own natural long nails now.. My nails grow healthy and long fast !! This is worth every penny I&#x27;m on my second bottle</li>
    <li> everyone,this is a great product. I wore false nails for 20 years while I worked,and I ruined my nails. I could never grow my nails because they would peel and split. this product makes them better and they look nice again.</li>
    <li> What I hate are claims by nail treatments to make my nails rock hard and invincible. This formula peels like everything else, leaving me to re-apply day after day. I need a formula that goes on/stays on--until I take it off. I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on basic grooming, which includes time wasted in hair and nail salons. Back to acrylic nails...</li>
    <li> I had a terrible problem with peeling nails. This product is terrific. I use it once a week. Love the sparkling (not too much) color. Application is easy.</li>
    <li> I use this item Gel Coat all the time for several years.  It helps my nails grow stronger and long.  The nail tech at the salon I go to for my hair compliments me on my nails.  I have read where people have stated it get thick in the bottle after time.  I have found this true but you can still use it until the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this did much at all to strengthen my nails.  Plus for me it did not stay on well.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my nails  at my age - I&#x27;m 64.</li>
    <li> Works well, my nails are healthier and longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used to strengthen my nails &amp; I have tried many.  It is easy to apple &amp; dries quickly</li>
