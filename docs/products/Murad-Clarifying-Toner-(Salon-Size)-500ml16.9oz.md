<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite product in the world, along with acne product and lotion and cleanser from Murad. This toner takes off all dirt and makeup. You could use this alone</li>
    <li> great price for the quantity</li>
    <li> burned a hole in my cheek.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use toner, but this product is amazing. I started to get adult acne out of nowhere about 5 months ago, switching to murad daily moisturizer helped by making it a little bit better. But once I bought and used this toner my skin improved by 90%. I now occasionally get a pimple, rather than waking up with 5 new ones a day. I originally bought the smaller bottle from Murad, and came back to buy the salon size, which is a much better deal!</li>
    <li> Love the salon size, will last me a very long time...6-8 months...&lt;br /&gt;Pump is made for lotion/cleanser so you have to be careful not to splatter everywhere and use cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;I poured it in an empty spray bottle and now I can spray it on my face...</li>
    <li> Had been using this for years before and changed to a different product for a few months.  I got it this afternoon (SUPER FAST DELIVERY!) and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw just how much more dirtiness had come off with this toner.  I was shocked to see how much I must have been leaving behind with the other toner (***an even more expensive designer spa brand).</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, but all of the contents were spilled during shipping since the cap was not taped to the bottle. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The item appeared to be opened. There was no sealer over the opening on top of the bottle. Going to return it because I&#x27;m not sure if it has been tampered with.</li>
    <li> The clarifying toner works wonders. Smells great and feels even better!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like the tingling clean feeling.  This is great value.</li>
    <li> Like it very much. Has cleared dark spots.</li>
    <li> Love that I could order the salon size. It was a great price for the value!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for two days, so far not terribly impressed.  The smell is not pleasant, I have used Witch Hazel for many years and already know that this stuff smells odd but this product is just OFF due to the extra junk in it.  Basically, it is overpriced witch hazel.</li>
    <li> Very good product to use alone if you have mild acne or breakouts. Also good if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on my neck but drys out my face. Cleared up the acne on my neck and back within 2 weeks</li>
    <li> This is my first murad product and I fo really like it and it&#x27;s nice to have the large size but it&#x27;s sometimes hard not to pump out to much but feels great and refreshing on the skin and the sent me a trial size of another product that I also like so I&#x27;ll definitely keep using and will order more products ..... I just turned 30and have some breakouts and also starting to use wrinkle products I&#x27;m oily in t zone and dry in others so this balances nicely for my skin</li>
    <li> good value pack. always use this toner, good for the acne skin.</li>
    <li> Murad makes this great toner.  Have been using it for years. My last visit to the Dental office the Dental assistant said, \\&quot;you have great skin\\&quot;, I say thank you Murad.</li>
