      <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>

      <li>Awesome diffuser, especially if you have long/thick hair!</li>
      <li>Glad Xtava did.  </li>
      <li>I love the look and feel of my hair</li>
      <li>I feel that this diffuser does everything that it claims to do and I would recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>
      <li>I suffer from flat hair at front, so the diffuser is perfect to lift up those stubborn parts of your hair and give volume to them,</li>
      <li>I received this diffuser complimentary and am sharing my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you.</li>
      <li>I have medium length ,fine  hair.  </li>
      <li>I also liked the large size, which allows me to gather a lot of my hair at once, saving time.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>This thing is huge, it takes a while to get adjusted to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of my xtava hair dryer as well.</li>
      <li>Just the decrease in heat from a traditional hair dryer alone has improved the health of my hair greatly.</li>
      <li>What hair dryer is this meant to fit?</li>
      <li>This diffuser helped to define my waves and made my hair sleek and smooth.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my blow drier</li>
      <li>When I tried to fit the diffuser to my John Frieda blow drier</li>
      <li>I love that it is so large</li>
      <li>and it does what it wants most days.</li>
      <li>my hair is much healthier and frizz free!</li>
      <li>Hands down my favorite diffuser ever!!  </li>
      <li>What is great about this is when the fingers are touching your scalp, the hot hair is blowing through the holes on the fingers which is allowing the hot air to get near your scalp, which is the place that takes longest to dry!</li>
      <li>It was nice and soft and very tamable.</li>
      <li>I use my fingers instead of a brush when drying my hair and it leaves my hair with a much more natural look.</li>
      <li>The diffuser did get super hot</li>
      <li>It diffuses the heat evenly and combs right through the hair..</li>
      <li>I mean I know that most diffusers are pretty good in size, but this one takes the cake.</li>
      <li>I used the XTAVA Black Orchid Large Hair Diffuser and my hair looks healthier and Amazing!</li>
      <li>This one is huge in comparison to the other one, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t collapse.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s probably because it wasn&#x27;t connected to a real Xtava dryer!  </li>
      <li>I’m trying to get my hair back to its healthy condition and was told that this diffuser salvages your hair strands by it</li>
      <li>The diffuser allows the air to flow through my hair instead of getting straight on hot blast of heat.</li>
      <li>The orchid petals make this great to use on a younger person as it holds the hair dryer far enough away from the head that they don&#x27;t feel that intense heat from the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>,s all most dry than I flip it and start drying.</li>
      <li>This diffuser is large so it gets a large area all at once.</li>
      <li>Never seen a diffuser so large.</li>
      <li>This one did not fit my gold-n-hot dryer either, but I realized that it fit my friends gold-n-got dryer just fine.</li>
      <li>When I opened the box I was a little surprised with the size of the diffuser and thought that it would not be a good match for me.</li>
      <li>I love this diffuser, it just doesn&#x27;t fit on hardly any hairdryers.</li>
      <li>The reason I say that is because like a knuckle head, I ordered this assuming it would fit my already owned and loved Xtava hair dryer, however, I was compleat.y wrong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really get to use it to</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that tends to do what it wants.</li>
      <li>’s gently air dispersing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a hair diffuser before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to do when I got this.</li>
      <li>Too much sun, age, coloring and continual use of heated equipment has caused my fine, flat hair to become frizzy and brittle.</li>
      <li>Once I used it, using my friend&#x27;s dryer, I have to say it&#x27;s better than the other one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s full potential,</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; on tho is one are longer and dispersed heat a lot better, and I find that I had even less frizz with this one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>A couple things I like about this black orchid large hair diffuser by Xtava is that it is huge and helps dry your hair super fast.</li>
      <li>This has opened up some new opportunity for me to deal with my uncontrollable hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would easily say it has cut the time in half I devote to drying my hair.</li>
      <li>My curls get dry quickly without frizz</li>
      <li>I use it for my daughters naturally curly hair and it makes her curls more defined, less frizzy and adds overall body to her hair.</li>
      <li>I always thought that diffusers were only for curly hair but mine is stick straight</li>
      <li>I think mines is just an old model so the nozzle doesn&#x27;t attach.</li>
      <li>After using the diffuser my hair had beach waves that were soft and bounce.</li>
      <li>The actual diffusion cup is HUGE, so it covers a lot of ground, which means less time</li>
      <li>It is so much faster to dry my hair with the diffuser than without.</li>
      <li>a 49 year old woman and as you get older or hair tends to get dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>The only caveat is that it only fits on an Xtava dryer so only purchase this if you have or are willing to buy one.</li>
      <li>No specs, but it would only fit on a small barrel dryer, and there&#x27;s no give.  </li>
      <li>I got this hair diffuser because I have red natural curly hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Let me start by saying that this diffuser is so big. I mean I know that most diffusers are pretty good in size, but this one takes the cake. I absolutley love it&#x27;s design, and I without a doubt believe it will do an incredible job. The reason I say that is because like a knuckle head, I ordered this assuming it would fit my already owned and loved Xtava hair dryer, however, I was compleat.y wrong. I did want to leave a review anyway because even though I haven&#x27;t used it yet, I am super impressed by the quality of this diffuser, and the size. I will update this review after I purchase the correct hair dryer that this diffuser attatches to. I did recieve this product for review purposes, but that does not in anyway affect, or sway my opinion or experience about this product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c23e893cae43508df5ff06c3d9e72de8]]OMG!! This is theeeee best diffuser I have ever used! I received this diffuser last week and used it yesterday morning after washing my hair.  This thing is awesome!! So there are little \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; all around it and all of the little fingers have a little hole at the end which allows air to flow through. What is great about this is when the fingers are touching your scalp, the hot hair is blowing through the holes on the fingers which is allowing the hot air to get near your scalp, which is the place that takes longest to dry! What a concept! Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?  Glad Xtava did.  This allowed my roots to dry along with the rest of the hair which helped me maintain the volume and length that I like.  What a genius diffuser this is.  Hands down my favorite diffuser ever!!  I have already recommended this bad boy to my friends.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Now I have to go back and buy one for my sisters. They are gonna love it and I know you will too.  Well done Xtava! I also did a video review which you can see here.</li>
    <li> Every curly haired girl knows that we can&#x27;t just simply brow dry our hair. We have a process we must follow unless we want frizzy locks all day long. This defuser is great and works well. I love that it is so large do it covers more hair when drying it. Also i would like to point out that it seems built to last. Glad i received this :)</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but I always curl or straighten because if I try to wear my hair natural, it looks like a frizzy mess. This diffuser helped to define my waves and made my hair sleek and smooth. I also liked the large size, which allows me to gather a lot of my hair at once, saving time. Sample provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine just got done making a video review about this diffuser on her YouTube channel. Since I tried the collapsible one from this brand, I wanted to see how this one compared. I was about to recieve this one for test and review purposes. This one is huge in comparison to the other one, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t collapse. This one did not fit my gold-n-hot dryer either, but I realized that it fit my friends gold-n-got dryer just fine. I think mines is just an old model so the nozzle doesn&#x27;t attach. Once I used it, using my friend&#x27;s dryer, I have to say it&#x27;s better than the other one. The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; on tho is one are longer and dispersed heat a lot better, and I find that I had even less frizz with this one.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have damaged hair. Too much sun, age, coloring and continual use of heated equipment has caused my fine, flat hair to become frizzy and brittle. I was so discouraged with my hair until I used this diffuser. I always thought that diffusers were only for curly hair but mine is stick straight and It has worked wonders!! The life in my hair has been restored.&lt;br /&gt;I start drying my hair upside down on a low medium heat. The diffuser allows the air to flow through my hair instead of getting straight on hot blast of heat. I use my fingers instead of a brush when drying my hair and it leaves my hair with a much more natural look. Since I have been using this diffuser my hair is fuller and has more shine. This diffuser is large so it gets a large area all at once. It is so much faster to dry my hair with the diffuser than without. I would easily say it has cut the time in half I devote to drying my hair. Just the decrease in heat from a traditional hair dryer alone has improved the health of my hair greatly. I know that I could decrease the heat without the diffuser but I would be drying for hours if I did. It is the small streams of air that dry it so quickly. I love the look and feel of my hair these days!!&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a promotional price to test and provider honest unbiased feedback and results.</li>
    <li> I like this diffuser.. I don&#x27;t have an XTAVA Hair dryer so it didn&#x27;t connect to any of my other blow dryers I had, so I didn&#x27;t really get to use it to it&#x27;s full potential, buutttt I did hold it onto my other dryer with my hand, and turned it on..It diffuses the heat evenly and combs right through the hair..My hair has dried faster than it ever has.. The diffuser did get super hot but that&#x27;s probably because it wasn&#x27;t connected to a real Xtava dryer!  Other than that, my curls are amazing and I have some awesome beach waves too!&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser! A couple things I like about this black orchid large hair diffuser by Xtava is that it is huge and helps dry your hair super fast. I use it for my daughters naturally curly hair and it makes her curls more defined, less frizzy and adds overall body to her hair. The orchid petals make this great to use on a younger person as it holds the hair dryer far enough away from the head that they don&#x27;t feel that intense heat from the hair dryer. The orchid petals also feel really good on your scalp, like you are getting a massage! I feel that this diffuser does everything that it claims to do and I would recommend it to my friends for sure. I received this diffuser complimentary and am sharing my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my blow drier</li>
    <li> This thing is huge, it takes a while to get adjusted to. However, once  I got used to it, it helped a lot to lift up my hair at the front. I suffer from flat hair at front, so the diffuser is perfect to lift up those stubborn parts of your hair and give volume to them,</li>
    <li> What hair dryer is this meant to fit? No specs, but it would only fit on a small barrel dryer, and there&#x27;s no give.  I think the diffuser part is really great, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I ended up duct taping it to one of the 3 dryers I have in order to use it. My husband&#x27;s going to rig something out of radiator hose to attach it. More thought should have gone into the hook  up aspect.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> It is HUGE and seems to work effectively - but it keeps popping off my XTAVA Peony hair dryer.  If someone can give me a hint on how to keep the dang thing on, I will gladly change the star rating..</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! air comes from every where so it all dries and curls evenly. I have wavy hair that tends to do what it wants. This keeps the waves even and big!</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser, it just doesn&#x27;t fit on hardly any hairdryers. But it is BIG and holds lots of hair and gets lots of air through it.</li>
    <li> Never seen a diffuser so large. I got this hair diffuser because I have red natural curly hair. I hate going anywhere with my hair wet, however; I do not use a blow dryer on it because my hair would frizz so bad I will end up with an afro! Not only do I not normally dry hair because of what it does to my hair but also because it is time consuming. My hair is very long and thick.  So I got this diffuser and still kinda freaking out about using a hair dryer on hair but I gave it a try after I borrowed a hair dryer because the diffuser wouldn&#x27;t work on mine. My hair dried quickly but it was only damp when I started and it was not an afro. It was nice and soft and very tamable. I cannot believe the differences this diffuser has made.  Now to get that hair dyer that will work with it and I will be all set. This is a great diffuser. I was able to mess with my hair after it dried and it did not go all crazy on me like normal. This has opened up some new opportunity for me to deal with my uncontrollable hair!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary and this is my honest and unbiased review Keep in mind that all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a hair diffuser before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to do when I got this. Unfortunately there were no instructions included, so I had to look up a video on youtube.  Once I was ready to try it, I realized that the hole to attach it to my hair dryer is too small! The only way I could use it is to hold it in place while I blow dry my hair and that&#x27;s not feasible. I have a regular,  hum-drum ConAir hair dryer, so nothing fancy. I thought all hair dryer heads were the same size, but I guess they aren&#x27;t.  So unfortunately, I&#x27;m not able to use this. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Love it. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This diffuser is everything I hoped it would be! I’m trying to get my hair back to its healthy condition and was told that this diffuser salvages your hair strands by it’s gently air dispersing. In no time, I will end up with beautiful, healthy looking hair. The actual diffusion cup is HUGE, so it covers a lot of ground, which means less time and that&#x27;s a huge plus for me. Its diversified 360 degree airflow targets every angle of my hair from its roots to the tip. It fits perfectly on my (off-brand) hair dryer and when done, nicely in my cupboard. This is a must-have item that you should make the room space for.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes</li>
    <li> Largest diffuser ever made. Long teeth make drying curly hair a breeze. The only caveat is that it only fits on an Xtava dryer so only purchase this if you have or are willing to buy one. It didn&#x27;t fit on any of the three hair dryers in my house and unless a diffuser can fit on the dryer securely, it is worthless. You don&#x27;t want to be holding it together while you dry your hair. It snaps into place on an Xtava dryer.</li>
    <li> I love it i used it today and was frizz free and love how it made my naturals curl kinky and bouncy perfect curls</li>
    <li> When I opened the box I was a little surprised with the size of the diffuser and thought that it would not be a good match for me. The diffuser is big, with deep &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34;. I have medium length ,fine  hair.  When I tried to fit the diffuser to my John Frieda blow drier I was very disappointed to find that would not work... But as a girly girl, I had 2 more blow driers and one of of them worked!  After using the diffuser my hair had beach waves that were soft and bounce. I am so happy with this product. Even happier that I received at discounted price. Score all the way.</li>
    <li> Awesome diffuser, especially if you have long/thick hair! This has seriously cut down on my drying time; the design is just smart. I paired with the peony dryer also from xtava, so happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best diffuser ever.  My curls get dry quickly without frizz</li>
    <li> I have biracial hair (Black and Korean) and this diffuser is a must have! My curls look hydrated and awesome. I&#x27;m a huge fan of my xtava hair dryer as well.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair but very thick and wavy and it does what it wants most days. I used the XTAVA Black Orchid Large Hair Diffuser and my hair looks healthier and Amazing! I.m a 49 year old woman and as you get older or hair tends to get dry and frizzy. I used the diffuser came with no instructions , but I knew what to do .I don&#x27;t dry my hair until it,s all most dry than I flip it and start drying. My waves and little curls all came out just the way I wanted them too. I just used my fingers to put the curls were I wanted them. Reduced my hair drying timeand my hair is much healthier and frizz free! I love my hair again! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
