      <li>Bio Ionic is a good brand, there are knock-offs</li>
      <li>I actually love the concept of this product, and it would have been great in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s when I had tons of hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Love this blow out set to use on clients and the price is great.</li>

      <li>I LOVE ALL  BIO IONIC!</li>
      <li>and I love this product!  </li>
      <li>love it!)</li>
      <li>Love Love Love it!</li>
      <li>(Yes, I have to kind of pull the curlers out in a brush stroke kind of motion when removing, but still, they leave a great soft curl/wave</li>
      <li>Wish they held the brushes with better stability.  </li>
      <li>Even so, the brushes help me in getting a superior result in finishing the drying process on my freshly shampooed hair and to giving an added boost and fullness in between shampoos.</li>
      <li>Love the ease and speed of inserting the brushes in one&#x27;s hair and removing the detachable handle.  </li>
      <li>I have ever been able to do at home.</li>
      <li>Detachable brushes are the best way to get a long lasting, beautifully pro-style looking blow out.</li>
      <li>but this is so easy for me to use ..</li>
      <li>The curlers got stuck in my hair and the handle that holds the curlers on comes off easily.</li>
      <li>The brushes are ultra lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>These are the best on the market, hands down.</li>
      <li>I use them alongside of my Bio-Ionic power light blow dryer.</li>
      <li>If you can stand to leave them in for hours your hair will be smooth.  </li>
      <li>I use my own because the ones included are really below par.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can get better results from velcro or hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>but these are the original.</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Quick hair drying time, leaves hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The barrels on these brushes create amazing shine, incredible smoothness and long lasting style.</li>
      <li>The only thing good about ordering these is that I could get them from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>with any type of blow drying good tension is key.</li>
      <li>then wait about 5 - 10 minutes to remove, and my hair is shiny and has tons of bounce and curls are nice &amp; soft ... makes me look like a &amp;#34;Breck Girl&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I feel like I am hair challenged, yet this was pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product at my salon, and liked how it made drying and curling my hair at the same time so easy.</li>
      <li>Great for weddings, prom and up or down styles!)</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not enough curlers to fit my head - unless I purchase more.</li>
      <li>I love this, My hairdresser used it at my last cut and I bought one right away.</li>
      <li>Yes, you do need to allow extra time, but once you use these brushes, you will be so pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I am sure Bio Ionic is aware of this problem, I only hope they will improve this product and</li>
      <li>Save yourself some pain and agrivation and buy some hot curlers.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>Love the clips to leave in a brush while moving to the next section!</li>
      <li>these will allow the hair to set the shape, have tons of shine without the damage of hot irons.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re pretty good w a round brush</li>
      <li>If you have a good relationship w your stylist they can explain the basics of how to use a round brush.</li>
      <li>I wonder how much damage this heat will do to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I still use it (because I paid so much money for it) but feel like the weight of the brushes are not</li>
      <li>I recently purchased since I&#x27;ve been on a &amp;#34;hair binge&amp;#34; lately trying to work my hair in different ways -- and found this set to work the best!  </li>
      <li>Now I understand why older ladies cut it all off.</li>
      <li>They are blue in color while cool and white when they get hot.</li>
      <li>So I fought it for $20.00 in order to get a new handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Positive and negative ions are safe and gentle on the hairs ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wish there were extra brushes and clips that did not cost so much!  </li>
      <li>now I have just above the shoulder, much finer hair</li>
      <li>It adds soft curls and shine that lasts for days.</li>
      <li>re-release it in the near future.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Professional Hairdresser and let me tell you my clients loooove the brushes on their hair.</li>
      <li>I dry my hair about 80% and then use these rollers and blast hot air on them once rolled and set ..</li>
      <li>I have had no success with curling irons or flat irons in that they dry out my hair and actually don&#x27;t make my hair look nice ..</li>
      <li>if anyone reading this is old enough to remember that!  </li>
      <li>I purchased at my local professional only store.</li>
      <li>Now that I have used it a few times consistently, I am sold.</li>

<li> The Bio Ionic set here has AMAZING brushes... but the &amp;#34;detachable&amp;#34; feature is majorly flawed and nearly impossible to do seamlessly.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m returning all my other curling irons &amp; stuff</li>
<li> Expensive, but I really like these.  </li>
<li> This is not worth the money.  </li>

<li> Hard to use on yourself if you have long hair because they tangle while trying to remove them.</li>
<li> Not happy, can not influence other enough not to buy it.  </li>
<li> They were a little overpriced too.  </li>
<li> The little handle broke</li>
<li> The bristtles of the roller are down right painful.  </li>
<li> Recomend for other pros!!</li>
<li> The brushes are so heavy they wouldn&#x27;t stay up.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You need to know what you&#x27;re doing w a brush for these to work well. They are not rollers: they are brushes. If you&#x27;re pretty good w a round brush these will allow the hair to set the shape, have tons of shine without the damage of hot irons. If you have a good relationship w your stylist they can explain the basics of how to use a round brush. These are the best on the market, hands down. Bio Ionic is a good brand, there are knock-offs but these are the original. If you&#x27;re not great at blow outs there will be a learning curve, I&#x27;d suggest Bio Ionic square shaped round brushes to learn on. (Stylist for 10+ years, not affiliated w Bio Ionic. Recomend for other pros!! Great for weddings, prom and up or down styles!)</li>
    <li> Love this! Gets my hair dry w/out frizzies. Love the clips to leave in a brush while moving to the next section!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but I really like these.  The little handle broke and I wrote to the company but have never heard back. They were a little overpriced too.  I did find another pack of them at TJ Max. So I fought it for $20.00 in order to get a new handle.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever. It got stuck in my hair and would not come out. We where close to cutting off a foot of my hair (my hair is over 2ft long). My mom had to put detangler and conditioner in my. She also had to use a wooden stick to push it off my hair. It was a nightmare. My mom and I were almost in tears. NEVER BUY THIS</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase these through Amazon. I purchased at my local professional only store. I&#x27;m a Professional Hairdresser and let me tell you my clients loooove the brushes on their hair. I use them alongside of my Bio-Ionic power light blow dryer. Quick hair drying time, leaves hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any type of blow drying good tension is key. The detachable brushes are perfect for hair setting. They are blue in color while cool and white when they get hot. Perfect to see when your style has been &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive and negative ions are safe and gentle on the hairs ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I called the company to try and get directions,  She was very nasty.  I never received the directions.  The brushes are so heavy they wouldn&#x27;t stay up.  The clips are useless.  I even bought clips from sally&#x27;s and they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  What I have to do is use rubber bands and connect the clips together.  The bristtles of the roller are down right painful.  They stick in your head like needles.  If you can stand to leave them in for hours your hair will be smooth.  I wonder how much damage this heat will do to my hair.  I hardly use these because of the pain and what you have to go through to get the curlers in your hair.  Then try to keep them in.  This is not worth the money.  The only thing good about ordering these is that I could get them from Amazon.  Save yourself some pain and agrivation and buy some hot curlers.</li>
    <li> I love this, My hairdresser used it at my last cut and I bought one right away. I feel like I am hair challenged, yet this was pretty easy to use. I have thick hair and the brushes stay in well. It adds soft curls and shine that lasts for days.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at my salon, and liked how it made drying and curling my hair at the same time so easy.</li>
    <li> My Girl Friend Loved It !!!!</li>
    <li> It was like having 6 brushes hanging in my hair.  I can get better results from velcro or hot rollers.  The price is outrageous!  Not happy, can not influence other enough not to buy it.  I took it back.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for good results the easiest fastest way- unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t give me the look on my shoulder length hair and the clips are not strong enough for the heaviness of the rollers- sent them back</li>
    <li> not enough curl, rollers too  and only 3 that somewhat work</li>
    <li> Time saving, and saves my hair from overdrying. My hair is thick, the brushes hold it well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem detaching the brush handle. My hair takes forever to dry, this keeps the curl in place&lt;br /&gt;while I move to the next section. It&#x27;s like having extra hands, and electric curlers all in one.&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  Love the ease and speed of inserting the brushes in one&#x27;s hair and removing the detachable handle.  If I could change anything about them, it would be to enhance the clips that are supposed to hold the brushes in place.  Wish they held the brushes with better stability.  Even so, the brushes help me in getting a superior result in finishing the drying process on my freshly shampooed hair and to giving an added boost and fullness in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this on me and it was the bomb.  Yes, you do need to allow extra time, but once you use these brushes, you will be so pleased with the results.  Love Love Love it!</li>
    <li> The curlers got stuck in my hair and the handle that holds the curlers on comes off easily. My hair did not turn out. There&#x27;s not enough curlers to fit my head - unless I purchase more. I don&#x27;t like the size of the small barrel ones either.</li>
    <li> Love this blow out set to use on clients and the price is great. I wish they included four of each size brush heads instead of three. All the diagrams show a total of 8 rollers used on the head. Hard to use on yourself if you have long hair because they tangle while trying to remove them.</li>
    <li> I actually love the concept of this product, and it would have been great in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s when I had tons of hair.&lt;br /&gt;But now I have just above the shoulder, much finer hair and I find the brushes are too long and too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also the clips should be bigger. I still use it (because I paid so much money for it) but feel like the weight of the brushes are not&lt;br /&gt;doing my hair any favors.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to a woman with tons of hair and a giant head.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and I love this product!  I have had no success with curling irons or flat irons in that they dry out my hair and actually don&#x27;t make my hair look nice .. but this is so easy for me to use .. I dry my hair about 80% and then use these rollers and blast hot air on them once rolled and set .. then wait about 5 - 10 minutes to remove, and my hair is shiny and has tons of bounce and curls are nice &amp; soft ... makes me look like a &amp;#34;Breck Girl&amp;#34; if anyone reading this is old enough to remember that!  Anyway, I love these!  (Yes, I have to kind of pull the curlers out in a brush stroke kind of motion when removing, but still, they leave a great soft curl/wave and my hair is so bouncy ... love it!) .... I&#x27;m returning all my other curling irons &amp; stuff I recently purchased since I&#x27;ve been on a &amp;#34;hair binge&amp;#34; lately trying to work my hair in different ways -- and found this set to work the best!  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Detachable brushes are the best way to get a long lasting, beautifully pro-style looking blow out. The Bio Ionic set here has AMAZING brushes... but the &amp;#34;detachable&amp;#34; feature is majorly flawed and nearly impossible to do seamlessly.  The barrels on these brushes create amazing shine, incredible smoothness and long lasting style. But trying to release the handle from the barrel during the blowout process is nearly impossible to do without two hands. I am sure Bio Ionic is aware of this problem, I only hope they will improve this product and re-release it in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used detachable brushes from Body Up Pro, but found the brushes to be inferior (though their detaching feature is a cinch).  Someday hopefully will make a set that works well in all areas!</li>
    <li> When my stylist used these brushes on my hair and I saw the results, I had to ask her how I could get them for myself. I am not disappointed. The brushes are ultra lightweight and easy to handle. They don&#x27;t weigh your hair down when you leave them in while blow drying the rest.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to criticize would be the clips. I use my own because the ones included are really below par.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am delighted by this product.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It does have a learning curve. Now that I have used it a few times consistently, I am sold. I got the product as a Christmas gift. As a person who is getting up there in years, it is getting more difficult to get your hair to do what you want it too. Now I understand why older ladies cut it all off. Hopefully I will not be doing that anytime soon! I feel this is the closest to salon hair I have ever been able to do at home.</li>
    <li> Recently cut my hair to shoulder length.  This kit works so well.  Cuts styling time in half.  I let my hair almost dry and then use this, leave in for 10 minutes while I do other things and voila - a nice styled blow out!  Wish there were extra brushes and clips that did not cost so much!  The $60 deal here for this is great.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! For the reviews that said they were stuck in their hair obviously had no business using them. Didnt know how to use them... I LOVE ALL  BIO IONIC!</li>
