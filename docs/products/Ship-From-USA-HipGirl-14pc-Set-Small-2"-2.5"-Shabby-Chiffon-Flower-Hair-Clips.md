      <li>course it didn&#x27;t perform a miracle but it was cute enough to make her feel better about her bangs and since the focus would be on the adorable headband, it would take it off the</li>
      <li>All in all, good set for the price in a nice little box.</li>

      <li>While the flower clips are nice and well made, they&#x27;re much smaller than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>They look like after a while of some good, rough toddler play they might start to show some wear, but that&#x27;s why you buy lots and lots of bows and clippies anyway, so you&#x27;ve always got backups.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t as big as I thought, but they look nice and I&#x27;ve gotten complements on them.</li>

      <li>The printed flowers turned out better than the solid</li>
      <li>There are enough in one box for everyone to share and be able to pick out what they like</li>

    <li> Good selection. They were a bit smashed.</li>
    <li> Help complete the vintage look I was going for. Also look great on my 3 year old daughter! You will not be dissapointed</li>
    <li> very poor quality, does not look like advertised photo.  Don&#x27;t buy !</li>
    <li> Pretty colors on good quality clips. Some of them poorly made</li>
    <li> Have a little baby girl with fine hair and they stay in great. (if she lets them in) Great Buy!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my 4 girls! Not too small or too large, very well made, and the colors are fun.</li>
    <li> Put together well, very fun to wear.</li>
    <li> This past week we had another &amp;#34;bang incident&amp;#34; as I now refer to them. Several times now Paige has gotten ahold of a pair of scissors and given herself a little trim! When her bangs get too long and she wants them out of her eyes, she just snips away without a thought to the aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TRY to fix them but sometimes, there&#x27;s just nothing I can do. This time wasn&#x27;t the worst but it was bad enough that she ended up with short, uneven bangs. I&#x27;m scared to fix them any further because they will end up even shorter! HipGirl Boutique to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige already tried their headbands and bows and loved them so for this particular issue, we thought we&#x27;d try something that covered a bit more! I usually associate the Crochet Headbands with babies but thanks to the latest style, older girls can wear them as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a band that matched the dress she was wearing, chose a cute shabby flower hair clip to attach to the headband and pushed it down on her forehead to lengthen her bangs a big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it didn&#x27;t perform a miracle but it was cute enough to make her feel better about her bangs and since the focus would be on the adorable headband, it would take it off the bangs!IMG_6967&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headbands are nice and thick and I love the sweet crochet pattern and look. It has such a universal appeal that all ages of girls can wear them from babies to grown ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok maybe I don&#x27;t quite pull it off but for Paige to feel better, I wore it around the house for a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bows are adorable and clip on easily but can also be worn by themselves as a cute flower in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just loving these HipGirl accessories and especially the prices! I love those crochet hats that they make and again, associated them with babies. I was sad they didn&#x27;t come out with them until Paige was passed the baby stage but I think she can still wear them and we already have the cute hair clips to attach! That&#x27;s the beauty of their accessories. You can mix and match for all different kinds of looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige had fun modeling the different looks for me and by the time she was done, her confidence was back and she basically forgot about her bangs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t so easily forget but thanks to HipGirl we will have fun playing and covering up the damage! These would make the cutest stocking stuffer for all the little girls on your shopping list this year!beauty of their accessories.

    <li> The hair clips arrived exactly as stated and are in pristine condition. They are exactly as pictured. They look very delicate, but are quite sturdy. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I received a lot of flowers for a low price, im very happy w this purchase. cute colors as well</li>
    <li> These are absolutely stinkin&#x27; adorable. They were smaller than I expected but overall I&#x27;m quite happy with them. I will update my post if I run into any quality issues.</li>
    <li> I was buying these clips as a gift for my niece.  Some of the flowers were so poorly made they didn&#x27;t look like flowers but ribbon glued to a clip in a rather messy circular fashion.  I gave her 5 of the clips that I found to be some what acceptable in appearance but discarded the other 7.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t look as nice as the picture.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and they are really soft so they won&#x27;t irritate my daughters head. Perfect size for all of my girls ages 2-10. I even wear them!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My daughter loves this, they are the right size for a toddler.  Definitely  would recommend to others for purchase.  Great price for the item.</li>
    <li> Too cute! Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> These are great.  They are classy and chic and can complete the simplest of outfits or dress up and look formal and fancy.  The clips have a tulle backing sewn as a base and the clip is securely attached.  The colors are all as they appear in the picture.  This was a great deal on very versatile and darling clips.</li>
    <li> Adorable, a little different than your typical bows, and excellent quality. I will definitely buy another set in a different print.</li>
    <li> My daughter gets so many compliments on these. For the price they&#x27;re really great!</li>
    <li> so adorable nicely packaged. i really love the varity of colors theyre so perfect for any outfit. Just the right size.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what I asked myself when I opened the box and saw them.  Ridiculous!!!  I will not order that again.</li>
    <li> We got these to use in a clip in ponytail for a rapunzel costume.  I had to fight off my 9 year old from &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; them before Halloween.  They are very pretty and stay in place well.</li>
    <li> These are super cute hair clips for your daughter/granddaughter/niece. You need to fluff them up a little from being shipped but they look really nice. The gift box is nice too.</li>
    <li> Item is cheap made and way over priced. Pictures make them look a lot bigger than they are. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Thanks for selling these their adorable in the hair. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them just wished you had more colors.</li>
    <li> So cute and a great Value!</li>
    <li> Cute and not too big.  I loved the variety and clip held really well even at the amusement park</li>
    <li> They look a little cheap up close and are not perfect but they are very cute from a distance and they function well.</li>
    <li> Used this item for a baby shower &amp;#34;create a headband&amp;#34;  table. the mother to be loved it. Quality wad great and the item came quickly.</li>
    <li> Very cute for your little girl!</li>
    <li> Inconsistent quality.  Fabric is hanging off in chunks on some of the clips.  Some clips are more &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; than others.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clip for my 6 year old niece and she loves them!!!!! They are not too big but not too small either. Perfect size and reslly cute sets to pick from!!!!she has had them for over 3 moths and uses the frequently and their still in great condition..the glue really holds the flower and clip together!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love these! Great quality, beautiful colors! I&#x27;m thinking of picking up a few to have on hand for presents, as any little girl would adore these!</li>
    <li> I got the shabby chiffon flower clips to wear with my work outfits. They are very nice for the price. Some of them were kind of smashed, but I was about to straighten them out. They aren&#x27;t as big as I thought, but they look nice and I&#x27;ve gotten complements on them. They look nice on winter clothes too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that some of the colors doubled up and so I didn&#x27;t get all of the colors shown. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are still nice though and you can&#x27;t beat the price. :)</li>
    <li> Got the shabby chiffon flowers, they are precious. They look like after a while of some good, rough toddler play they might start to show some wear, but that&#x27;s why you buy lots and lots of bows and clippies anyway, so you&#x27;ve always got backups. All in all, good set for the price in a nice little box.</li>
    <li> Looks bad just being honest</li>
    <li> Super cute and a good variety. I gave these as a Christmas gift to my nieces. The girls loved them!</li>
    <li> This is a great assortment for ages 18 mos and up. I have three grand-girls ages 19 most to 7 years, and they all love these. There are enough in one box for everyone to share and be able to pick out what they like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are easy to use, even for a 4 year old child who wants to do it herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They appear well made - we&#x27;ve only had them a little while - but they look great.</li>
    <li> They are small but great to feminize very short hair</li>
    <li> The printed flowers turned out better than the solid but they&#x27;re pretty cute! They&#x27;ll make a great stocking stuffer for my 6 year old daughter. She has short hair so these flowers are the perfect size! Plus they arrived on time and that makes me a happy customer too!</li>
    <li> The flowers are very cute. Came with a nice variety. A little small for an adult to use but great for little girls!</li>
    <li> Better than expected; perfect as party favors for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party. Had plenty of leftovers for us to use. Good quality, stylish, pretty colors. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> These are so well made and adorable! My girls like to coordinate them with their outfits!</li>
    <li> Got them as a gift for a friend and she loves them! They&#x27;re small (A little smaller than I expected) and convenient. They look cute and love the variety!</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair clips after reading reviews and must admit, they are really cute hair clips, but I wish they were a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Good variety of colors &amp; patterns. We&#x27;ve used them all in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Some of them came with the &amp;#34;petal&amp;#34; partially tucked in to the back but a little tug got it loose and there wasn&#x27;t any damage.</li>
    <li> These hair pieces are great accessories. The only downside is that due to the material, it slightly disassembles itself.</li>
    <li> They are so cute! I just bought them for my best friend for christmas and when I saw them I liked them so much I ordered a set for me! :)</li>
    <li> Most of these flowers were nice but there was a few in the mix that looked like they we&#x27;re put together poorly.</li>
    <li> These hand made chiffon clips are beautiful. Not only do they look adorable on young baby girls, but I have also used them for my 7-year old as well. They come in a variety of colors and they are hand-made which is completely noticeable and appreciated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase. My fianc&amp;egrave; loves it when I wear flowers in my hair. He says they look beautiful. :)</li>
    <li> I wear these everyday, the variety is awesome. So is the workmanship</li>
    <li> While the flower clips are nice and well made, they&#x27;re much smaller than I anticipated. I do still think it&#x27;s a great deal and love the color variety, but the diameter is about the size of a small lime. It would help if the seller put a picture up that showed the bows to scale</li>
    <li> Not bad.  Pretty smashed when they arrived and I ended up with duplicate colors.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to attach to my baby&#x27;s headbands and they are the perfect size and colors! Most flowers/bows seem as though they&#x27;re trying to eat the baby&#x27;s head because they&#x27;re so big. These are big enough to grab your attention but not big enough to be bothersome. Love them!</li>
    <li> Cute and perfect size for my 6 month. Stays on tight enough but not super tight so child would be uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece. Love the variety. Also, the clips are a great quality. They look just like the pictures.</li>
    <li> The flowers are at best 2 inches and some seem to be even smaller. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like these bows for my 3 month old daughter. They are so adorable. They are high quality. Only complaint is the way they are packaged smashes them a bit.</li>
