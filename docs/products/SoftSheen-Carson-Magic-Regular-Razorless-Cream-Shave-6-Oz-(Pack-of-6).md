      <li>I MUST BE TOTALLY HONEST ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>well, not anymore since Magic Shaving Cream.  </li>

      <li>This is the best Hair removal for Black Men on the market.</li>

      <li>THIS ITEM WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE COMPANY WOULD REALLY TRY TO IMPROVE ON IT&#x27;S FORMULA FOR THE CREAM.</li>
      <li>they send you a blue one that&#x27;s no where near as good in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Never experienced a better lookin&#x27; bald before... takes only minutes in my own place,works for hidden places too, moonshining best.</li>
      <li>Truly sad about this formerly excellent product.</li>
      <li>The newer Magic Shave Cream in the blue tube, does&#x27;t work as well.</li>

      <li>Using traditional or electric razors typically leave me with razor bumps, so this product is a great alternative.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You really have to slather it on and leave on the designated amount of time.</li>
      <li>Customers be aware you are not going to get the gold label cream instead you will get the blue labels for beards.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t burn especially as much as the previous one i used.</li>
      <li>I imagine this varies a lot as a function of how sensitive your skin is though.</li>
      <li>Gone from the new ingredients are all but a couple of the natural oils and butters that were present in the old formula.</li>
      <li>Overall, results were decent and I&#x27;ve used again.</li>
      <li>It will clog it up if your not careful!</li>

<li> I would recommend it to and for all Black men.</li>

<li> false advertisement.</li>
<li> Now begins the sad search for a replacement.</li>
<li> OTHERWISE, I JUST CAN&#x27;T GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS AT ALL FOR NOW!  :(</li>

    <li> works great, .use it to shave my head every two days. don&#x27;t burn especially as much as the previous one i used.</li>
    <li> Never experienced a better lookin&#x27; bald before... takes only minutes in my own place,works for hidden places too, moonshining best.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she said that a Brazilian has never been easier.  Glides on smoothly and comes off easily (after 12 minutes).  She has recommended It to all her friends.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves the stuff! He swears by it and won&#x27;t use anything else. This will be an ongoing and regular purchase in our house. Be careful though to put something down in the sink. It will clog it up if your not careful!</li>
    <li> This is cheaper that getting it in the store and works well on my skin, this will be the way I get my shaving cream from now on.</li>
    <li> the one in the picture is not the one they send you. they send you a blue one that&#x27;s no where near as good in my opinion.  false advertisement. I&#x27;d put no stars if I could</li>
    <li> This stuff is great with no irritation whatsoever.  I have one hair that grows on my nose (believe it or not) . .  . well, not anymore since Magic Shaving Cream.  I put it on about five minutes before I shower and . . . what hair?</li>
    <li> This is great shave cream that works consistantly everytime. The newer Magic Shave Cream in the blue tube, does&#x27;t work as well. It burns the skin at 4 min or longer.</li>
    <li> Product works excellently, smooth clean shave</li>
    <li> Using traditional or electric razors typically leave me with razor bumps, so this product is a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, I find you need to leave it on for longer than the package recommends (I usually keep it on for 25-30 minutes instead of the recommended 9-15); the recommended time is usually not long enough to remove all of my facial hair. I imagine this varies a lot as a function of how sensitive your skin is though. Start out with the recommended time then leave it on longer if you need to.</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using Magic products for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> shipps in the blue color and not gold as displayed and does have a foul smell</li>
    <li> I MUST BE TOTALLY HONEST ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. AND THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO WHAT&#x27;S ADVERTISED ON IT! I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2 YRS.NOW, AND IT DOES NOT TAKE OFF HAIR IN 4 MINUTES AND DOES NOT KEEP IT OFF FOR 4 DAYS NEITHER. PERSONALLY, FOR THIS PRODUCT TO REMOVE ALMOST 90% OF THE HAIR IN MY FACE, I HAVE TO KEEP THE CREAM ON FOR AN HOUR! AND IN TWO DAYS TIME,GRAY HAIRS STARTS SHOWING UP AGAIN. THIS ITEM WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE COMPANY WOULD REALLY TRY TO IMPROVE ON IT&#x27;S FORMULA FOR THE CREAM. BY IMPLEMENTING HAIR ROOT GROWTH INHIBITORS IN THE CREAM FORMULA, THAT WOULD KILL OUT THE HAIR ROOT OVERTIME! OTHERWISE, I JUST CAN&#x27;T GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS AT ALL FOR NOW!  :(</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT, REMOVES ALL THE HAIRS FROM MY HEAD.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 20 years. It has worked better than advertised however this new update (navy blue/white tube) burns me terribly after only a couple of minutes on my face. Did the allergy test and no issues there. Truly sad about this formerly excellent product. Gone from the new ingredients are all but a couple of the natural oils and butters that were present in the old formula. Now begins the sad search for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the correct cream. Instead of the gold label bald head cream I received the blue label cream for beards. My boyfriend is beyond pissed. Thanks for false advertising the gold label bald head cream. Customers be aware you are not going to get the gold label cream instead you will get the blue labels for beards.</li>
    <li> This is the best Hair removal for Black Men on the market. I would recommend it to and for all Black men.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and used this in the private regions. Used a shaver to get as short as possible and then used this. You really have to slather it on and leave on the designated amount of time. Overall, results were decent and I&#x27;ve used again. Using a couple of times per week keeps everything really smooth. Though after a few weeks I stop for a while as with extended use it gets a little burny on the sac.</li>
    <li> I use this every day for a smooth and clean shave.  This was a regular scent however it is not as strong a smell as it use to be.  Great product.</li>
