<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smells a bit like chocolate.  I am glad it&#x27;s not pungent.  I tasted it out the bag it has no flavor.  I will use it to make chocolate.</li>
    <li> Really good quality to make chocolate. very satisfied</li>
    <li> Have not used in recipe yet, but goes on skin smoothly and has only soft pure chocolate smell.</li>
    <li> Yum!  I used this for chocolate and to make body products.  And honestly, it tastes good all by itself!  Great product. Shipping was fast also.</li>
    <li> I bought this for making chocolate and the taste is not as good as others I have bought. The best description is that it tastes like shea butter smells. However, since it is supposed to be edible, the price is better than other options. I will probably stick to the slightly more expensive but better quality cocoa butter in the future and maybe use the rest of it as lotion or something.</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE COCOA LOVE!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. did not smell or taste like chocolate. at all should be no stars</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Great for the skin!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy ! I bought this for making homemade body cream/butters. It smells amazing!</li>
    <li> It has a delicious chocolate aroma. I may not know yet how to handle it but this cocoa butter becomes oil real fast even at a very low temperature. It may be excellent to assist chocolate making but I purchased it to make oil based colors. Because it becomes liquid the colors show transparent rather than opaque so it becomes hard to see what the actual color is. Also it leaves a tiny residue as the oil powder color I used would not dissolve in it completely.</li>
    <li> First let me say that my order arrive on time and i was very please with the way the item was package. it looked and smelled very fresh, I haven&#x27;t tried this product but I  will be sure to write a review when I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m was very happy.  My package arrived quickly and the cocoa butter smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent for making homemade chocolate! !</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase more when I need it. This smells like chocolate :-) I made lotion bars with it and I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It made some really nice lavender body butter,</li>
    <li> Best Cocoa Butter I&#x27;ve ordered so far off Amazon. It stinks cause you can&#x27;t get prime with this but it&#x27;s worth it. However It would be awesome if they raised the price a little and made it prime! It doesn&#x27;t however taste all that great, kinda taste like eating lotion, contrary to other statements on here for this particular Cocoa Butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent condition when it arrived. Exactly what I was wanting. Now I can make my own &amp;#34;Magnum&amp;#34; bars</li>
    <li> Love it! Use for all natural body butters and it is so wonderful! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> Lovely, thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice and will buy it again.  It smells amazing, melts beautifully, and tastes wonderful.  I have used it for cooking (homemade chocolate bars turned out great!), as a body butter ingredient, and straight out of the bag for skin moisturization.</li>
    <li> Packed in 2 labeled tubs, ordered a quarts worth. Smelled wonderful! It definitely seemed unprocessed as it came shipped in large chunks. It melted down pretty well though for when I made some homemade body butter.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price, good shipping!</li>
    <li> love love love love love love love it! smells chocolatey. and is definitely the cocoa butter i know and love. used it today when i received it. even the fruit flies wanted sommadis! used it on my 2 year old baby&#x27;s hair. love it. makes me feel au naturale.</li>
    <li> Good healthy source. Fast service.</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is great quality - smells sooo good 😉</li>
    <li> Happy with what I received. No complaints.  Read some reviews that it smelled like chocolate. Mine did not smell at all like chocolate. Smelled like raw Shea butter. But that doesn&#x27;t even matter to me...I wasn&#x27;t buying for the smell.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got the package I could smell the Chocolaty goodness!!!  It was double bagged which was great.  They were in chunks, which I dont mind.  The best part was the amazing smell!!!  All evening I kept opening the bag and just breathing in that delicious aroma.  I made some body butter, mixing it with Shea Butter, almond oil and coconut oil and it turned out amazing!!  It melts right in and moisturizes.  I am very very pleased with this Cocoa Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I just ordered more...I will definitely be a repeat customer!  Everyone that has used the body butters I make with it... has LOVED it**</li>
    <li> Used it for lip balm and lotion bars. Smells so good! Good price too. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great price for organic cocoa butter...assuming it really is organic!</li>
    <li> It came quickly and smelled delicious. I mixed it with a couple more natural products and I have a great skin moisturizer. I will re-order from here when I run out.</li>
    <li> I make my own organic lotion and this product works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and price of this cocoa butter.  I use it to make soaps and body butters, so I plan to order more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve purchased this before. It&#x27;s always nice and rich in color. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  used as (food) grade and as a cosmetic  product excellent on both counts.Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Got this to use a body lotion bar. I must say it works great for that. And since this product can be stored for 2 to 3 years in the fridge I would rate this A Plus</li>
    <li> It was awesome. I love my cocoa butter.  It was fresh and wrapped properly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend and she is very pleased with quality and fast shipment!</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAZING !  If you are looking to put scent in any products using this cocoa butter you will have to work with the existing chocolate aroma of this product.  Its warm and yummy.  The quality of the product is just fine with me. Im using it for soaps and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful!  So glad I purchased it.  I made body butter with along with Shea Butter, Coconut Butter.</li>
    <li> This is one of the more affordable edible cocoa butter products online.  Since it&#x27;s food grade, you can use it on your body too (you can&#x27;t use body cocoa butter for food though).  My friend uses melted cocoa butter to prevent pregnancy stretch marks.  Smells so yummy like a dark chocolate candy bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made white chocolate using this, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out the perfect recipe for white chocolate ganache using cocoa butter.  I made 14 ounces of white chocolate and added 5 cups of cream.  It&#x27;s still more solid than I prefer for ganache, but it&#x27;s so tasty.  I&#x27;ll have to keep tweaking for ganache, but the white chocolate is so nice....not as sweet as the store bought.  This is the recipe I used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•1 C. (8 oz.) Food Grade Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;•1 C. Confectioner’s Sugar (10x Sugar)&lt;br /&gt;•1/4 C. Powdered Milk (finely ground)&lt;br /&gt;•1 Tbsp vanilla paste (I like the specks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melt the cocoa butter then add the other ingredients.  You can refrigerate your concoction or let it cool on the counter.  I prefer to make it no more than 1/2 inch thick because it can be a mouthful.  Adjust for your preferred level of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this has a pale yellow tint when solid and it&#x27;s a strong yellow when melted.  Do not expect to get a pure white from this product.</li>
    <li> This seems to be excellent cocoa butter.  It is raw and unprocessed, so it has a wonderful chocolately smell.  If you&#x27;re looking to use a significant amount of this in a recipe, be advised that the chocolate smell will overpower most other scents, so plan to use this for a project where the smell of chocolate is a big factor.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cocoa butter brand I&#x27;ve tried yet. I has a great aroma, it&#x27;s fresh and taste raw. It&#x27;s great for making homemade chocolate which I do often. I melt it, add cocoa powder, stevia and some raisins and chopped almonds. It&#x27;s food grade. I&#x27;ve contacted the company to verify. I&#x27;ve come across a few brands on amazon and ebay which have tasted like soap or had a perfume scent. I&#x27;ve purchased this a bunch of time and SAAQIN has been excellent. Using Christmas molds I&#x27;ve made Santa chocolates and Santa Vanilla and Chocolate lolly pops. It also make great homemade reese&#x27;s peanut butter cups.</li>
    <li> excellent smell and quality</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and leaves my skin so soft</li>
    <li> so far so good.  Love the quality of the product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great quality. I would definitely recommend them!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews about similar products, I feel that this one is the real thing.  And it smells heavenly!  Packaged well and received quickly.  I have used it already to make a body balm and it feels wonderful.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my homemade hand lotion. The smell is amazing. The recipe I have requires essential oil for added scent. I don&#x27;t have to use any because this Cocoa Butter smells so amazing you want to eat it!</li>
    <li> excellent, pure cocoa</li>
    <li> I really love this product and it smells so delicious too.. it makes my skin very soft and smooth.. I love it also because it is mild enough to use on my 4 year old.</li>
    <li> I use this with coconut oil and sweet almond oil to make my Coconut Dream Body Butter! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good.</li>
