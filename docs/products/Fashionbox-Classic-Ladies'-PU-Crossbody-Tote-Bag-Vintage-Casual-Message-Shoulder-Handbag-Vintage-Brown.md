<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is nice and has good quality.</li>
    <li> well, completely different as i think. colour, size, texture also different. it totally doesn&#x27;t worth those money.</li>
    <li> Lasted a week before it totally fell apart.</li>
    <li> i loved the bag and i planned to use is for school but it much smaller then the picure makes it appears to be</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting something I couldn&#x27;t put my smartphone inside. Once I received my purchase I was more then happy with the size. I can deal with the ok material since I got it at such a low buy. Can&#x27;t wait to use it l.</li>
    <li> much smaller than the picture and looks a bit cheap when your looking at it closely but it is cute from a distance.</li>
    <li> So cute but Fell apart in 2 weeks :(</li>
    <li> Clasp on the long strap broke within 3 days of receiving it. Tried to exchange it, but all that was offered was a return and a replacement would take a month. Kept it and paid to have it repaired myself. Only giving 2 stars because it&#x27;s really cute, just very poorly made.</li>
    <li> I love it! It has plenty of room for all my stuff and is super fashionable. The adjustable strap is great. The color of it is beautiful As well. Looks better than the picture.</li>
    <li> The purse is so small not what iwanted.the pictures are false advertising. I order it because I wanted and needed a big,large purse</li>
    <li> wore it once and the strap broke so now its only good as a hand bag which is annoying if its not the only thing in your hands.</li>
    <li> look like a vintage bag, but that must be buying what&#x27;s paid, the quality is a question</li>
    <li> The strap was to short to go cross body. Disappointed</li>
    <li> To be honest. I like it alot. Yeah it looks smaller in person than advertised, but that&#x27;s only the advertised with a small model. I&#x27;m small myself,  so on me it looks like a good size. I say this purse or tote bag fits with people who are around the height of 5&#x27;4.</li>
    <li> Strap is very short, could not wear it crossboady like I had intended. Also if you put more then 1 or 2 lbs of stuff in it, it keeps popping open.</li>
    <li> It is a scam, I get another product and not the one I bought</li>
    <li> Not at all as described. Much much smaller than shown in picture. I am keeping it for a small cross body. Othr</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the bag! I can already tell that it is going to last a very long time. It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
    <li> This bag has a cool design but oh gosh ...the wear has set in already :(. Apparently, there are some tiny screws which hold it together at the metal part and some of them are out already. By the way, the damage came within a week or two of having it.</li>
    <li> I like it but I only gave it three stars because it&#x27;s smaller than it looks at the pictures. Still pretty though.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than in the picture. Also, you can tell the leather is fake... It is really shiny. If I have too much stuff in it, it doesn&#x27;t stay closed and opens when I&#x27;m walking.</li>
    <li> I really love the concept of this bag, but in looks so cheap in person that I stopped using it after a few days. The decoration on the closure looks like it was bought at a hobby store and glued on. The bag is quite large, which is nice, and the color will match anything, but it really only looks good from far away. I may give it to my niece to play dress up with or something.</li>
    <li> I waited about a month for this bag. I didn&#x27;t really mind since I wasn&#x27;t in any rush to get it. I was happy to see that it looked just like the picture though, it&#x27;s so cute! My favorite thing about this bag is definitely the closure, it just looks so cool. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> This s***ty bag fell apart within a month of having it. Not happy with this purchase.. at all. You really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> COMPLETELY SMALL! LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE! COMES WITH WEIRD CIRCLE STRING TO MAKE IT A CROSS BODY BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO PUT IT TOGETHER! IT LOOKS HORRIBLE! I HATE IT! RETURNING IT IMMEDIATELY!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed, this bag looks cheap .</li>
    <li> It was cheaply made and started falling apart day one</li>
    <li> This bag fall apart in a month and a half. I will recommend you save your money.</li>
    <li> send me a return staus thank you its ulgy as sin yuck i hate hate plastic send me a returns slips for 2 ullgy</li>
    <li> I love it but it came broken. The clasp is coming apart from the purse. I&#x27;m really sad about it because I love the style.</li>
    <li> Super cute, and fun! Very roomy and adorable!</li>
    <li> The bag is super cute but was sad to find out that it was WAY smaller than it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this bag the material is amazing!</li>
    <li> nice enough quality&lt;br /&gt;nice still&lt;br /&gt;is a purse not a tote. Bag is smaller than it appears on the picture&lt;br /&gt;over priced for size and quality</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! Just as advertised fast delivery as well!</li>
    <li> For the price of this purse, I was a little worried. Took a long time to receive but when it finally came, it exceeded my expectations. This purse is spacious without being bulky. The quality of materials are not cheap looking either. Love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very professional. The clips work very well. I&#x27;m loving it, no complain so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but made with cheap materials</li>
    <li> Excellent products!!!!</li>
    <li> Not even close to the size shown.  Much smaller.</li>
    <li> I thought it was more big, but i like it anyway . The color is great, easy to combine. I recomend the seller.</li>
    <li> Kinda cheap feeling but its still super cute, durable, and looks great. Looks exactly as the pic. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> bag was SO much smaller than advertised. I do like it which is why I am keeping it but it is Half the size then what was shown. not happy about that. wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It looks too cheap, not impressed at all. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> While its super cute in the picture it seems poorly put together when you actually have it. Its NOT a tote. And it DOES NOT STAY CLOSED. If you have a lot of stuff in yojr purses like a normal girl, don&#x27;t expect this purse to be able to hold it. It will keep popping open and its ANNOYING. There&#x27;s my two cents.</li>
    <li> Hate it purse does not look like it look on the picture</li>
    <li> I only had this purse for 2 weeks and the straps broke</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments, but I do wish the pockets inside were bigger</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;m barley reading all the reviews and I should have read them before I purchased it! All the little screws fell out within a couple days, I tried using a glue gun to glue the screws in but that only helped for a week at most!! Such a cute purse but a waste of money since I can&#x27;t even use it anymore. Bad quality for sure.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the money. From the reviews I expected it to be smaller but it&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Love the size and the roomy inside.</li>
    <li> Waaayyy smaller than advertised!  I wanted it for a book bag but I can&#x27;t even use it for a very small pocketbook because it looks incredibly cheap! I sent it back immediately!</li>
    <li> This purse really is gorgeous. It takes a long time to ship and is smaller than perceived in the picture, but for its price it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and receive compliments on it constantly!</li>
    <li> As everyone said, smaller than it appears in photo! Clutch at top come open easily, but the detail is very cute! Not terrible for a $17 bag!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this bag as a true tote!  What a disappointment!!!!  This bag, being called a tote, is the size of a purse!!! It is probably 1/2 the size that is represented here, the picture must have been of another &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34; or taken with a small child wearing it.  NO it must be a different bag because it is the most fake looking vinyl ever and the detail of the clasp, not even close.  I am thoroughly disappointed and it came with no paper work to send it back...who knows how much that would cost me any way.  NOT HAPPY!</li>
    <li> The bag is super cute, super upset about the fact that it appeas way bigger on here than in real life. :/ keeping it but would&#x27;ve actually likeD it bigger</li>
    <li> Adore everything about this bag. Read some reviews after I purchased it and figured it would be smaller but it was actually bigger. I love the size and the length of the straps. I especially love the added strap to give it more length. Love love love it&#x27;s color and added decorations. Would definitely recommend to others!!</li>
    <li> Stitching fell apart. Very cheep make, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to finally received it. However, I was disappointed that it was smaller than I thought.  I decided to keep it anyway.</li>
    <li> Way way smaller then advertised, the color is flat and the kiss lock&lt;br /&gt;is off center as well. I&#x27;m  totally unhappy. Yes I know it was only $17.00 but it should at least be the size anticipated. Not cool!</li>
    <li> The material is good but in the picture it seems big but when I received it , it was way too small for me.</li>
    <li> Really cute, came faster than expected...it&#x27;s a little smaller than I had pictured ( but that&#x27;s my fault).</li>
    <li> Bag was ripped when I recieved it 😩</li>
    <li> much smaller than pictured, fell apart after 1 week of use, material is very cheap looking</li>
    <li> I like this bag and it arrived sooner then expected.It isn&#x27;t a big bag but I knew that when I ordered it.It can be used as a cross body or carried by the handle that comes with it.It holds everything I need and it&#x27;s pretty,I love the &#x27;old fashioned clasp&#x27;Also very comfortable to carry cross body.I&#x27;m really happy with it and glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> great little bag for the price --</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would be bigger than it was..guess I should&#x27;ve looked at the specs; oh well its still cute!!</li>
    <li> The side broke off of the metal part on top within one week. And even before that it never stayed closed even when it was empty. So cute but disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, expecting it to be like the picture but it is actually very small, almost a handbag. I felt cheated</li>
    <li> It was a well received present.</li>
    <li> Great vintage look.....</li>
    <li> Love it but very small, in picture purse looks much,much,bigger</li>
    <li> I like the style as it is very roomy inside.  I do wish the inside pockets were a little deeper to handle sunglasses.  They aren&#x27;t wide enough either. I do like the outside decor representing the &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as large as the picture makes it out to be, but it&#x27;s still a good size by my standards. You can definitely fit a good amount of stuff in this bag, without it being too large and bulky. The quality isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s good for its price. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is roughly comparable to a size 5 soccer ball, except it&#x27;s a bit bigger in what it&#x27;ll hold.</li>
    <li> Stiff and the handle is too long for my shoulder and really too short for cross body. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product !!!! Soooooooo Much smaller than the pictures shows no fair thought It was a good deal at first until I received the purse in the mail false advertisement at best!!!!!!!!!! If you want a small purse then you might like this one but its made poorly and to me not Worth the money paid for it as I was expecting what was in the photos!!!!!!!!: (</li>
    <li> the photo leads you to believe that this messenger bag is much larger than it actually is.  I purchased this because I started a new job in which i need to carry binders and folders for special needs children to and from class with them.  This appeared to be large enough to facilitate that need.  What i received when I opened the box was a very large coin purse.  It was smaller than my coach bag.  It was beautiful and very well constructed but I could barely fit my wallet and lipstick in there, much less a binder and notebook.  With a broken heart, i had to send this item back.  I wonder if i got the refund for it.... hmm....have to check on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want a purse, something to hold a small amount of things, this is actually perfect and very cute.  if you want a messenger bag though, keep looking.</li>
    <li> Quite hand bag it&#x27;s not what I expected but is quite</li>
    <li> I originally loved this bag, but after a month or so, it started to fall apart. The clips on the strap broke a few weeks after I had gotten it, but honestly, I wasn&#x27;t too stressed out. I just fixed it with two key-rings. Next was the cloth on the inside. Holes were forming in the bottom corners. Basically the whole purse is falling through, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this one in particular. I was greatly disappointed, having first thought this purse was very adorable and vintage.</li>
    <li> Fake leather, totally isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34;- it&#x27;s not old at all.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose really nice for the price</li>
    <li> The strap broke very easily but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter and within 2 weeks or so it literally came apart at the seams. Cheap cheap cheap. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Keep up the good work</li>
    <li> i hate this bag. made cheap, paper leather, closure not even. you should not be able to sell something like this.</li>
    <li> No the leather looks cheap.  I was quite disappointed.  I should have returned it</li>
    <li> I rated this one star based on the false size advertising from the picture. I purchased this bag solely based on the size in the picture because I thought it would hold my notebooks for when I am out in the community visiting with my clients in their home. The size was a total let down as I was anticipating my large sized tote bag, not purse. This is false advertising. Next time I will read the reviews before ordering.</li>
    <li> The purse is stiff. Not only is it small but the clasp is like a fake metal almost plastic. I&#x27;m scared to even carry this out of the house because I worried of ripping or breaking.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I got it so much soon than what was said.  It is smaller than I hoped but it came with 2 strapes and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to keep the small one but so far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The picture is better than the purse really is.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeee this bag. I don&#x27;t even think I can explain how much I love this bag. Got it in maybe 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve used every day since then. Perfect for a mother like myself who wants to throw it over the shoulder and not have to worry about carrying it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is cause I had to readjust the balls alil so it wouldn&#x27;t pop open all the time. Very easy fix tho.</li>
    <li> great gift for any occassions .... love the quality,size, color and the style is just unque... great for anytime....</li>
    <li> This purse broke within days of using it. I was so sad!</li>
    <li> This is just as it looks.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!! NOT a messenger bag at all.  Just a large purse.  Can NOT be used for a briefcase.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The inside is definitely deep enough.  Easy access, while on your body, to get at anything inside &amp; safer too.  My phone, sunglasses, pens, etc., were constantly falling out of my other purses that had side pockets.  The price was great!  If only it could have been real leather, but, it  still looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> I did not like it as it was very cheap looking and the clasp does not work well</li>
