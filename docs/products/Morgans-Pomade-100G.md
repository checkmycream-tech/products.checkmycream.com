### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This is one of the very best bair product  in corculation since some time now, I  hope the did not change the recipe</li>
      <li>For stronger hair Morgan is one of the best hair cream money can buy.</li>
      <li>Superb pomade for men with graying hair.  </li>
      <li>They keep their promise and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best thing to use and the price is amazing</li>
      <li>But it works great for my hair loss.</li>
      <li>Now that I myself am in mid-life, I am using this product with great results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I can tuck it away and it looks very nice.</li>
      <li>Also, the smell is not so pleasant.</li>
      <li>Feels good on the hair too, makes hair manageable.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied!</li>
      <li>Great product and i like it very much.</li>
      <li>It functions well as a very light pomade.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased.  </li>
      <li>Excellent hair product, for dry scalp and greys.</li>
      <li>It gives my a lovely glow and easy 2 comb.</li>
      <li>This product is usually sold out quickly so it is best to purchase more than one.</li>
      <li>It smells very old school but in a good way.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s important to you not to have the pomade rub off on pillowcases, try using this pomade with an inexpensive pillowcase you don&#x27;t care about and see if it rubs off or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Guess she will have to use it to r much longer time to see a more substantial change.</li>
      <li>I was also able to choose where to apply this so my temples could have just a bit of grey but the rest of my hair would be a much more youthful color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>now use this product about twice a week to maintain the appearance of my hair and I can wash my hair much more frequently.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it imparts color as much as it conditions it so completely that it loses that bright white-gray and blends in nicely.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for more than ten years</li>
      <li>I avoided the embarrassment of having \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; hair one day (and believe me, there was more salt than pepper) and darker hair the next day!</li>
      <li>Has great smell and last long.</li>
      <li>I had my first hair dye a couple of months before I got this.</li>
      <li>My younger sister has a lot more gray hairs than I do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use; I started by applying it to my hair after washing it in the shower and letting it dry.</li>
      <li>Preferred when it was available as a &amp;#34;Hair Cream&amp;#34; in their famous Black Jars.</li>
      <li>I have used his product for more than two weeks and my grey hair has not been changed at all.</li>
      <li>I really wish you could get the cream as well as this pomade in the USA.</li>
      <li>Most of the time just use stuff that makes it looks wet.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really like it to much</li>
      <li>This hair was much grayer than the rest of my hair and had gotten very wiry.  </li>
      <li>and I have found that it &amp;#34;dresses&amp;#34; the hair very well.</li>
      <li>I really like Morgans, it provides tremendous hold but is very lightweight, has a nice scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t accomplish the end-game that I hope for as yet, but I have a second jar and will be using it daily for a better end-result.</li>
      <li>Nice product, for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth getting, same quality if not better than pom pomade that&#x27;s avgv</li>
      <li>tried it for 4 weeks and no luck, i am Irish, pale with dark brown hair and graying temples, should be perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I recommend that you rub the pomade into your hair roots and then comb your hair the way you normally would.</li>
      <li>; -- that is a more typically male style, but I use it to smooth the hair down just in the area above and in front of my ears</li>
      <li>I usually apply some at night after a shower and it stays in nice for the next day</li>
      <li>Roughly three weeks after starting to use Morgan&#x27;s Pomade (and not washing my hair more than two or three times a week during that time) I got the desired effect: no grey hair except where I wanted it!</li>
      <li>Only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since I was 20 years old, over 21 years ago.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for people who wish to color their hair in a much more natural fashion than an abrupt overnight dye that could get messy unless you spend a lot of money at a men&#x27;s hair stylist shop.</li>
      <li>This product very slowly darkens the gray and keeps the hair looking healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and it appears the issue may be i&#x27;m not in the sun much and when i am it&#x27;s in a pool and the chlorine probably takes it out.</li>
      <li>also, the other reviews mentioned staining on pillows and such, i didn&#x27;t notice anything like that, even with it not resolving the gray it worked well as a pomade, actually very well.</li>
      <li>It calmed down the hair and reduced the gray metallic color so that it gives the appearance of being much darker.  </li>

<li> It has a little bit of a smell (not great, but not horrible), but it seems to work with helping hide the gray hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a subtle improvement and very inexpensive!</li>
<li> it also darkens grey areas gradually.</li>
<li> It only made my hair little shinning as regular gel.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m a little self conscious if other people can smell it while I&#x27;m in the car with them.</li>
<li> I got this for my grey hair, it helps if leave it on but greasy, not much after wash.</li>
<li> I would avoid using other types of dying such other pomades and hair coloring products.</li>
<li> The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because it has a slight medicine smell to it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately after a couple weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference on my grey hairs.</li>
<li> It also adds a luster than is not that phony shiny that some other pomades create.</li>
<li> But can&#x27;t return due to 30 days return policy.</li>
<li> Morgan&#x27;s Pomade helped my father conceal his greying hair for quite a few years until he gradually used less and less of it to let it go grey on his terms!</li>
<li> Only concern is if it has some chemical that is not good for your health of your skin or any other effects.</li>
<li> I kept using it as instructed for a half year.</li>
<li> Anyways, it seems to blend in easier with my black hair.</li>
<li> I notice a little bit of change.</li>
<li> Now they seem to be an off white maybe like a dirty white maybe.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I just started the product a few days ago.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
<li> After using this product, I&#x27;ve lost at least 90% less hair than before.</li>
<li> so the smell is usually gone by then.</li>
<li> Other members of family and freinds that I have recommended this product now know the secret to keeping gray hair away.</li>
<li> It has no help for my gray hair, even a little!!</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a dramatic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It smells like cloves, not at all unpleasant.  </li>

    <li> Morgan&#x27;s Pomade helped my father conceal his greying hair for quite a few years until he gradually used less and less of it to let it go grey on his terms! Now that I myself am in mid-life, I am using this product with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use; I started by applying it to my hair after washing it in the shower and letting it dry. I recommend that you rub the pomade into your hair roots and then comb your hair the way you normally would. I would avoid using other types of dying such other pomades and hair coloring products. Roughly three weeks after starting to use Morgan&#x27;s Pomade (and not washing my hair more than two or three times a week during that time) I got the desired effect: no grey hair except where I wanted it! I avoided the embarrassment of having \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; hair one day (and believe me, there was more salt than pepper) and darker hair the next day! I was also able to choose where to apply this so my temples could have just a bit of grey but the rest of my hair would be a much more youthful color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this product about twice a week to maintain the appearance of my hair and I can wash my hair much more frequently. I am quite satisfied! I don&#x27;t even have to use gloves to apply it; and it adds luster without being overly shiny just as another reviewer notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want, you can also use this pomade as a type of gel to also style your hair although I use it to simply color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Morgan&#x27;s Pomade rubbing off on things like pillow cases, some people say it does and others say it doesn&#x27;t--this may actually vary from user to user. If it&#x27;s important to you not to have the pomade rub off on pillowcases, try using this pomade with an inexpensive pillowcase you don&#x27;t care about and see if it rubs off or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for people who wish to color their hair in a much more natural fashion than an abrupt overnight dye that could get messy unless you spend a lot of money at a men&#x27;s hair stylist shop. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product works. It keeps hair in place without being greasy. it also darkens grey areas gradually.</li>
    <li> Superb pomade for men with graying hair.  This product very slowly darkens the gray and keeps the hair looking healthy. It also adds a luster than is not that phony shiny that some other pomades create.</li>
    <li> My grandparents used to use this. I just thought they did not have gray hair. My younger sister has a lot more gray hairs than I do. I got this for her. I notice a little bit of change. Guess she will have to use it to r much longer time to see a more substantial change.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Has great smell and last long. Only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. Currently testing alternatives that cost $2</li>
    <li> They keep their promise and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I just started the product a few days ago. I don&#x27;t have any comments on it now. I will review when I see some result.</li>
    <li> I really wish you could get the cream as well as this pomade in the USA. Great product! I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and my hair darkened gradually. It&#x27;s a subtle improvement and very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I am a female who wanted something to darken and condition the hair at my temples and sideburns.  This hair was much grayer than the rest of my hair and had gotten very wiry.  I have been using Morgan&#x27;s for about two months and I am pleased.  It calmed down the hair and reduced the gray metallic color so that it gives the appearance of being much darker.  I don&#x27;t think it imparts color as much as it conditions it so completely that it loses that bright white-gray and blends in nicely.  It smells like cloves, not at all unpleasant.  It is a pomade (e.g. hair grease) so that is why it is advertised &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; -- that is a more typically male style, but I use it to smooth the hair down just in the area above and in front of my ears so I can tuck it away and it looks very nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best bair product  in corculation since some time now, I  hope the did not change the recipe</li>
    <li> I got this for my grey hair, it helps if leave it on but greasy, not much after wash. But it works great for my hair loss. I had my first hair dye a couple of months before I got this. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of hair every time I wash or comb my hair. After using this product, I&#x27;ve lost at least 90% less hair than before. There&#x27;s a dramatic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a week, just leave it on for a day or overnight, then wash it off. It works like a wonder.</li>
    <li> It smells very old school but in a good way.  It functions well as a very light pomade.  Unfortunately after a couple weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference on my grey hairs.</li>
    <li> Been searching for different stuff for a while to darken my salt and pepper hair. Most of the time just use stuff that makes it looks wet. Doesn&#x27;t look as gray like that. Saw this Pomade and said why not. Well I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now and it seems to be working. My white strands of hair around my forehead don&#x27;t seem to be as white as they were before. Now they seem to be an off white maybe like a dirty white maybe. Anyways, it seems to blend in easier with my black hair. Feels good on the hair too, makes hair manageable. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because it has a slight medicine smell to it. Don&#x27;t really like it to much and if your outside and the wind hits your hair you can smell it. I will say the smell tends to go away after awhile. I carpool so I&#x27;m a little self conscious if other people can smell it while I&#x27;m in the car with them. I usually apply some at night after a shower and it stays in nice for the next day so the smell is usually gone by then. It&#x27;s winter time and your suppose to be in the sun to darken the hair faster, so I cant wait to see if the sun actually helps. Anyways so for now I give this product two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> tried it for 4 weeks and no luck, i am Irish, pale with dark brown hair and graying temples, should be perfect for me. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and it appears the issue may be i&#x27;m not in the sun much and when i am it&#x27;s in a pool and the chlorine probably takes it out. i will try again after my next haircut and report back. also, the other reviews mentioned staining on pillows and such, i didn&#x27;t notice anything like that, even with it not resolving the gray it worked well as a pomade, actually very well.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t accomplish the end-game that I hope for as yet, but I have a second jar and will be using it daily for a better end-result.</li>
    <li> It seems to help darken the gray hair without making it greasey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, helps to control the hair similar to a mousse.</li>
    <li> I have used his product for more than two weeks and my grey hair has not been changed at all. It made my hair looking greasy, so I have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. But he does not like as it is oily.</li>
    <li> This is the same product that I remember in Ireland and the West Indies. It works well on darkening the hair and keeping it well groomed and neat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t have any effect on gray hair at all.</li>
    <li> Nice product, for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth getting, same quality if not better than pom pomade that&#x27;s avgv 18$, would purchase again. and probably again.</li>
    <li> The hair got sticky after applied this. Also, the smell is not so pleasant. After I tried a couple of times, I gave up.</li>
    <li> Great product and i like it very much. Other members of family and freinds that I have recommended this product now know the secret to keeping gray hair away.</li>
    <li> I really like Morgans, it provides tremendous hold but is very lightweight, has a nice scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and I have found that it &amp;#34;dresses&amp;#34; the hair very well. Preferred when it was available as a &amp;#34;Hair Cream&amp;#34; in their famous Black Jars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 20 years old, over 21 years ago. For stronger hair Morgan is one of the best hair cream money can buy.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I placed order of 8. I think it will work on my gray hair. I kept using it as instructed for a half year. It only made my hair little shinning as regular gel. It has no help for my gray hair, even a little!! I&#x27;m so disappointed. I still have 6 unopened. But can&#x27;t return due to 30 days return policy. It may work for someone but not for all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. If you want to try, just buy one to see if it works.</li>
    <li> It has a little bit of a smell (not great, but not horrible), but it seems to work with helping hide the gray hair.  My husband approves.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product, for dry scalp and greys. This product is usually sold out quickly so it is best to purchase more than one.</li>
    <li> This Pomade works for my hair.  Will keep reordering. Only concern is if it has some chemical that is not good for your health of your skin or any other effects. Been using it for more than ten years and it still works if i apply it every day.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the best thing to use and the price is amazing</li>
    <li> Just started using it. It gives my a lovely glow and easy 2 comb. Perhaps, I&#x27;ll have a different review after a while. So far, so good.</li>
