      <li>This is perfect for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>Perfect for my blushes now i have more space for more!!!</li>

      <li>good to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size and is way easier to store than a bunch of plastic cases.</li>
      <li>loved it , deeper for mineral make up items</li>
      <li>The original sizes are great though!</li>
      <li>Also wish the packaging was more attractive.</li>
      <li>Some items (mostly MAC) would not stick, so I used the enclosed metal stickers and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I want to order more now!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love my Z Palette!</li>
      <li>and I now have room for more!</li>
      <li>I ended up getting 3 more!</li>
      <li>I was depoting some blushes that were domed and they fit great into them.</li>
      <li>That was nice.</li>
      <li>Nice palette but</li>
      <li>/&gt;A couple of tips: before you use one of the included magnet stickers, see if the container of shadow that you de-potted is magnetic on its own.</li>
      <li>The dome is nice for thicker pots or brushes.</li>
      <li>I liked it in the beginning, but it provided no protection for my Milani Baked Blushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be nice if makeup companies would do something like this for their lines of shadow so you could put the ones you wanted or use the most together.</li>
      <li>I am completely stunned as to the excellent reviews of this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an eyeshadow whore, and this case just gives me more excuses to buy more and more shades!</li>
      <li>Very good, but mainly for your baked/domed bronzers/blushes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t squish them and it&#x27;s stylish and lasts a while.</li>
      <li>I love my baked blushes, bronzers, powders, shadows.  </li>
      <li>It will take quite a bit of make up to fill this up - much more than I use.  </li>
      <li>I love Z Palettes they are a life and space saver.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to depot my MAC MSF and have a palette to keep them better organized in, but after I got them in the palette, the lid wouldn&#x27;t close.</li>
      <li>If you LOVE makeup....</li>
      <li>I love that you can see what makeup you have in there and can organize the palette yourself.</li>
      <li>LOVE my Zpalettes.</li>
      <li>This is a phenomenal product.</li>
      <li>I now have more room on my makeup table now that I got rid of a ton of eyeshadow compacts.....</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>It was a bit more durable than I was expecting since some reviews were complaining about it made of cardboard.</li>
      <li>The fact that you can see in thru the clear top is great</li>
      <li>was able to fit all of my Milani baked</li>
      <li>I just thought it would feel more secure &amp; substantial.</li>
      <li>your makeup is kind of a process, but it&#x27;s worth it- by putting all my eyeshadows together</li>
      <li>Easy to use and comes with instructions on how to depot</li>
      <li>Also, the magnets that come with it don&#x27;t seem to be too strong.</li>
      <li>I think I fit about 9 or something like that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here is what fit in each:&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
      <li>and this fit almost all of them.</li>
      <li>This is a great idea especially for traveling.</li>
      <li>Also feel like the lid is not that secure</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t toss it like I can with items in their original case.</li>
      <li>Any makeup can be placed in the palette via original pots (magnetic dots &amp; squares are included) or pans can be ordered additionally.</li>
      <li>The quality is good, it&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but the magnet isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep items from sliding around.</li>
      <li>Definitely gave me a lot more space!</li>
      <li>It has helped free up so much space, and gives me the freedom to customize my looks into one location.</li>
      <li>I love how professional it looks and that I can customize it any way I want.</li>
      <li>It was nice to consolidate, and get rid of the extra bulk.</li>
      <li>Just the right size.</li>
      <li>This was my first z palette purchase.</li>
      <li>It is bigger than I was expecting so be sure to check the measurements.</li>
      <li>and I love how deep it is because some eyeshadows are taller than others!</li>
      <li>There is no way this product will last more than a couple of months of travel.  </li>
      <li>Love the depth, wish it were bigger.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and was exactly as described</li>
      <li>I had so much fun arranging my new makeup in my palette.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend ordered this for me a few days ago and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
      <li>bought 2 different z-palettes (including this one), a few months ago and both are great.</li>
      <li>I am such a huge fan of these Z Palettes.</li>
      <li>The product seemed well made and very roomy.</li>
      <li>I really cleaned up the clutter on my bathroom counter, and they are a convenient size/shape for travel.</li>
      <li>I had so much baked blushes that were taking up space in my makeup drawer</li>
      <li>the magnets aren&#x27;t very sticky.</li>
      <li>This has saved so much room in my pro kit</li>
      <li>time I&#x27;m just sticking to these because even the regular shadows can fit in here.</li>
      <li>Really, $26 for something made of pressed cardboard that arrives with corners already creased?</li>
      <li>I was able to fit 4 benefit cosmetics box sets (2 small eye sets, 2 large &#x27;everything&#x27; sets), 1 UD Naked palette, 1 Laura Geller holiday blush/highlighter, and 1 Anastasia book of brows/eyes.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read more of the reviews because I would not have purchased one, much less two .  </li>
      <li>Also, if you have the same problem as me and drop makeup, and you broke the makeup itself, put a few drops of rubbing alcohol into the makeup and smooth it out and let it dry, and it&#x27;ll be good as new.</li>
      <li>So if your trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth the extra money, it is!</li>
      <li>So I had a bunch of perfectly good makeup that I had to keep in sandwich bags because the container was broken.</li>
      <li>and it still looks new.</li>
      <li>, I started to see new color combinations that I hadn&#x27;t thought of before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was exactly what I needed to get all my shadows in the same place so that I can see them, use them, mix them.</li>
      <li>has streamlined the way I get ready, SERIOUSLY saving time opening and shutting all the containers and looking for the right ones!!</li>
      <li>I have had it for over a year now and use it frequently</li>
      <li>I dropped it once and everything completely shattered.</li>
      <li>I also like the depth of this one because I can fit small brushes and puffs in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Additionally,  the whole &#x27;prying process&#x27; is a major problem for any pots that were not new.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because it was larger for not much more money but in my case bigger is not always better.  </li>
      <li>(they don&#x27;t come in metal pans, but rather a black plastic around the product as well), so the extra size is kind of a waste.</li>
      <li>A lot of mine were, so I&#x27;ve barely used any of the stickers.</li>
      <li>It does cost a little more than some of the other palettes but the others in my opinion are not of the same quality as the Z palette.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. These dome pallets are quite small. The dome is nice for thicker pots or brushes. I will be ordering the XL from now on and slowly depot everything to consolidate in pallets.</li>
    <li> Just a great, space-saving solution!!!</li>
    <li> I looked into this product initially because I always drop my plastic compacts or knock them off my bathroom counter and break them. So I had a bunch of perfectly good makeup that I had to keep in sandwich bags because the container was broken. This got really annoying after a while, mostly when it came to travel, so I&#x27;d end up buying new makeup just to have an intact compact (that I would inevitably break, what can I say, I&#x27;m clumsy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 different z-palettes (including this one), a few months ago and both are great. I really cleaned up the clutter on my bathroom counter, and they are a convenient size/shape for travel. I haven&#x27;t dropped one yet, but they don&#x27;t seem like they would break like a brittle plastic compact. I also like the depth of this one because I can fit small brushes and puffs in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;De-potting your makeup is kind of a process, but it&#x27;s worth it- by putting all my eyeshadows together, I started to see new color combinations that I hadn&#x27;t thought of before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips: before you use one of the included magnet stickers, see if the container of shadow that you de-potted is magnetic on its own. A lot of mine were, so I&#x27;ve barely used any of the stickers. Also, if you have the same problem as me and drop makeup, and you broke the makeup itself, put a few drops of rubbing alcohol into the makeup and smooth it out and let it dry, and it&#x27;ll be good as new.</li>
    <li> I bought this to depot my MAC MSF and have a palette to keep them better organized in, but after I got them in the palette, the lid wouldn&#x27;t close.</li>
    <li> Awesome case for ALL of my eyeshadows.  This palette is giant! I&#x27;m an eyeshadow whore, and this case just gives me more excuses to buy more and more shades! It was nice to consolidate, and get rid of the extra bulk. I like that the lid folds back behind the palette for ease.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but the magnet isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep items from sliding around. I can&#x27;t toss it like I can with items in their original case.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these, one for eyes and one for face.  I took all of my favorites out of their packaging and put them into the z palettes.  Some items (mostly MAC) would not stick, so I used the enclosed metal stickers and it worked great. Here is what fit in each:&lt;br /&gt;Face: The BALM bahama mama, The BALM Instain blush (x2), NARS blush, MAC pro shaping powder (x2), The BALM mary-loumanizer &amp; Revlon Transluscent powder.&lt;br /&gt;Eyes: Makeup Geek eyeshaddow pans (x7), MAC eyeshaddow pans (x6), Clinique small duo, and my whole Urban Decal Naked 2 palette!  I CAREFULLY broke the plastic Naked 2 palette out of the metal outer palette, trimmed the edges and it fits into the DOME z-palette.&lt;br /&gt;This has streamlined the way I get ready, SERIOUSLY saving time opening and shutting all the containers and looking for the right ones!!</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I was expecting so be sure to check the measurements. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> loved it , deeper for mineral make up items</li>
    <li> This was shipped in a timely manner.  I ordered this because it was larger for not much more money but in my case bigger is not always better.  I wanted the larger one thinking I could put some make up brushes in it too &amp; there is plenty of room for them.  Only problem is I still don&#x27;t have enough makeup to fill it up.  It will take quite a bit of make up to fill this up - much more than I use.  Also feel like the lid is not that secure so have to be careful not to turn it upside down.  I just thought it would feel more secure &amp; substantial.</li>
    <li> Really, $26 for something made of pressed cardboard that arrives with corners already creased? There is no way this product will last more than a couple of months of travel.  I wish I had read more of the reviews because I would not have purchased one, much less two .  There is no reason to pay extra for the deep domed version as it is still 1/16 of an inch too shallow for modern pots that have not been pried out.  Additionally,  the whole &#x27;prying process&#x27; is a major problem for any pots that were not new. Fortunately,  I only tried 4 of my pots using the oven method (thankfully) and 3 of them shattered before I gave up.  I am completely stunned as to the excellent reviews of this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea especially for traveling. I decided to try to remove some eye shadows and blush from their containers before I used this palette. A lot of them broke apart. The small eye shadows are delicate and powder and blush are bigger and also break. One of the shadow pans bent quite a bit before it came out.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if makeup companies would do something like this for their lines of shadow so you could put the ones you wanted or use the most together.</li>
    <li> The product seemed well made and very roomy. It was just too big for me. But that was my mistake and doesn&#x27;t reflect the quality of the product.  The domed top is really awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice palette but the magnets aren&#x27;t very sticky. A couple didn&#x27;t work. But overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> This was my first z palette purchase. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It was a bit more durable than I was expecting since some reviews were complaining about it made of cardboard. It&#x27;s thick. And it came with stick pans for makeup products that won&#x27;t stick to the magnet. That was nice.</li>
    <li> I like the Z-Palette for storing loose shadows, etc. I bought the dome-shaped palette to put my MAC powders and bronzers in, but it turns out, they don&#x27;t depot so well (they don&#x27;t come in metal pans, but rather a black plastic around the product as well), so the extra size is kind of a waste. The original sizes are great though!</li>
    <li> I now have more room on my makeup table now that I got rid of a ton of eyeshadow compacts.....I want to order more now! If you LOVE makeup....you MUST have this!</li>
    <li> good to use. hope it to be cheaper</li>
    <li> LOVE my Zpalettes. It has helped free up so much space, and gives me the freedom to customize my looks into one location. It does cost a little more than some of the other palettes but the others in my opinion are not of the same quality as the Z palette. They have either broken at the hinges or the magnets sucked and caused my shadow to break. So if your trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth the extra money, it is!</li>
    <li> I love Z Palettes they are a life and space saver.  The Domed versions are great for all baked make up.  Easy to use and comes with instructions on how to depot both regular make up and baked make up.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal product. I love how professional it looks and that I can customize it any way I want. Any makeup can be placed in the palette via original pots (magnetic dots &amp; squares are included) or pans can be ordered additionally. I had so much fun arranging my new makeup in my palette. I was able to fit 4 benefit cosmetics box sets (2 small eye sets, 2 large &#x27;everything&#x27; sets), 1 UD Naked palette, 1 Laura Geller holiday blush/highlighter, and 1 Anastasia book of brows/eyes. This has saved so much room in my pro kit and I now have room for more!</li>
    <li> I liked it in the beginning, but it provided no protection for my Milani Baked Blushes. I dropped it once and everything completely shattered. I would not recommend buying these. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of de-potting and then having all of them break. I feel like I wasted my money</li>
    <li> this holds all my mac mineralized skin finishes!&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing is that the magnets don&#x27;t hold to well but with a little crazy glue it works fine.</li>
    <li> Lots of space.  Convenient.  Just the right size.</li>
    <li> I am such a huge fan of these Z Palettes. The dome size is perfect for my MAC mineralized foundation powders. It&#x27;s a deeper container than the regular sized palettes. These are so space-saving.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim but I am SOO happy that I did.. I ended up getting 3 more! It is perfect size and I love how deep it is because some eyeshadows are taller than others! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was depoting some blushes that were domed and they fit great into them. Never can go wrong with a Z palette. Lots of colors they come in now.</li>
    <li> A standard Z-palette, not much I can say about it except the stickers that came with it keeps on coming off the makeup, which make them fall off frequently. Also wish the packaging was more attractive.</li>
    <li> Love the depth, wish it were bigger. With the Milani Baked blushes and baked MAC blushes I think I fit about 9 or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not very much and I ended up having to buy 3 to accomodate my blushes and depotted MAC mineralized eyeshadow duos.</li>
    <li> was able to fit all of my Milani baked blushes</li>
    <li> it was exactly what I needed to get all my shadows in the same place so that I can see them, use them, mix them. I need another!</li>
    <li> Very good, but mainly for your baked/domed bronzers/blushes</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this for me a few days ago and I absolutely LOVE it! I have a small space for my makeup and well, way too much makeup. This got rid of 12 of my domed shadows and 4 of my regular sized mac shadows. Definitely gave me a lot more space! I love that you can see what makeup you have in there and can organize the palette yourself. It&#x27;s a good size and is way easier to store than a bunch of plastic cases. Can&#x27;t wait to order another one!</li>
    <li> This was my hero! I had so much baked blushes that were taking up space in my makeup drawer and this fit almost all of them. It doesn&#x27;t squish them and it&#x27;s stylish and lasts a while. I have had it for over a year now and use it frequently and it still looks new. I would repurchase this over and over.</li>
    <li> Love my Z Palette! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The fact that you can see in thru the clear top is great but it is pricey and it doesn&#x27;t fill well in my cabinetry like the MAC palettes do. Also, the magnets that come with it don&#x27;t seem to be too strong. If I try to stand it up my product slides but since it is too tall for me to store that way I have to keep it lying down anyway. I probably won&#x27;t purchase another. The quality is good, it&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my blushes now i have more space for more!!!😱☺️</li>
    <li> I used it for Mac eye shadows and work great .</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and was exactly as described</li>
    <li> I love my baked blushes, bronzers, powders, shadows.  This is perfect for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;m just sticking to these because even the regular shadows can fit in here.</li>
