      <li>Great for my wet hair in the shower!</li>
      <li>When I purchased this comb I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive to my home so quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use my new comb immediately.  </li>
      <li>ummm great for curly girls and other ambitious naturals.</li>
      <li>This helps to keep the hair smooth and it separates SO much easier for the comb.</li>
      <li>This is a good wide tooth comb</li>
      <li>in conjunction with each other makes my hair so smooth it is amazing.</li>
      <li>The teeth are a good 1/2 inch apart from each other.</li>
      <li>Feel free to imagine yourself as a mermaid sitting under a waterfall combing through your lovely long tresses at this point</li>
      <li>It keeps you from carrying a whole bunch of hair products to keep your full hair weaves from matting or losing hair trying to untangle your hair.</li>
      <li>This comb is large and in charge!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only ever been able to find these combs on amazon.</li>
      <li>Love the big teeth!</li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend to anyone looking for a big comb</li>
      <li>Feels very sturdy, worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a solid leaving in conditioner  that is organic.</li>
      <li>This is a nice large, wide toothed comb.</li>
      <li>All in all, maybe one day if my hair gets that long I&#x27;ll be able to use this comb.</li>
      <li>No snags in the production of this comb (molded properly), great for long hair, wet hair, chemically treated hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s black plastic, but does a nice job detangling hair.</li>
      <li>It works great whether my hair is wet or dry.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all and really massages my scalp when I comb my hair too.  </li>
      <li>so the two really work well together.</li>
      <li>This comb is gentle and works.</li>
      <li>I really like this comb.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>This is really sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.  </li>
      <li>fast shipment, inexpensive, sturdy,</li>
      <li>Anyone with thick, long or natural hair this will become your best friend.</li>
      <li>The reason I can tell this is if your careful and start combing from the ends and work your way to the roots the knots come out so easily (use detangler with comb).  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair that has destroyed most previous combs I&#x27;ve used--I had resorted to buying combs with metal teeth that were intended for use on dogs.  </li>
      <li>:) I needed a comb that would stop taking my hair out when I wrapped it at night or blow dried.</li>
      <li>i am growing my hair for locks of love and it has never been this long (i am male).</li>
      <li>I am enjoying this comb especially when my hair is wet..</li>
      <li>After getting all of the knots out I can safely towel dry my hair and then apply the ga-zillion products I use everyday - finally, one last comb through to make sure everything is evenly distributed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t drag brushes and combs through our hair, but I have been known to break more than a few cheap brushes and combs within one second of them being on my hair.</li>
      <li>it is surprising to me how hard it is to care for long hair.</li>
      <li>I have broken many so called unbreakable combs, but this Diane WON&#x27;T be one of them!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new comb when my old one was getting, well, old and eh.</li>
      <li>When they say extra large...</li>
      <li>it is important not to pull to harshly on wet hair, as it will unnecessarily stress the hair, this comb works well, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for a new comb when my old one was getting, well, old and eh. This comb was bigger than I thought it would be but I don&#x27;t mind one bit. I straighten my hair often and I now use this comb whilst styling. Love the big teeth! No static from this comb and I like the feeling of it along my scalp. Feels very sturdy, worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I have rated this comb 5 stars, because I&#x27;ll never use it.  But they do call it Extra Wide, and believe me, it is.  Will do a heck of a job for somebody I&#x27;m sure ... perhaps a horse&#x27;s mane?  It is that large and heavy duty.</li>
    <li> looking for one for ages, it is perfect. I love it and would recommend to anyone looking for a big comb</li>
    <li> When they say extra large... THEY MEAN IT!!! This comb is huge. It would be great for a entangler or someone with really long hair. I just wanted a nice comb for medium length hair. This one did not fit the bill. Nothing really wrong with the comb, other than it is a lot larger than I expected. The teeth are a good 1/2 inch apart from each other. and the comb is about 9 1/2 inch&#x27;s long.  All in all, maybe one day if my hair gets that long I&#x27;ll be able to use this comb.</li>
    <li> Great, does what any wide tooth comb does, but I&#x27;m afraid it could break any moment.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length curly chestnut Irish hair and THIS is the best comb for after washing, to get the snarls out and the conditioner evenly distributed.  I buy two or three at a time every couple of years.</li>
    <li> The picture represents the product well. The Ion&#x27;s smooths, and softens and adds luster to my hair. I like that it is static resistant. I can use the comb to get a feather-like appearance. The comb was shipped to me in a timely manner as well.</li>
    <li> I love this comb.  I already have a smaller diane comb that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years.  I wanted another diane comb to use when I wash my hair and also when I roll up my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all and really massages my scalp when I comb my hair too.  When I purchased this comb I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive to my home so quickly.  I was able to use my new comb immediately.  I would definitely recommend this comb to anyone.</li>
    <li> This comb is large and in charge! I use it to comb my preschool-aged daughter&#x27;s wavy/curly hair and it does a great job of detangling without causing a fuss or tears. The plastic is sturdy, and the teeth are sharp enough to detangle and part, without hurting.</li>
    <li> You may think the teeth on this comb are too wide, I say they are perfect. My hair is just past my shoulders and this comb glides through my wet hair while in the shower. I also use it after I&#x27;ve towel dried my hair and again it simply glides through and thoroughly removes all tangles. This could also be because I&#x27;m using a fantastic product to wash my hair...so the two really work well together.</li>
    <li> This comb is wayyy bigger than I thought it would be (and that&#x27;s good). :) I needed a comb that would stop taking my hair out when I wrapped it at night or blow dried. My hair is a little past shoulder length and very thick. I recommend this comb!</li>
    <li> I got these, and they were not the same., They were flimsy, with a tack hologram on the side and the teeth HURT! They were pointy and scraped my scalp. When I tried to return them, they wanted me to pay shipping. Horrible waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is a good wide tooth comb it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I am natural my hair type is 3c so it does the trick and I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out. Anyone with thick, long or natural hair this will become your best friend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  It&#x27;s a good quality wide tooth comb for a great price.</li>
    <li> Buy it!!  It&#x27;s like having your personal beautician and you can see the results while combing your hair. You have a feather-like appearance.</li>
    <li> This is the comb you need with full hair weaves!!!! It keeps you from carrying a whole bunch of hair products to keep your full hair weaves from matting or losing hair trying to untangle your hair. So Stop raking at your hair &amp; use this comb while keeping your full hair weave in tacked. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice, This comb is huge &amp; thick enough you can&#x27;t break it or loose teeth in the comb!! I got 2, 1 for home &amp; 1 to keep with me in my bag....</li>
    <li> Great for my wet hair in the shower!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product it gets out tangles annd is very good for long thick hair.im very  happy with this</li>
    <li> All curly haired girls be sure to love it. This comb is gentle and works. Be sure to use a solid leaving in conditioner  that is organic. Go old skool&lt;br /&gt;  Almond oil and mayonnaise.</li>
    <li> Not sure about the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but the mold that created this comb IS the mold that created the less expensive combs that come in many colors.. Just buy the conair one.. no difference at all.  The comb works just fine,  but I don&#x27;t think that &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; exists..</li>
    <li> Big comb. I use it in the shower with my conditioner. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I got this wide tooth comb because I just started the curly girl method (which I recommend to all curly haired girls like me). Very nice comb, gets all the knots out of my hair very efficiently.</li>
    <li> This is a good comb. It gets the job done. I am satisfied with the product. FYI: I have very coarse hair and this comb makes detangling a breeze.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this comb especially when my hair is wet..it takes the tangles out without pulling your hair..I would recommend it for whatever use you would want to use it for.</li>
    <li> EVERYONE should have a wide tooth comb. They cause minimal damage, especially compared to thin combs on wet hair or snarls, and this one is no exception. Maybe a little overpriced on here, but this is definitely a must have hair tool.</li>
    <li> It does what it says on the cover.  Wide toothed, gentle on hair, arrived on time.  Highly recommended for 4b hair like my own.</li>
    <li> i am growing my hair for locks of love and it has never been this long (i am male). it is surprising to me how hard it is to care for long hair. this helps a lot. i would give it 5/5 except i like the revlon rv2513 better. (bought one for the shower and one for dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice feature that it has the hole for hanging from my shower rack</li>
    <li> My hair is longer and this wide toothed comb goes right through.  I really like it, it is as described:  Extra WIDE comb.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Is great for removing knots from tangly hair without damaging hair. Is good for all hair types. Can be used with wet or dry hair. For curly hair only use on wet or damp hair.</li>
    <li> This comb is great!  It is perfect for getting any tangles out of wet hair!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with super fine hair!</li>
    <li> This is the Big Mama of all wide tooth combs! The rest are just wannabes! I have broken many so called unbreakable combs, but this Diane WON&#x27;T be one of them! Take your Diane Extra Wide Tooth comb with you to your hairdresser or barber and refuse to have your locks combed with anything else while you&#x27;re there. Get extras!</li>
    <li> not much to say. ummm great for curly girls and other ambitious naturals. great for detangling. fast shipment, inexpensive, sturdy,</li>
    <li> Not only are the teeth wide enough to make detangling my own and my daughters hair easier, it is sturdy enough so that it does not bend or break. I don&#x27;t drag brushes and combs through our hair, but I have been known to break more than a few cheap brushes and combs within one second of them being on my hair. This comb is good quality.</li>
    <li> It has a pronounced seam down every tine/tooth.  So it isn&#x27;t a smooth comb-through.  Combs shouldn&#x27;t have thick, raised seams on the teeth/tines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rough on my brittle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.  That&#x27;s my advice.</li>
    <li> I saw on here people were complaining about the size.  Honestly I love the size!  Because it is so wide tooth I know after I get my perm I can actually use it for my curls without breakage.  The reason I can tell this is if your careful and start combing from the ends and work your way to the roots the knots come out so easily (use detangler with comb).  After I use the comb then I use the Spark Innovators Hair Bean Hair Detangling Comb which is also an amazing product.  Using these three things (after my hair is completely dry, because this lessens breakage due to the fact wet combing is really bad for your hair) in conjunction with each other makes my hair so smooth it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I received some cheap ass plastic combs with the word &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; printed on the side along with butterflies and flowers.  The packaging says &amp;#34;De Cheng Hair Comb&amp;#34;  Obviously not Diane and obviously not ionic.  I bought these combs for my salon and there is no way in heck I would use these.  The teeth were not cut of of the plastic well and are very sharp and scratchy.  I really could not be more ticked off.</li>
    <li> Love this comb. My mom wanted the one I bought so I bought another. It&#x27;s perfect for really thick hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t have a lot of static when I comb my hair dry so maybe it is. I&#x27;ve only ever been able to find these combs on amazon. Other combs I see at the store have painted tips on the end and over time those painted tips or teeth will tear down and get rough and start to snag out my hair. These have held up well.</li>
    <li> This comb was not exactly was i was looking for. I like that its huge but its not good at detangling my hair. It pulls my hair when I comb it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! No snags in the production of this comb (molded properly), great for long hair, wet hair, chemically treated hair. As a professional Hairdresser I use this comb everyday in the salon (I bought several) it is important not to pull to harshly on wet hair, as it will unnecessarily stress the hair, this comb works well, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Price, proper molding of plastic, no snags, great item..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Nothing</li>
    <li> This is a very wide tooth comb. Its great if you are trying to limit breakage. I love the width of the teeth but it has a cheap glide over my hair, maybe the seams are extra thick. Its not as smooth as my conair.</li>
    <li> I use this comb every day.  It works great whether my hair is wet or dry.  I have long, very thick, wavy hair which gets frizzy if I bother it too much.  This comb tidies up my hair without making it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though... it&#x27;s really big.  The day my husband first noticed it, he held it up, puzzled, and said he felt like Alice in Wonderland or something, as the scale seemed way off.  :-)</li>
    <li> This comb is large and great for styling during and after washes! I wouldn&#x27;t definitely recommend it and/or purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like this comb.  I had another wide tooth one but the tines kept breaking off.  This is really sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.  I have curly, somewhat fine hair. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great comb.  Doesn&#x27;t snag or catch hair at all.  I had a different wide tooth comb to untangle my hair when wet but this one is so much better than the one I had</li>
    <li> This is a great, sturdy comb.  Very simple, but very nice.  I have curly hair that has destroyed most previous combs I&#x27;ve used--I had resorted to buying combs with metal teeth that were intended for use on dogs.  This comb, however, has held up for months of constant use.  And wide tooth combs make curly hair look great, so that&#x27;s a plus as well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice large, wide toothed comb. I keep this comb in my shower and use it to comb through my conditioner.  It&#x27;s black plastic, but does a nice job detangling hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb for my daughter who has thick, curly natural african-american hair. This comb goes through her hair really easily.</li>
    <li> First off- I absolutely love this product! Before buying this comb, I used to always brush my long, bleached hair out with a paddle brush and I would have so much hair fall-out from trying to tug through all the post-shower tangles in my damp/ towel dried hair. Now, my Diane comb hangs on a hook in my shower (very convenient hole in the brush handle for those of you who like to keep your styling tools in plain site) and after conditioning my hair I use the comb to work through tangles while still standing under the water. This helps to keep the hair smooth and it separates SO much easier for the comb. Feel free to imagine yourself as a mermaid sitting under a waterfall combing through your lovely long tresses at this point (I guess this would make you a lake mermaid, but don&#x27;t get too caught up in the details). After getting all of the knots out I can safely towel dry my hair and then apply the ga-zillion products I use everyday - finally, one last comb through to make sure everything is evenly distributed. The comb is easy to wash off (it&#x27;s just plastic after all) and should be cleaned after each use. Even on dry hair this is a great comb to detangle before brushing through with your bristle brush. Anyway, full stars for this awesome product!! &amp;lt;3</li>
