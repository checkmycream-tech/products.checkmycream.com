      <li>I ordered two snack packs in a month to give it a fair shot.</li>
      <li>and if I want moisture I don&#x27;t get good definition.</li>
      <li>It seems like if I want definition I don&#x27;t get good moisture</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great line of products but just not for me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the shine and define cream!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of these products!</li>
      <li>My favorite is the Greg Juice!</li>
      <li>The Greg Juice is good for hydrating or refreshing a wash and go.</li>
      <li>I gave this a star for each product I liked in the snack pack.</li>
      <li>she works nice as a leave in too.</li>
      <li>for hair is a great option for those looking to try out Oyin Handmade products without spending money on full size bottles.</li>
      <li>For I&#x27;m sure those products are just as amazing.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more of the pomade,it was my most favorite part of the pack!</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>So I bought more.</li>
      <li>I love all these products as does my 2y</li>
      <li>also you know how some products work better in winter than summer and vice versa</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite thing to smell is the honey hemp conditioner and the burnt sugar pomade.</li>
      <li>so, I wasn&#x27;t able to use them.  </li>
      <li>I wish more companies did this.</li>
      <li>It may work for most of u</li>
      <li>Since everyone&#x27;s hair is different, it may be wonderful for others.</li>
      <li>These all-natural, great-smelling, perfectly-performing hair products whetted my appetite for more.</li>
      <li>Shine and define has great soft hold.</li>
      <li>After purchasing their &amp;#34;snack pack&amp;#34; I immediately bought full sized bottles of everything!</li>
      <li>and i will for sure be purchasing full sizes.</li>
      <li>A great way to try the products out rather than purchasing the regular size item.</li>
      <li>These products, especially the honey hemp conditioner, are great for moisture.  </li>
      <li>these products are good for natural hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of products on my little girls hair but nothing has worked as good as these!</li>
      <li>The Greg Juice was mild in scent.</li>
      <li>Some of the other  products have strong scents (more like odor..pew!)</li>
      <li>so try the sample sizes first before committing to the full sizes.</li>
      <li>When my hair was loose (and natural), I used the burnt sugar pomade for great, defined</li>
      <li>And the best thing about the pomade is that a little goes a long way so if you buy the snack pack and love it like I did, you won&#x27;t have to buy a full size version for a while - it can last months.</li>
      <li>(I put the dew on once completely dry), and the Greg Juice was a nice detangler.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much these products rock!</li>
      <li>Thanks Oyin Handmade!</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I was promised.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair lots of moisture which is what I was after for very thirsty fine natural hair.</li>
      <li>The Burnt Sugar Pomade is a great sealant that smells absolutely yummy, the Hair Dew made my 4C hair feel soft and fluffy after washing/blow drying it</li>
      <li>The only reason it has 4 stars is because it does not give me good definition with my curls like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>My twistout came out well defined, very hydrated and extremely soft.</li>
      <li>Someone recommended them to me a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been in love with them ever since.</li>
      <li>Overall discovering the Shine and Define cream was worth the price of the snack pack.</li>
      <li>Its nice they provide small samplers like this!</li>
      <li>If Oyin could either make an unscented or alter the scent of the other products that would be fantastic.</li>
      <li>Oyin Handmade is now the product of choice for this natural!</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s the first product that does not leave a white film on my hair.</li>
      <li>Note: I am natural and my hair type is 4 a/b.</li>
      <li>One of my girl friends gave me this sample pack and so far I have used all products except the conditioner</li>
      <li>I wish it worked for me as I prefer using natural products on my hair ..but something in this line worked against mine.</li>
      <li>Since my hair is colored and natural, it is prone to dryness.</li>
      <li>I love their products and I am slowly working my way through the hair care line and will soon have some of their body items as well.</li>
      <li>With that said, the prices for these products are way too high, especially when factoring in shipping, so I probably would only buy the pomade again since I can&#x27;t get anything that smells like it anywhere else (which is not the case for the other two products).</li>
      <li>The main deciding factor for me was that these products contain no alcohol or very little and everything that is combined together are all natural oils and fragrances that promote moisture.</li>

    <li> Honey hemp has great slip for deranging she works nice as a leave in too. Shine and define has great soft hold.</li>
    <li> The burnt sugar pomade is heavenly,it smells so good. these products are good for natural hair. I plan on buying more of the pomade,it was my most favorite part of the pack!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great line of products but just not for me. They ALL made my hair hard, dull and brittle. Luckily I only bought the sample sizes or I&#x27;d be sending them all back. Since everyone&#x27;s hair is different, it may be wonderful for others. I wish it worked for me as I prefer using natural products on my hair ..but something in this line worked against mine. It may work for most of u so try the sample sizes first before committing to the full sizes. Oh yea, they smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love all these products as does my 2y/o son who thinks they smell like cookies! Oyin Handmade is now the product of choice for this natural!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products on my little girls hair but nothing has worked as good as these! Not to mention they smell great! I will be buying Oyin in bulk.</li>
    <li> I received the snack pack sooner than I expected. I LOVE the shine and define cream! My twistout came out well defined, very hydrated and extremely soft. The Greg Juice is good for hydrating or refreshing a wash and go. Some of the other  products have strong scents (more like odor..pew!) so, I wasn&#x27;t able to use them.  Overall discovering the Shine and Define cream was worth the price of the snack pack. I will definitely purchase both the Shine and Define cream and Greg Juice again. If Oyin could either make an unscented or alter the scent of the other products that would be fantastic. For I&#x27;m sure those products are just as amazing.</li>
    <li> The only product I like was the burnt sugar pomade.  All the other product were too fluid. The Greg Juice was mild in scent. I have yet to try the honey hemp.</li>
    <li> One of my girl friends gave me this sample pack and so far I have used all products except the conditioner and I have to say I&#x27;m in love with Oyin which is weird becuase I tried the whipped pudding a while back and didn&#x27;t like it but the greg juice, the honey dew lotion and the pomade had my hair moisturized for days!! It could be a seasonal thing also you know how some products work better in winter than summer and vice versa but regardless these will definiltey become staple products for me for whatever season they work with! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Note: I am natural and my hair type is 4 a/b.</li>
    <li> I was looking for hair products that moisturize my hair and would not cost a small fortune to buy. After a little research online, I came across Oyin and decided to give them a try.

    <li> Especially loved the shine and define.  This is THE perfect way to sample the products.  My hair has never felt more moisturized.  Looking forward to trying the shampoo and i will for sure be purchasing full sizes.</li>
    <li> Good sampler package. A great way to try the products out rather than purchasing the regular size item.</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2TDL5Q0S8NRX9]]The Snack Pack - 5 Pc. for hair is a great option for those looking to try out Oyin Handmade products without spending money on full size bottles. Oyin Handmade seems to be a great company and provides good products. Watch the video to hear a short description of each and take a look at the textures/consistency of each product.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time,received in perfect condition. Got exactly what I was promised. Conditioner and hairdew smell great,works wonders for african hair. Will definately commit to the larger packs.</li>
    <li> I gave this a star for each product I liked in the snack pack. The Burnt Sugar Pomade is a great sealant that smells absolutely yummy, the Hair Dew made my 4C hair feel soft and fluffy after washing/blow drying it (I put the dew on once completely dry), and the Greg Juice was a nice detangler. With that said, the prices for these products are way too high, especially when factoring in shipping, so I probably would only buy the pomade again since I can&#x27;t get anything that smells like it anywhere else (which is not the case for the other two products). And the best thing about the pomade is that a little goes a long way so if you buy the snack pack and love it like I did, you won&#x27;t have to buy a full size version for a while - it can last months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 3A and I was looking for an alternative to Deva products, but these didn&#x27;t help my hair. It dried frizzy, not curly.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these products! It gives my hair lots of moisture which is what I was after for very thirsty fine natural hair. It also does not weigh my hair down like other products. Also, it&#x27;s the first product that does not leave a white film on my hair. I ordered two snack packs in a month to give it a fair shot. The only reason it has 4 stars is because it does not give me good definition with my curls like other products I&#x27;ve used. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair. It seems like if I want definition I don&#x27;t get good moisture and if I want moisture I don&#x27;t get good definition. Perhaps if I start using the Eco Gel, that everyone raves about, along with this line of products perhaps I will get the definition. I am not sure yet if I will continue using.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much these products rock! Someone recommended them to me a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been in love with them ever since. Since my hair is colored and natural, it is prone to dryness. These products, especially the honey hemp conditioner, are great for moisture.  I use the greg juice as a daily spritz. When my hair was loose (and natural), I used the burnt sugar pomade for great, defined twistouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing: these products smell ah-maz-ing! My favorite thing to smell is the honey hemp conditioner and the burnt sugar pomade. Trust me when I say that the scents smell heavenly. The scent for the Greg Juice is good for both women and men.</li>
