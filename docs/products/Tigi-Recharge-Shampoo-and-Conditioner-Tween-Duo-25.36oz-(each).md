      <li>I bought this shampoo because I had purchased a bottle at my local Marshalls and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It made my colored hair shiny and full of body that lasted through two full days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>, i think it should be packed more tightly</li>
      <li>so i have to buy a new nozzle in order to use this and wipe off botte from where some of the product leaked out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of the diff shampoos in the bedhead line and this is by far my fave!</li>
      <li>My 19 year old daughter loves this shampoo/conditioner product!</li>
      <li>Conditioner left my hair very soft!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they have tweaked the ingredients or is a whole new formula..?</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but I can also straighten my hair and this makes it really shiny.</li>

    <li> This is the second time I purchased this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  My husband likes the smell of it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great it works on my hair and my greasy teens hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, it&#x27;s one of the best at helping keep color vibrant while not drying out my hair or scalp considering I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is okay. I have received compliments for the look and scent of my hair after washing with it, but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I think the Kirkland brand shampoo and conditioner from Costco smells better and makes my hair softer.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it appears to come in a tin (which locally they do sell it that way at the salon from time to time). I do love this shampoo! I bought it for my daughter who is 10, but now I started to use it on my color treated hair. It&#x27;s great and smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve used a number of the diff shampoos in the bedhead line and this is by far my fave!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It was delivered in a timely matter, and it arrived well packaged! The size of this shampoo will last me anywhere from 4-5 months!</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product! It&#x27;s Bed Head...of course it&#x27;s great! Smells amazing. Made my hair feel soft and smooth. I have thick, color-dyed hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I had purchased a bottle at my local Marshalls and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my colored hair shiny and full of body that lasted through two full days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased Bed Head products before and have always found them to be good products but this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!!!! Such a great price!!! Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> very good quality and very fast shipping</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Bed Head products and I really love this shampoo and conditioner. It really does clarify your hair and make it nice and shiny. I don&#x27;t use these every day, but I do use them a couple times a week to help with product build up and I&#x27;m really enjoying them so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works great!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and this is a great deal, compared to nearly $30 in a salon. Not sure why another person stated that this is not for daily use, it clearly states on the Tigi website that this is for daily use...</li>
    <li> Great shampoo combo.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> My 19 year old daughter loves this shampoo/conditioner product!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the this &amp;#34;recharge&amp;#34; line from TIGI. I have long, very thick color treated hair and this just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturized and manageable as I would like.</li>
    <li> I havent used the product yet but when i recieved it the box was already opened on the end my packing slip wasnt in there and the nozzle to one bottle was destroyed so i have to buy a new nozzle in order to use this and wipe off botte from where some of the product leaked out, i think it should be packed more tightly i thought by picture it woud be in an aluminum tin then placed in box but it wasn&#x27;t just had tape on the nozzle. Hopefully the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Not one of the best Bed Head products, but it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell and it makes your hair a little dry and dulls shine but it lathers real well and the conditioner is great for even big tangles!</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner cleans &amp; softens/detangles hair very nicely.  However, I have used other Bed Head Products in past years &amp; I believe like someone before me have to agree that the usual beautiful expected fragrance isn&#x27;t there in these two products.  I&#x27;m not sure if they have tweaked the ingredients or is a whole new formula..? Anyway, I myself would NOT get this type of Bed Head Shampoo/Conditioner again, I would pick another type.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition.  kids love it</li>
    <li> My fave. Been using it since it came out. Leaves my hair super soft and shiny. Love the smell</li>
    <li> I USE THIS SHAMPOO WHEN MY DAUGHTER TRIED IT SHE SAID IT WAS GREAT SO I ORDERED HER SOME. YOUR HAIR FEELS SO CLEAN AND SOFT.</li>
    <li> Smells great!! Conditioner left my hair very soft!</li>
