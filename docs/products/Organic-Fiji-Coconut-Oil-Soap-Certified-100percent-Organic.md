      <li>and you&#x27;ll be able to enjoy outdoor living this summer.</li>
      <li>It has a strong perfumed scent to it.</li>
      <li>But I easily cut it in half for easier handling and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>It keeps me on the search for other best buys, however, it&#x27;s worth a &#x27;first-try!&#x27;</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>I ordered it because it said it was Fragrance Free</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free</li>
      <li>It cleans nicely but dissolves fast despite drying immediately after use.  </li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d give coconut soap a try, did feel the smooth feel of coconut, however I was not a fan of the bar soap feel of the product.</li>
      <li>Good soap but bar goes pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this simple effective soap!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found there are no &#x27;drying&#x27; (after) effects, and the smell is nothing but fresh!  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel so clean.  </li>
      <li>No specific smell of it which is good</li>
      <li>skin and the fragrance-free doesn&#x27;t attract  bugs in hot climates (just go easy on perfumes,colognes and hair sprays)</li>
      <li>Great for fragrance sensitive folk...left me clean and soft with not soapy smell.</li>
      <li>The only problem with Tropical Traditions is the shipping and handling is more than the product!  </li>
      <li>For body, so far it seems to be working okay.</li>
      <li>This particular soap is great in hard water which is very important to me.</li>
      <li>You can get fair trade, organic coconut soap at wholefoods or bathandbodyworks for half the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a nice big bar, but it dissolves too fast.</li>
      <li>My skin always feels so fresh and clean after my shower and feels so soft.</li>
      <li>I love the entire Fiji line.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a natural alternative to all the chemical filled products I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
      <li>Felt squeaky clean and my skin felt soft!  </li>
      <li>Using this coconut soap leaves my skin soft, rinsed clean</li>
      <li>Using this soap just feels so right and natural!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this soap bar and don&#x27;t really like it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When this soap gets wet it sticks like old lady perfume, and it&#x27;s strong.</li>
      <li>Plus no harsh chemicals!</li>
      <li>Pro;&lt;br /&gt;While my skin is combination at the best of times, when you mention winter, my skin becomes tight and uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is the bar is too large.</li>
      <li>but I use the cold pressed coconut oil and feel great.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, even when I don&#x27;t use moisturizer.   </li>
      <li>, this is the only soap i have tried in my whole life i can say that about, even my face.</li>
      <li>Because this soap is soft it cuts like cheese.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s just because I have sensitive skin, but my skin on my face burned after using this.</li>
      <li>This is a very Soft soap that will not dry out your skin!</li>
      <li>it exfoliates with out denaturing skin, so it really gets the oil out too, but my skin is soft and not to dry afterwards!</li>
      <li>It would be better if it cost a little less; that&#x27;s why just 4 stars.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a strong base strong.</li>
      <li>, this is a soft soap that requires that you allow the bar to dry out between uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The soap is good but I think it is a little bit expensive. No specific smell of it which is good</li>
    <li> It cleans nicely but dissolves fast despite drying immediately after use.  Quality of cleaning is excellent but economy of use is fair.</li>
    <li> When i got this, i realized how enourmous it was. I now make my own soap bars, but this was a great product which introduced me to more natural products.</li>
    <li> (I) don&#x27;t like the suds (sodium lauryl sulfate) and ingredients of other soaps and soap products, and have searching and trying different &#x27;organic&#x27; soaps.  LOVE Organic Fiji.  This Coconut Oil soap has a luxurious feel, and leaves a nice smooth finish when rinsed.  I&#x27;ve found there are no &#x27;drying&#x27; (after) effects, and the smell is nothing but fresh!  My only downside - is the pricey PRICE! It&#x27;s hard to pay $5-$8 for a bar of soap.  It keeps me on the search for other best buys, however, it&#x27;s worth a &#x27;first-try!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Very fine soap. Works especially well for celiac patients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and my skin has never been healthier!  Love it and would not change!</li>
    <li> Great. Smells good but not over powering. Works well. Don&#x27;t like using it on my face, seems to dry out my skin a bit there.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have a very hard finding products that I can use. I love the entire Fiji line. These products are very gentle and soothing and feel great on my skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff will get you very clean, doesnt smell, and is trully organic.&lt;br /&gt;leaves my skin perfect, this is the only soap i have tried in my whole life i can say that about, even my face. it exfoliates with out denaturing skin, so it really gets the oil out too, but my skin is soft and not to dry afterwards!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  As advertised!  Felt squeaky clean and my skin felt soft!  Glad I purchased and will be receiving every month!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite bar soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I want more!</li>
    <li> This soap is not unscented. It has a strong perfumed scent to it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic coconut soap for myself.  I have tried several and I like this one and Tropical Traditions the best.  The only problem with Tropical Traditions is the shipping and handling is more than the product!  This particular soap is great in hard water which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> You can get fair trade, organic coconut soap at wholefoods or bathandbodyworks for half the price. It&#x27;s a nice soap, but overpriced.</li>
    <li> I just wasted $6. on a bar of soap, THAT&#x27;S NOW IN THE TRASH. Can&#x27;t Return an Open Item back to Amazon, even if the product description is  a Big Fat Lie. Buyer(s) Beware... When this soap gets wet it sticks like old lady perfume, and it&#x27;s strong. I ordered it because it said it was Fragrance Free, it is, until it gets wet. I mean come on... If it should have any smell, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be COCONUT!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is GREAT!  The nice thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.   It leaves my skin feeling soft, even when I don&#x27;t use moisturizer.   I think I&#x27;ve found a natural alternative to all the chemical filled products I&#x27;ve been using.  :)</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get away from all the bad things manufactures put in things nowadays. This product is one of the BEST I have ever found!&lt;br /&gt;It is a number &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; by me. I have recommended to friends and they are now using as well and love it! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin smooth. I use this in conjunction with the Organic Coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this soap bar and don&#x27;t really like it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice big bar, but it dissolves too fast. It lasts only a few days, less than a smaller bar of soap lasts. It leaves a white residue on the towels that is hard to get out. I had to wash the bathroom towels two or three times in the washing machine to get out the white residues from this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy more of this soap. I have allergies, and will look elsewhere for hyopallergenic soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It makes my face feel so clean.  I wanted an all-natural, organic soap and I very glad that I tried this.</li>
    <li> This is good product. However, you have to ale sure you&#x27;re not allergic to coconut. No scent but it&#x27;s a strong base strong.</li>
    <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is the bar is too large. But I easily cut it in half for easier handling and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> FEELS GREAT!  LOVE IT. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Regular user of coconut oil for cooking, baths, etc. Thought I&#x27;d give coconut soap a try, did feel the smooth feel of coconut, however I was not a fan of the bar soap feel of the product.</li>
    <li> Using this soap just feels so right and natural!  I love it!  It would be better if it cost a little less; that&#x27;s why just 4 stars.  Hopefully as more people realize the skin absorbs whatever you put on it, then more people will care more about what chemicals are in their soap and start choosing organic soaps over chemical bombs; this will cause the cost of organics to become more affordable for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great vegan soap that is super-moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is a soft soap that requires that you allow the bar to dry out between uses. This is a small price to pay for the rewards this soap gives.&lt;br /&gt;  I cut the bar in half and leave the other half in the box until I need it.  Because this soap is soft it cuts like cheese.&lt;br /&gt;Now your half size bar will last even longer and you&#x27;ll use it all without the bar breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this bar sit in water without a soap-saver under it !&lt;br /&gt;Soft skin and the fragrance-free doesn&#x27;t attract  bugs in hot climates (just go easy on perfumes,colognes and hair sprays) and you&#x27;ll be able to enjoy outdoor living this summer.</li>
    <li> Good soap but bar goes pretty fast.</li>
    <li> It is a very harsh soap when used on my face. Perhaps that&#x27;s just because I have sensitive skin, but my skin on my face burned after using this. For body, so far it seems to be working okay.</li>
    <li> Have always had problem skin. Oily combination. I break out easily mostly hormonal break outs. I started using this in the shower because my back and arms also break out. I feel really dry when I come out but I use the cold pressed coconut oil and feel great. I also use both on my face and after about a week or so I could confidently walk around with out putting make up on. Still have some minor break outs now and then but I also don&#x27;t exfoliate as I should. But my complexion is much much more even.</li>
    <li> Great for fragrance sensitive folk...left me clean and soft with not soapy smell.</li>
    <li> I really love the organic soap.  My skin always feels so fresh and clean after my shower and feels so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut soap. I use it on my face and body without worry that it will dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve been switching to all organic products from &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; cosmeceutical companies and have not regretted it. This Fiji Coconut Oil Soap, as mentioned, does not dry out my skin, especially the delicate skin on my face. It is fragrance free so I don&#x27;t worry about any allergic reactions or sensitivities. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is a very Soft soap that will not dry out your skin! Plus no harsh chemicals! It&#x27;s so hard to find a bar soap without antibacterial and toxic chemicals in it. I just want to wash without risking being poisoned!!! Thank you for this simple effective soap!</li>
    <li> My mother in-law loved her soaps se got for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty.</li>
    <li> Pro;&lt;br /&gt;While my skin is combination at the best of times, when you mention winter, my skin becomes tight and uncomfortable. I usually use Dove but wanted a change. Using this coconut soap leaves my skin soft, rinsed clean and I can actually skip the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con; my fault - I went with unscented thinking it would smell of coconut only. Unscented is truly unscented in this case. I&#x27;m going to try on of the other &#x27;flavors&#x27; next time.</li>
