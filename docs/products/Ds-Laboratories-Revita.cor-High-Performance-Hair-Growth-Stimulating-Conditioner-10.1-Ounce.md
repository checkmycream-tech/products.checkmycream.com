      <li>I lost most of my hair, (it was falling out in clumps!)</li>
      <li>Better than losing the hair!</li>
      <li>But the product is amazing</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I get my own bottle of conditioner and shampoo, I&#x27;ll review again ;</li>
      <li>When you first use this product, it seems to be very good with your hair.  </li>
      <li>Ok this conditioner is awesome it really does make your hair grow but EVRYWHARE  </li>
      <li>spheres\\&quot;, which according to the booklet, are supposed to make the conditioner do its magic or if they were just some kind of crystals.</li>
      <li>but I am so delighted to have healthy looking hair that has stopped breaking and falling out that I can truthfully say I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Its too soon to tell if this will produce spectacular results, but I like the ingredients list - for the most part</li>
      <li>Hair looks and feels great after consistent use.</li>
      <li>SO QUICKLY TOO!!</li>
      <li>Did I maintain instead of losing more hair?</li>
      <li>did not use the conditioner more than 2 times, so I do not know if it eventually makes the hair grow</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t order any more</li>
      <li>Is is ok, but i think it dries my hair.</li>
      <li>Is my hair better than it would be if I hadn&#x27;t used this product?</li>
      <li>Save your money for better things, not this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>just switched to another brand, I see better results.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than my hair dresser</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; IT</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner as it leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>The shampoo used alone does make your hair thicker and more full looking.</li>
      <li>True : you loose More Hairwhile using it!!!!  </li>
      <li>First of all if it never stimulated hair growth or stopped my hair from falling out I would still be satisfied - because my hair is shinier and in better condition than it has ever been.  </li>
      <li>and I am super satisfied.  </li>
      <li>At best, you might grow a few hairs</li>
      <li>This is such a great conditioner</li>
      <li>Good conditioner... Does not irritate the skin &amp; makes the hair more solid...</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t tingle like other stimulating conditioners (which I always liked, but since this one works, I like it better) and smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t regrow but it significantly diminished hair loss.</li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t suggest diluting more than you are going to use for that day.</li>
      <li>THE SMELL IS NOT  BAD,  WE  HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CHANGE IN HAIR GROWTH,  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel stronger unlike any other conditioner out there and has a great smell.</li>
      <li>The pamphlet that is included is funny, pretty sure its just marketing scheme to get you to believe that is works.</li>
      <li>shampoo was good for a week, after which it started making my hair and scalp very dry.</li>
      <li>this is great takes awhile to start working have used it for about a year and husband has little whips of hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it regularly like he does, but when I do it makes my color treated hair look &amp; feel amazing, silky shiny and thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent.</li>
      <li>but nature wins every time.</li>
      <li>easy to use and leaves a normal appearance.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as my other conditioner.</li>
      <li>Does t work right away</li>
      <li>He noticed the quality right away...</li>
      <li>This product in conjunction with the Spectral DNC  has made a huge difference in both the amount of new hair and thickness of my existing hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for exactly 5 months now.</li>
      <li>Not that i&#x27;m aware of.    </li>
      <li>Be aware that the sensation the conditioner gives is stronger than peppermint.</li>
      <li>He used it 2x a day for the first bottle he went through</li>
      <li>It is very cooling and is a great indicator that it helps with inflammation and excessive heat on the scalp.</li>
      <li>However, I use it a little differently and it works brilliantly.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair manageable and smooth like no other conditioner does for me.</li>
      <li>Since this product is gentle, and nourishes the scalp, I feel it really worked!  </li>
      <li>Now for the good news:  My hair was coming out in small clumps and it stopped coming out after I used it about a month.  </li>
      <li>I have blonde shoulder length fine hair and this product has been just what i needed.  </li>
      <li>I really like both products and would suggest it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Feel a tingly sensation on scalp but mo real results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say whether or not this really does stimulate hair growth.</li>
      <li>Absolutely works.</li>
      <li>I think it working, my hair is not coming out as much, in fact.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend since it is working for him!</li>
      <li>This was much easier to apply to the scalp and not tangle the length of my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product my dermatologist recommended this for my hair.</li>
      <li>I believe all the anesthetics and the stress was responsible for my hair loss.  </li>
      <li>Well I can&#x27;t tell much about that</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>I used it for about 2 months until the whole bottle (along with the shampoo) was gone.  </li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>it absolutely worked for me.so much so I am about to reorder and recommend it to my son.</li>
      <li>This conditioner does its job well and works really well with the DS Laboratories Shampoo as it was intended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended to those losing hair!</li>
      <li>Well I was really a skeptic</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product in conjunction with the Spectral DNC  has made a huge difference in both the amount of new hair and thickness of my existing hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great when combined with the Rivita Shampoo.  My hair was falling out by the handfulls due to female hormone imbalance but now it is growing back!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is on another level. I used this product in conjunction with the Revita Shampoo (notes on the shampoo at the bottom) and it felt wonderful. I shampooed according the instructions and lightly towel dried my hair. I parted my hair and applied Revita.cor to my scalp in small sections to preserve the product. I applied a different conditioner (Aloxxi Keratin Treatment conditioner) to my the mid-length and ends, but not heavily. I put my hair up in 4 bantu knots, covered w/a cap and went to read the morning paper. Be aware that the sensation the conditioner gives is stronger than peppermint. It is very cooling and is a great indicator that it helps with inflammation and excessive heat on the scalp. I rinsed the mid-lengths and ends first and went back to rinse the Revita.cor.     This conditioner doesn&#x27;t have slip, but it does condition the hair sufficiently. It won&#x27;t melt tangles though. I didn&#x27;t use a leave-in conditioner with this and the styling products I used after did not come in contact with my scalp. I did not have a problem detangling my hair.    Its too soon to tell if this will produce spectacular results, but I like the ingredients list - for the most part and it did not irritate my sensitive scalp.     Yes it is a small bottle, but it is a highly concentrated product. I don&#x27;t suggest you use it as you would your regular conditioner.     *Now a note on the shampoo - it is extremely concentrated and drying to relaxed/natural hair. I got around the drying aspect of this by adding adding diluting the amount of shampoo I used to 4 parts water in a color applicator bottle. This was much easier to apply to the scalp and not tangle the length of my hair. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t suggest diluting more than you are going to use for that day.</li>
    <li> not sure it works but like the way it smells and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair as much</li>
    <li> This is such a great conditioner</li>
    <li> This is my personal review. Ive reviewed their products before... all you need to know is that this stuff does have the best ingredients for hair growth, but do NOT take others advice when they say &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; everyone WILL have different experinces.. all you can do is try it yourself!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks. He noticed the quality right away...I&#x27;m noticing it works well on my color treated hair..YAY really well and made my hair super thick. His hair looks thicker adn feel good. Let&#x27;s check in after three months....hopefully he&#x27;ll have hair down to his knees.lol He is using this conditioner in conjunction with with the DS lab shampoo and minoxidil solution (all from DS Laboratories).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the conditioner enough to buy it for myself. I don&#x27;t have male balding, but I do have a lot of shedding. especially towards the front.  I haven&#x27;t used it regularly like he does, but when I do it makes my color treated hair look &amp; feel amazing, silky shiny and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I get my own bottle of conditioner and shampoo, I&#x27;ll review again ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ds Laboratories Revita.cor High Performance Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner, 190ml</li>
    <li> this is great takes awhile to start working have used it for about a year and husband has little whips of hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon. I even bought our son 4 bottles for his birthday is how good we think it is.&lt;br /&gt;DAC</li>
    <li> this conditioner seems to be working great. It makes my hair feel stronger unlike any other conditioner out there and has a great smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; IT WORKS SO WELL!  YOU ONLY NEED A TINY BIT FOR LONG HAIR, SO THE BOTTLE LASTS A LONG TIME!  DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH DOWN YOUR HAIR LIKE OTHERS.  THEY SHIPPED IT TO ME SO QUICKLY TOO!!</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with the shampoo on the advice of my hairdresser. I love this conditioner as it leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my receding hairline comes back.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for thinning hair. I&#x27;m younger, but have thinner looking hair. After using this for a couple months (along with the shampoo), I definitely see a difference. Doesn&#x27;t tingle like other stimulating conditioners (which I always liked, but since this one works, I like it better) and smells pretty good. Has these weird spin fibers in it, pretty awkward texture. Down sides is that it has the WORST PACKING EVER! This bottle is a joke and product gets stuck in the cap and leaks all over the shower. Still a good product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but has a lingering smell when I get out in the sun and its hot outside. Probably won&#x27;t order any more</li>
    <li> The Revita Cor conditioner is one of the best conditioners I have ever used. It is a thick white cream which you apply and leave-in for a couple of minutes. However, I use it a little differently and it works brilliantly. I wash my hair, dry it, apply conditioner, leave-in for 10 minutes, then rinse. Leaves hair manageable and smooth like no other conditioner does for me. I definitely recommend in conjunction with Revita shampoo. I also use 15% minoxidil, but not theirs. I have been using this combination for a week, so I can&#x27;t yet judge on hair growth, so I might update this later.</li>
    <li> There are a few things that people will waste their money on even though they know it&#x27;s a hoax.&lt;br /&gt;Next to weight loss products, hair loss is a close second. I knew this. Gave it a shot. And realized what&lt;br /&gt;A joke it was. True : you loose More Hairwhile using it!!!!  That didn&#x27;t change in 3 months of using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> Is is ok, but i think it dries my hair. i have tried it once and noticed my scalp dried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for 6 mos now and at 60 yrs old; I&#x27;m noticing a small amout of new hair growing in. It seems it will take a long period of time to make a significant difference in the bald areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is well worth the price. Didn&#x27;t regrow but it significantly diminished hair loss. Wish I had discovered 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> it absolutely worked for me.so much so I am about to reorder and recommend it to my son. Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than my hair dresser</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. I find that I see less hair in the drain when I&#x27;m using this regularly. Gives a tingly feeling when applied.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for about 3 or 4 months now and I wish we took before pictures! I notice little hairs growing in, and he tells me it feels thicker and healthier than it was before.  He used it 2x a day for the first bottle he went through and now he just does it 1x a day and its continuing to work.  Highly recommend since it is working for him!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It has helped with losing my hair.I would recommend this product after trying it.</li>
    <li> Even though the bottle was sealed, it was only about half full, I had to squeeze it hard to get anything out. Normally I wash my hair every other day but I had to wash it daily because this product made my hair look greasy. I used it along with the shampoo and it did nothing for my hair loss. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Had to replace Nioxin after 8 years since they changed their formula. You can feel this invigorating your head again. Leaves hair looking thicker and softer.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS NOT  BAD,  WE  HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CHANGE IN HAIR GROWTH,  BUT WE WILL WAIT TO MAKE A  FINAL STATEMENT  UNTIL  WHEN THIS  BOTTLE IS ALMOST EMPTY , BEFORE WE  MAKE OUT  A REPORT OF HOW THIS STUFF  WORKS,  WE SHALL WAIT AND SEE FIRST ...???</li>
    <li> Good product! Good conditioner... Does not irritate the skin &amp; makes the hair more solid... Not falling out anymore! Try it... Better than losing the hair!</li>
    <li> 3 weeks in and I am seeing some growth.&lt;br /&gt;It is still to early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word word word word</li>
    <li> I really like both products and would suggest it to anyone. I really appreciate the low price.  All around great products.</li>
    <li> The quality has diminished over time. Move on to another hairloss solution, which hopefully isn&#x27;t a pill for obvious reasons.</li>
    <li> Still too early to tell whether or not this works. I&#x27;ll update this review as I see changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this along with DS Laboratories High performance Hair Stimulating Shampoo for the last 2 years and my hair has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> in my case this product didn&#x27;t work at all, the hair loss was the same or more, and i bought the 3 products the shampoo, the conditioner and the little spray!</li>
    <li> This conditioner does its job well and works really well with the DS Laboratories Shampoo as it was intended. Hair looks and feels great after consistent use.</li>
    <li> Product leaks from bottle badly. Lost approximately 1/4 of the product due to this defect.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working good. Dries my hair out a bit, but I will buy again to see if I can get the results I want. Hair feels fuller!</li>
    <li> The shipment was pretty quick from Amazon, as usual. I had ordered the shampoo along with this conditioner which leaked but the conditioner had a seal which protected it from any leaks during shipment. In the shower tho, both the products leak because the design of the bottle is pretty bad, as commented by other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has an information booklet that has a lot of info about the product and the science behind it, which is good if you are interested in it. The conditioner itself has no strong fragrance and is white in color with a creamy feel and weird texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird part is, that it had some thin hard fiber like things. I am not sure if they were the \\&quot;encapsulating cationically charged solid spheres\\&quot;, which according to the booklet, are supposed to make the conditioner do its magic or if they were just some kind of crystals. But they felt pretty bad on my palm. They were nothing like small spheres, that you see in some of your face-washes, instead they were like tiny needles and one of them even hurt my hand a little. It was worse because I was not expecting anything hard in my conditioner and they took me by surprise. They do seem to dissolve when you rub them in you palm but I am not sure if I got a bad lot of the conditioner or if everyone has these weird hard things in their conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still applied it onto my shampooed hair (I used the Revita shampoo) to see how it works and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as my other conditioner. It still left my hair pretty tangled and also caused hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the conditioner more than 2 times, so I do not know if it eventually makes the hair grow but I had had enough of it already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was good for a week, after which it started making my hair and scalp very dry. I am currently trying different dilutions of the shampoo to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this conditioner but it was a big let down. The consistency looks thick when it comes out of the bottle but when you rub in your hands to distribute it gets very thin.  It does not thicken your hair whatsoever so you if you are looking for a thickening conditioner then this is not the one to buy.  The pamphlet that is included is funny, pretty sure its just marketing scheme to get you to believe that is works. The bottom line is if you want to grow hair then buy Rogaine, this conditioner does nothing except maybe make your hair a little soft and managable which any $1.99 drugstore brand will do.  Needless to say i am returning this.</li>
    <li> He noticed after using this product along with the shampoo that his hair loss lessened dramatically as long as you follow the steps, shampoo first. Highly recommended to those losing hair! The cap seems to leak  a little is the only downfall to this product!!</li>
    <li> this product did nothing for me but turn my hair darker and I&#x27;m still bald. It doesn&#x27;t work on period,</li>
    <li> Product was leaking when it arrived !</li>
    <li> I have been using the product to see if it will make hair thicker and to early to tell. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product, however, the product is too thick and does not dispense at all&lt;br /&gt;as packaged out of the bottle cap. I have to take the cap off and force product out of bottle manually.&lt;br /&gt;Need to re-design the cap.</li>
    <li> Very good product - all DS Laboratories!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the formula and the shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months now. I have the typical bald spot on the crown and I have seen new growth. This stuff works but you have to be on it for at least 4-5 months to see any results.</li>
    <li> The only way to really tell if it is really responsible for the nice re-growth of hair would have been to use it on only half my head, and I wasn&#x27;t about to do that.  I lost most of my hair, (it was falling out in clumps!), after a serious injury which required many surgeries.  I believe all the anesthetics and the stress was responsible for my hair loss.  Since this product is gentle, and nourishes the scalp, I feel it really worked!  I can now go outside without a wig, as my new growth of hair is filling in the bald spots.  This product is quite thick, so I found it easier to take off the cap to use the product, as I do not have enough hand-strength to squeeze the bottle in order to use the flip--top cap.</li>
    <li> My hair is worse after using this product.  Twice immediately after use my hair had an oily appearance but the hairs seemed a little thicker.  The rest of the time I saw no results.  My hair was so dry after the double shampooing regimen seemed to strip my hair of natural moisture.  It looks like some of my hair just dissolved at the ends and I have less coverage than before.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> When you first use this product, it seems to be very good with your hair.  However, after continued use it seems to dwindle.  It may depend on how old it is when you recieve it, as some shampoo is thick while the other package was smooth flowing.  The conditioner, which I thought would help....does not.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner but the design of the bottle is absolutely horrible!!!!  But the product is amazing so I just take the lid off when applying the product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product my dermatologist recommended this for my hair. My scalp feels so cleaning and soothing. My hair feles soft and manageable  to style after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;I would indeed recommend this to anyone to use</li>
    <li> I am recovering from cancer treatment and this is the first product that is actually helping my hair grow in. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference does not leave your hair soft I wont buy again. Over priced as well.</li>
    <li> Os resultados são satisfatórios, mas tem que ter paciência. Não vai fazer nascer novos cabelos, mas minimiza muito a queda.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed improvement and use daily. Feel a tingly sensation on scalp but mo real results. Aforementioned poor bottle design that leaks easily at the lid. Does anyone have recommendations on alternative product?</li>
    <li> I am sure this product works great, I haven&#x27;t noticed yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I have noticed is the HORRIBLE lid on both the shampoo and conditioner.  When you tip the bottle upside down to squeeze some into your hand the cap of the bottle fills up with about 5 days worth of product and you can&#x27;t get it out, ever.  Not to mention I have to use my teeth to squeeze the bottle because they&#x27;re so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shampoo bottle specifically, it leaks out of the lid slowly all over my shower wall and it&#x27;s bright orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I buy this I&#x27;m not going to use the bottles it comes in. I&#x27;ll put the product into a practical bottle that doesn&#x27;t waste a ton of the product.</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling out and this shampoo has helped to slow it down and it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I am hopeful that the results will show themselves soon.  Will let you know when I do.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this really does stimulate hair growth. But what I can say is that this does make my hair look great. I&#x27;ve been using this along with Regenepure DR &amp; NT and the combination of these shampoos and this conditioner makes my thin hair look fuller and healthier. It&#x27;s very thick, but light enough that I can massage on my scalp and rinse off without any residue on my hair. This does not weight it down and makes my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons of this product are that there tends to be some sort of crystalization that happens in it. I hate it, but this is the only conditioner that I like so far. So I keep purchasing. It&#x27;s also too thick to come out of the top. So I just end up unscrewing the bottle cap each time I use it. Packaging definitely needs improvement. Even if they would just address the crystalization only, I would raise this to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers, you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle.  A combination of the walls of the bottle being too stiff and the high viscosity of the product means it is very difficult to get any product out.  The first two times I squeezed as hard I could and got less than a teaspoon of product.  This is when the bottle is new; I doubt any would come out if it ever gets to half full.  I&#x27;m giving up and asking for a refund.  PS I can pick up a 12 pack of soda in one hand with two fingers, so I do have the hand strength.</li>
    <li> These hair revitalizing products are very confusing and misleading but i tried this and it seemed to have worked in conjunction with the shampoo. this is the conditioner and i recommend you get both and use them together for good or the best results</li>
    <li> Well I was really a skeptic but I have been using this product for 3 months and I am super satisfied.  First of all if it never stimulated hair growth or stopped my hair from falling out I would still be satisfied - because my hair is shinier and in better condition than it has ever been.  Now for the good news:  My hair was coming out in small clumps and it stopped coming out after I used it about a month.  Any regrowth?  Well I can&#x27;t tell much about that but I am so delighted to have healthy looking hair that has stopped breaking and falling out that I can truthfully say I love this product.  I have blonde shoulder length fine hair and this product has been just what i needed.  I have thrown all of the other more expensive products I was using out the door.  Thank you Ds Laboratories for developing this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Dotto as remarks for shampoo. i said it all for the shampoo, have no further comment other than try it.</li>
    <li> I have used this before was purchase from hairdresser made my hair grow then I found it was the same product on here for cheaper but it made my hair started falling very badly so upset I have bald spots all around the edge has broken off really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Stops hair loss, leaves hair well conditioned, and thickens thin hair! Plus has a great smell! Combine with DS Laboratories Revita shampoo for best results.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, DS Labs sell false hopes for genetic baldness. Save your money for better things, not this.&lt;br /&gt;Women, however, may benefit from DS Labs&#x27; products. They specialize in presentation and it gives hope to men. But in fact it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad, I had hope to keep my hair... but nature wins every time.</li>
    <li> Overall, I didn&#x27;t really like the Revita Shampoo and this accompanying conditioner.  More specifically, I found it weird and slightly uncomfortable that one of the listed ingredients for this conditioner is Stem Cells.  Seems a bit excessive for a shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon but from a salon that recommended it and I paid quite a bit for it.  It did nothing.  The only thing I noticed was my hair&#x27;s texture became really rough and it seemed like it made my hair really dry and my hair broke off.  I used it for about 2 months until the whole bottle (along with the shampoo) was gone.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great Conditioner. Leave on the sculpt for at least 3 minutes. You will feel a tingling on your scalp. I swear by this product. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works. You can feel the hair roots tingle as you use it! Be patient. Does t work right away</li>
    <li> The product seems to leave your hair flat and oily. I won&#x27;t purchase again. The shampoo they sell is very good and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Ok this conditioner is awesome it really does make your hair grow but EVRYWHARE  so use it sparingly! And the smell is a little weird.</li>
    <li> I think it working, my hair is not coming out as much, in fact. I have very little hair loss, however I am hoping I will have some new hair growth in the bald areas.</li>
    <li> Jk jk my palms are not hairy now as a result of this product. I do see a difference. I am loosing way less to no hair now and my hair feels healthier and thicker.</li>
    <li> These company products used to be great! I used the shampoo, conditioner, spray.&lt;br /&gt;It worked! NOT the case anymore. Production was moved to China, quality went down.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do a thing! All products already watery (diluted) and by smell &amp; results I can tell that formula changed! I was absolutely upset with my last shipment. Shampoo was like water VS. GEL like substance in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I just switched to another brand, I see better results.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer of this as a person trying to avoid SLS in my shampoo and being of an age that I am worried about hair loss. After 3 months of using it my hair is getting thicker in the spot that was thinning out. I have been using propecia for a few years and was basically counter acting the hair growth by using products heavy with SLS before I realized I needed to stop what I was using. Great product and I will continue to use it. Even my hair dresser asked me what I have been doing differently after being a good customer for past 10 years at same place.</li>
    <li> I have used the Revita Shampoo for a month and have stopped losing hair and have new hair appearing.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use and leaves a normal appearance. Just like any good quality shampoo and cream rinse does.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this, you need to take the other reviews with a grain of salt. I&#x27;ve read alot of the reviews and some people are just ridiculous. I&#x27;ve read reviews of people quitting it after two-three weeks because they \\&quot;saw no results\\&quot; or quitting after two days because supposivly it \\&quot;made their hair fall out more.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t listen to these morons. If this product is to work for you, (if it works at all)  you have to give it time, not a few days or a few weeks.    With that being said...    - 23yr old  - male  - moderate thinning    I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for exactly 5 months now. I&#x27;ve used exactly as directed religiously since my hair lady recommended it. It&#x27;s almost impossible to gage if i&#x27;m losing less (or more) hair in the shower -who can actually measure that?- get real.    Is my hair better than it would be if I hadn&#x27;t used this product? Cant say.    Is my hair worse? Not that i&#x27;m aware of.    Did I maintain instead of losing more hair? Again, no definitive answer.    Did it fill in my thinning areas noticeably? No, I&#x27;ve started propecia.    Unless you&#x27;re going to a hair specialist every few months and get hair samples/counts done it&#x27;s really hard to tell if this product is working or not.    The shampoo used alone does make your hair thicker and more full looking. ESP if you blow dry after.    The conditioner+shampoo will leave your hair flatter than just the shampoo alone.    At best, you might grow a few hairs/maintain your hair/less hair fall.    At worst, you get a quality shampoo that will not damage/ make your scalp/hair worse because of harmful chemicals and additives.    The above has just been my experience and ive been as honest as possible because i know how devastating  hairloss is and i want to help people as much as possible.
