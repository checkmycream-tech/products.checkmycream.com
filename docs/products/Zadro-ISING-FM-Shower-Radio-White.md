      <li>sound is excellent FM, altho the stations are not always locked in.  </li>

      <li>it has great sound...</li>
      <li>Perfect size, great reception, great sound, antenna is a nice addition - only draw back</li>

      <li>It fell off the wall, so I stuck it on a glass wall, where it adhered much better.  </li>
      <li>I like listening to talk radio in the morning which it is okay for.</li>

      <li>I love having the time displayed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sound quality isn&#x27;t as great as a non-shower radio, but is very acceptable for a shower radio.</li>
      <li>He found that the suction cups work best if wet before attaching them to the wall.  </li>
      <li>overall, i think the size is good and sound quality is good as well.</li>
      <li>It breaks easily when dropped (this I discovered when my husband knocked it off it&#x27;s holder).</li>
      <li>I give it 2 stars because the clock works fine.</li>
      <li>Does that just fine,</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t expect it to sound like a stereo.  </li>
      <li>It costs under $10, sticks well to the shower wall, has a cheap clock built in, and doesn&#x27;t eat batteries.    </li>
      <li>When it arrived I thought it looked cheap.  </li>
      <li>Very simple and a great value.</li>
      <li>too cheap to return, just threw it out.  </li>
      <li>The digital clock comes in very handy, also.</li>
      <li>It is better than the first one we got, but this eventually conked out too.</li>
      <li>The sound quality even when  reception is at its best is poor.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a simple radio with good volume and the digital clock is a nice plus.</li>
      <li>For a tiny shower radio, this sounds pretty good.  </li>
      <li>This little $10 radio is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased so far.  </li>
      <li>This radio cost $15.00 but is worth $2.50.</li>
      <li>It worked great for several months - stuck to the shower wall well and tuned better than our previous radio.</li>
      <li>It mounted fine to my fiberglass shower but be sure to wet the suction cups to alleviate falling and breaking.</li>
      <li>Reception is good - gets some of the local radio stations better than other radios in the house do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, looks cheap, only gets FM, has a metal antenna, and is tricky to tune.    </li>
      <li>Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>for the price - this is a pretty good little shower radio.  </li>
      <li>The fall seemed to have no ill effect on the radio.  </li>
      <li>First of all the radio wouldn&#x27;t work and then the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick to the glass.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this unit does exactly what I need it to, holds its station</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty sturdy with the included suction cups.  </li>
      <li>AAA batteries for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they do the job pretty well considering the size.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I need it to do</li>
      <li>After seeing positive reviews for the Zadro ISING FM Shower Radio, ordered it from Amazon for about $15.  </li>
      <li>Batteries seem to last and it is easy to find and keep it on the station I want</li>
      <li>Now I can hardly get one radio station in tune (batteries good).</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to get a good grasp to turn them.  </li>
      <li>Tip of antenna broke but didn&#x27;t seem to affect reception much.</li>
      <li>as much) about shower time.</li>
      <li>But, this thing really works!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>We only paid $10 for it, so we weren&#x27;t expecting anything fantastic.</li>
      <li>It finds a local station that can be hard to get in, so has great reception.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed my first I Sing radio, so much that I bought it as a birthday and a Christmas present for other people.</li>
      <li>You could replace it every year for 4-5 years and not be out any more money than the more expensive ones, but I think we&#x27;re ready to try a higher-end model to see if they last longer than a year.</li>
      <li>the audio is only fair and the station dial is too fine (its hard to find stations because they are so close to each other).</li>
      <li>Not a whole lot of water splashes on it, but when it does it keeps right on ticking!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little tinny, but is fine for the shower.  </li>
      <li>Suction cups really hold the radio securely to the wall, and there&#x27;s no real chance of slipping, unless you&#x27;re doing some tricky wall climbing using the radio as a handhold.  </li>
      <li>The reception is clear.  </li>
      <li>Then about a month ago, the on/off/volume knob started having two settings: off and LOUD.</li>
      <li>The radio gets surprisingly loud and clear, allowing me to hear it over the water.  </li>
      <li>So far no complaints from my 15 year old son or my husband.</li>
      <li>It is not the same sound quality of my old radio but it is loud enough and clear enough to hear while in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the time or money spent!</li>
      <li>Listen to NPR every morning in the shower so a decent radio is as essential as shampoo.  </li>
      <li>So, a cheap radio, and you kind of get what you pay for, yet I didn&#x27;t hate it.     </li>
      <li>Music was not coming in clear and soon enough, it broke on me.</li>
      <li>It gets loud enough</li>
      <li>Big sound for a little radio,great little radio for price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to change the channel and turn the knobs while you&#x27;re already showering because they become slippery and it&#x27;s hard to get a good grasp to turn them.  If you&#x27;re buying this radio with the intent of using the suction cups then forget about it because they don&#x27;t stick to anything, I tried them on different surfaces and it stays for a few minutes and then collapses.  Other than that it&#x27;s a simple radio with good volume and the digital clock is a nice plus.</li>
    <li> bought 2 of these a few months ago.  the one that we put in the shower no longer works.  too cheap to return, just threw it out.  The other is still going, but it is in a dry place.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, great reception, great sound, antenna is a nice addition - only draw back is that it seems to pick up cell phone interference every now and then.</li>
    <li> My $35.00 shower radio of 7 years died recently which prompted me to visit Bed Bath and Beyond where I had purchased it to find a replacement.  I went to 3 similar stores and found very little selection. I finally came to Amazon and purchased this inexpensive radio. It is not the same sound quality of my old radio but it is loud enough and clear enough to hear while in the shower. It mounted fine to my fiberglass shower but be sure to wet the suction cups to alleviate falling and breaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. First of all the radio wouldn&#x27;t work and then the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick to the glass. So I returned it and got another one. The second clock/radio had working suction cups, but the radio still wouldn&#x27;t play. It would turn on for about 30 seconds and then shut itself off. Now I just want a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the time or money spent! Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> This radio is perfect. It does exactly what I need it to do which is allow me to listen to NPR in the morning while I shower/shave. Very simple and a great value.</li>
    <li> have purchased two of these radios. they do the job pretty well considering the size. when the batteries run low, they have poor volume, but change the batteries and things will be back to normal. i bought the second radio after the first one, after getting a lot of use, stopped picking up channels without the aid of a home-made antena (not good for use in the shower). overall, i think the size is good and sound quality is good as well.</li>
    <li> I have the radio hanging in my shower. I get great signal and can listen to the stations I want. It gets loud enough and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet it has been working great.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed my first I Sing radio, so much that I bought it as a birthday and a Christmas present for other people. The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t always stick to the shower so well, and it continued to fall. So I bought a 2nd one. The reception is actually much better than I have ever had on a shower radio.</li>
    <li> This is about my 25th shower radio (over about 10 years).  Listen to NPR every morning in the shower so a decent radio is as essential as shampoo.  This little $10 radio is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased so far.  Batteries seem to last and it is easy to find and keep it on the station I want (sounds basic but this has been a problem w/ other ones for 3 times the price).</li>
    <li> So far no complaints from my 15 year old son or my husband. The digital clock comes in very handy, also.</li>
    <li> Big sound for a little radio,great little radio for price. Tip of antenna broke but didn&#x27;t seem to affect reception much.</li>
    <li> This is the second shower radio my husband and I have tried in two years. It is better than the first one we got, but this eventually conked out too. It worked great for several months - stuck to the shower wall well and tuned better than our previous radio. Then about a month ago, the on/off/volume knob started having two settings: off and LOUD. Then it finally stopped working at all. We only paid $10 for it, so we weren&#x27;t expecting anything fantastic. You could replace it every year for 4-5 years and not be out any more money than the more expensive ones, but I think we&#x27;re ready to try a higher-end model to see if they last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> It works great!  sound is excellent FM, altho the stations are not always locked in.  I put mine on the medicine cabinet mirror, and can adjust the reception by opening the mirror door and moving it.  Works like a charm.  Get the best batteries for it and it will provide lots of use.</li>
    <li> this shower radio is very light, sticks appropriately to the wall, and catches radio signals. the audio is only fair and the station dial is too fine (its hard to find stations because they are so close to each other). i bought it for my daughter&#x27;s shower...she&#x27;s 12. it does its job.</li>
    <li> I bought this Zadro ising shower radio and when it works it&#x27;s great but it just cuts out constantly and we have to smack it to get it to come back on. Weak signal? I don&#x27;t know. It doesn&#x27;t turn off, it&#x27;s like the station signal is lost for a minute.</li>
    <li> The radio itself works good.  The reception is clear.  The only problem my husband has had with it is getting it to stay on the wall.  He found that the suction cups work best if wet before attaching them to the wall.  Another way to attach would be helpful.  Works well overall.</li>
    <li> Not exactly loud, but it does everything I want it to do- tell the time, play the morning news radio program I listen to (NPR).  Does that just fine, and it&#x27;s water resistant.  Works like a charm.  Suction cups really hold the radio securely to the wall, and there&#x27;s no real chance of slipping, unless you&#x27;re doing some tricky wall climbing using the radio as a handhold.  Batteries last a long time.  Nicely done!</li>
    <li> It finds a local station that can be hard to get in, so has great reception. I like the small size. It&#x27;s sound quality isn&#x27;t as great as a non-shower radio, but is very acceptable for a shower radio. It breaks easily when dropped (this I discovered when my husband knocked it off it&#x27;s holder). Note, it would not stay up when suctioned on, I hooked it on the shower organizer I have.     When I replaced the one my huband broke, the second one only lasted about three months, and just stopped, for no apparent reason. So, a cheap radio, and you kind of get what you pay for, yet I didn&#x27;t hate it.     Update: I just tried a Conair that was horrible, and my opinion has probably improved on this one. I just purchased another.</li>
    <li> I was kinda skeptical of buying this item for only $10 especially after reading so many bad reviews for shower radios out there.  Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised!  It has everything it&#x27;s advertised to do.  I have it hanging in my shower for the past week it&#x27;s pretty sturdy with the included suction cups.  The trick is to wet the cups with water to maximize sticking power.  It also has a built-in stand allowing you to rest it on something if you choose.  The radio gets surprisingly loud and clear, allowing me to hear it over the water.  Only gets FM signals but that&#x27;s what I wanted anyway.  Having a clock in the shower keeps me on time in the morning as well.  Radio dial remains on the same station as when I last turned it off.  Not a whole lot of water splashes on it, but when it does it keeps right on ticking!  Only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the metal extendable antenna since I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to rust eventually.  A plastic coated one would have been ideal.  It takes 3 AAA batteries and needs a small screwdriver to close the battery cover to make it water tight and sealed.  Probably the best budget shower radio out there!</li>
    <li> I bought this about 5 months ago. Music was not coming in clear and soon enough, it broke on me. I do not recommend this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a shower radio at local retail stores, but no one carried them.  After seeing positive reviews for the Zadro ISING FM Shower Radio, ordered it from Amazon for about $15.  Mounted it using the suction cups provided on one of the plastic walls of the shower and about a half hour later heard a crash.  It fell off the wall, so I stuck it on a glass wall, where it adhered much better.  The fall seemed to have no ill effect on the radio.  The sound is kind of tinny, and sometimes spoken word sounds garbled, but did not expect high-fidelity for the price.  Reception is good - gets some of the local radio stations better than other radios in the house do.  After about a month it fell off the glass wall of the shower and the antenna bent, but still works OK.  It&#x27;s probably a good idea to re-attach the suction cups to the shower wall every week or so to avoid falls.</li>
    <li> This radio worked great for a couple weeks. Now I can hardly get one radio station in tune (batteries good). I have not changed position of the radio in the shower, it just simply stopped working.I would not recommend this shower radio.</li>
    <li> This is a good shower radio for a great price.  We have been using it for over a year and only have issues when the batteries are dying (they last a  long time).  I would recommend this product.  It works great for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this radio in a store around 6 months ago and it is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> We bought this radio at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, got it home, and it simply didn&#x27;t work. DOA. We returned it for a replacement, and it just stopped working two weeks ago, after a few months. Changing the batteries didn&#x27;t help, it just died. Sorry folks, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there...</li>
    <li> For a tiny shower radio, this sounds pretty good.  You can&#x27;t expect it to sound like a stereo.  It&#x27;s a little tinny, but is fine for the shower.  It is plenty loud to hear it over the water, or even from the two bedrooms down the hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first one failed, but I believe this was caused by my husband putting rechargeable batteries in it.  Bleep, zap, and it was gone.  We did exchange it, and I read the directions myself, which said \\&quot;Do not use rechargeable batteries.\\&quot;  This second unit has worked with no problem for close to a year.  I have just changed the three (regular) AAA batteries for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fiberglass surround in my tub, and this radio&#x27;s suction cups stick great to the fiberglass.  It has never fallen off.  You may have to stick it to a couple of different spots to find the best reception, so the material you have in your shower may be a factor.  I would guess it would stick best on a smooth surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback of this radio is the round on/off button.  It can be hard to operate with wet hands.  Actually, it can be hard to operate with dry hands.  There is no grip to it.  However, its redeemable quality is its digital clock.  I love having the time displayed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this unit does exactly what I need it to, holds its station well once I found the right spot, and doesn&#x27;t sound half bad.  It may be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the radio doesn´t work. I give it 2 stars because the clock works fine.</li>
    <li> for the price - this is a pretty good little shower radio.  it has great sound...just sometimes hard to get a station.  but then again - it is inside your home, in your shower.  but the kids love having a shower radio and no longer gripe (as much) about shower time.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The dials are very hard to handle with wet fingers.After a few days the stations slide and after a few min the radio gives out this high pitched squeal type noise. No station comes in. I have tried turning it off/on and even other areas of the house. NOPE the squeal comes back and wont go away for awhile. I tried changing the batteries too. It still cames back.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> When it arrived I thought it looked cheap.  But, this thing really works!&lt;br /&gt;Great product the sound quality isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s a shower radio.  Wonderful for the price!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, looks cheap, only gets FM, has a metal antenna, and is tricky to tune.    It costs under $10, sticks well to the shower wall, has a cheap clock built in, and doesn&#x27;t eat batteries.    I&#x27;d buy it again, and am enjoying my tunes in the shower!</li>
    <li> This radio cost $15.00 but is worth $2.50. The sound quality even when  reception is at its best is poor. I like listening to talk radio in the morning which it is okay for. As soon as they play a song though between talk sessions the sound is horribly distorted like the speaker is blown. It intermittently cuts out as well. The radio dials are not accurate to where the station or volume really is. If I didn&#x27;t throw the package out I would have sent this radio back immediately. If you gave it to me for free I wouldn&#x27;t be happy!!!!</li>
