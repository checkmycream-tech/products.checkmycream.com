      <li>This is an excellent set to try out Burt&#x27;s Bees facial products if you&#x27;ve never tried them, or to stock up if they&#x27;re products you already use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going to go for organic moisturizer, I&#x27;d prefer to splash out on Tata Harper&#x27;s lovely rose-scented day lotion.  </li>
      <li>The towels were the most lack luster performer in the group.</li>
      <li>in all, not my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Moisturizer -  This moisturizer is nice and light, and not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>I think I would have preferred something with a bit more liquid</li>
      <li>I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees stands for and how well the products work.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see it ever replacing my favorite moisturizers any time soon.  </li>

      <li>I love the cleanser.</li>
      <li>Your face will love this.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm...live their foot cream.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going to go for organic moisturizer, I&#x27;d prefer to splash out on Tata Harper&#x27;s lovely rose-scented day lotion.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I just know I’m going to be wasting moisturizer that I would have been able to get out of a jar and</li>
      <li>really impressed with the quality of this skin care line, especially given its affordable price tag.  </li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve use the Burt&#x27;s Bees brightening facial moisturiser and it does a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>The brush needs a more liquid product.  </li>
      <li>wipes were my favorite part of this pack.</li>
      <li>face wash was a great, fresh clean.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin that is prone to breakouts, but the face wash clears up my skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t find anything particularly special about the towelettes, but was very impressed with the deep cleansing and moisturizing</li>
      <li>but I do love having them available</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; natural, formula  smells and feels great.  </li>
      <li>The face soap smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have not gotten great results with most facial wipes.</li>
      <li>The wipes are a good size and very soft.</li>
      <li>I have noticied a huge difference in the amount of redness in the two weeks I have been using it,  </li>
      <li>but now I enjoy it</li>
      <li>This is a great kit for facial care.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really get warm just tingly.</li>
      <li>The face wash is gentle but effective, it has a creamy texture, you mix with water, you don&#x27;t get suds, you just get a thinner cream that spreads evenly on your face.  </li>
      <li>By themselves the moisturiser and the cleansing cream are $17 and $16 respectively so therefore $23.50 for both is great value.</li>
      <li>I have been using the St. Ives cleaning lotion for a while now and just think it is a fantastic product for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>daily moisturizer is great, too.  </li>
      <li>soap is tingly and fantastic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a crush on this set.  I usually buy things that promise to reduce my pores, reduce effects of aging, brighten my skin, blah, blah, blah.  I sometimes forget that my face needs relaxation, good moisturizing, and a clean slate.  I really like the wipes, and I have already purchased more of these.  The face wash is gentle but effective, it has a creamy texture, you mix with water, you don&#x27;t get suds, you just get a thinner cream that spreads evenly on your face.  There is a slight medicinal smell to the cleanser and it provides your face with a fresh tingly feeling.  I like how fresh and clean my face feels after washing up.  The moisturizer is divine for my face.  You know how some days the regular wear and tear of the day has your skin just begging for a drink and bedtime...enter this thick creamy moisturizer, light scent if any, it spreads on easy - a little goes a long way - and it soothes the day away.  I had been out at an event near a very windy body of water, my face felt wind burned, sand scratched, and just tired.  I washed up and reached for the nicest moisturizer in my arsenal, this was it.  In the morning my face looked plumped back up to health and ready for a new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the wipes for a variety of reasons, but if you use other masks, or perhaps you need a refresh, but not a full on face wash, these come in handy.  I used them frequently.  And all of these products were less expensive than what I had been using on my face, and have a better reputation for being ecological and kind.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. I was happy with how well the towelettes got of makeup. They even worked fine on long wearing makeup and stage makeup. I have not gotten great results with most facial wipes. But these really worked. the facial cleanser is just lovely. It is rich and creamy. But it still leaves your face feeling very fresh and clean. My skin was just perfect. The moisturizer is a good simple face cream. It felt rich going on but soaked right in without a problem. It left my face dewy and fresh. I was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep the cleanser on hand.</li>
    <li> Facial cleanser:  I usually really like Burts Bees products, but there is something weird about this cleansers fragrance.  Maybe it is the menthol.  It isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It isn&#x27;t quite like Vicks Vapo Rub, but it&#x27;s not great.  The texture is creamy, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t quite dissolve enough before I put it on my face- so I have to rinse well or have bits of white cleanser leftover.  It isn&#x27;t awful, and I will use it up.  I have sensitive skin, and the product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or dry it out.  I would just try another product next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day cream:  This cream isn&#x27;t quite heavy enough for me.  My skin still feels dry after I use it, and I have combo/dry skin.  I thought maybe I could use it at night, but it just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I also do not like that it has no sunscreen in it.  It isn&#x27;t very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial wipes:  I did not think that these would remove make up, but they sure do!  It even got my waterproof mascara off without irritating my eyes.  The wipes did not even irritate my sensitive skin.  If you are in the market for make up removing wipes, these are a good buy.</li>
    <li> For all natural products, we loved them all. The towels were the most lack luster performer in the group. They have about 1/3 as many as other make up removing wipes... Not a big deal maybe since they could be considered more of a sample, but something to look out for in store. The biggest issue was they didn&#x27;t work as well as the neutragina naturals that are our current favorite. They just didn&#x27;t have the oomph at removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is tingly and fantastic. It&#x27;s great and envigorating and removing makeup and anything else. And it really does tingle when on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is another gem. I feel like moisturizers really lend themselves to the all natural treatment. They are made to hydrate out natural faces and work with out natural oils and this bottle works well. Not to heavy, it&#x27;s easy to work in and sets light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good set by a good company. I highly recommend the documentary on Burt to anyone that&#x27;s interested.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set to try out Burt&#x27;s Bees facial products if you&#x27;ve never tried them, or to stock up if they&#x27;re products you already use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are a sample size pack with 10 wipes, but the other items in the set are full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire set is excellent for sensitive skin, especially the moisturizer. I buy the moisturizer regularly here at amazon on Subscribe and Save. It is the only moisturizer that my daughter can use faithfully every day and have no bad reactions whatsoever. Her skin is very sensitive and will flare up with redness, bumps, dryness, etc with most products.  Her skin tends to be dry and it was hard for use to find a moisturizer she could use. It took several years of trying different brands. Finally, Burt&#x27;s Bees came out with their facial products and so we tried the moisturizer and have never bought a different brand ever since. It calms her skin, keeps the dryness away, doesn&#x27;t induce acne (which she is also prone to) and has kept away all irritations and redness. Her skin looks marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream cleanser in this set is also very good. Since it has chamomile, it is soothing as well. Being a cream base, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It leaves it clean, smooth and soft. I use it with a facial cleansing brush and love the way it makes my face feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wiped are great and do not leave any residue. I buy these wipes regularly and they&#x27;re my favorite. They remove makeup, even waterproof eye makeup, and do not dry out your skin. The wipes in this kit work well for my daughter with sensitive skin, but she does prefer the sensitive version, so we buy those for her. The ones in this set work great for me though and I like the herbal scent. I buy them here with Subscribe and Save as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 items are great products. Effective, but gentle and only very lightly scented. They all have a slightly herbal scent that does not linger at all.</li>
    <li> So I normally use Shiseido. Which is getting very expensive for me. I can get this three pack for less than the price of one cleanser with Shiseido. I can tell you its a bit of an argument with my husband. So, after trying this Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s face kit, I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin and sometimes when I use new cleansers my face turns red. Even though this has a hint of menthol in it my face doesn&#x27;t react at all. I normally dislike &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; sensations. This doesn&#x27;t really get warm just tingly. It was a bit of a shock when I first used it but now I enjoy it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is awesome. I can feel it even at the end of the day. My face feels creamy and soft and I love it! I&#x27;m a little nervous of the pump action dispenser because a full pump is a little too much for my whole face. I made the mistake of pushing it down all the way and I got enough moisturizer for my face, hands, elbows, and neck. No fragrance on this which is good because some can be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup remover clothes are great too. For me this is something I wouldn&#x27;t use as much but I do love having them available I use them for miscellaneous things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this kit is amazing. The one thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the moisturizer had 0 SPF protection. I was hoping for at least a minimal amount but its not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and cuticle cream for years.  This is my first time trying the facial products and I love them.  The face soap smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  The moisturizer absorbs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy. The cleansing cloths are perfect for travel because they do a great job, are easy to pack and you don&#x27;t have to worry about them leaking all over your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm...live their foot cream. but this face care kit not so much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, but really not a product that I would seek out in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning towelettes are nice. It found the material soft, and for me they did a nice job removing makeup. then I like every towelette I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;But the cleansing cream..well, it seemed to do a good enough job, but the menthol in it...that was rather unexpected and really did not like it. Not on my face. I like it in the lip balm and the foot cream..but not the face.&lt;br /&gt;The third part of the kit, the moisturizing cream was fine, and maybe it is just me, but  I thought a little greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> There are a few things to love about Burt&#x27;s Bees - the products are mostly natural (many quote 99%+ natural ingredients), they&#x27;re inexpensive and - most importantly - they work just as well as pricier brands. Like many of the other items in their range, the moisturizers work over an extended period and have a tendency to make your skin springier the longer you use them. The cleaning cream is extremely mild and definitely suited to sensitive or dry skin. This kit is a great introduction to the Burt&#x27;s Bees range of products and if you enjoy these I would recommend checking out their lip balms, shampoo and conditioner product - all in all, you can&#x27;t go far wrong.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees before, and have always been happy with their products. We were excited to have the chance to try some new things out, and we&#x27;re pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Wipes - We&#x27;ve used these before. They&#x27;re great for removing makeup, and feels great afterwards. Burt&#x27;s Bees does make a pink grapefruit version that we prefer a little better, but otherwise, they&#x27;re the same great facial wipes we&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Wash - It has a nice clean, pleasant scent. Your face tingles as you use, which really helps clean deep down in your pores. It&#x27;s become a new favorite in our household. My face also didn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards, but felt soft,  refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to test the effectiveness of the face wash, so I washed my face with it first, then I used the facial wipes to see if any makeup or dirt/oil would be visible on the wipe. There was no visible residue on the wipe after using the wash, so I knew that the face wash was really getting my face as clean as it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer -  This moisturizer is nice and light, and not at all greasy. I used it in the morning and my face did not get oily all day. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this moisturizer is that is does not contain SPF sun protection, which I usually prefer in my face moisturizer. So, if you want sun protection on your face, you need to use something else in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we really like this facial care kit. Burt&#x27;s Bees makes great products that we continue to enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for facial care.  I love the smell of the green tea. The wipes are great for cleaning in moisturizing your face.  I sometimes use the wipes to clean my face and do not use any cleanser or moisturizer. They work beautifully.  I have never had any problems with breakouts or oily or dry skin using this set.  Natural and healthy ingredients. It would make a great gift for someone you love.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super-sensitive, dry skin that turns red with a lot of products.  These three treatments help with redness and leave skin moisturized and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream Cleanser:  I have been searching for a replacement for Aveeno&#x27;s Calming cream cleanser that was discontinued and this is even better! It is non-drying,, has a wonderful light fragrance, leaves your skin clean, and it makes your skin feel tingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing Wipes:  These remove almost all of your makeup (they probably remove all but I am a bit lazy) and even get off stubborn mascara.  If I am too tired to wash my face before betimes, at least I can quickly take the make up off.  I do rinse with water after using these.  They make my skin feel so great and help to reduce redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Lotion:  This is THE lotion I have been looking for.  It is light enough to use under a BB cream and  makes your skin feel silky but without being too much.  I have noticied a huge difference in the amount of redness in the two weeks I have been using it,  I have used Aveeno and Clinique in the past but this is just the perfect balance for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love and have used two of these three products in the past. The towelettes remove makeup without stinging my face.and I love the cleanser. I won&#x27;t change my skin care regime, but I think this set would be a great start for a teenager. I was a bit surprised by how small this set was. It&#x27;s more appropriate as either a starter or gift set and should be marketed as such.</li>
    <li> I had never really used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before, with the exception of their natural lip balms, and was pleased to discover that their reputation for natural ingredients has gone well beyond the beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees Face Care Kit is comprised of a sample package of 10 pre-moistened towelettes with white tea extract, a six-ounce tube of soap bark and chamomile deep cleansing cream and a 1.8-ounce container of daily moisturizing cream for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find anything particularly special about the towelettes, but was very impressed with the deep cleansing and moisturizing creams.&lt;br /&gt;The deep cleansing cream goes on gently enough for dry sensitive skin, not like the sand-papery effect you get after using some deep cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;But it does contain a bit of cooling menthol, so make sure you pay attention when they say to avoid applying it near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutral-scented daily moisturizing cream, meanwhile, goes on lightly, without leaving an oily residue, but is still substantial enough that your face still feels hydrated hours later.  I&#x27;d definitely consider purchasing a la carte versions of both the cleanser and cream versions in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this skin care set is no exception.  Since it consists of three separate items, and I liked one more than the others, I&#x27;ll do the review in three parts - from my favorite to my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream by far took the prize.  I should start off by saying that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to cream cleansers that double as eye makeup removers (like Cetaphil and Principal Secret), so imagine my dismay when I realized too late that this contains menthol.  Ouch.  But that was my bad for not reading the directions which specifically state to avoid the eye area.  That aside, I absolutely loved everything about this. It&#x27;s thick and rich with a medicinal smell (almost like cherry cough drops) that left my face feeling super clean and tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial Cleansing Towelettes are very handy.  Currently I have them in my gym locker at work and I&#x27;ve been using them to quickly remove my foundation before a workout.  They work well, doing a thorough job, despite not seeming particularly wet.  The towelette itself has a soft, thick, almost cloth-like texture, but is only mildly damp.  I think I would have preferred something with a bit more liquid but they seem to do a good job of removing make-up nonetheless.  The instructions say there is no need to rinse and, while it&#x27;s true that my face is not particularly tight after a wipe with these nor does it seem to have any tacky residue on it, I&#x27;ve still been rinsing with a bit of cool water.  That&#x27;s just me, though.  I hardly think it&#x27;s necessary and I suspect there may even be some moisturizing benefit to leaving the solution on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite of the three is the Daily Moisturizing Cream.  While nice enough, it&#x27;s not particularly distinguished and I don&#x27;t see it ever replacing my favorite moisturizers any time soon.  It has no added fragrance and smells vaguely like library paste.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with library paste, it&#x27;s that non-toxic, flour-based glue used by small children before they&#x27;re allowed to graduate to Elmer&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s a wheaty smell that, I&#x27;ll admit, is more pleasant than that horrid chemical odor you get from mainstream unscented products like Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizer, but still not particularly appealing.  If I&#x27;m going to go for organic moisturizer, I&#x27;d prefer to splash out on Tata Harper&#x27;s lovely rose-scented day lotion.  Of course, Burt&#x27;s Bees probably costs about ten percent of Tata Harper, so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice set.  While I only absolutely adored one item, they were all very nice for the price and I heartily recommend the entire set.oxic, flour-based glue used by small children before they&#x27;re allowed to graduate to Elmer&#x27;s.

    <li> This is a great gift kit from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  We&#x27;ve used all of these products individually before and we really like the quality of their products.  Everything fees very natural with no chemical residue or harsh after effects. Both of the creams go on very smooth and go quite a long way.  They do a good job of moisturizing your skin without leaving any oily film remaining.  The towelettes are great for when you are on the go as well.</li>
    <li> If you have used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before, you know they never fail to live up to the hype. The same holds true for this kit, all of the products in it, of which, were new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash was a great, fresh clean. I usually use acne wash, but this was good for the days when my face starts to feel dry and I need to lay off the acne wash for a little while. It didn&#x27;t leave a film, nor did it overly dry my face. It made my skin feel clean and smooth, and I would definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is very light. Even though I can&#x27;t usually put moisturizer on my face, this was light enough even for me to use. My husband, who tends to get really dry skin around his beard, used it, but it wasn&#x27;t heavy enough for him. He tends to need almost a body cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes were my favorite part of this pack. I love face wipes for those nights you have on make-up and don&#x27;t feel like getting all wet using your face wash over the sink. I have tough standards for these wipes, because I don&#x27;t want them to leave a film that means I have to rinse my face anyway- and these didn&#x27;t! Great wipes. Will absolutely be investing in more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great little pack either for you or for a gift. As always, great, reliable products from Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> This is a 3 piece set, including:&lt;br /&gt;• 10 White Tea Extract facial towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;• 6 ounce tube of Soap Bark and Chamomile cleansing cream.&lt;br /&gt;• 1.8 ounce Moisturizing Cream with Cotton Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not obsessed with using natural products, but when the chance comes along, I do like to try them.  If you can care for your body inside or out naturally, why add chemicals?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ingredient list for each product:&lt;br /&gt;Facial Towelettes  water, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, glycerin, camellia sinensis leaf extract*, cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract, tocopherol, citric acid, parfum (fragrance)**, xanthan gum, polyglyceryl-4 caprate, dicaprylyl carbonatecaprylyl/caprylpolyglyceryl-4 caprate, dicaprylyl carbonate, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, glycine soja (soybean) oil, benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate phenoxyethanol, amyl cinnamal, citral, citronellol, limonene, linalool. *White Tea Extract **Natural Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing Cream: water, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, stearic acid, glycerin, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, sodium borate, cetyl alcohol, silica, glucose, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) leaf extractaloe barbadensis leaf extract, anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, echinacea angustifolia (coneflower) extract, quillaja saponaria (soap) bark extract, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract tocopherol, citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel oil, coriandrum sativum (cilantro) oil, artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) oil, lavandula hybrida (lavandin) oil, jasminum grandiflorum (jasmine) flower oil, xanthan gum, sucrose stearate, menthol glucose oxidase, and lactoperoxidase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing Cream:  water, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, CI 77947 (zinc oxide), zea mays (corn) starch, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) flower extract, oryza sativa (rice) extractbeta vulgaris (beet, extrait de racine de betterave) root extract, artemisia umbelliformis extract, euphrasia officinalis extract, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane, extrait de canne a sucre) extract aloe barbadensis leaf juice, jojoba esters, hydrolyzed jojoba esters, kaolin, lecithin, sucrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, citric acid, benzoic acid, trehalose, xanthan gum glyceryl laurate, potassium sorbate, sucrose stearate, sucrose polystearate, sodium benzoate, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium PCA, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t mind any of the products, but liked the cleanser the best.  The towelettes were good, but the pack I had was somewhat dry.  I don’t think they were expired or anything but just a bit less damp than other towelettes I have used.  They did seem to clean well though, and even removed make up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer was also decent.  It had a distinct scent that I could not quite put my finger on.  Not horrible, but not overly pleasant either.  I don’t know if it was the corn starch combined with the aloe and some of the other ingredients but it was kind of sappy smell that I did not care for.  But as far as performance, the cream goes on well, goes a long way and does seem to moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser was nice.  It left my face feeling clean, but not overly scrubbed or medicinal.  There is menthol in it, very far down in the ingredient list, but there’s enough so you’ll get that “cool burn” sensation.  It is a nice scrub though, with a load of natural ingredients which are good for the skin, especially the sensitive skin on your face.  It leaves my “over 50” skin feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are good products, and they can be purchased separately so you aren’t forced to buy something you don’t need or want.  I would probably pass on the towelettes next time around.  For a natural product, this line is absolutely very competitiveprice-wise and usually comes in much lower than other natural lines.</li>
    <li> FACIAL WIPES: The wipes are a good size and very soft. I liked the smell. Unfortunately, there are only ten wipes in the pack. It didn’t effectively remove my mascara though I wiped over my lashes multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURIZER: I liked it well enough. My skin looked nice. I applied it right after cleansing. It took a while for it to absorb. I don’t care for the type of pump container it came in. I just know I’m going to be wasting moisturizer that I would have been able to get out of a jar and even a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: It goes on like a cream. I liked it because of the lack of sulfates. I liked the cooling effect of the menthol. It lasted for a while even after I’d used the moisturizer. The menthol smell is a little bracing. You can’t use it to remove eye makeup since you can’t get it near your eyes.</li>
    <li> For the most part, I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Basic Face Care Kit.  The Cleanser had a nice, fresh smell neither it nor the moisturizer left my face feeling sticky or greasy and oily.  While I didn&#x27;t use the facial wipes too much, they&#x27;re great for when I&#x27;m just too busy to go through my whole facial routine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that it&#x27;s getting four stars out of five is that for some reason, the cleanser burned with the fury of 1000 suns when I first put it on my face.  In fact, I thought I was having an allergic reaction due to the burning.  It calmed down some once I put on the moisturizer, but still, it had me worried for a second there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: At first, I gave this product 4 stars.  However, after using it for two weeks, I decided to rate it 2 stars due to the cleanser.  I&#x27;m someone with somewhat oily skin.  So, I have no idea how the cleanser made my face peel the way it did.  But it did.  It dried my skin out so much (and, again, I&#x27;m someone who has the opposite problem.  The cleanser also made me breakout.  The breakout when away somewhat quicker than I&#x27;m used to, but still.  I&#x27;m not going to use a cleanser that makes me breakout just b/c it somewhat cleans my face and makes my breakouts less noticeable if it&#x27;s going to make me breakout more.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I already buy and love two Burt&#x27;s Bees products (the intense hydration eye cream and the honey lip balm). I loved every product in this kit and am already ordering more of the cleansing wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipes: I am a big user of facial wipes and I am switching to these from now on. I have been buying Aveeno ultra calming wipes every month or two, those work well and don&#x27;t irritate my skin but leave an oily feeling. These Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes clean my face without drying my skin OR leaving oil behind. Magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser: cleans well with no redness or irritation and left my skin very soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion: the lotion seals in moisture after you wash your face again with no oily or greasy residue.</li>
    <li> This face care kit contains cleansing facial wipes, cleansing cream, and daytime moisturizer, and it&#x27;s a great way to try all three products to see what you like and what you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel and the scent of the facial cleansing cream.  You apply it to your wet face, and rinse with your hands or a wet washcloth.  I&#x27;ve tried both ways, and I&#x27;m happy with both.  It feels gentle on my skin, washes off well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling either too dry or greasy or oily.  I did try it using a facial brush I often use, and - no surprise - it didn&#x27;t work as well for that.  The brush needs a more liquid product.  The tube of cream is a generous size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just noticed - the instruction on the tube state the product should be used on a wet face while the product page says dry face.  I wonder which is really correct.  I use it on a wet face, and that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily moisturizer is great, too.  It comes in a little pump bottle.  It went on my skin nicely, and there was less drag putting on foundation after using the moisturizer than there is with another moisturizer I routinely use.  It works well, too, to mix with a bit of the moisturizer with the foundation for a tinted moisturizer - for those days when I want some makeup but not full-on foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like both of those products.  I am less enthusiastic about the facial towelettes.  I don&#x27;t really like the scent of them, or the feel of the towelette itself.  They do a decent job of cleansing, but I&#x27;ve used others I like more.  This package of ten is good for travel, but I won&#x27;t be getting these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing cream and moisturizer are products I&#x27;ll get again.  Two out of three ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I am very fond of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. My first introduction to their product line was the chap stick. Whenever I start using a chap stick I tend to eat the whole thing within a few days due to it&#x27;s addictive properties so I am wary about consuming flavored petroleum jelly. I found the Burt&#x27;s Bees product and fell in love with the simplicity of the product as it provides a delightful sent, as well as fantastic healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;This new product line of face care was appealing to me because I enjoy the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products so much. The idea is to expand the safe and healthy products into other beauty care needs while still being all natural and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really liking all three of the products. However, I am not sure if it would be cost effective for me to continue to use them on a long term basis. I like to use facial wipes on the nights end to clear my pores, but the pack only came with 10 wipes. I appreciate the smell and the clean feeling after use but could not justify purchasing an entire pack for the cost. I could only make the pack of wipes last a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the moisturizer is a great product. I think I would purchase this one on an individual basis. The moisturizer goes on clean and didn&#x27;t make me feel greasy at all. It reminded me of an Aveeno product that I used to use. I am very fond of the moisture cream probably my favorite from the kit.&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite product was probably the facial cleanser. I have been using the St. Ives cleaning lotion for a while now and just think it is a fantastic product for a cheap price. This facial cleanser couldn&#x27;t compete. I don&#x27;t feel like it got my face nearly as clean of oils and dirt as the St. Ives cream managed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the kit a three. The moisturizer is a must buy for me in the future, but the other two products were not as satisfying.</li>
    <li> I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees stands for and how well the products work. Moisturizer works great without being greasy (even for my oily skin), the face wipes gently remove makeup, and the cleansing soap is amazing. Has a touch of menthol which makes my skin feel really nice. I will definitely be purchasing this kit.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried Burt’s Bees products before, but this skin care trio is the first time I’ve used the products consistently.  I’m really impressed with the quality of this skin care line, especially given its affordable price tag.  I’m middle-aged and my skin is “normal” with a tendency to be a bit oilier in the t-zone.  Here are my thoughts on each product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep Cleansing Cream:  Love this stuff!  This is a true “cream”, and a dime-size amount is enough to cleanse your face and neck – a little goes a long way.  It does not produce a lather, but it does a thorough job of cleansing your skin, including removing make-up.  It’s got a bit of a menthol type smell but it’s not overpowering.  It doesn’t leave my skin with that tight, overly dry feeling – just soft and clean.  It’s 100% natural and I didn’t experience any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towelettes:  Not impressed.  These don’t do a great job of removing make-up; even my non-waterproof mascara doesn’t budge.  These are probably best just to refresh your skin in a pinch after a work-out, or they might be OK for those who don’t wear make-up.  On the plus size they are super gentle and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Moisturizing Cream:  This product is perfect for my skin.  Just simple, lightweight moisture that absorbs right in with no sticky feeling.  Works great under make-up and is 100% Fragrance Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that stops this skin care trio from being 5 stars for me is the towelettes, which were a bit of a disappointment.  The cleanser and the moisturizer are products that I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have both been Burt’s Bees fans for some time, basically surviving every winter with their moisturizers and lip balm, but this is our first experience with one of their cleansing products. This pack comes with a smallish pack of towelette wipes for use on the go, plus an all-natural facial cleanser and a moisturizer. My wife tried everything, I just tried the cleanser and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cleanser uses only natural products, it really packs a wallop. Shortly after lathering it up and placing on my face, I could feel a slight tingling that started to warm my skin. I continued washing and allowed my cheeks, chin and forehead to “feel the burn”. When I felt I had cleaned enough, I rinsed off and immediately felt normal. This cleanser felt a little slicker after use than I like – I prefer a much brisker, less greasy finish – but my skin looked fine and after a while, felt fine. I moisturized with a small dab of the moisturizer and I felt okay, but I didn’t think my skin felt as good as it does after my usual cleansing routine, and certainly nowhere near as comfortable as after a shave and wash with post-shave balm or lotion (Axe, Dove for Men, doesn’t matter). Similarly, my wife thought the tingling was a little over the top and the moisturizer also good but not great. She did like the wipe, but there are only ten in a pack, so they are not really as utilitarian as they need to be. She also said they don’t remove make-up, so are really only useful as a “freshening up” wipe or something like that. They can’t really be used to clean you face, so like everything in this pack, she felt they were about average, maybe even good, but alas, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We certainly felt like this Burt’s package was well thought out and contains some pretty fine products, but overall, their performance is not quite as high as their lip balms and some of their other moisturizers. We struggled with whether we thought they were four star material, or just an average three stars, so we split the difference and are calling it three-and-a-half, but lighting up the fourth star on the marquee.an average three stars, so we split the difference and are calling it three-and-a-half, but lighting up the fourth star on the marquee.</li>
    <li> Honestly, my only complaint about this set is that there aren&#x27;t enough wipes. The face wash has been my favorite for a long time. I have dry skin that is prone to breakouts, but the face wash clears up my skin perfectly. As long as I use it daily, I don&#x27;t have any issues. It also smells wonderful and leaves me feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a wonderful moisturizer that is perfect under makeup. It leaves my skin very soft for hours without inciting any breakouts or skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are excellent for removing makeup or cleaning your face in a pinch. They smell heavenly, and they don&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all wonderful products, and this is a fantastic set.</li>
    <li> Amazing set of facial cleanser, make-up remover wipes, and moisturizer.  Your face will love this.  Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; natural, formula  smells and feels great.  This stuff really works. My favorite is the Deep Cleansing Cream.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent way to try all three products to see which of them works and which doesn&#x27;t. It contains a sample pack (about ten) of cleansing facial wipes, cleansing cream and a daytime moisturizer. The latter two are full size products.&lt;br /&gt;These products are not heavy but gentle and lightly scented. My wife loves them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in two minds about this face care kit. In one respect it&#x27;s a great deal. By themselves the moisturiser and the cleansing cream are $17 and $16 respectively so therefore $23.50 for both is great value. This doesn&#x27;t even include the cleansing wipes that come with it ( of which you only get 7. It&#x27;s not a full pack of 30).&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;m just not sold on the moisturiser. For years I&#x27;ve use the Burt&#x27;s Bees brightening facial moisturiser and it does a wonderful job. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble. Plus a very little amount of it goes a long way. The same can&#x27;t be said for this sensitive facial moisturiser. It&#x27;s so much thinner in consistency and not as creamy. My face still feels dry when I apply the same amount of this as I do my former moisturiser. I have to double the amount I use. Therefore I&#x27;m going to go back to my old one and just have to be out the extra money to buy the cleansing cream and moisturiser separately. In the long run maybe I won&#x27;t be out much more money because the brightening cream lasts so much longer.</li>
