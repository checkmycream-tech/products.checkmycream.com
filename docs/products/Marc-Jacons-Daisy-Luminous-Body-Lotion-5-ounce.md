      <li>I have no idea why Marc Jacobs thinks it&#x27;s necessary for women to look glittery, but it&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product, so I have given it a highly favorable rating.</li>

    <li> Love, love, love this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a very creamy body lotion, not the thin, watery type. It is very moisturizing and does not leave the skin feeling greasy. I also like the fragrance level; it&#x27;s strong enough to be worn alone if going somewhere (work, a meeting, etc.)  that you don&#x27;t want the fragrance to be too strong, and it&#x27;s excellent for layering with Daisy perfume for a night out.  The only surprise with this product is that it is \\&quot;sparkly\\&quot; on your skin. I have no idea why Marc Jacobs thinks it&#x27;s necessary for women to look glittery, but it&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product, so I have given it a highly favorable rating.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shimmery lotion that softens the skin and gives it a glow.  The scent of it is great as well.  I am glad I got it and will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I first learned of this fragrance when a friend was wearing it and I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy it.  Of course, I&#x27;m a smart Amazon shopper and knew I could most likely find it on here at a better price than in a department store.  That was definitely the case and it arrived super fast.  This is a nice, light scent that lasts a long time.  I always get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it.  It has some glitter to it as well, but it&#x27;s not too much and is just a small amount.</li>
    <li> I will order again! The friend I ordered this for loves it! Her favorite. The lotion came in it&#x27;s original box--new and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> It came with quarter of the perfume missing :(</li>
    <li> Such a refreshing smell!  It envokes happy thoughts and great times, and has such a classy and rich smell to it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Now if you don&#x27;t like glitter or shimmer, this is not the lotion for you since some people get turn off by that.&lt;br /&gt;If you Do like glitter or shimmer, you will love this, it has the perfect smell and it has shimmer, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> the product does not look like one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I was looking into it. I guess the seller bought gift set and selling them individually..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there was a sticker on the product I removed it and it says &amp;#34;not for individual sale.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well I don&#x27;t mind it.. I bought cheap and I only got what I wanted from the whole gift set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance is there so I don&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Soo many compliments on how gooood you smell, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have never used this body lotion before.  I was flipping through a magazine and there was a &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; strip in it.  I decided to try it and since the fragrance is so light, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  The price that Amazon offered this lotion for was a lot less than Macy&#x27;s or Carson&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells so fresh…not over powering at all!</li>
    <li> The product was as expected. I have the Daisy Eau de Toilet so the lotion compliments it nicely. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent so it does wear off at the end of the day, but that&#x27;s ok for me. I don&#x27;t like strong over-powering scents so this one suits me fine. I purchased it from the TOCCINI vendor and was very satisfied. The order was delivered promptly and in perfect condition. I&#x27;d do business with them again.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, it is so light and refreshing.  I get many compliments on it when I wear it.  I especially enjoy the lotion, I apply it after my shower and it has just a touch of glimmer but not to much.  Makes me feel pretty!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Use it every day. I would recommend it to anyone. I have used this product in the past and was very glad to find it oline</li>
    <li> My mom loves it, smells nice and fresh!</li>
