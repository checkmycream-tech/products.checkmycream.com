    <li> I loved it I get very good service condition</li>
    <li> Love it keep making thus product!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally find the eye shadow brand &amp; color I can never find in the stores anymore!</li>
    <li> I have tried this once and got hooked. Easy to put on and gives me that natural look. Delivery was fast too!</li>
    <li> Turns out this wasn&#x27;t the right color for me. I wanted it for a nude looking eyeshadow but it  it is far too light to use for anything except to highlight the brow bone, inner eye, etc. Otherwise, it seems to be a good eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I wanted a matt powder...this one has shimmer. ugh!</li>
    <li> This item Linen 360ESU-15 is matte and says it is matte on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it carries the exact same model number as on the shimmer version (which says shimmer on the pkg).&lt;br /&gt;The UPC codes are the same on the matte and the shimmer finish versions (I compared my old and this new one).&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this was the fault of the seller, but it would be helpful if their listing did not say all 3 finishes, and just said matte.</li>
    <li> its almost like a eye shadow/concealer any way not to pink like another one i have and looks great! and cant beat price!</li>
    <li> This is a product as well as MAC and 1/4 its price, It is a very nice light color. I love it.</li>
    <li> son buenas sedosas  quedan blancas me gustaron</li>
    <li> This works as a great base for your eyeshadow and to use just under the eyebrows.  It goes on nicely too! The only thing i would change are the applicators.  They tend to come off the stick too soon!</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite for inner lid and under brow.  Very subtle shimmer, stays on all day.  Serves as the perfect highlighter to enhance eyes. Not too pink, white, or yellow.</li>
    <li> I like the Maybelline powder eyeshadow.  I use it as a highlighter, underneath my eyebrows.  I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with other close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes. I love that the chic naturals has so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
    <li> Great to lighten up the area below your brow line. Keeps me looking fresh and awake.</li>
    <li> The picture isn&#x27;t quite the color I thought it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;However, I rated this 5 stars but I like it; don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;But there is nothing wrong with the product so I didn&#x27;t think it deserved to be marked down.</li>
    <li> Like the neutral color.</li>
    <li> OK for Price, but  I prefer loose, mineral eye shadow</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love the color. Looks very nice when applied.</li>
    <li> This is one of my makeup staples. I use it everyday to brighten my lid area after applying foundation.  What I love about this shade is that it blends perfectly with the color of my skin and, since it is completely matte but not chalky, it seems like I am not wearing anything at all. Definitely this is the best eyeshadow if you are fair-skinned and are looking for a nude and natural look.</li>
