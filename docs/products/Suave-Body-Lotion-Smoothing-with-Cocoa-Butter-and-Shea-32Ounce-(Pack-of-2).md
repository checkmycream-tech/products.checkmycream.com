      <li>Suave Cocoa Butter lotion works great for my skin, relieving dryness, itching, and smoothing away marks.</li>
      <li>On 1/1/13 - I buy a replacement bottle of this great lotion.</li>
      <li>Suave Shea and Cocoa Butter lotion used to be great.  </li>
      <li>I had been using an off brand of aveeno which is great.  </li>
      <li>I just love it!!</li>
      <li>NOT my favorite lotion!!</li>
      <li>but none of them work as good as this.  </li>
      <li>I could&#x27;ve given this product four stars because it&#x27;s price is good.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
      <li>This is a good medium-light weight lotion.  </li>
      <li>Even better!</li>
      <li>The lotion is great for all skin type and the cocoa butter will have your skin felling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>The price is sooo amazing for what you are getting.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy again, after 5 years of loving this lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on cracked heels and though it&#x27;s not as effective as some products made specifically for that purpose</li>
      <li>The old formulation of this product was perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap and don&#x27;t let the price fool</li>
      <li>Plus I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>, I find it more soothing on the cracked skin.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells great, hydrates my skin really well, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I used to LOVE the Suave Cocoa Butter lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love love this suave  cocoa butter &amp; shea lotion and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>Its rich and creamy, but not sticky or greasy at all!  </li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to find the original and buy a case (or 2)!</li>
      <li>This lotion smells great and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It also smells exactly like chocolate which makes it even more enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>The old product smelled like cocoa butter - a light pleasant chocolate scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I have been using this for a few years and have found this to be the best hand lotion.</li>
      <li>Usually very economical as well when I purchase in stores.</li>
      <li>I kid you not - it absorbs quickly and easily</li>
      <li>It used to have a nice, light, natural scent, but now it has a heavier cherry-like fragrance, AND IT BURNS MY SKIN!  </li>
      <li>it now has a sicky sweet almost floral fragrance.</li>
      <li>31 ounce 2-pack is just a economical way of getting months worth of this stuff for a low price - very nice.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothy, is absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get skin much more sensitive than mine and although I do tend to go towards unscented products (esp laundry detergent) I do sometimes take a chance on fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I think this product is worth trying.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is not sticky and has the right consistency.</li>
      <li>Just throwing that out there because sometimes it is about finding the right combination of products versus the product.  </li>
      <li>- my skin dries out very easily for some reason, especially my hands.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that there was a big difference with the suave being better (felt more relief from dryness).  </li>
      <li>It rubs in quickly and unless you put way too much on it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy/oily feeling on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I pump a little on my hands and their are good to go with some knitting or sewing.</li>
      <li>the lotions covered similar ingredient territory like dimethicone and petrolatum as do most lotions on the lotion aisle.  </li>
      <li>I must agree with L. Peterson that the newer \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; formula is not as good as the previous product, which my nephew in Arizona uses too!</li>
      <li>The latest two bottles I&#x27;ve received have a sickly sweet almost coconut scent and the lotion itself is thinner and seems watered down.</li>
      <li>It had a pleasant (chocolate) scent and was creamy and thick.</li>
      <li>The price is very affortable, but don&#x27;t let the price turn you away  from this lotion because this lotion really moisturize your skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not irritating to the skin</li>
      <li>as soon as I run out of the old, and can&#x27;t find more - I will be searching for a different lotion.</li>
      <li>And I love its very subtle fragrance, and am sure they use real cocoa butter in it because you can smell it as well as feel it on your skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbed in just a few minutes and leaves skin feeling soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>In fact I compared the ingredients and my old bottle listed cocoa butter and shea much higher up in the ingredient list than the newest bottles I have received.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers from the very cheap to the expensive.  </li>
      <li>The new product is PEE-weW!</li>
      <li>Now I definitely appreciate the fact that I purchased this double pack. :)</li>
      <li>In all honesty you are always taking a chance with a new product that you may be the rare exception that has a reaction, but anything you buy at a regular grocery store will be dermatologist tested as is this product.  </li>
      <li>Presumably to make up for the lack of cocoa butter they&#x27;ve included this new overpowered faux chocolate scent.</li>
      <li>If I were to rate the new one ...</li>
      <li>NEW??</li>
      <li>They tried to save money on the new formula, but will be losing my money as a customer.</li>
      <li>I received this product very fast and was amazed at how big the bottle was.</li>
      <li>My star rating is for the OLD lotion -5 stars!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just switched to the Cucumber with Aloe lotion from the same company and although it&#x27;s a little early to tell, so far it&#x27;s much better.</li>
      <li>nearly all Suave products</li>
      <li>The OLD product was called \\&quot;Cocoa Butter with shea body lotion\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Definitely not heavy or obnoxious</li>
      <li>far as perfume, it&#x27;s also medium-light in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Normally, I&#x27;m all for change, but I want my Suave Cocoa Butter Lotion back!  </li>
      <li>I definitely feel for those who have found the new formulation to no longer work for them; what a pain.  </li>
      <li>shea\\&quot; and a new graphic.</li>
      <li>However, it didn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>To me that is astounding because some of the supposedly high quality (and very expensive) lotions out there are advertised as being so wonderful, but when you use them they either smell bad or too perfumey, or are greasy and sticky and have a strange after affect.  </li>
      <li>The graphic on this Amazon listing IS the old graphic - but will the lotion be the old product???</li>
      <li>I will search long for the OLD lotion!</li>
      <li>I have scleroderma btw, so extremely dry skin and very sensitive.  </li>

<li> Also on a side note for the natural products, there are actually a higher chance for bad reactions over all, but a little education on the ingredients goes a long way.  :-)  </li>
<li> Anytime I&#x27;ve bought other lotions to try out, I usually end up giving them away to family members or someone at work, and going right back to Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea Body Lotion!!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s terrible when a company takes a once quality product and releases something more cheaply made in it&#x27;s place.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried literally EVERYTHING out there because my skin is so dry, especially my hands and feet.  </li>
<li> This has the ability to soak in and last for a long, long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (just soft and moist), and actually lasts a few hours - which is a miracle with my dry skin.  </li>
<li> Nothing ever lasted this long for me.  </li>
<li> The new \\&quot;richer\\&quot; formula must mean that the product is going to make Suave richer; they must be saving a bundle by not actually adding any cocoa butter to their lotion.</li>
<li> Plus it stays on for a very long time.  </li>
<li> The new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; formula has less shea butter, and less cocoa butter (which is now cocoa seed butter).  </li>
<li> I have dry hands and use a lot.</li>
<li> Sometimes my arms and legs get dry and itchy, but after using this lotion it goes away.  </li>
<li> I ran to Walmart today - and bought EVERY bottle of the OLD product, alas only 3 left.</li>
<li> I bought this suave lotion at a local store because it was half the price of what I was using</li>
<li> I have very dry and itchy skin, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the oily feeling that other lotions, like Eucerin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very dry and itchy skin, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the oily feeling that other lotions, like Eucerin so I suffered through it.  I tried this one day and am in 7th heaven.  It rubs in quickly and unless you put way too much on it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy/oily feeling on my skin.  It also smells exactly like chocolate which makes it even more enjoyable to use.</li>
    <li> I love Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea Body Lotion!!!!  It is the best lotion I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried literally EVERYTHING out there because my skin is so dry, especially my hands and feet.  This lotion is fantastic.  Its rich and creamy, but not sticky or greasy at all!  It just absorbs so well into my skin.  Sometimes my arms and legs get dry and itchy, but after using this lotion it goes away.  Plus it stays on for a very long time.  The price is sooo amazing for what you are getting.  To me that is astounding because some of the supposedly high quality (and very expensive) lotions out there are advertised as being so wonderful, but when you use them they either smell bad or too perfumey, or are greasy and sticky and have a strange after affect.  I have a tube of this in my purse, a pump bottle in the bathroom, one in my bedroom, and one for my office at work.  And I love its very subtle fragrance, and am sure they use real cocoa butter in it because you can smell it as well as feel it on your skin.  Its wonderful.  Anytime I&#x27;ve bought other lotions to try out, I usually end up giving them away to family members or someone at work, and going right back to Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea Body Lotion!!  I just love it!!</li>
    <li> Only lotion I&#x27;ve used for 10+ years.  I try my mom&#x27;s expensive creams/moisturizers when I visit her several times a year but none of them work as good as this.  Usually very economical as well when I purchase in stores.</li>
    <li> I could&#x27;ve given this product four stars because it&#x27;s price is good. However, it didn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin. I&#x27;ve just switched to the Cucumber with Aloe lotion from the same company and although it&#x27;s a little early to tell, so far it&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> This is Absolutely Great and Awesome stuff. Plus I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it gets 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have scleroderma btw, so extremely dry skin and very sensitive.  I had been using an off brand of aveeno which is great.  I bought this suave lotion at a local store because it was half the price of what I was using and I spend a lot of money on skin products.  I put the off brand on one arm and this suave on the other.  I actually didn&#x27;t think there would be any difference since (if you look at the ingredient lists) the lotions covered similar ingredient territory like dimethicone and petrolatum as do most lotions on the lotion aisle.  I was surprised that there was a big difference with the suave being better (felt more relief from dryness).  The people in the reviews who had burning must have had either a bad reaction to the fragrance (which can definitely happen) or a particular ingredient did not agree with them specifically.  You can&#x27;t get skin much more sensitive than mine and although I do tend to go towards unscented products (esp laundry detergent) I do sometimes take a chance on fragrance.  In all honesty you are always taking a chance with a new product that you may be the rare exception that has a reaction, but anything you buy at a regular grocery store will be dermatologist tested as is this product.  Also on a side note for the natural products, there are actually a higher chance for bad reactions over all, but a little education on the ingredients goes a long way.  :-)  I definitely feel for those who have found the new formulation to no longer work for them; what a pain.  Even with the best lotion I must use an aquaphor type product from time to time esp on the driest spots like elbows, knees, bottom of feet.  Just throwing that out there because sometimes it is about finding the right combination of products versus the product.  Plus your skin can change over time.  I think this product is worth trying.  Hope you find what works for you.</li>
    <li> For the price, I have been using this for a few years and have found this to be the best hand lotion. I have dry hands and use a lot. I keep this strategically placed so as I pass by it I pump a little on my hands and their are good to go with some knitting or sewing.</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE the Suave Cocoa Butter lotion.  Smelled just like chocolate.  Now, it smells like pineapple and cherry mixed together --  like a Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion that I have used in the past.  Plus it&#x27;s not as thick as the previous version.  Normally, I&#x27;m all for change, but I want my Suave Cocoa Butter Lotion back!  I don&#x27;t want to smell fruity.  I moved over to the Suave brand when Ponds Cream and Cocoa Butter Lotion was no longer manufactured.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers from the very cheap to the expensive.  Very few moisturizers work as well as Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea.  I kid you not - it absorbs quickly and easily, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy (just soft and moist), and actually lasts a few hours - which is a miracle with my dry skin.  Nothing ever lasted this long for me.  Ever.  Usually I&#x27;d feel the need to replenish a few dozen times a day - my skin dries out very easily for some reason, especially my hands.  This has the ability to soak in and last for a long, long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 31 ounce 2-pack is just a economical way of getting months worth of this stuff for a low price - very nice.  Plus it qualifies for super-saver shipping!  Even better!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great, hydrates my skin really well, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It&#x27;s absorbed in just a few minutes and leaves skin feeling soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve even used it on cracked heels and though it&#x27;s not as effective as some products made specifically for that purpose, I find it more soothing on the cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Changed formula. Used this for years.&lt;br /&gt;Than stopped after they changed it?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy again, after 5 years of loving this lotion.</li>
    <li> Suave Shea and Cocoa Butter lotion used to be great.  The new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; formula has less shea butter, and less cocoa butter (which is now cocoa seed butter).  It used to have a nice, light, natural scent, but now it has a heavier cherry-like fragrance, AND IT BURNS MY SKIN!  They tried to save money on the new formula, but will be losing my money as a customer.</li>
    <li> Hmmm! What An Body Lotion. This is a body lotion used by every member of my family and was very good on our skin. I would recommend this body lotion for anyone that need a moisturising body cream.</li>
    <li> This is a good medium-light weight lotion.  It goes on smoothy, is absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as perfume, it&#x27;s also medium-light in my opinion.  Definitely not heavy or obnoxious and it&#x27;s a fragrance that the guys in my family don&#x27;t mind wearing: ever so Slightly floral with a hint of cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nearly all Suave products it&#x27;s not irritating to the skin and it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> I received this product very fast and was amazed at how big the bottle was. It&#x27;s very cheap and don&#x27;t let the price fool you this has to be one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and I love it. Now I definitely appreciate the fact that I purchased this double pack. :)</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Suave Cocoa Butter lotion works great for my skin, relieving dryness, itching, and smoothing away marks.</li>
    <li> On 1/1/13 - I buy a replacement bottle of this great lotion. IT HAS BEEN CHANGED!! Front says \\&quot;Smoothing\\&quot; \\&quot;now richer formula\\&quot; - and \\&quot;with cocoa butter and shea\\&quot; and a new graphic. NEW?? Oh! NO!! NOT my favorite lotion!! I read the label: WELL, the cocoa butter and shea have moved DOWN on the ingredient list [meaning LESS of those items]. The OLD product was called \\&quot;Cocoa Butter with shea body lotion\\&quot;. The new product is PEE-weW! stinky- it now has a sicky sweet almost floral fragrance. The old product smelled like cocoa butter - a light pleasant chocolate scent. I ran to Walmart today - and bought EVERY bottle of the OLD product, alas only 3 left. The rest were the \\&quot;new\\&quot;. I will search long for the OLD lotion! My star rating is for the OLD lotion -5 stars! If I were to rate the new one ...ZERO....as soon as I run out of the old, and can&#x27;t find more - I will be searching for a different lotion. The graphic on this Amazon listing IS the old graphic - but will the lotion be the old product???</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft. The price is very affortable, but don&#x27;t let the price turn you away  from this lotion because this lotion really moisturize your skin. The lotion is great for all skin type and the cocoa butter will have your skin felling silky smooth. The lotion is not sticky and has the right consistency. I love love this suave  cocoa butter &amp; shea lotion and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The old formulation of this product was perfect. It had a pleasant (chocolate) scent and was creamy and thick. Somewhere along the line they changed the formula! The latest two bottles I&#x27;ve received have a sickly sweet almost coconut scent and the lotion itself is thinner and seems watered down. In fact I compared the ingredients and my old bottle listed cocoa butter and shea much higher up in the ingredient list than the newest bottles I have received. Presumably to make up for the lack of cocoa butter they&#x27;ve included this new overpowered faux chocolate scent. It&#x27;s terrible when a company takes a once quality product and releases something more cheaply made in it&#x27;s place. The new \\&quot;richer\\&quot; formula must mean that the product is going to make Suave richer; they must be saving a bundle by not actually adding any cocoa butter to their lotion. Suave should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I must agree with L. Peterson that the newer \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; formula is not as good as the previous product, which my nephew in Arizona uses too! Guess I&#x27;ll have to find the original and buy a case (or 2)! Too bad. :(</li>
