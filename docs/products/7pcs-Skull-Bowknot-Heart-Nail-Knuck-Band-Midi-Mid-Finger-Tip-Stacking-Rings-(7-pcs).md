<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In the first place this rings come out too small ...&amp; it&#x27;s a nasty gold tone .. Is like cheap pant .. And the one with the bowl it broke off like wdf... I won&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> These rings are super cute and a great fit for small fingers. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them with my stiletto nails!</li>
    <li> more than half of the rings arrived broken! it was terrible, i cant believe i paid money for broken jewelry!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. But I got what I paid for I guess it wasn&#x27;t all that pretty or nice</li>
    <li> Cause there so small and  they look cheap and they just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but mean if u have smal fingers then it will work</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these rings to come in and when they did I was somewhat disappointed. I like that they are adjustable. But the skull ring just looks like a little golden blob you cant even tell its a skull. The nail ring just looks weird. The plain rings ended up being my favorite, but after one day of wearing them they left my fingers green and turned from a pretty gold color to an unattractive bronzey color. The bow ring was also way too big to fit as a midi ring. Overall I don&#x27;t hate the product, but I definitely don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> the nail tip one was cheap and too small to fit any bodies pinky!, oh and the bowknot one was also too big for all of my normal-sized fingers exept for my thumb!, and the bow fell off that day! i really wish i hadn&#x27;t bought them they weren&#x27;t worth the money, i truly do suggest not to buy this ring set</li>
    <li> For the price, this item was really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;You may not be able to wear them the same way as the picture depending on the your finger sizes.&lt;br /&gt;But they are vary cute.</li>
    <li> Be prepared to wait a month and a half for some yellow rings only 3 of them are mid rings</li>
    <li> All of the rings are too small, the skull and the heart one look nothing like the picture. They look deformed. Very Cheap , would not buy. The only plus was that they came pretty fast. But i don&#x27;t recommend and would NEVER buy again.</li>
    <li> These rings are cute and fashionable. I wear 2 every day because wearing them all looks kind of tacky, but good product for the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, the price&#x3D;the quality. My complaint is mine are not smooth my heart has a big blob under the gold and so does the nail ring.</li>
    <li> Very creative and good to wear for summer love them. Some fit bigger then other rings but you can work with them.</li>
    <li> this product is rusting rubish  :(  don&#x27;t recommend it! very awful quality. looks not as in foto. Have changed the color in 2 days.</li>
    <li> The rings fit a little tight and the gold rusts easily. My favorite ring is the bow. The rest of the rings are too tight.</li>
    <li> I really like the rings the only thing is that the ring was changing color(turning green) after the first wear...so what I did was put clear nail polish on them and seem to be ok now.Just try to avoid lotion,perfume,soap,and water while wearing.The good note about the seller he was fast to ship.</li>
    <li> the bow broke 3 mins after wearing it. The others tinted my fingers green. I knew for the price I wasnt getting a &amp;#34;jewel&amp;#34; but this is ridiculous</li>
    <li> The ring change fingers green (not when getting wet) the bowtie fell off one ring after taking it out the package and majority of the ring do not fit on the fingers correctly! Bad product! Get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Some were weird looking but the skull heart and now were cute. They fit well. you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> they were Beautiful, but it was cheaply made,  i had to buysomething for the color to stay, don&#x27;t worth the effort</li>
    <li> Cute when first rcvd, but the bow broke off the ring the first time wearing it.. Other rings were also too big</li>
    <li> Most of the rings only fit on two finger and some where two small to fit on any of my fingers.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I opened my package. The rings looked nothing like the picture, the sizes were extremely small and they turned my finger green the first day I wore them.</li>
    <li> I waited a whole month for these and when they came, they were disappointing. The rings are not the &#x27;gold&#x27; colors as it is in the photo shown ; theres this one ring with a pointy metal part so if you put it on, It&#x27;ll scrape your hand ; Wear them for half an hour and there already gonna lose their color and leave the skin part where you wore your ring &#x27;blue&#x27; . Theres only like 3 good/cute ones I like but i recommend not buying. they suck tho :/</li>
    <li> The rings are cute but they looked deformed. You get what you pay for. The bow ring is too big but i wear it on my middle finger. Some of the rings are too small.But i will purchase again to wear a few times.</li>
    <li> horrible just horrible ugggghhhh none of them fit but one....n they turn your finger green like wtf cheap cheap cheap</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED AND THEY SENT ALL BANDS NO BOW KNOT NO HEART AND WHEN I CONTACTED TO LET THEM KNOW THEY IGNORE YOU THEY GOT YOUR MONEY AND THATS ALL THEY CARE!</li>
    <li> perfect for use only one day because they already come loossing the color gold, they so nice but dont have long life</li>
    <li> I am happy with what I got...it did turn color quickly but that was expected....now I act like that&#x27;s the color its suppose to be....lolol</li>
    <li> I purchased two of this product, one for myself and the other is a gift. Both were new and very cute. I love how the gold is shine and the material is very good. The only one thing that I don&#x27;t like is some of them are not adjusted size, otherwise they are cute.</li>
    <li> they were nice. cheap and what i expected. ive only worn them once. so far so good. yes, yassss, yeassss !</li>
    <li> These rings look just like the picture and fit perfect. I love them, just wish they came in silver too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and 3 didn&#x27;t fit at all they were really really small the one with the bow was really big ..... Very disappointing purchase maybe they should have put the actual sizes if each ting</li>
    <li> This product sucks. I was supposed to get it June 9th the latest and is June 12th still no sign of it... 0 stars</li>
    <li> Even for the price I&#x27;m super disappointed. Glad they where so cheap or would send them back. One fits nice the rest are so small the won&#x27;t even go on.</li>
    <li> These are really cheap rings for a toddler to play dress up with. They would only fit on my pinky finger. Tried them on my toe to and its a no go there too. Save your money and buy a coke. You&#x27;ll enjoy that much better.</li>
    <li> For the price i find them to be a really good find. they are cheaply made but it&#x27;s just a trend and i know i wouldn&#x27;t pay $15 maybe even $20 for something like this at a regular store. If you like the trend and you want to buy some go with these :) the bow fit well on my ring finger most of them are pretty small except the bow and the simple rings. if you have thin fingers they will fit you fine.</li>
    <li> The rings in the picture are not the rings I received at all!!! I would give this product zero stars if they allowed it.</li>
    <li> I did not like it on the computer it look cute but in person they were so small.I would not buy for u again because it was the most bad thing i bought.So dont waste your money if you do good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.In the end of all this it work for my little pet shop.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and looks lovely worn half way on the finger as shown on the picture, I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> the color gold came off within like 3 uses . and they didn&#x27;t fit properly as mid rings . i wouldnt buy this .</li>
    <li> These are just okay. Nothing great, but not terrible. I won&#x27;t complain because I got what I paid for. They do look a bit inexpensive , so I guess I&#x27;ll give them to my niece.</li>
    <li> I love these rings so much! I put a clear coat of nail polish over it because I don&#x27;t want the gold paint to fade. I have pretty small hands, so the rings fit perfectly. The bow ring can fit on my thumb, and the rest are midis for the ring, middle, and pinky. The only dislike would be that they do not fit the index finger as midi rings. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Omg the only thing I can say I love  it maybe too much the nail ring is big but it&#x27;s ok .... If I lose mine rings  I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I never received the rings in the first place. waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying unless you just want to waste some money.</li>
    <li> Broke first day i got them! Cheap metal and smallllllll it was a big waste of money to me :(</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Yes, they take a long time to arrive, but they are toooo cute so well worth the wait! I recommend painting a clear coat of nail polish on them before wearing them. I forgot that I was wearing them and washed my hands, so they did start to turn my fingers green. I put clear polish on after that one time, and they have held up pretty good. love</li>
    <li> its cheap and it does not fit my fingers because it does not. I have normal size finger and it does not fit what else can i say</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.I recommend this product it is very very useful .I received all 6 rings. This product met my expectations.👌</li>
    <li> Because all the ring size are small. Infant size. I&#x27;m upset and I was excited to use them and now I can&#x27;t. Waste of money ! Not a happy customer !</li>
    <li> Cheaply made!!!! The worst costume jewelry ever purchased. Will not suggest this product to anyone. The bow broke off in ten minutes.</li>
    <li> I have received 5. Didnt like it I would rather go.to a kids deparment and get rings ! ! !</li>
    <li> They look and feel so cheap it looks like my preschool son did them with a piece of wire!!!!!!!!!! Dont buy</li>
    <li> i didnt like them and it made my fingers turn green alot and i didnt really like how that happend</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t lose your money. it&#x27;s not good and very cheap . I dont like any and will not use it</li>
    <li> The rings were way to small I mean they didn&#x27;t even fit on the pinkies of my six and eight year old daughters</li>
    <li> I loved the look of these but the issue with these is my fingers are much bigger and they came in a standard size. My husband was able to cut them where they were connected and sanded down the sharp spots so that he could bend them to fit my fingers.</li>
    <li> i liked these rings, but the sizes ran quite weird. definitely a good price for a new trend, would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was cheaply made and look nothing like the picture. I was very very very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Worst rings ever!!! They turned green the second day i wore them! Bad quality! Doesnt look anything like how it looks on the picture.</li>
    <li> They looked super fake! They turned color in less than an hr! It was literally the worst thing! Waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I love these but they aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they look in this picture. I would recommend them though and I have gotten many compliments on them.</li>
    <li> Never again would I buy from this - only one ring looked BARELY like what pictured. I threw them all away. cheap and disappointing</li>
    <li> These rings are really cute and go with almost anything that you want to wear. They have not started to turn colors yet... But the will sometimes leave a green mark / ring on the skin of my fingers. Make sure that you remember that theses are for the top part of your fingers: not where you would usually put rings on. These are definitely worth their price!</li>
    <li> Rings are a bit deformed not as perfect as pictured  but still kinda cute on your hand love the bow</li>
    <li> I thought these were super cute and were a great deal! However, when I received them and tried them on, they were way too small. Granted, I don&#x27;t have extremely skinny fingers, but they barely fit on my pinky fingers.</li>
    <li> I like them there very cute there gonna look real nice once the summer comes and I polish my nails</li>
    <li> They are very cheap looking. Turns your fingers different colors after a couple hours of use. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> VERY CHEAP QUALITY!! THEY LOOK LIKE THE FAKE JEWELRY THAT YOU GET FROM THE GUMBALL MACHINE. YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN TELL THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL, HEART RING AND THE OVERLAPED RING DOES NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL. THE ONLY RING DUABLE WAS THE RIBBON ONE OTHER THAN THAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rusting already I only wore it once and the bow tie ring is not a midi ring so it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> they fit exactly as expected. but some of them look a little orange instead of gold. so be carefulwith that. pain over them with clear polish</li>
    <li> These rings are made for an infant. They are extremely too small and the quality is horrible. Even though you get what you pay for I have spent $1.25 for a 5 pack of silver knuckle bands and it&#x27;s the best $ I have ever spent. Save your money people</li>
    <li> rings are different sizes. Some don&#x27;t fit. What&#x27;s the old saying...&amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. bla, bla, bla, bla</li>
    <li> Only one of the rings fit my fingers.  A piece of one of the rings actually broke off when I tried to put it on.</li>
    <li> The rings look nothing like the picture, you cannot make out the design of the rings they just look like small gold blobs.</li>
    <li> After waiting for almost a month, my items arrived in a tiny plastic envelope without padding and the packaging and rings were both damaged!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s fingers they use to determine the size, but I just opened my order and ended up giving them to my 5 year old daughters. They do not fit. The only one that fits is the little bow..not a loss cause my girls love them. But I gave it one star because they are sold for adults.</li>
    <li> I rated this product 3 stars. I like the fact that so many rings come in the pack. Defiantly made the appearance look really nice. Only thing I disliked was that the rings became rusty really quick and the bow fell off after 3 days of wearing. I would recommend this product to any females looking for knuckle rings. Also would suggest coating the rings with clear nail polish so they would rust.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them the bow ring is broke and thay are to little it&#x27;s a waste of time and money to send back I just going to trash them</li>
    <li> They were really awesome when I first got them and let me tell you, they&#x27;re small but I was able to fit one on every hand and stack and they were really nice. People kept complimenting but then they faded to a really light gold and eventually silver, I would&#x27;ve liked them better if they kept the gold color. Despite this though, they&#x27;re still nice.</li>
    <li> Nt good quality at all, two of the rings broke when I put them on the first time. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Love the rings and the price..except the size on the picture weren&#x27;t the same when I got them they were smaller and I only got a 6 pc set..but other then that very cute for adding to any outfit :-D</li>
    <li> Bad quality. I threw all of them away except the bow ring. You really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So I just got my rings yesterday &amp; they are soooo tiny... I&#x27;m little wit little fingers so I dnt understand how all cnt fit all my fingers...the skull fits my pinky but I already got the 2 hearts &amp; this other little ring on my pinky so the skull would hv to go on my ring finger (which it can hardly fit) the bow on my middle finger, the finger tip on my other pinky &amp; the plan ring on my ring finger w/the skull smh.... Cute rings but luckily I hv other finger rings tht could go w/these rings!!!</li>
    <li> Totally fake, I didn&#x27;t get what was on the picture. Very disappointing . I feel like I was just deceived</li>
    <li> As much as I love them they are extremely small I cant even get them over my fingernails on most fingers. They fit my pinky finger perfectly but I was going for the look on the picture. They arrived before the expected delivery date and other than I cant fit them over most fingers theyre great.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I thought they were gonna be like the picture but they weren&#x27;t in.the picture they look real what I got was fake plastic like</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking. I know they are not pricey but I definitely could of put my few dollars elsewhere. I will not be wearing these at all.</li>
    <li> Idk... The rings are aight I guess. The quality sucks tho. I mean that&#x27;s what u get for the price. So yeah. It&#x27;s kinda rusty</li>
    <li> EXPENSIVE and not worth it.  too small and chintzy&lt;br /&gt;these were tiny, like a child&#x27;s play toy.&lt;br /&gt;they were cute enough, but not at all useful</li>
    <li> I love these things! But if you have big fingers only the bow shaped one will fit you:(But if you have tiny fingers,like me you will enjoy these! They are currently trending so be sure to look at others on amazon.</li>
    <li> I agree that the rings look cheaply made! They don&#x27;t look nice like the picture, and the bow ring didn&#x27;t even fit as a normal ring, happy I only paid like $2 though. You should change the picture and display what you actually sell people!</li>
    <li> i hate these rings there toooo small to even fit on your knuckles. they are cute though. wish they were alittle bigger</li>
    <li> After ordering these rings I could not wait for them to come in, I for one have what seems to be small fingers compared to most and these rings didnt even fit my pinky they are so small that now I can not even wear them I am glad they were under $5</li>
    <li> Over all I would say they are worth it. Fashionable yet simple. They may change colors but clear nail polish will preserve them. Bid you have sweaty fingers I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. But other than that they&#x27;re perfect for a diva!</li>
    <li> Terrible material actually plastic painted to look like metal.&lt;br /&gt;They are not made to fit knuckles...turned my fingers green, save your money don&#x27;t but these.</li>
    <li> IS NOT THE SAME  with photography&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY UGLY...&lt;br /&gt;DEFORMED ...&lt;br /&gt;IT IS HORRIBLE IN HAND I THREW MY RINGS IN THE TRASH very disappointed...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re  too small. These would be great for people with smaller hands. It got here in a good amount of time though.</li>
    <li> cute rings i liked most of them but some were a little off. the ring with the nail was a little too small and the ring with the skull had ridges that kind of hurt. but its cheap and it was a good product. the bow ring is super cute but its not a midi ring on me.- XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> The rings are so tiny, not recommended for thicker fingers at all. Wondering who to give it to because I don&#x27;t even know who they can fit 😩</li>
    <li> Not what was expected.Only one ring fit the rings dont even look like the picture. Dont go wasting your money on all this,all this is, is junk.</li>
    <li> These rings are very cute and fashionable. I wear all the rings except the nail ring. The nail ring isnt nearly the size of anyones nail. These rings look good with any outfit</li>
    <li> Ok I wear most of the set all the time and everyone loves them but the one that covers your fingernail arrived broken and the one that looks like a spiral needs to be sanded or something because it is scratchy. Other than that I wear all of the other ones. You get what you pay for but for the price....I would probably get them again.</li>
    <li> It is nothing like the picture can&#x27;t fit my fingers I am very disappointed I waited all this time for nothing will not do business with this company again it took over a month to receive this item was not worth my money I am very upset.</li>
    <li> Rings didn&#x27;t fit at all . Wasn&#x27;t even rings. Was horrible didnteven look like the picture when I received them</li>
    <li> VERY very cheap and only fit to of my fingers. they were to small and the bow broke in just a moment of delivery.</li>
    <li> Sizes are way way bigger then it looks. Took very long to come in, I like the bow ring only.</li>
    <li> I HATE THEM, DO NOT ORDER!!!!! they only come in one size, soooooo more than likely they will be to small!!!</li>
    <li> I like these rings but they did not fit as I thought they would fit some did not fit at all but overall the product is ok</li>
    <li> I brought these because they looked good but they were too small I had to give them to my 8 ur old daughter because they fit her fingers lol</li>
    <li> I love these rings! There so cute! I just wish they had a bigger variety, but I mean for the price it was awesome! The only one I didn&#x27;t like was the one that&#x27;s shaped like a finger nail because it was smaller than all my finger nails and I thought it was suppose to cover them or atleast one, but it didn&#x27;t cover any so it kind of looks dumb on me. But I&#x27;ll probably give it to my little niece to wear or something. Otherwise I love them! There a fun accessory!</li>
    <li> For the price its ok if you only plan on wearing them one or two times. However the shipping took FOREVER!!! About two months so if you plan on ordering them, dont plan on wearing them anytime soon. Clearly they aren&#x27;t real gold but I was disappointed after wearing them once the coloring started to fade off. Of course they left the green/brown rings on my fingers as well. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong but don&#x27;t plan on wearing these more than a few times</li>
    <li> I wear these all the time, I love all of them! I&#x27;m a size 7 ring and most fit just above my knuckle, and some fit normally! I made sure to clear coat these with nail polish before wearing them so they don&#x27;t change colour! Shipping was fast and they were packaged well! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly which I liked. The only thing is the bow of one ring broke when I got it. And they change color very very quickly.</li>
    <li> great product. a bit small though . other than that the items are very detailed like  in the description of it</li>
