<li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t smug, and is long lasting.</li>
<li> Then for some odd reasons I tried more expensive mascaras, which caused irritation to my eyes.  </li>
<li> I recieved this product and it was like the tube was empty.</li>
<li> I apply it once in the morning, and it&#x27;s set for the day and lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your eye lashes.</li>
<li> The tube I received was dried up.</li>
<li> Very disappointing, waste of money</li>
<li> Having used this product before, I was unable to find it in any of the stores I went to.</li>
