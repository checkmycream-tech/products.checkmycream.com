      <li>/&gt;Overall my experience was good, save the mistakes I made.  </li>
      <li>But over all really good.</li>
      <li>Works really good</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this razor!</li>
      <li>We have the BodyGroomer and love it (both of us!), and the Braun just doesn&#x27;t compare for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I liked using it.</li>
      <li>and it is nice to have a razor/trimmer that can be used in the shower and recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I would have liked for the razor portion to be power like the Gillette Fusion Power,</li>
      <li>Better than most of these type products, the electric part followed by the razor was a great idea</li>
      <li>The handle had a good grip and the included accessories (combs, caddy, case, etc) were fitting for this price range.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Braun products, and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The way it is designed it would be very easy for someone to cut themselves on the razor blades.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother with the plastic attachments, and found the shave very easy on my skin.</li>

      <li>The battery life so far has been excellent, and Braun says you can get up 50 hours per charge.</li>
      <li>The guards make for safe and effective trimming.</li>
      <li>Okay - two of us tried this and neither of us was overly thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a trimmer in the shower, but until they improve on this design, I&#x27;d advise anyone looking at this to purchase a razor and trimmer separately.</li>
      <li>, I already knew exactly which attachment would work best and was able to shave and shaved very quickly.  </li>
      <li>, I already knew exactly which attachment would work best and was able to shave and shaved very quickly.  </li>
      <li>(A Braun 5414 has been going strong fo over 10 years!)    </li>
      <li>But I must admit that the Gillette blade system used is an excellent one (the same one I use to shave my face, and the best I&#x27;ve found so far), so if you want to have both trimmer and shaver in one place, I suppose this is the way to do it.</li>
      <li>no (sorry!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer does a great job in getting rid of most hair, and it does a fantastic job (much better than the body groomer) at trimming and doing fine hair</li>
      <li>It performed a very smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>OK, I guess some guys might like keeping that area...</li>
      <li>It just seems more like a sales pitch than anything.</li>
      <li>Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>You cannot get a closer body shave than that, but unless that is an issue you are better off with the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>and I get better results.</li>
      <li>all, I like using this much better than the Mangroomer (also sold on Amazon).  </li>
      <li>I just wish there were more settings for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>and I can swear in no uncertain terms that it shaves more closely than any razor I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>and I shall give you the conclusion that I surmised as well as you should be able to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; position is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I have a Phillips Norelco that I like much better and will probably stick with.</li>
      <li>For example, some guys just want to trim things up a bit, and there&#x27;s an appropriate attachment for them.</li>
      <li>The Braun bodyCruzer works best if you have a moderate amount of body hair to trim.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t shave against the grain with the buzzer, or it will hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A decade or two ago a \\&quot;neat\\&quot; girl was uncommon to be seen in men&#x27;s magazines, or in real life for that matter.  </li>
      <li>I use this to trim body hair in even the most sensative places and it does without any pain.</li>
      <li>This sleek looking unit is a better edger than it is a body groomer.  </li>
      <li>And if my experience with the Fusion razor is any guide, it probably is outstanding at this.  </li>
      <li>The light on it goes brown when you put it in the inductive charger, but it never changes color, and the unit remains warm in the charger, leading me to pull it out manually after the 10 hours of charging</li>
      <li>blade defeats the purpose of the trimmer in many cases.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if you rarely get irritations from blades and prefer to use shave/blade combo in the shower/bath, then this could be a good choice for you.  </li>
      <li>For most, if you are getting irritation from a blade, then you will get irritation from using this blade as well.  </li>
      <li>I put the bodycruZer through the a vigorous review process and was overall impressed with its performance:         </li>
      <li>and here it is, sitting on top of a trimmer.  </li>
      <li>I quite liked the Mach 3 original blades, though they did tend to nick me at times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I like a clean shave, so</li>
      <li>The thing I love most about it is that it&#x27;s waterproof and really easy to charge with the docking station.</li>
      <li>It is great for everything, be it getting rid of unwanted body hair or just normal shaving.</li>
      <li>As a trimmer, this product does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>This works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to using a pair of electric clippers for grooming, so with that in mind I&#x27;ll say that the Braun bodyCruzer does a pretty good job considering that it is a battery operated trimmer.  </li>
      <li>You may not use everything it comes with and make use of everything it&#x27;s capable of, but you will get a good trim or shave or whatever hair manipulation that interests you most.</li>

      <li>This groomer works good, but I&#x27;d much prefer a groomer that has a more permanent \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; attachment rather than the Gillete razor that it uses.  </li>
      <li>Braun did a great job designing this product, and the device has a very natural feel.      </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This Body Groomer efficiently removes body hair in all parts of a man&#x27;s body. The weird placement of a Gilette Fusion razor on the back side of it seems like a simple effort to get me to use more of those expensive things than I&#x27;m already using on my face.    But it got me to thinking:  when was it exactly that men were expected to start being \\&quot;neat down there?\\&quot;  Yes, I&#x27;m talking about what you are thinking.  I think it is fully expected for men (at least under 50) to be neatly trimmed \\&quot;down there.\\&quot;  This body trimmer is clearly not only for competitive swimmers,cyclists, or Abercrombie models, as I doubt that market is large enough to sustain this product.     I think the trend to men being \\&quot;neat\\&quot; started with women being \\&quot;neat.\\&quot;  A decade or two ago a \\&quot;neat\\&quot; girl was uncommon to be seen in men&#x27;s magazines, or in real life for that matter.  \\&quot;Neat\\&quot; girls were an anomaly - some might even say kinky.  Look at any glamour photography from the 70s or adult films: the ladies were a lot more hirsute back then.  I think the 90s were the decade in which being \\&quot;neat\\&quot; became mainstream for women (at least of a certain age).    For men, this presents a bit of a dilemma.  Once I&#x27;m \\&quot;neat\\&quot; down there, where do I stop?  Do I go for the \\&quot;full monty\\&quot; like the very smooth, slender, smiling man on the box of the trimmer?  Is there a different answer for the heterosexual, metrosexual, or homosexual man? Will this require constant upkeep like shaving my face?  Maybe by expanding the geography I&#x27;m just creating an entire golf course of grass to mow weekly instead of just a putting green.      Anyway, this little \\&quot;Body Groomer\\&quot; does its job, whatever you decide that job is.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor/trimmer 2 weeks ago.   It performs well.  It performed a very smooth shave.  BUT, I give credit to the Gillette Fusion blade not to the shaver.  The buzzing handle does not seem to vibrate the blade as much as my Gillette AAA powered Mach 3 handle.  I trimmed side burns with the trimmer and it worked fine.    Buy this machine as a trimmer only.  For a shaver I would recommend the battery powered Gillette Fusion (~$12.99)  You can probably find a medium sized trimmer for less than the ~$60 price of this machine.    This machine is a trimmer with a Gillette Fusion blade inertly attached to the end.</li>
    <li> Electric trimmer/Blade razor makes a bad combination. I had the Norelco Body Groomer before, which stopped working -I assume because I left it recharging for a too long period of time. So, I decided for a change to try the Braun BodyCruzer. To make this comment short, shaving with the Bodycruzer is difficult without getting cuts, due to the 5 blade Gillette system; also its electric trimmer is not very effective. On the other hand, I never got these problems with the Norelco, which performed its tasks very effectively without producing any noticeable irritation or cuts. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Bodycruzer.</li>
    <li> As an owner of many Braun products, I was excited to try this groomer out.  My first impressions were pretty good.  The build quality seemed to be very good and it felt firm in the hands.  The handle had a good grip and the included accessories (combs, caddy, case, etc) were fitting for this price range.      So much for first impressions.  While the build of the groomer itself felt and seemed strong, getting everything to work together was an issue.  The combs were difficult to remove and I just did not feel confident in the trim and razor combo.  Even when using just the trimmer, the razor just seems like it is in the way.  Trimmers themselves tend to be versatile and while you are careful with them, you still tend to move more freely with them.  With the razor attached you now have to be extremely careful and instead of being able to move freely with the trimmer you are always worried about the razor.      As a trimmer, this product does a pretty good job.  However, it can get stuck or clog easily.  My biggest issue is also why this unit is so hyped: the trimmer/razor combo.  It&#x27;d be just as easy to have a razor to use separately when needed.  It just seems more like a sales pitch than anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll say this first: I&#x27;m the laziest shaver in the world. Yes, the world (I&#x27;ve asked around). In theory I like to be clean shaven; in practice I&#x27;m a lazy bum when it comes down to it. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for years. I quite liked the Mach 3 original blades, though they did tend to nick me at times. The Mach 3 Turbo blades were a definite improvement, smoothing out the shave for me, with reduced cuts. Then, some months back, I switched to the Mach 3 Fusion blades (the type included with the razor part of this unit). These have been by far my favorite blades. Much smoother than the Mach 3 blades, and a little easier on my skin than the Mach 3 Turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the idea of having an electric buzz trimmer to get my thick facial hair down, and then the Fusion blades razor for the close part - is very appealing, and, I&#x27;m glad to say, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a couple of Fusion blades, a small brush to get out hair, and some plastic attachments for the trimmer for different lengths. I&#x27;ll be honest, I like a clean shave, so I didn&#x27;t even bother with the plastic attachments, and found the shave very easy on my skin. No, the buzzer won&#x27;t give you the closeness of the razor part, but then it&#x27;s not supposed to. Just make sure you don&#x27;t shave against the grain with the buzzer, or it will hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is designed for you to buzz AND razor simultaneously, but in practice I find this doesn&#x27;t work so well. I shave with foam, and it just makes a big mess trying to buzz and razor simultaneously. I just wouldn&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bodyCruzer comes with a rubbery cover for the whole device, and a travel bag! Very thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern with the device is that it&#x27;s never obvious that it&#x27;s fully charged. The light on it goes brown when you put it in the inductive charger, but it never changes color, and the unit remains warm in the charger, leading me to pull it out manually after the 10 hours of charging Braun suggests. The battery life so far has been excellent, and Braun says you can get up 50 hours per charge. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what \\&quot;up to 50 hours means,\\&quot; since it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s different electric settings. It&#x27;s either on or off! Either way, even getting half of that time would be excellent I&#x27;d say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great device. Definitely a very convenient bathroom appliance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5has been excellent, and Braun says you can get up 50 hours per charge.

    <li> Let me begin by explaining that I am a big fan of the Gillette Fusion razor.  I have been using it for over two years and I can swear in no uncertain terms that it shaves more closely than any razor I have ever used.  Moreover, it does so with less irritation than I&#x27;ve ever experienced and with no abrasions or cuts.  I&#x27;ve never cut myself using the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Braun Body Groomer is another kettle of fish entirely.  Simply unpacking it I cut myself twice, on two different fingers.  Then a coworker (I unpacked it at work) in looking at it did so as well.  The way the Fusion part of the Groomer is positioned puts it in a more awkward position than the blades are placed on the regular razor.  I&#x27;m simply not convinced that this is a safe product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest problem with this product is that it truly is not for general use.  Not many men are going to need it at all.  Or rather, not many men will want to use both of the grooming tools with which it is equipped.  There is a trimmer that is useful, but I already had a Remington trimmer that does that just as well.  And the Remington doesn&#x27;t have an all-too-exposed razor on the backside.  The other tool is the razor from a Fusion.  There are several uses that this can be put to use.  Unfortunately none of them apply to me.  Who would use this?  Swimmers.  Bodybuilders.  Anyone who needs or want to rid their body of hair.  And if my experience with the Fusion razor is any guide, it probably is outstanding at this.  I would imagine that a swimmer would find that this gives them a closer shave than anything else they could use.  Except for a regular Gillette Fusion razor.  And why not use a Gillette Fusion instead?  All you get with this Braun is the trimmer/razor combo.  If you shave your head, why would you need a trimmer?  Well, I suppose if you had a beard.  Still, I&#x27;m not sold on the utility of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the clincher for me is how easy it is to cut yourself on this product through casual handling.  This simply shouldn&#x27;t be possible.  My recommendation would be to get a Gillette Fusion razor and a separate trimmer.  I definitely do not recommend this product.is simply shouldn&#x27;t be possible.  My recommendation would be to get a Gillette Fusion razor and a separate trimmer.  I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Decent dry shaver/trimmer that will trim the hair all the way to the stub.&lt;br /&gt;*Adjustable heads for trimming to the desired hair lenght.&lt;br /&gt;*Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;*Durable design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The blade defeats the purpose of the trimmer in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent body groomer from Braun considering other choices out there(Norelco.)  This is one example however when a brand tries too hard to beat out their competition.  The dry trimmer is what you can expect from your body trimmer:  Shaves hair close, but not completely off.  So of course you say to yourself \\&quot;Well, that&#x27;s what the Gillette blade is for, right?\\&quot;  If you think about it, the  number one reason people buy a body groomer like this is because they get irritation while using a blade and here it is, sitting on top of a trimmer.  Therefore, if you are already comfortable using a blade, then there is no reason for you to get this.  For most, if you are getting irritation from a blade, then you will get irritation from using this blade as well.  However, if you rarely get irritations from blades and prefer to use shave/blade combo in the shower/bath, then this could be a good choice for you.  Other things to consider:  One full charge should last you for about 50 minutes.  Overall a decent choice, but certainly not for everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is a combination shaving razor and hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*It is water proof so you can take it in the shower - this is a VERY nice option&lt;br /&gt;*It sits in a recharging stand, (like a powered toothbrush) so it is always charged&lt;br /&gt;*The razor has 5 blades, so it is of course, great - it gives you a very close, very comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;*It is excellent for trimming side-burns and those ugly hairs on the back of your neck&lt;br /&gt;*The trimmer can be used right on your skin without biting, pinching, or cutting&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*It is expensive&lt;br /&gt;*The replacement blades are expensive ($18 on Amazon for a pack of 8)&lt;br /&gt;*Most of my body hair is thin (including that on my head), so it works great almost everywhere - BUT - the trimmer doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against thick, or wiry hair - I like to trim and shape my beard at about ½ inch in length - the trimmer cannot grab or cut the thick hairs that grow on my face - it just pushes them around&lt;br /&gt;*The hair length guard heads are too small - their deepest guard is about ¼ inch, so if you want any hairs longer than that, you will have to remove the guard and wing it - this can lead to horrible mistakes if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand and great reverse (you are in the mirror) hand-eye coordination&lt;br /&gt;*The hair length guards are curved, so depending on the angle of the shaver to your body, the hair will be cut at variable lengths -  this is a terrible design flaw&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think using this product depends on the type of facial hair you have - if you have thin hair, great - get it, it will work for you.  If you have thick or wiry hair - there is no point, you are wasting your money on this because you need something more robust.  Given that, I think the product is grossly overpriced - I think it is worth about $30.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and does a great job of trimming my chest, armpits, stomach, and groin with no problem.  I personally prefer to use it dry, as I find when using it in the shower, there is far more friction when your skin is wet.  Also, I don&#x27;t use the fusion razor that came with it and in fact removed it immediately - using the trimmer alone results in a very close and smooth cut.  Granted it&#x27;s not as smooth as the razor would provide, but as other reviewers have pointed out, I think the trim and cut combo would be a bit awkward to use.  Not to mention I don&#x27;t necessarily want a razor anywhere near certain areas of my body (a slipup/mistake could be very painful!).    One slight criticism would be as it relates to the attachments.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of trouble putting them on/off as others have pointed out (in fact, I view this as a MASSIVE improvement over the Norelco Godygroom 2020 I owned previously), but I do think that the \\&quot;long\\&quot; trimmer attachment leaves the hair far too long when compared with the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; attachment (which cuts the hair quite short).  Would be nice to have something in between, but it&#x27;s something I can live without.    I bought a Norelco bodygroom 2020, and after two uses, I threw it out - it was very poorly constructed, and the foil actually began to tear after just two uses!  The bodyCruzer is far and away the superior product.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well and I liked using it. Having said that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very innovative or will become a daily use shaver for me. It&#x27;s kind of awkward to hold and use. I would rather keep using separate products that do one job really well. It works good thus the 4 stars. It&#x27;s just awkward to use.</li>
    <li> Okay - two of us tried this and neither of us was overly thrilled with it.  Primarily, the design feels awkward. In fact, the design made it look downright intimidating and I was a bit reluctant to use it at first.  I guess it did an okay job, but it&#x27;s just not built right for those more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas.  The way the two pieces are attached, it felt a little clunky and I actually would have felt better using a separate fusion razor and a power buzzer. I have a Phillips Norelco that I like much better and will probably stick with.</li>
    <li> The Braun bodyCruzer is an incredibly easy way to shave unwanted hair, no matter where it is. The shape of the bodyCruzer makes it easy to handle and easy to reach lots of places (except your own back). The trimmer cuts beautifully, and you have the option of using the razor blade to both trim the hair and shave what&#x27;s left. It has an inductive charger, which is slick, and the motor is very quiet. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time, so I am very pleased. As I have body hair and this works great for those hard to reach places !</li>
    <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re traveling and realy need to cut down on having both a razor and a trimmer, this could make it worthwhile.  For me, though, I felt like this product captured only some of what a razor and trimmer could do separately, but didn&#x27;t give me much extra in return.  For me personally, I hate having to keep track of trimmer attachments, so I always prefer a trimmer with a single, built-in, adjustable attachment.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this shaver/trimmer was going to suck when I first looked at it, mainly because of the combination of the removable and non-removable blade.  And to be honest, I still don&#x27;t quite understand the point of the removable blade, unless you are trying to get a very close shave (which I find you can pretty much get with the built-in trimmer).  So that removable blade is not for me, and I&#x27;m not going to talk about it because I really have nothing to say other than it&#x27;s the same as if you&#x27;d strapped it to one of those smaller vibrating razor sticks.  But everything else is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a disclaimer I need to say I&#x27;m not big on body hair maintenance and so a lot of the appeal for me here was getting something I can use on my face to shave very close without completely removing my facial hair.  But, in the interest of providing a good review (and giving myself what was probably a much-needed body hair cut) I did the entire thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem I ran into was with the attachments.  A lot of the time the attachments, which trim to certain lengths, have some sort of indicator on them so you know what you&#x27;re going to get.  If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a hair cut where an electric razor has been involved you&#x27;ve probably been asked if you want a 2 or a 3, for example.  So, with this, I was expecting at least that if not specific length measurements.  Because I didn&#x27;t have them, when I started off trimming my chest hair it ended up a bit shorter than I was expecting.  It did a nice job, but now my chest looks and feels like the legs of Doris, my afternoon pre-school teacher who only shaved once a week (sitting on her lap was unpleasant when short shorts were involved).  But once I figured out what each attachment did, things went smoothly.  I was able to handle the remaining areas of my body with little to know difficulty.  I&#x27;ve tried one of these things in the past (the Philips Bodygroom, which does label the attachments) and it took me MUCH longer.  I was able to get through this whole laborious process of body hair trimming pretty quickly with the bodyCruzer.  I&#x27;m just going to refer to it as the Braun from here on out, by the way, because that name is really dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you don&#x27;t mind going from your balls to your face, the BRAUN works very well as a facial hair trimmer.  Thanks to the chest hair mistake, I already knew exactly which attachment would work best and was able to shave and shaved very quickly.  I&#x27;m going to be using this thing for my face indefinitely.  It&#x27;s so much more versatile and easier to deal with than an actual razor--plus I don&#x27;t have to shave my facial hair entirely.  I like how it looks after growing back for a couple of days and I can just shave to that length with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my experience was good, save the mistakes I made.  Next time, though, I&#x27;ll do a much better job.  In addition to working well you get a pretty cool holder/charger for the device as well as a few additional superfluous accessories.  Overall it&#x27;s a good choice.  You may not use everything it comes with and make use of everything it&#x27;s capable of, but you will get a good trim or shave or whatever hair manipulation that interests you most.H longer.

    <li> This Body Groomer, made by Braun, features the Gilette Fusion blade.  I guess that&#x27;s a double-edged sword, because you will have to replace the blade from time to time and are still paying for the electric shaver.  Still, it works really well and I am pleased with the results.  The bodyCruzer comes with three combs; a sensitive, medium, and long.  These all work really well.  The trimmer is powerful enough to get the job done and didn&#x27;t pull on any hair.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean and comes with a charging stand.  If you&#x27;re looking for a body groomer, this is a good one to get.</li>
    <li> First of all it feels a little like a Frankenstein device. I think about cell phones that have a camera, voice recorder, keyboard, wifi, gps, etc, etc ....    This thing tries to do it all too with the shaver attachment. While it does work - it is certainly unwieldy. The shaver portion is weird. It does shave and I liken it to being able to shave a beard and get close shave at the same time. For those of you that must do both simultaneously - you are in luck.     Other wise - the body groomer works very well and the option of having a razor attached is handy for that one spot you must closely shave.     The bummer here is that you can&#x27;t let a razor sit for along time - it will simply rust along the edges and will be worthless next time your body hair and that spot you must shave is due for grooming.    If you want a capable body groomer and are right on the margin of buying another one at the same price - then the shaver can push you over the edge. Otherwise it is just an expensive gimmick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one of those guys who wants a completely hairless look on his body, but now and then I do like to trim up many of the curly hairs that sprout on my chest and shoulders, especially that patch that thrusts itself up out of my v-neck collars. The Braun bodyCruzer works very well in that regard. I had no problem getting the various elements to work together and the combs to fit over the trimmer body, a problem that I have faced with other brands of trimmers. The device is solid, and since it&#x27;s made by Braun I expect it to hold up. I had no problem with clogging of the combs, and it was easy to clean. The razor portion, which I never intend to use, is a bit silly. I think it would be much easier just to use a separate razor if you want to shave right down to the skin. But I must admit that the Gillette blade system used is an excellent one (the same one I use to shave my face, and the best I&#x27;ve found so far), so if you want to have both trimmer and shaver in one place, I suppose this is the way to do it. The trimmer did a fine job on what I wanted it to do, so I&#x27;d recommend it for at least that...</li>
    <li> This this is total junk and a rip off!!!    They simply put a razor on the back of a beard trimmer and call it something new and for what reason I have no idea because it doesn&#x27;t work.  It is too clumsy to use and can not keep the blades flush against the skin.  Only thing it can do is shave with the razor part - but then why did I buy this garbage???  I could have just used my razor on my chest and trimmer under my arms.    Plainly put - this is a rip off and just a razor and trimmer mashed together.  I don&#x27;t know how other reviewed this and don&#x27;t put that it doesn&#x27;t work.  Sending back today.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Norelco Bodygroom for years, and decided on a whim to give the Braun a shot.  I&#x27;ve always liked Braun products, and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, this groomer is very well built.  It is solid, sturdy, sits tight in the charging stand, and the parts are all well built. It trims hair easily, unless it&#x27;s very thick, in which case you&#x27;ll have to find something else to use. I had trouble getting through some thicker hair with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes a razor, although I cannot fathom why anyone would use a built-in razor on an awkward shaver over just using a regular razor. It&#x27;s cumbersome trying to use it, and simply a bit awkward. I tried several times and finally gave up. Plus, the replacement razors are very expensive (about $18 for 3), and just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof, which is a very nice option. However, I found that it doesn&#x27;t cut wet hair as evenly as it does dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was left slightly disappointed with this trimmer. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Norelco Bodygroom and will immediately go back to that one for my \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;. It&#x27;s much easier to use and I get better results.</li>
    <li> Had phillips norelco bodygroomer before which did decent trimming but died after 2 years, had trouble turning it on sometimes. So, thought of trying this braun trimmer, charged all night and tried next morning works great with no issues at all. The skin feelt smooth all over after trimming, the old trimmer made the skin little rough after trimming. The trimming attachments are also good. Hopefully it will last long!</li>
    <li> The trimmer portion of the BodyCruzer is great. The guards make for safe and effective trimming. When you need to get really close the razor portion works fine with the Gillette Fusion blade but I would have liked for the razor portion to be power like the Gillette Fusion Power, the little bit of vibration from the power makes for much easier shaving in difficult areas.</li>
    <li> First this is a well made product. I found it very ergonomic and it is nice to have a razor/trimmer that can be used in the shower and recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fine as a trimmer. There are different attachments for various parts of the body and it worked well enough as a trimmer. It also worked decently in &#x27;hybrid&#x27; mode with trimming followed by a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas there was one major problem that limited the usefulness as a trimmer/shaver combination. I am a huge fan of the Gillette fusion razors. However I really like the power fusion. It adds a great level of comfort to me. When the bodyCruzer is used in shaver mode with the shaver fully extended and the power button on it works as a Gillette fusion razor without power. I would have given it five stars if they had designed it to work as a power fusion razor in shave mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, it does not replace my shaver and is useful only as a trimmer to me. Too bad because I like being able to use it in the shower and have it recharable. Also too bad because I found it to be as comfortable, ergonomically if not more so compared to a regular Gillette fusion. As a trimmer it is fine and if you are a Gillette fusion non-power fan then I would consider getting this.</li>
    <li> In short, as another reviewer said: \\&quot;I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the extra money when compared to the popular Philips Body Groomer.\\&quot; Both hubby and I wholeheartedly agree with this. We have the BodyGroomer and love it (both of us!), and the Braun just doesn&#x27;t compare for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately [as other reviewers have said] the razor part is neat--but awkward. And I really dislike that there is even a razor to replace (I didn&#x27;t realize this when we got it). Hubby said the blade itself is good, but just could not get the hang of using the \\&quot;trim then shave\\&quot; aspect. That said, as a general razor, he said the trim part works well--the teeth are small enough to avoid nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say for the money, get the Philips BodyGroom instead.</li>
    <li> This groomer works good, but I&#x27;d much prefer a groomer that has a more permanent \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; attachment rather than the Gillete razor that it uses.  The clipper part works good, but I find that I can&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like without having to use the razor (which completely shaves clean, rather than leaving a little bit of hair).  So instead of having a blade that shaves just a little closer, you&#x27;d have to spend money constantly on new blades (why not use a regular razor then???).  At least Gillete makes out on the deal!  :(</li>
    <li> This is the first body groomer I have ever heard about or seen. I was left wondering, where have they been?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is coming from the point of view of a man with hair. I didn&#x27;t shave my legs with it or witnessed it used on a woman. I can only attest to what it has done for me thus far and I shall give you the conclusion that I surmised as well as you should be able to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off this resembles much a beard groomer with different settings for different lengths of hair but where it differs is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has different head for different TEXTURE of hair. Very Very useful and adds to its universal ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has attached a very Gillette like razor blade for obvious reasons. It is used to \\&quot;finalize\\&quot; the remaining hair that was left after using the trimmer. So in the long run after you have used different tools to trim the hair down to size, you will at best get the closeness of any disposable razor--which is decent but not as good as a wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very straightforward item and my conclusion is that it is a regular hair trimmer tweaked to fit body hair more auspiciously but in the end it all coalesces to a simple razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say if you have a lot of hair (men) I would look into this because the price is relatively inexpensive but note that it&#x27;s a fancy way to get your hair short enough to use its integrated razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women - I would stick to what you have been doing because I doubt this makes it any easier.</li>
    <li> Better than most of these type products, the electric part followed by the razor was a great idea</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun bodyCruzer for couple of weeks now. All-in-all, it&#x27;s a great groomer, even tough it may be sometimes quite difficult to use it with attached Gillete shaving cartridge. I got it mainly for my chest and legs (since I&#x27;m a triathlete), and I also occasionaly shave my head with it. For this purposes, it works really well once you get used to it. The thing I love most about it is that it&#x27;s waterproof and really easy to charge with the docking station.</li>
    <li> I have had a previous body trimmer from Norelco/Phillips, and it was a piece of crap. For an unbelievably low price, the Braun BodyCruzer delivers close, safe shaves to all the right places.</li>
    <li> I got this product through Amazon Vine. I did not have a use for it personally but my 22 year old son did and here&#x27;s what he has to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The electric buzzer backed by the adjustable razor is really convenient because you can shave a long beard or any long hairs in one fell swoop with no problem, or use either of them separately easily.  It is completely safe to use in the shower and get soaking wet with no functional problems.  It comes with a convenient travel pouch and tons of add-ons depending on how long or short you want your hair cut. I give it a 5 out of 5\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is nothing more than a Gillete Fusion Power razor on one side, and a rudimentary \\&quot;sideburn trimmer\\&quot; on the other.  It is rechargeable, so at least you do not have to replace batteries.  However, in my opinion, the quality of the trimmer is not even up to par with my Panasonic shaver&#x27;s built-in trimmer, let alone a Wahl.</li>
    <li> This is the third in a succession of men&#x27;s body trimmers. A Norelco bodygroom failed due to design. The Mangroomer turned out to be junk. So, even though this Braun seemed to have some strange features, I went ahead and bought it for longevity. (A Braun 5414 has been going strong fo over 10 years!)    The \\&quot;Trim\\&quot; function works quite well - much finer blades / teeth - more like a barber&#x27;s trimmer. The depth attachments are hard to attach and remove, however.    The \\&quot;Trim &amp; Shave\\&quot; position is outstanding. you have to hold the shaver at close to 90 degrees to your leg, chest, etc., but, once you get the feel, it only requires a couple of passes, versus 4-5, to get the job done.    Hard to tell if / when it&#x27;s fully charged - never seems to vibrate as fast as it predecessors - but it trims all right. Doubt if I&#x27;ll ever use the \\&quot;Shave\\&quot; feature - with the Gillette head fully extended.</li>
    <li> Works really good I just wish there were more settings for shorter hair. But over all really good. I never really use the actually razor.</li>
    <li> Though the trimmer head is inferior to any Philips Norelco Bodygroom IMHO, its ace in the hole is the attachment for a [[ASIN:B003EMXLIE Gillette Fusion Cartridge]].  You cannot get a closer body shave than that, but unless that is an issue you are better off with the [[ASIN:B007VB50LU Philips Norelco BG2038 Bodygroom Plus]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Unless you plan on regularly maintaining yourself in that condition, it is not advisable to shave yourself too closely between the waist and the knees.  Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Should you be attempting to share living quarters with a smaller massed, higher voiced person who complains about being cold all the time, this body groomer may offer a solution because I have noted that after removing my fur I feel noticeably cooler and can tolerate a higher thermostat setting.

    <li> This is an excellent product, prime quality very versatile and extremely practical....will recommend to any body. Very, very, very good.</li>
    <li> A few years ago phillips came out with the body groomer and it&#x27;s been the only real thing out there for men who wish to \\&quot;shed\\&quot; some excess hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the original so much so that when it broke, I bought another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bruan has this new bodyCruzer, the question most people are asking is if it&#x27;s better than the body groomer, and if they should upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple answer, yes and no (sorry!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer does a great job in getting rid of most hair, and it does a fantastic job (much better than the body groomer) at trimming and doing fine hair (this thing is very sensitive and can take out some of those hard to get areas much better than the body groomer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part this razor falls behind the body groomer in is the ability to take out back hair.  I find it incredibly difficult to do that with this device.  While my bodygroomer does it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if I had to choose one over the other, it would be this one.  It&#x27;s just too good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation?  Buy this \\&quot;bodyCruzer\\&quot; and pick up the \\&quot;mangroomer\\&quot; for back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(please note, this razer is not for shaving your face, but it does do a great job of shaving the back of your head and keeping that nice smooth look that will let your haircut got just a bit longer than it should)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using a pair of electric clippers for grooming, so with that in mind I&#x27;ll say that the Braun bodyCruzer does a pretty good job considering that it is a battery operated trimmer.  Longer hairs (like under arms) tended to clog the blades and needed to be cleaned out or the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t cut at all.  Arms, chest, abs - it did a good job as long as it was kept completely flat to the skin.  No pulls or cuts on the privates - so that&#x27;s good!      I didn&#x27;t much think the razor attachement was needed, because the blade alone did a very close job.  I never shave that close anyway because that can lead to breakouts and bumps.      I like that it comes with a charger.  The clips require two hands to take on and off - good and bad - they keep in place very securly, but then you can&#x27;t change then with one hand.    I&#x27;m more likely to keep up with grooming using this than the corded clippers I usually use.  This seems like a much quicker grab and use product.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Currently I use a separate razor and body trimmer, so I figured this would be a great product since it would eliminate the clutter of having both of those devices.  I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion for a couple years now and really like it, so I didn&#x27;t think I would have to get used to anything new there. I was wrong. I couldn&#x27;t shave nearly as fast as I&#x27;m used to because it&#x27;s awkward to hold the trimmer and try to shave without cutting yourself.  After a couple weeks I got a little more used to it and was able to speed things up, but still nowhere as efficiently as using my standalone razor.  The worst part about this product though, is cleaning it.  It clogs all the time, and I am not even a hairy person, but I was constantly cleaning it to get hair out from between the blade and the back of the trimmer.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a trimmer in the shower, but until they improve on this design, I&#x27;d advise anyone looking at this to purchase a razor and trimmer separately.</li>
    <li> The Braun bodyCruzer works best if you have a moderate amount of body hair to trim. If you have thick hair, be prepared for some painful \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;. The unit feels very sturdy and charges quick. I have sparingly used it for nearly 2 weeks now on the initial charge so battery life is very sufficient. My main complaint is the high price for the unit. Similar alternatives can be found for nearly half of the price.</li>
    <li> I have always been a huge fan of Braun products.  The build quality and design always amazes me.  I have owned several Braun rechargeable shavers over the years; not because they kept wearing out but because I like to experience the new technology Braun puts into their latest products.  Now I&#x27;m not a very hairy man but I do require a beard and mustache trimmer, a nose/ear hair trimmer, and even a mini shaver for detailing.  Much to my disappointment, Braun does not make any of these trimmer/shavers.  So even though I am a serious Braun fan I always find myself having to purchase less quality products from other manufacturers.  So when Braun introduced the new BodycruZer groomer, I was extremely intrigued.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the attached Gillette Fusion shaver, as it looked rather dangerous to have perched atop a trimmer.  Well when I was offered the opportunity to test this new device I eagerly accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is packaged well and comes with everything you could need.  The box includes the Braun BodycruZer groomer with attached Gillette Fusion razor, a weighted base charger stand, 3 different attachment combs, cleaning brush, hanging holder for the BodycruZer, travel pouch, owner&#x27;s guide, and warranty/registration paperwork.  There is also a replacement Gillette Fusion razor head included in the package.  A concerning fact about this packaging is that the multi-blade Fusion razor head does not come with a cover, so you want to be very careful removing the device from the packaging as one could easily cut themselves.  The Braun BodycruZer feels very solid, well balance, and feels good in your hand.  The Fusion razor sliding adjustment is well designed and easy to operate.  Charging is performed via an inductive type method, through the base of the groomer handle itself, with no exposed contacts.  This great design virtually eliminates the possibility of electric shock.  Once charged for a few hours the BodycruZer comes to life with plenty of power to cut most body hair.  It is NOT a beard trimmer, although it can certainly be used for light beard and mustache trimming.  However, with that Fusion razor head looming above the power trimmer, it requires the user to practice extreme caution when using the trimmer anywhere on your face.  It would be extremely easy to nick your ear or nose with the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wet and dry body grooming trimmer/shaver, so you can use it with or without shaving cream, and can use it in the shower and/or rinse it clean with water.  The attachment combs are convenient but are a little cumbersome to remove.  It was very hard for me to feel confident doing anything with the end of the trimmer due to that multi-blade razor sitting there so close to the trimmer head.  I really feel that the razor adds a definite level of danger, given the fact that the blades are always exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The operator&#x27;s manual states that \\&quot;the BodycruZer is NOT intended for removing facial hair or scalp hair.\\&quot;  The manual also states that the trimming combs should be used on dry hair only, and that shaving foam, cream or gel should not be used when trimming with the comb attachments.  It also advises using the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; comb attachment when trimming on skin in sensitive areas, such as in the genital area.  Seriously, the genital area?  OK, I guess some guys might like keeping that area...um, well groomed.  The manual advises using the trimming and shaving combination on large areas, like the chest and back.  I did not test this because I do not have back hair and I have no desire to shave my chest.  Braun also recommends applying a drop of machine oil onto the trimmer head, on a weekly basis, if the trimmer is cleaned under water.  Oddly enough my BodycruZer did not come with any machine oil so I guess they figure I would enjoy running out and buying it myself before using their trimmer.  Well they figured wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I find this device is geared toward extremely hairy men or men that want a smooth, hairless chest and/or genital area.  I honestly assumed that the BodycruZer was meant for facial trimming and shaving, in addition to grooming other areas of the body.  Since the device is not intended for the facial area, I just don&#x27;t have much use for the product.  I&#x27;m also a bit scared of the razor head, as there is no cover for the razor blades.  Now I&#x27;m not saying that this device is not good.  It seems very well built, as all Braun products usually are, and I&#x27;m sure some men will find it very handy for trimming and shaving hair in areas that I just don&#x27;t have a need or desire.  I do, however, feel that Braun should have paid far more attention to safety, regarding the extremely sharp Fusion razor head.  The way it is designed it would be very easy for someone to cut themselves on the razor blades.  A simple cover would prevent accidental cuts and could also provide protection to the delicate blades themselves.  Then again I&#x27;m not an engineer so maybe they know something that I don&#x27;t.  But for me the Braun BodycruZer will likely remain in a bathroom drawer most of the time.  I have removed the razor head, for the safety of myself and my family, but will keep the BodycruZer handy in case I suddenly sprout back hair or decide to shave all of my body hair so I can join the Olympic swim team.

    <li> I put the bodycruZer through the a vigorous review process and was overall impressed with its performance:         * First, the bodycruZer uses Gillette Fusion blades, so you get top-of-the-line shaving and many of you the blades will be compatible with your everyday razor that you already use.       * With wet &amp; dry shaving, the bodycruZer is very convenient.      * It&#x27;s easy to use. Braun did a great job designing this product, and the device has a very natural feel.      * The bodycruZer has several comb attachments, so you can adjust it to your own grooming needs. For example, some guys just want to trim things up a bit, and there&#x27;s an appropriate attachment for them. It has all the tools to help a guy take care of things in a way that will make his gal pal happy.      * It has cordless operation of up to 50 minutes per charge.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my brother&#x27;s hair for years and this helps me to get a nice clean look around his neckline and a nice straight cut for his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleanly and closely trims any back hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the shaver part of this unit very much, but when I&#x27;ve needed it, it&#x27;s come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like using this much better than the Mangroomer (also sold on Amazon).  While you can&#x27;t really use this Braun Body Groomer on your own back, it feels like a much more solid and quality piece of equipment which will last.  And it shaves pretty well.  We still have the Mangroomer but don&#x27;t use it any longer now we have this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had the Braun name.  I don&#x27;t know how it does for shaving, but for trimming body hair it does not work.  I charged it up, snapped on the guide, and ran it across my arms.  It cut maybe one out of every 40 hairs or so.  I am returning it.  I&#x27;ll also think twice about buying something just because it is a Braun.</li>
    <li> Great item but you have to be very careful when using it!  Works well and runs quietly  I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I use this to trim body hair in even the most sensative places and it does without any pain. I also like the fact that I can use it in the shower which takes care of alot of the cleanup.</li>
    <li> This sleek looking unit is a better edger than it is a body groomer.  Its precise, consistent cut is diminished by a non-ergonomic body, poor cutting combs, a too-narrow head, and a gimmicky tie-in to Gillette&#x27;s Fusion razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male of South Asian descent, I find it necessary to groom body hair to keep myself looking sharp.  I&#x27;ve historically used the [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Norelco BodyGroom]] which is cheap and effective, though it does require regular cutting-foil replacements, the combs tend to pop off, and my original unit has a failing on-off switch.  However, it excels at its basic job of trimming, across broad areas, both with and without combs attached, but isn&#x27;t supremely precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, the the bodyCruzer&#x27;s cutter is more precise and sharp, neatly trimming hair to the skin without any pinching or damage.  But with combs attached, the cut is uneven, requiring many passes with the small cutter.  One comb is too short (3mm, just above the skin), and one too long (8mm)-- no intermediate length like I would use on my [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Norelco BodyGroom]] for a natural but groomed look-- 4-6mm would cover most of my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodyCruzer is easy to hold for precise work like trimming sideburns, but its narrow body is awkward for longer strokes on larger body areas, a strange design choice for a body groomer-- combined with the too-long comb, trimming takes a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodyCruzer doesn&#x27;t come apart for cleaning-- making it low-maintenance (Braun suggests oiling the cutter once a week), but also making it so that once the cutting edge wears down, the unit would have be replaced.  I prefer a removable/replaceable cutting foil like the Bodygroom uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other design issues, the unit stands upright in its charging base but doesn&#x27;t click into place-- making it easy to knock over.  The charging light did not turn off even after more than enough time had elapsed for a full charge.  On the positive, the recessed switch is nice, making it unlikely that I&#x27;d turn the unit on/off by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for for the \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot; (aka Fusion razor blade), I wonder who buys a body trimmer to shave their body?  If male body hair is fine enough in a small enough area to be shaved, a trimmer wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, and this unit makes the usually sharp, high-precision Fusion razor into something large and unwieldy.  If the hair is coarse/heavy, you&#x27;d either be trimming or waxing.  trying to shave your whole body with a Fusion blade would be silly (and rapidly, expensive).  I wonder if somebody of Northern European descent (with fine, minimal body hair) designed this system.  I use my unit with the Fusion blade removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining large negative of the Fusion tie-in is that the cutter is the same width as the fusion blade, and probably didn&#x27;t have to be otherwise-- another half-inch wider would make this unit more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice cutting system is spoiled by the Fusion-blade gimmick, poor combs, and poor ergonomics.  Unless you have (only) precise shaping to do, get the Norelco BodyGroom instead.the recessed switch is nice, making it unlikely that I&#x27;d turn the unit on/off by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for for the \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot; (aka Fusion razor blade), I wonder who buys a body trimmer to shave their body?

    <li> I absolutely love this razor! It is great for everything, be it getting rid of unwanted body hair or just normal shaving. The fact that it not only has the electric part, but also combines the manual part is really great for a extra close and smooth shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think only negative this I can think of about this product is the fact that hair get stuck in the corners of the electric part and it is a pain to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all is a great product for an even better price!</li>
    <li> new look every day, have used it once a week, cuses no irritability, and it is very fast to use</li>
    <li> Helps manscaping be less annoying than with a regular razor. I actually am in control and far less fearful than before.</li>
