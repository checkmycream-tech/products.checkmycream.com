      <li>In conjunction with lots of water on your face, this shaving conditioner is top notch.  </li>
      <li>While there&#x27;s not a lot to share about men&#x27;s skin products, I have to say I&#x27;ve pleased with the Nivea brand.  </li>
      <li>The cost is about $1.25 more per a bottle.</li>
      <li>It makes using the razor more convenient because the shaving cream is in the razor.</li>
      <li>Nivea could improve the product some by adding more moisturizers.</li>

      <li>I think that it is a pretty good deal.</li>

      <li>The can is an easy way to refill the shaver.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t easy to dispense this way, but it can be done.</li>
      <li>Easy on the skin because of the Nivea cream.  </li>
      <li>Still works, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It succeeds at making the skin feel moisturized and protected and while the price is a tad high, it gets the job done, conditioning the skin with its special ingredients and eliminating irritation from the shaving experience.</li>
      <li>the cool skin range is better than most &#x27;ordinary&#x27; ones - it is great to be able to use it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find a three-pack that included the replacement cartridge as well (the singles at the local stores stopped including the cartridge).</li>
      <li>Shaving Lotion is so comfortable while shaving with my Norelco razor, I couldn&#x27;t think of how to enjoy this feeling without it.</li>
      <li>CLose, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Also easy to clean under faucet.</li>
      <li>So Amazon and free shipping is the way to go.</li>
      <li>No more Razor Burn, the perfect shave.     </li>
      <li>This is about the only place I have been able to find the lotion and cartridge for this amazing razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nivea Shaving Conditioner is intended to be used with a specially- designed electric razor with a conditioner dispenser.</li>
      <li>Pros: good lubricant; makes for smooth shaving; dispensing system gimmicky but ok if it appeals to you.       </li>
      <li>I´m glad I can always find it at Amazon, at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>this does help keep you cool.</li>
      <li>Now remember they have already charged my credit card for the full amount.  </li>
      <li>Having a wet/dry razor that work with this shaving conditioner has kept my skin in good shape and younger looking.  </li>
      <li>It is much cheaper and does a better job.</li>
      <li>Thanks :-)</li>
      <li>Arrives quickly and well packaged with Prime.  </li>
      <li>The price was great too; I got three for less than it would have cost me to buy two at the store.</li>
      <li>I shave my whole head, so the razor has to be easy to handle.</li>
      <li>The product arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This shaving conditioner product is dispensed directly through the heads of the razor and it feels cool and refreshing when it comes in contact with the skin.</li>
      <li>use this along with my electric razor and works better than anything for sensitive skin-ingrown hair prone guys.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>You will need to pack an additional canister in your suitcase, more of a hassle because it is much bulkier, you also go through these pretty fast and not all stores carry this.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the right stuff.</li>
      <li>Plus the Nivea products are fantastic for pretty much any skin type</li>
      <li>Thanks for your quick turnaround on this product for me.</li>
      <li>With how fast I go through the conditioner I need the three refillers, and the extra cartridge is a nice bonus</li>
      <li>The extra cartridge was a nice bonus although we didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
      <li>it is a good way to give a long live for the Norelco.</li>
      <li>BUT you may not be concerned about expense if you&#x27;re willing to buy the pricey razor.       </li>
      <li>I will order this product again as I have not been able to find the replacement cartridges locally.</li>
      <li>When this nivea shaver first came out, you could get these for like $4-5 bucks</li>
      <li>THEY HAVE NEVER FAILED.</li>
      <li>Works Ok with the razor, but not a big difference to use with or without it!!</li>
      <li>Nivea Shaving Conditioner is a useful product to protect against skin irritation and it works very well when used with one of the electric razors that utilizes skin conditioner to reduce irritation while shaving.</li>
      <li>This way of shaving is exactly what I need - if you&#x27;re into electric shavers</li>
      <li>When used the razor glides easily on the face with little razor burn leaving smooth skin and no smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While there&#x27;s not a lot to share about men&#x27;s skin products, I have to say I&#x27;ve pleased with the Nivea brand.  Having a wet/dry razor that work with this shaving conditioner has kept my skin in good shape and younger looking.  I have issues with dry skin and since I&#x27;ve owned this razor and used the conditioner I haven&#x27;t seen any problems.    If anything the only issue I would have to say is getting refills for shavers is a little like toner for printers.  The cost factor as well as trying to find them.  I can never find these locally so I&#x27;m very happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product but it will only work if you have the HS803 series cool-skin razor. It makes using the razor more convenient because the shaving cream is in the razor. I do like the older style razor however that kept the shaving cream in little packets, those were easier to use with travel, you could always carry a spare in your travel kit. You will need to pack an additional canister in your suitcase, more of a hassle because it is much bulkier, you also go through these pretty fast and not all stores carry this. Amazon is your best source. The product itself is as good as any other shaving cream out there but is not as thick in consistency as an off the shelf shaving gel, I tried using that and it would clog the razor and require constant cleaning. My razor seems to work best with this product. Again, you cant use it unless you are using the HS803 series razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this as a gift along with the Norelco razor before and it&#x27;s always been well received.  Plus the Nivea products are fantastic for pretty much any skin type so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it irritating sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a must for anyone with the Norelco shaver with the built in shaving conditioner.  With how fast I go through the conditioner I need the three refillers, and the extra cartridge is a nice bonus should you drop your shaver and break the other one.  I havn&#x27;t done that yet, but it&#x27;s a nice feeling you don&#x27;t need to worry about it.  I would recommend this to anybody.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Nivea Shaving Conditioner is a useful product to protect against skin irritation and it works very well when used with one of the electric razors that utilizes skin conditioner to reduce irritation while shaving. I own one of these electric razors and compared to others, I have found that the addition of skin conditioner does indeed make a difference in shaving. It makes shaving with an electric razor less irritating on the skin and makes me more likely to use an electric razor for my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving conditioner product is dispensed directly through the heads of the razor and it feels cool and refreshing when it comes in contact with the skin. It moisturizes well and what I find even more satisfying is the elimination of irritation. My skin doesn&#x27;t react very well to a metal surface being rubbed across it, but this irritation is eliminated with this skin conditioner, and my electric razor now gets as much of a workout as my manual blade hand razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea Shaving Conditioner is intended to be used with a specially- designed electric razor with a conditioner dispenser. Of course, you don&#x27;t have to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation. You can use this without the special electric razor by simply applying it directly to the skin, as a preparation to using a manual razor. It isn&#x27;t easy to dispense this way, but it can be done. However, whatever you do, don&#x27;t use this conditioner with an electric razor that is not designed as a wet/dry razor. Your skin might feel good, but your electric razor will be ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving can be irritating, but Nivea Shaving Conditioner helps to keep this problem under control. It succeeds at making the skin feel moisturized and protected and while the price is a tad high, it gets the job done, conditioning the skin with its special ingredients and eliminating irritation from the shaving experience.</li>
    <li> After trying to find just a single bottle at various stores locally, I decided to see what Amazon had to offer. I was happy to find a three-pack that included the replacement cartridge as well (the singles at the local stores stopped including the cartridge). The price was great too; I got three for less than it would have cost me to buy two at the store.</li>
    <li> This product changes an ordinary shave into a really close, smooth, comfortable shave. I never had a shave this close since going electric many years ago.</li>
    <li> This is about the only place I have been able to find the lotion and cartridge for this amazing razor. I don&#x27;t usually use electric razors. Got this one for Christmas and have been using it since. Just love it.  CLose, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.I don&#x27;t worry about shaving burn or rash.[[ASIN:B001FB5IKK Nivea for Men Sensitive, Extra Soothing Lotion for Sensitive Skin, SPF 4, 2.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years it goes with the Norelco shaver I purchased several years ago.  When used the razor glides easily on the face with little razor burn leaving smooth skin and no smell.</li>
    <li> Basically got what you&#x27;d expect, except that the color of the backing didn&#x27;t match my razor.  That may have to do with that I have an older one.  Still works, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Stores have started to stock this instead of the old HS800 lotion, which I assume has been discontinued. I&#x27;m through two refills and, sadly, this new \\&quot;Anti-Irritation\\&quot; lotion is thinner, less lubricating and less soothing than the old lotion, actually resulting in more irritation. If you can still find the HS800 lotion, I highly recommend purchasing it instead.</li>
    <li> Pros: good lubricant; makes for smooth shaving; dispensing system gimmicky but ok if it appeals to you.       works well in the shower or at sink; zero irritation; good for gadgeteers.    Cons: Expensive: 1) razor shaves almost as well without Conditioner; can just pre-wet razor and face, and keep wet during shaving -- BUT you may not be concerned about expense if you&#x27;re willing to buy the pricey razor.       Odor (\\&quot;perfume\\&quot;) stronger than desirable in this era of perfume-intolerant persons; not overwhelming, but check your take on the odor before going with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered two shaving conditioner sets for my son who ran out.He likes the stuff and uses it with his New Philips Norelco razor. A step up from dry shaving with the old electric razor. The skin looks alot better after using the conditioner in the shower. Plus, I have only one store that carries the stuff. The cost is about $1.25 more per a bottle. So Amazon and free shipping is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This way of shaving is exactly what I need - if you&#x27;re into electric shavers the cool skin range is better than most &#x27;ordinary&#x27; ones - it is great to be able to use it in the shower.  The can is an easy way to refill the shaver.</li>
    <li> use this along with my electric razor and works better than anything for sensitive skin-ingrown hair prone guys. Great Price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Shaving Lotion is so comfortable while shaving with my Norelco razor, I couldn&#x27;t think of how to enjoy this feeling without it.</li>
    <li> When I purchased my Philips Norelco Shaver, a small container of the HS803 came bundled with it.  In conjunction with lots of water on your face, this shaving conditioner is top notch.  It smells good and works well to assist the shaver in removing the hairs from your face.  If they sold this in 5-gallon drums, I would buy one.</li>
    <li> Arrived prior to estimated shipment date.  No problems encountered.  I will order this product again as I have not been able to find the replacement cartridges locally.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff as a refill for my husband&#x27;s Norelco electric razor. Works great! It&#x27;s easy to use and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best shave I have had.  Easy on the skin because of the Nivea cream.  I shave my whole head, so the razor has to be easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Works great, great odor and washes off your mug, and shaver head, easily. If you possess an adequate imagination, the use of which is almost erotic.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Norelco shaver for 2 or 3 years now. I have always been using it with Norelco shaving conditioners. They make shaving very comfortable and easy on your skin. This package comes in one replacement cartridge and three conditioners. I think that it is a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I have a newer model of Norelco Shaver, and the adapter for the creaam does not work...but the cream is very effctive</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It works well, as do the shavers.  I have no complaints except that this makes shaving with an electric razor quite expensive.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband who uses the Norelco razor, the bottles are about twice the size of the bottle the razor came with. The extra cartridge was a nice bonus although we didn&#x27;t really need it. Will order more refills when we need them as the price was the best I found. Nivea could improve the product some by adding more moisturizers. My husband&#x27;s skin gets dried out after using.</li>
    <li> Great service good product  arrrived on time and works great.  I love the ease of use with the razor and has a nice feel and aroma!</li>
    <li> The product works well.  The cream contents of the can should be larger.  Hence, it is a bit expensive for the can size.  I alternate using the Nivea canned cream and Nivea for  men Moisturizing Face Wash as pre shave conditioner.  Both work well.  mike</li>
    <li> This is the worlds most ridiculously expensive shaving cream. Dont buy the razor unless you plan to spend ten dollars every couple of weeks feeding it this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shaving conditioner is very hard-to-find in drugstores, and is a showpiece on how to sell a product (Philips, shaver) and not support it (conditioner). I´m glad I can always find it at Amazon, at a reasonable price. The shaver is great, and works better if you have the conditioner, so praises for Amazon for having it at a price well below that of the official Philips website.</li>
    <li> This stuff really gave me a close shave, but got way to expensive and to hard to find. So I switches to Nivea For Men 2 In 1 Artic Freeze, Wash and Shave Gel, 3.3-Ounce (Pack of 2) and followed up my shaves with Nivea For Men 2 In 1 Artic Freeze, Wash and Shave Gel, 3.3-Ounce (Pack of 2). This stuff works way better, closer shave and even less irritation than with the Shaving Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have keep using the Phillips Norelco HS803 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner if it had not got so expensive, but I have found a much better replacement. It is much cheaper and does a better job. If you use one of the Norelco electric razors that uses this shaving conditioner give the Arctic Freeze stuff a try, much cheaper and goes much farther. I defiantly have less irritation with the Artic Freeze stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is great and much less expensive than the sample that came with th e shaver. I feel that the shipping took too long to get the product to me (13 days),but Amazon refunded my shippng charges&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m happy and will continue using Amazon as they have just the best costomer service,period. Thanks</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY. SO FAR I HAVEN&#x27;T USED THE RESEVOIR THAT IS SUPPLIED. THEY HAVE NEVER FAILED. PHILIPS NORELCO HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THE RAZOR FOR THIS PRODUCT GIVES ME THE CLOSET SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD.</li>
    <li> This certain brought new life to my razor.  Well worth the purchase.  I recommend to anyone who owns this razor.</li>
    <li> The nivea having conditioner works well, and Amazon makes it cost effective. I know it would be cheaper to buy a conditioner, but it&#x27;s a big time saver to use the shaver&#x27;s dispenser.</li>
    <li> Users should know to only dispense enough at a time to be visible in the  holes in the heads. I have found that this works well, and extends the life of the refills considerably.    I got three refills for less than the price of two in ym local Target, and a new cartridge as well.</li>
    <li> I like using the Norelco and Nivea shaving conditioner, very soothing and does a close shave. I highly recommend, shaver charge lasts a long time. Also easy to clean under faucet.</li>
    <li> I like shaving with this shaver. The lotion softens the beard and it is contained in the shaver. I would recommend this shaver and the Nivea shaving conditioner products.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Norelco shaver and this nivea cream is perfect.  Arrives quickly and well packaged with Prime.  We have even starting saving by doing a subscription.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It works better than the sample you get with the razor. Also great price. Cheaper per bottle than anywhere else (typically pay around seven for each elsewhere).</li>
    <li> All I can say is really good product (useless if you don&#x27;t have the elec. razor to go with it). Get it, if you have sensative skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described and on time  Bought these in a bundle with a replacement shaving head to save on postage  About 30% cheaper than purchasing locally    Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> This advice really it is amazing. Now, it is more easy than ever to do my shave! The replacement cartridge it is a good way to give a long live for the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have used Noreco shavers for many, many years. This one is the worse ever. I bought it because of the shaving conditioner application system, which happens to work very well, but for some reason the machine takes longer to shave than all the previous ones that I had and not that clean. I don&#x27;t recommend it. I am really dissapointed.</li>
    <li> If you buy the shaver that uses this,it might be a good idea to stock up on the conditioner. The shaver works very well, but if they stop making it, we will have to have a stockpile of this.</li>
    <li> This product fits both the Philips Nivea for Men Razor, as well as the Philips Norelco CoolSkin Razor.     Both razors are identical in nature, except that in the states it&#x27;s called the Philips Norelco CoolSkin Razor.     Either way, this product totally rocks, it soothes the skin while you shave. Leave it on for a few more seconds and you don&#x27;t even need an aftershave! No more Razor Burn, the perfect shave.     Been wondering why people invest in shaving systems that can cost easily over $200 or more when this shaving system is perfect. Don&#x27;t give it a miss.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.  Thanks for your quick turnaround on this product for me.</li>
    <li> Our grandkids have gotten facial hair at age 12 or slightly after.  We bought each of them a razor that uses this product.  They are all baby faced and this product makes shaving more comfortable.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and this lotion works so well!!  Best price I found anywhere on the internet.  Definitely recommend this shaver and Nivea conditioner!</li>
    <li> This really works great.</li>
    <li> Good price like packages</li>
    <li> I tend to have sensitive skin on my neck and my electric razor gives me a rash when I use it dry. This conditioner allows the razor to glide across my skin therefore eliminating the  burns. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered the conditioner for my Norelco Nivea shaver and a replacement cartridge from Amazon.  The shaver and the conditioner are great I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered it stated the items were in stock.  After I ordered I am informed that the items are backordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor then says they will be in within a week, so I did not cancel the order.  After a week they say it will be a few more days.  Now remember they have already charged my credit card for the full amount.  They then say that there  is a error and only the conditioner came in and they have no replacement cartridge.  They ask if they can send the conditioner and $10.00 to cover the cost of the cartridge I was not going to receive.  I said fine and in a few days I get the conditioner and a$10.00 bill in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ask to review my purchase and I did with a negative review of the supplier.  Nothing was done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER USE AMAZON FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN FOR BOOK PURCHASES AND THEN IF IT IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET THE BOOK!</li>
    <li> This was the worst thing ever and you keep emailing me!!! I emailed and called time after time and get know response until you want to post some phoney lie about how happy I am. You only sent me half my order and never got back to me. Leave me alone!!!&lt;br /&gt;Most important would be to credit our credit card ASAP!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes the razor move across my face a lot easier and my face feels great after wards. I use it every time i don&#x27;t use it in the shower. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This makes shaving more comfortable :)</li>
    <li> Nothing like the right stuff.</li>
    <li> This Nivea Shaving Conditioner for Philips Norelco HS803 Model has revived my hubby&#x27;s razor. It is not available at our local stores. Great that we found it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for some years now. Including the previous model. They have worked wonders with my &#x27;facial pain&#x27; after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Easily gets five stars for that alone, but the pricing is all wrong here on Amazon. Norelco factory outlet sell the triple pack for about 28$.</li>
    <li> My only issue is the shaver itself - but this re-fill product works as advertised. I switched back to Gillette razor blades later on.</li>
    <li> When this nivea shaver first came out, you could get these for like $4-5 bucks a can at walmart. If you ordered this pack, you had the added benefit of the replacement cartridge and a slightly lower overall price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, they have discontinued the razor, and quit making these conditioner cans. The few people that do still have them in stock have jacked up the prices %400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeat, DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I love it best prices works great.</li>
    <li> These refills are NOT available in the retail stores anymore - like CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the ONLY place I can find these refills!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for stocking them. The HS8420 Niver Razor (from Philips) is great,&lt;br /&gt;and now I have a good supply of refills for it!</li>
    <li> Works Ok with the razor, but not a big difference to use with or without it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that helps sooth the skin and provides an clean shave.  If you have tender skin this does help keep you cool.</li>
