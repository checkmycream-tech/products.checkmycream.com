      <li>/&gt;It enhances my lashes nicely bringing attention to my eyes.</li>
      <li>Basically it&#x27;s nice for every-day use but considering the price</li>
      <li>I liked that.</li>

      <li>The brush is nicely shaped and it&#x27;s stored in a cute silver bottle</li>

      <li>Since this mascara felt so lightweight, I thought for sure it must have worn away.</li>
      <li>I feel a taper design gives me better control when applying and seperating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The brush is interesting.</li>
      <li>While there is a limit to what mascaras can do with my lashes, some are definitely better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having gotten this through Vine, I was hopeful of purchasing more...</li>
      <li>and I welcomed the range of results I was able to create.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the mascara I&#x27;ve tried will make my eyes itch</li>
      <li>cheaper, goes on easier, and stays on better.</li>
      <li>If you like that look then you will love this.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a better deal :)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure that I may give up some of the quality that this mascara has,</li>
      <li>I think I will be sticking with my old school Great Lash.</li>
      <li>It also is easy to remove, though it does not smear or run with use.</li>
      <li>Removal was easy.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily too.</li>
      <li>Comes off easily at night</li>
      <li>The bit of clumping was easily seperated and cleaned-up.</li>
      <li>Nice soft brush that goes well with a great-looking case, which travels nicely with you wherever you go.</li>
      <li>This mascara is amazing that it goes on flawless, it plumps your lashes, makes them long, plump, full, lush</li>
      <li>It went on silky smooth, with no clumps and no smudging.</li>
      <li>This mascara goes on lightly.</li>
      <li>I have really skimpy lashes, so I am forever looking for the product that&#x27;s best at transforming them into lashes someone would actually want to have.  </li>
      <li>So far this one looks good all day and the brush does separate the lashes</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the look and texture of this mascara - vivid colour, and smooth application.</li>
      <li>If I had normal lashes, I&#x27;m sure I would be satisfied with this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>It has a unique wand unlike any</li>
      <li>The mascara goes on well with the unique brush and has even distribution and is clump-free.</li>
      <li>it goes on smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t clump, is a good color, and appears to last throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Goes on buttery-smooth, light (the Almay stuff is, at best, thick and clumpy, even when body-temperature.</li>
      <li>With how much it cost I thought just maybe it would be a better mascara, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes, seemed to clump if I put on more then one coat</li>
      <li>The color is rich black that looks rich with great coverage.  </li>
      <li>and I was surprised and impressed that it coated and separated every single eyelash.  </li>
      <li>First off I&#x27;ll be honest that I&#x27;ve never spent more than about $8 or $9 on mascara, so I wondered what would make mascara worth spending over $25 on?</li>
      <li>Also, the shape of the wand is pretty unique and makes it so that I do not have to run the wand along the edge of the tube every time I apply the mascara.</li>
      <li>I found there was some tendency to clump, but overall it went on very easily and cleanly.</li>
      <li>but then I realized why it was useful.</li>
      <li>It added a nice length to my eyelashes but they definitely did not look fuller.</li>
      <li>but, I like L&#x27;Oreal and for the money right now</li>
      <li>I have been loyally using Almay Pure Blends Mascara for about 2 years...</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because I like the product and think it would be good for a lot of other people, but I most likely will not get it again.</li>
      <li>I do not beleive in using soap and water, is use only eye makeup remover and cotton balls on my eyes-soak ligthly and then very lightly stroke inwards toward eye.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s just shy of perfect</li>
      <li>but really, is that absorbed through mascara?  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I bring out some mascara -- and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
      <li>The Passion Volume Up Mascara is the first Ainhoa product I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Pros: does not clump, my sensitive eyes are fine with this product, does not run, nice black coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
      <li>For me though, it doesn&#x27;t make my top list of mascaras that really make a difference (of which, admittedly, there are only 2).  </li>
      <li>Another positive is that it goes on my lower lashes, which can be tricky, just as smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I already have long lashes, so I need volume more than length.</li>
      <li>Easily washes off at night with simple soap and water.  </li>
      <li>The brush is oddly shaped but surprisingly convenient and fits the shape of lashes well in a direct swipe.</li>
      <li>I used a metal lash brush seperator that I have of my own that I used just after applying the 1st coat when it was almost dry to make sure the 2nd coat would not clump and I barely needed a full 2nd coat.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>She much prefers her $7 Maybelline mascara.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mascara. The brush is oddly shaped but surprisingly convenient and fits the shape of lashes well in a direct swipe. The mascara itself leaves them not clumped and soft, though not as defined as some others I&#x27;ve tried. Basically it&#x27;s nice for every-day use but considering the price, I&#x27;d probably go for some store-brand instead.</li>
    <li> The Passion Volume Up Mascara is the first Ainhoa product I have ever tried. I&#x27;m extremely impressed. The color is very rich and dark, and lends a gorgeous dramatic effect instantly. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with \\&quot;spiky\\&quot; eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The makeup separates the eyelashes very well, although the mascara itself clumps toward the base of the eyelash. If you aren&#x27;t careful, you&#x27;ll end up with tiny little clusters in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the look Ainhoa gives. This truly is a pretty mascara that makes your lashes look longer, fuller, and darker instantly. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> For the record, I&#x27;ve never used mascara in my life and have no intention of doing so. However, my wife wanted me to order this AINHOA Passion Mascara through Vine, so I got it for her. Here&#x27;s what she said about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The brush is nicely shaped and it&#x27;s stored in a cute silver bottle&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not messy or clumpy when the wand is pulled out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;* It goes on easy and has good volume, but it flakes off by the end of the workday</li>
    <li> This mascara has a great deal going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Uniquely designed and shaped brush that does seem to comb thru lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying a second coat enhances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appears to lengthen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non clumping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removes at night with any quality eye makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may or may not be worth the extra dollars...will compare with my other favorite brands and will update.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife through Amazon Vine.  She says she&#x27;s used drugstore make up for the past 20 years.  She never wanted to splurge on the more expensive products.  This time she hoped at $27 this tube of mascara would sway her to try those fancy brands that tout their use in spas.  Unfortunately, she was not impressed.  She much prefers her $7 Maybelline mascara.  Ainhoa Passion mascara seems thick (like when mascara is getting old) and difficult to apply quickly and evenly.  The applicator is an odd shape that she&#x27;s sure is supposed to be helpful, but it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
    <li> It should be noted that when it comes to cosmetics, I&#x27;m not a name brand snob. In fact, my makeup bag of favorites includes several $2 products. So splurging on mascara like this is not something I would ordinarily do. My typical mascara is [[ASIN:B00008MOQI Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Soft Black- .43 Fluid Ounce]], which costs about $5, or one-fifth the price of this Ainhoa Passion. Getting me to shell out that much more money would require some spectacular results. So how did the Ainhoa Passion fare in terms of my sky-high expectations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging: Right out of the Amazon mailer, it was obvious Ainhoa aims to appeal to the aesthetic senses. Cased in a shimmering dark blue box, the mascara itself comes in a metallic silver tube. A nice bonus, but not something that justifies the elevated cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush: The brush is interesting. There&#x27;s an indentation that runs all the way around it about one-quarter of the way down. Even now, after using the product for a week, I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of this groove is. On the plus side, the mascara comes out of the tube without any globs. At no point have I had to scrape excess product off the brush onto the side of the tube, which I often have to do with my Maybelline Great Lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Application: I already have long lashes, so I need volume more than length. In fact, my Maybelline mascara often smears on my eyelid immediately after application because of the length of my lashes. That aggravating tendency did not happen with the Ainhoa. It went on silky smooth, with no clumps and no smudging. All of my lashes were separated without having to comb through them. I liked that. Another positive is that it goes on my lower lashes, which can be tricky, just as smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Durability: This product held up rather well throughout the day, even after rubbing my eyes. This surprised me. Since this mascara felt so lightweight, I thought for sure it must have worn away. I had absolutely no flaking or raccoon eyes while wearing this product and it comes off easily with soap and water. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my lashes aren&#x27;t quite as dry upon removal, almost as if the Ainhoa is conditioning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This is a quality product, but I use mascara to add volume and visual impact to my lashes. Cheaper products provide me with both of these aims. I don&#x27;t mind combing out a few clumps or wiping away a few smudges when the savings is $20 every time I need a new tube. The conditioning aspect has potential, however, so if this product were in the $12 to $15 price range, I might consider giving up my spendthrift ways for it.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It is very clumpy and the twist design of the brush only seems to magnify the problem. There is little else to say other than this: If you are looking for something to enhance your lashes, and something that looks natural, you may want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Very clumpy and grainy, even after trying to \\&quot;stir up the contents.\\&quot; The brush gets loaded down and the design of the brush seems almost nonsensical to me. The twist doesn&#x27;t do anything at all to improve the way the mascara adheres to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been loyally using Almay Pure Blends Mascara for about 2 years... but it gets dry and crumbly, largely because I don&#x27;t take care of my makeup the way I should (i.e. it sits in the car, so for a quarter of the year things get frozen and another quarter, they overheat).&lt;br /&gt;I also wear hard contact lenses - combined with mascara, this can be rough on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. Goes on buttery-smooth, light (the Almay stuff is, at best, thick and clumpy, even when body-temperature. Anything colder than body temp and it&#x27;s too crumbly), perfect, easy to apply even on lower lashes. The shape of the brush is perfect, and it&#x27;s a high-quality one. The mascara stays throughout the day without feeling crusty or irritating my eyes - and it washes off fairly easily. No need for eye makeup remover - my regular face wash was enough to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten this through Vine, I was hopeful of purchasing more... and then I saw the price and almost fell over. No wonder it&#x27;s so great. I guess I&#x27;ll have to try a few more brands. But in the meantime, will I be keeping this in my car? No.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the look and texture of this mascara - vivid colour, and smooth application. It also is easy to remove, though it does not smear or run with use. However, I experienced an allergic reaction including redness and watering, and would caution those who have eye allergies that they may need alternatives to this product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing that it goes on flawless, it plumps your lashes, makes them long, plump, full, lush but it does not clump them and does not smear. Follow the directions and apply from the base to the very tip slowly and precise being careful to get each lash in careful long strokes. Let dry before you apply a 2nd coat if needed. I have thin almost nothing lashes. I used a metal lash brush seperator that I have of my own that I used just after applying the 1st coat when it was almost dry to make sure the 2nd coat would not clump and I barely needed a full 2nd coat. This covered fully, did not clump on the 2nd coat and lasted for several hours. I used this on New Years Eve Night and it did not smudge and I use mascara remover anyway and I always gentley remove any mascara I take off no matter what-you are to NEVER tug, rub hard no matter what you use on your eyes because over time this will lead to increased eye wrinkles I beleive. But this was very easy to take off. I do not beleive in using soap and water, is use only eye makeup remover and cotton balls on my eyes-soak ligthly and then very lightly stroke inwards toward eye. Follow with facial wash product and pat dry, do not rub dry. Will definately buy and use again.</li>
    <li> There is alot that I liked with this mascara.  The brush is awesome at distributing the mascara, no clumps.. even came out looking good on my lower lashes. The mascara itself was creamy smooth in applying and dried fast enough that a couple coats took no time at all and made my eyelashes look longer and a bit thicker.  Worn all day and no flaking or smudging.  To tell the truth, I don&#x27;t take off my mascara at night..this stuff I can remove all traces of with my moisturizing cream in the morning, no problem.  To buy this I would want a waterproof type, only because that&#x27;s what I prefer.  I see that there are good ingreds like vitamin E..but really, is that absorbed through mascara?  I don&#x27;t pay $26. for any of my mascaras and I&#x27;m sure that I may give up some of the quality that this mascara has, but, I like L&#x27;Oreal and for the money right now, it&#x27;s a better deal :)</li>
    <li> I like the shape of the brush on this mascara, but unfortunately the product itself is underwhelming. The mascara goes on a bit clumpy and grainy, and then flaked off a bit during the day. I&#x27;ll stick with Great Lash for now... cheaper, goes on easier, and stays on better.</li>
    <li> It is a usual black mascara, I have not noticed my lashes looking any differently after the application than when I buy the one for 8-9 dollars from the drugstore. Granted, I did not pay for this one, but 26 dollars and change? For that price I usually buy Lancome mascara in the store.</li>
    <li> AINHOA Passion Mascara does the job and does well under water, but it doesn&#x27;t really stand out among other brands.  The color is rich black that looks rich with great coverage.  Nice soft brush that goes well with a great-looking case, which travels nicely with you wherever you go.</li>
    <li> Most of the mascara I&#x27;ve tried will make my eyes itch bt the end of the night, but not AINHOA. This was most welcome and the biggest plus of this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It enhances my lashes nicely bringing attention to my eyes. I found I can layer it to extend add volume without for a more dramatic effect without creating a clumpy mess. The color was good for me and I welcomed the range of results I was able to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is a rather conventional silver tube similar Lancôme Mascara I had before. It is nice to pack and the cap with the wand feels nice in the hand when applying. The brush on the wand has a curved shape with shorter bristles at the center and longer toward the ends. I think it is to fit the curve of the lash line, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as a simple taper would for me. I feel a taper design gives me better control when applying and seperating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying AINHOA Passion I found there was some tendency to clump, but overall it went on very easily and cleanly. The bit of clumping was easily seperated and cleaned-up. The end of the brush seems to come out of the tube with a little blob of mascara on the end. A little touch on a tissue easily removed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted well for me. At the end of the night it was as nice as at the start. Removal was easy. I think it&#x27;s just shy of perfect and that makes it one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality mascara that applies just the right amount with NO clumping--much better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used!  It has a unique wand unlike any I&#x27;d seen before and I was surprised and impressed that it coated and separated every single eyelash.  I&#x27;ve always had to use an eyelash comb to separate and de-clump my lashes after applying other mascaras but not so with this one.  Since I normally buy Brown Black mascara I was concerned that the Ainhoa Black would look too harsh but it was about the same shade of the brown black that I typically use. It washes off easily too. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> OMG theres really a difference in this mascara. I love love love this. The brush is shaped differently which worried me for a moment but then I realized why it was useful. It goes on correctly without clumping and lasts all day too. The packaging is attractive and this product already has me addicted! Full lashes with less fuss and I didn&#x27;t need a sandblaster to get if off my face at night. Enjoy looking beautiful without hurting your eyelashes and skin!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;ll be honest that I&#x27;ve never spent more than about $8 or $9 on mascara, so I wondered what would make mascara worth spending over $25 on? And unfortunately I&#x27;m still wondering after using AINHOA Passion Mascara Volume Up for the last few weeks. The brush design is awkward and while it applies the mascara well enough, it doesn&#x27;t do it any better than other designs. The texture was a little thick, which I suppose gives you some volume, but if it doesn&#x27;t go on smooth it just looks clumpy and bad. It washed off easier than waterproof mascara, but just the same as all the others. Overall I can&#x27;t find any reason why I would pay so much for mascara, that doesn&#x27;t perform any better than the less expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find the perfect mascara, I gave this one a try and once again was disappointed.  With how much it cost I thought just maybe it would be a better mascara, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes, seemed to clump if I put on more then one coat and it dried out and came off throughout the day.  The search for the perfect mascara continues...</li>
    <li> Pros: does not clump, my sensitive eyes are fine with this product, does not run, nice black coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The brush is a bit awkward, it is bushy and an odd shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara goes on smoothly but the brush is just strange. I have used fine mascara, trendy mascara, drug store brands and no this one.  I will continue to use the mascara to see how it performs over the long haul.  Even the expensive ones tend to clump after about a month.  So far this one looks good all day and the brush does separate the lashes, I just cannot figure out why it is so clumsy.</li>
    <li> Normally when I wear mascara, I spend the day with irritated eyes and the next day I lose several eye lashes.  I cannot tolerate the waterproof mascara at all and so I normally end up with dark smudges under my eyes by the end of the day.  This mascara goes on lightly. Look closely at the picture and you will see that the brush is a little different with longer bristles on the ends and shorter in the middle.  The mascara applied evenly and stayed on with no dark smudges at the end of the day.  I also had no irritation.  When it was time to wash my face for bed, I had completely forgotten I had any mascara on.  I am very happy with this mascara and recommend it to anyone with sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of mascaras, my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have trouble finding eye products that don&#x27;t irritate me.  AINHOA is fantastic, it did not irritate the slightest!  Even when I did the ultimate test - sleep in it.  The mascara goes on well with the unique brush and has even distribution and is clump-free. I deducted one star because it didn&#x27;t have as much lasting power as I would have preferred at this price point.</li>
    <li> I have really skimpy lashes, so I am forever looking for the product that&#x27;s best at transforming them into lashes someone would actually want to have.  While there is a limit to what mascaras can do with my lashes, some are definitely better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a perfectly good mascara - it goes on smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t clump, is a good color, and appears to last throughout the day.  The shape of the brush seems to help ensure that the mascara is evenly distributed.  If I had normal lashes, I&#x27;m sure I would be satisfied with this mascara.  For me though, it doesn&#x27;t make my top list of mascaras that really make a difference (of which, admittedly, there are only 2).  I gave it four stars because I like the product and think it would be good for a lot of other people, but I most likely will not get it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascara products I have ever tried! Not only does it go on smooth, it stays put for the entire day! Also, the shape of the wand is pretty unique and makes it so that I do not have to run the wand along the edge of the tube every time I apply the mascara. I would definitely buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this mascara for my wife.  Here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;One of the best mascaras I have ever used.  Manages to be natural looking and glamorous at the same time.  Did not irritate my sensitive eyes.  Very easy to wash off with Cetaphil.  Don&#x27;t even need to curl my eyelashes with it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a woman who cared much for makeup, but there are occasions I feel the need to tone it up a notch. That&#x27;s when I bring out some mascara -- and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands. On the whole, no matter what the ads promised, I&#x27;ve failed to see much difference between any of them. Mascara is mascara -- and this one is no different. It does the job well enough, but I don&#x27;t see anything particularly special about this item to recommend it.</li>
    <li> The one thing I liked about this mascara is that it wasn&#x27;t clumpy nor did it irritate my eyes. As for volume, my eyelashes still looked pretty thin. It added a nice length to my eyelashes but they definitely did not look fuller. I think I will be sticking with my old school Great Lash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light. you can barely see that you have mascara on. If you like that look then you will love this. It does add a little volumn but not really dark enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a week now to make sure I gave it a good trial before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t clump&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- Comes off easily at night (I had one premium mascara that was so difficult to get off that I was losing eyelashes!)&lt;br /&gt;- Application wand - oddly shaped which took some time getting used to but once mastered, I think it is much better than the typical wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly when you apply it.  I ended up smearing it all over my cheeks yesterday when I did other makeup too soon.  MUCH slower drying that any other mascara I have used.&lt;br /&gt;- Price - I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra money</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;The wand is thin enough that I don&#x27;t get mascara all over my upper lid, but it&#x27;s thick enough at the same time.  It goes on evenly and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run all day!  Easily washes off at night with simple soap and water.  I have such a hard time finding a decent mascara - most of the time, the wands are too thick and I end up with it all over the place, or it goes on clumpy.  Not with this one.  Love it!</li>
