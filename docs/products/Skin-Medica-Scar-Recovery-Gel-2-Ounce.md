      <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and sells in Doctors&#x27; offices for quite a bit more!</li>
      <li>Good price online versus my surgeons office</li>
      <li>Oh well.. the good news is that one tube lasted me 3 mos...</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Used this a year ago after surgery (purchased from the surgeon) and liked the results.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s too easy to use, and I don&#x27;t want a scar under my eye!</li>
      <li>Seems to be working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>doesnt seem to work any better than coco butter</li>
      <li>Had better results using just a vitamin E lotion.</li>
      <li>I will continue using it until I run out, but I won&#x27;t be buying any more after that.</li>
      <li>I had a surgery and used this gel as soon as I was able to (once the bandages were removed).  </li>
      <li>Product is nice and useful, but u need pay the tax if u r in Canada to the Canada post ~ that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and is not greasy.  </li>
      <li>and I pigment really easily,</li>
      <li>Very quick shipment.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>It is easily used and results can be seen relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>But it seems that it might have great results for the long run</li>
      <li>Luckily I work with some fantastic plastic surgeons.</li>
      <li>but I really see an improvement in my scar and am hoping that with continued use it will get even better</li>
      <li>It feels like you are putting super glue on the scars.</li>
      <li>Worth getting from Amazon, however, as more reasonably priced here.</li>
      <li>Either way, this is a pricey product worth buying from Amazon -- my doctor&#x27;s office sells it for triple digits.</li>
      <li>but I am pleased thus far.</li>
      <li>I have faithfully applied twice daily as directed and my scar is healing nicely.</li>
      <li>Eventually the gel either \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; or absorbed into the skin</li>
      <li>it got better but may just be the natural healing process..</li>
      <li>My opinion: worth it.</li>
      <li>To be fair, we have only been using it for a month on an older scar and change may take place over a longer amount of time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It came highly recommended from my doctor -- I would buy it here on the cheap, though, rather than from him and his price mark-up.</li>
      <li>Great to use with recent scarring from surgery - works better on small stitched areas - does take time to see results</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>Showed up fast!</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Thick gel feels good and dries quickly so stays put.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe how quickly this works on new wounds to prevent or minimalize scarring.</li>
      <li>I emailed the supplier and he quickly responded that he would mail a new one and to keep that one</li>
      <li>In the middle of the night I woke up with a burning sensation and might skin was bright red and flaking.</li>
      <li>far as the product goes, I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe 3 to 4 week so too early to know for sure</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well for older scars, but if you are diligent about applying it to new wounds, your healing time and scar visibility will decrease significantly.</li>
      <li>I guess next time I&#x27;ll pay full price and get the right product.</li>
      <li>The new one (emphasis on NEW) arrived quickly and everything is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;My $40 savings went into the trash by my doctor who then gave me the real deal</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much difference.</li>
      <li>product REALLY works.  </li>
      <li>I had my eyelids done and it is very soothing.</li>
      <li>does very well at deminishing visibility of scars.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see that it is doing much and have been using it for 5 weeks.</li>
      <li>Scar won&#x27;t fade in a week, but it will decrease the amount of redness much faster than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Was recommended by my doctors, so far it seems to be good, have only used it for a short period of time</li>
      <li>Recently scheduled additional surgery and purchased the product thru Amazon at a MUCH lower cost!!!</li>
      <li>Works faster and heals better than mederma or other junk on the market.</li>
      <li>This works so much better than Mederma or other brands.  </li>
      <li>With this gel, it not only reduces the redness of the post-acne marks SIGNIFICANTLY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed no change, actually more redness, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s due to this product-</li>
      <li>I started using this cream right after stitches were removed and my scar is pretty much invisible 6 months later, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>But I do highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of thick and sticky but goes on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>The product is a Gel, so when you apply it to a scar the product sits on top of the skin and glistens in the light which temporarily makes the scars look far worse than normal.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the same product used by my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I think the scar honestly would have looked roughly the same without this stuff, because obviously scras heal, then fade a bit any way.</li>
      <li>This gel is pretty thick and really does make a fresh or new surgical scar nearly disappear.</li>
      <li>For the expense, you would expect this to be a wow product..</li>
      <li>and since I am a young woman, I was naturally worried about how my scar would look.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product directly from SkinMedica to use on some redish/pink scars that I have.  </li>
      <li>So far haven&#x27;t seen results after over a month.</li>
      <li>Since I am satisfied with the results of surgery, I&#x27;m going to recommend this, even though I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually helped in the healing process.</li>
      <li>I am realistic that it takes several months of scar gel to evaluate results</li>
      <li>While the price is high, this actually does something for scars.  </li>
      <li>The Centelline in this product is the new gold standard for scars.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy the 5oz jar, since it is right now selling for less than the 2oz jar.</li>
      <li>As far as the product itself, the jury is still out because scars can take time to totally heal.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know whether it is worth the expense, but it does seem to be keeping the scarring from a revision surgery in check -- unlike whatever I used for the initial surgery, which obviously did not work (hence the second</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best stuff on the market!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by my opthamologist after I had surgery on my eyelids.  I got it on Amazon quite a bit cheaper than he was selling it for, plus he charged sales tax for some reason.  Since I am satisfied with the results of surgery, I&#x27;m going to recommend this, even though I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually helped in the healing process.</li>
    <li> Used as directed and did not notice any change in scars from a recent surgery. Had better results using just a vitamin E lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommended by my cosmetic surgeon. Reduces redness and smooths out scarring.  Would use this again and again if needed</li>
    <li> lost what my surgeon gave me after surgery so purchased online. does very well at deminishing visibility of scars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product directly from SkinMedica to use on some redish/pink scars that I have.  I&#x27;ve just received the product and used it once so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works yet but I did want to mention a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The product is a Gel, so when you apply it to a scar the product sits on top of the skin and glistens in the light which temporarily makes the scars look far worse than normal.  Eventually the gel either \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; or absorbed into the skin (I&#x27;m not sure which) and looked normal.  This took about 5-10 min to occur.  It&#x27;s not a big deal if you are applying the product to scars hidden under clothing or out of view...but it might be something you want to take into account if you are using it on facial scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The product is formulated to lessen the visibility of scars with a red or pink discoloration to them.  And while it may work on scars that do not have this type of coloration to them, I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money to try this gel on them unless it was a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Unlike other scar gels (Mederma) the gel did not peel off after drying, and it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.  So you can use this and go out on a date or go to work without people looking at you because you either smell funky or look as though you are molting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update/adjust this review in a few months with my thoughts on how well the product works on the scars I&#x27;m using it on.</li>
    <li> So far haven&#x27;t seen results after over a month.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my plastic surgeon. Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my doctor. It is easily used and results can be seen relatively quickly. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I have not found that this medicine reduced the appearance of the scar.  It has softened it a bit, but it is just as noticeable as before.</li>
    <li> Cannot say I have noticed any difference since I&#x27;ve started using it other than what could be attributed to time. I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle in hopes that it does start to work.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended but I don&#x27;t see that it is doing much and have been using it for 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream right after stitches were removed and my scar is pretty much invisible 6 months later, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After a surgical procedure my PS recommended I use this product on my scar. He sold it in his office for roughly $100 so of course I checked Amazon and found it for almost half the price. I ordered it and paid a little extra for express delivery. Ummm I&#x27;m not sure how but I ordered this one evening and my package was at my door step the next morning. Yay! Thank you!</li>
    <li> To be fair, we have only been using it for a month on an older scar and change may take place over a longer amount of time.  However, there has been no change and I&#x27;m thinking that this is another (more expensive) product to add to the pile of products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Three weeks after surgery now, and it is making such a difference. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> not working as expected. doesnt seem to work any better than coco butter</li>
    <li> I have gone through two tubes of the Scar Recovery Gel 2 ounces and I am on the third one now.  There has been some improvement to the appearance of the scars but not to my expectations.  I will need laser treatments to correct what I thought the Gel would do.  Perhaps I have not given &amp;#34;Time&amp;#34; enough time to heal but the Skin Medica Scar Recovery Gel  has not worked the miracle I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I recently had open heart surgery and since I am a young woman, I was naturally worried about how my scar would look. Luckily I work with some fantastic plastic surgeons. They recommended Skin Medica scar recovery gel. I have faithfully applied twice daily as directed and my scar is healing nicely. I am only 3 months post op so my scar is still slightly reddened. This should be applied for about 6 months post op. A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price worry you.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the gel for a few weeks and seems to work well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> I had some scars from recent surgery about 5 months ago.  A friend suggested this product so I decided to try it because I did not like the vitamin E oil that the surgeon had suggested to put on the scars.  I&#x27;m already seeing a difference and it has only been one week of use.  I use it twice a day and it&#x27;s not sticky like the vitamin E oil was.  I do recommend you use it after a bath or shower- it seems to work best when applied then.  But I do highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law had me purchase this for her after a surgery.  It&#x27;s a repeat purchase for her and she says it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my plastic surgeon. I have used it 2-3 times a day for almost 3 months. The only improvement in my scar could be attributed to the fact that all scars will fade over time. My scar is dark red and partially hypertrophic. I will continue using it until I run out, but I won&#x27;t be buying any more after that.</li>
    <li> This works so much better than Mederma or other brands.  While the price is high, this actually does something for scars.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for older scars, but if you are diligent about applying it to new wounds, your healing time and scar visibility will decrease significantly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and it seems to be working.  Too early to tell only a few weeks. It is easy to use and is not greasy.  I have friends that have used this product and swear by it.</li>
    <li> Received the product as planned. As far as the product itself, the jury is still out because scars can take time to totally heal. Our doctor told us this was the best product on the market. So we are trying it and will see.</li>
    <li> Product is nice and useful, but u need pay the tax if u r in Canada to the Canada post ~ that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> My sis says it is making a difference on her acne scars.</li>
    <li> I have used it since April, 2015, my scar are lighter but still visible.</li>
    <li> Good price online versus my surgeons office</li>
    <li> Does a good job at reducing the appearance of scar tissue; give it time for it to work and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a different company before buying here and there product seems to be maybe expired? It was a different color and texture than what I received from my doctors office. I guess next time I&#x27;ll pay full price and get the right product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Thick gel feels good and dries quickly so stays put. Only complaint is that the tube opening must get a little clogged by thick gel each time, so you push hard and then get more out on your fingertip than you&#x27;d like. That creates the dilemma of trying to put expensive gel back in tube, which I try each time.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe 3 to 4 week so too early to know for sure but scars are healing well and fading. Will continue to use and will buy another tube.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quickly this works on new wounds to prevent or minimalize scarring. This is a great product and sells in Doctors&#x27; offices for quite a bit more!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. Only been using a few weeks.  Redness has disappeared and flattening beginning to occur</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I suffer from acne and I pigment really easily, so whenever I breakout I will have scars that linger for awhile.  With this gel, it not only reduces the redness of the post-acne marks SIGNIFICANTLY but it also helps heal them faster too. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but if you are using it for small marks it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Showed up fast! Great product!</li>
    <li> My plastic. Surgeon and dermatologist both sell this product in their offices for $100. I bought this on Amazon for $85. This gel is pretty thick and really does make a fresh or new surgical scar nearly disappear. The Centelline in this product is the new gold standard for scars. Works faster and heals better than mederma or other junk on the market. This tube will last for months!</li>
    <li> Works great....should last a long time....I had my eyelids done and it is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Used this a year ago after surgery (purchased from the surgeon) and liked the results. Recently scheduled additional surgery and purchased the product thru Amazon at a MUCH lower cost!!!</li>
    <li> I personally think this is a waste of money. It feels like you are putting super glue on the scars. Will stick with retin-a and cocoa butter</li>
    <li> Worked some days and other days my face was too irritated to tell the difference. My opinion: worth it.</li>
    <li> I am still using this but I really see an improvement in my scar and am hoping that with continued use it will get even better</li>
    <li> For the expense, you would expect this to be a wow product.. Hard to say if it did anything for the texture of the scar as I used it on a newer surgical scar (one week old).... it got better but may just be the natural healing process.. I used the entire tube and it is now 3 mos later... scar is still red.so it definitely did not do anything for color which was my biggest concern... Oh well.. the good news is that one tube lasted me 3 mos...</li>
    <li> This is the only scar treatment the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office suggested post face lift. I am only 6 weeks post op. I am realistic that it takes several months of scar gel to evaluate results but I am pleased thus far.</li>
    <li> Best scar cream, ever!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy the 5oz jar, since it is right now selling for less than the 2oz jar. Either way, this is a pricey product worth buying from Amazon -- my doctor&#x27;s office sells it for triple digits. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know whether it is worth the expense, but it does seem to be keeping the scarring from a revision surgery in check -- unlike whatever I used for the initial surgery, which obviously did not work (hence the second surgery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came highly recommended from my doctor -- I would buy it here on the cheap, though, rather than from him and his price mark-up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to say how it works.  I&#x27;ve been using it since 4/20 but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this item from a different supplier, so this was my second round with the product (which i HIGHLY recommend).  I was not happy when the product arrived because it had been used (almost 1/2 of the product was gone).  I was concerned for sanitary reasons.  I emailed the supplier and he quickly responded that he would mail a new one and to keep that one (I was asking about exchanging the product).  The new one (emphasis on NEW) arrived quickly and everything is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product REALLY works.  Scar won&#x27;t fade in a week, but it will decrease the amount of redness much faster than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant smell. I bought the small size first. Save yourself some money and but the 2 ounce. Scar gels take a lot longer to work than you think. At least for my scar anyway.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one. I&#x27;m not sure it works, but I&#x27;m afraid to quit using it. My doctor recommended it.  Time will tell, I guess.  Worth getting from Amazon, however, as more reasonably priced here.</li>
    <li> According to my doctor this product is a fake and is not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;My $40 savings went into the trash by my doctor who then gave me the real deal free.&lt;br /&gt;According to her this Skin Medica products are only sold doctors offices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cautioned me buying product from Derm Store as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how well it worked since I have no way of knowing what the scar would have looked like had I not used it.  I had a surgery and used this gel as soon as I was able to (once the bandages were removed).  I used it for 5 months.  I think it worked well.  I only used it once a day not the twice recommend.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it takes a few minutes to dry and I&#x27;m usually in a hurry in the morning.  Anyway, after 5 months I started getting a rash in the areas where I applied the gel so I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the results but like I said I have no way of knowing.  I have a burn scar on my arm and used another product that seemed to work well but is alot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great results with this</li>
    <li> It seems to dry faster than other products. Other than that, the label indicates that it should be used daily for 6 months to get results. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Great to use with recent scarring from surgery - works better on small stitched areas - does take time to see results</li>
    <li> good price and great transaction, A+++</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my doctors, so far it seems to be good, have only used it for a short period of time</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much difference. I bought this from my PS for $49 after a mole removal on my face and I have been using it religiously. He said twice a day, but I will apply it up to 5 times a day, and if not, always at least 3. EVERY DAY. I have not missed a day, it&#x27;s too easy to use, and I don&#x27;t want a scar under my eye! After 3 weeks, my scar is still red, and I have noticed extremely minimal flattening. I think the scar honestly would have looked roughly the same without this stuff, because obviously scras heal, then fade a bit any way. I am going to still use this during the day and mornings, but switch over to Scar Away silicone strips for night :-( Those are cheaper with better reviews :-(  EDIT- A month later now...still think this isn&#x27;t working. I&#x27;ve noticed no change, actually more redness, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s due to this product- it&#x27;s probably due to me adding makeup over it to cover it :-(  My ps said he&#x27;d fraxel my scar in 4 months though so I&#x27;m afraid that will be the easiest way to remove a small atrophic scar</li>
    <li> I use this recovery gel twice daily on scar from tummy tuck. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s sort of thick and sticky but goes on easily and dries quickly.  I got a sample from plactic surgeon...they promote SkinMedica so if they like it...it must be good!</li>
    <li> Delivered in manufactures packaging in a timly manner.  Same product as the one I bought from my doctors office.  This product is great.  Helped reduce the appearance of my scar, and has healed my surgical scar months faster than if not used.</li>
    <li> Great product! My doctor prescribed this for me after my breast reduction to reduce the appearance &amp; flatten my scars. It really works!  If You Order from Amazon it&#x27;s a lot Cheaper!  It was $100 at the dr.&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment.  GREAT seller.  Will use again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been using it not for a long time. . But it seems that it might have great results for the long run</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product used by my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I actually had to return this product to the doctor&#x27;s office after using it twice. I started 4 weeks post op and as soon as I rubbed it in it started to tingle. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect so I thought nothing of it. In the middle of the night I woke up with a burning sensation and might skin was bright red and flaking. I am not normally sensitive to products but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
