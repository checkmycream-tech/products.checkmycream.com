    <li> I love this hair spray and it&#x27;s hard to find so I like that I can get it on Amazon. Great product.</li>
    <li> It has become very difficult to find this hairspray anywhere. Sun Products and Amazon had what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;As for this hairspray, it has the best hold of hairsprays around!!!!</li>
    <li> Hard time finding this hairspray.  I have used Mink for years.</li>
    <li> Great product, fair price and fast delivery! Would gladly buy again ... just before I run out!</li>
    <li> I Have used Mink hair spray for years and years,  but  could not find it any more in the stores, so had to  order it on line.  Really love this hair spray.  Great Stuff !!</li>
    <li> I bought 12 cans of the Mink hairspray for my sister. That is her favorite kind and she wasn&#x27;t able to find it for a long time so she&lt;br /&gt;was very happy when she opened the box. Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  J.W</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I can use.  I have very fine hair which is difficult to manage.  Mink hair spray keeps my hair in place while not becoming too sticky.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and highly recommend it over any expensive salon hair spray I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mink Difference Hair Spray for many years and cannot find it in my local drugstore any longer.&lt;br /&gt;Am so relieved to find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Never sticky and holds well!  I love it.</li>
    <li> I truly was frantic when I could not find Mink hairspray in any store in my area.  I finally decided to look on line and to my amazement and satisfaction I found it on Amazon.  I bought a case so now I don&#x27;t have to worry for quite awhile.  I love this product and have been using it for probably 15 or more years.</li>
    <li> great service &amp; product.  thank&#x27;s  MERV.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mink hairspray for at least 20 years. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance which is nice. I like the fact that it is firm to the touch, but isn&#x27;t sticky. I have not been able to find in any stores where I live, so I am so happy I can get it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!  It holds without being too stiff and has a nice fragrance. So happy to have found it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 15 years, and was sick when they took it off the shelves!  I could have been their spokes person for this product!  It is fabulous!  By that, I mean it holds my baby fine hair and  short unique one of a kind hair style perfectly all day.  My hair has been photographed all over the world, I&#x27;ve been stopped on the street, in stores, restaurants, etc. on a daily basis (that&#x27;s the truth), and by all age groups.  What I love the most about this product, is that I can comb my hair after having sprayed the heck out of it, and it&#x27;s soft and feels like I never had hair spray on it.  I can go on a speed boat ride, and not a hair is out of place when I get back!  Do you see why I say I was so upset when I could no longer buy it in the store!  And then, a friend put me onto Amazon, because she found it!!!  I&#x27;m happy again!!!  AND PRAY THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT!!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with Amazon for offering this wonderful product - like others, I have been using it for over 20 years and it disappeared from local stores.

Smell is great - and I have wasted so much $ trying to find something similar - nothing works this well for wet or dry setting or refresh.</li>
    <li> Extra long hold. Not sold in any store near my home so I have to buy multiple cans. So much more cost efficient!</li>

    <li> I love this hairspray I have used it for years, no build up, hold your hair and is just the best ever.</li>
    <li> I have used Mink hair spray for years and was so pleased to find it available once again.  I have found nothing that it compares to.  It is terrific--don&#x27;t quit maling it again,please.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mink Hairspray for 20 years plus. I cannot find it anywhere (not even Walgreens) so we ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it leaves your hair silky, not sticky....fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please bring it back to the retail stores so I can simply purchase it rather than having it shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
