      <li>I have used this product for many years and will continue to do so.</li>
      <li>I love Paul Michell Feeze and Shine, and the flexible shine verion of the product as well.  </li>
      <li>I Love It.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love this spray.</li>
      <li>If I use another name brand hairspray, it just makes my hair look even more duller and lifeless.</li>
      <li>and I have used it for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love</li>

      <li>Just love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am using this for years now and just love the strong hold.</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly and enjoying it every day.</li>
      <li>Great product to use when you might need that extra protection from the wind.</li>
      <li>:) But for real, I have curly hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, it does give your hair a finished shine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t quickly lose it&#x27;s hold.</li>
      <li>after I use the curling iron and comb out my hair exactly as I want it, I just lightly spray this in the areas</li>
      <li>The price for this big bottle is very good compared to stores like CVS where you get the smaller bottle at this price</li>
      <li>and it holds out moisture, adds a great scent and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
      <li>It has taken me years to find just the right combo of products to manage my hair.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and it was secured very well to prevent leakage during shipping.</li>
      <li>This is important to me and is worth paying a little more for.</li>
      <li>But when I want to make sure I want my hair to stay longer (such as a party, wedding, etc) I use&lt;br /&gt;freeze and shine.  </li>
      <li>it feels natural and clean.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and keeps my style all day long.  </li>
      <li>It is a strong hold, and at times I only use it when curling my hair with a curling iron, and then when I comb out my hair I use a softer hair spray from Paul Mitchell.</li>
      <li>My Mom loves this hairspray - it&#x27;s the only one that will hold her fine hair in shape.  </li>
      <li>I can usually count on my hair looking nice for 2 days.  </li>
      <li>I wear my hair as a flat top and this gives the lasting hold I need to get through the day.</li>
      <li>Where as the other held my hair but was not stiff and brushed out easily.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell products have been around a long time - probably because they really work!  </li>
      <li>This hairspray is great for me because I have very black hair, and sometimes it just looks dull.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several different types of products that say they will do a certain thing</li>
      <li>Excellent,  hold the hair style all day, the hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff and doesn&#x27;t get dirty.  </li>

<li> Excellent,  hold the hair style all day, the hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff and doesn&#x27;t get dirty.  </li>
<li> I spritz a little water on it the second day and scrunch it up to bring it back to shape ofter sleeping on it.</li>
<li> It helps to shape dry hair in addition to giving on all day hold to your styling</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up in my hair, or dry my hair out at all.</li>
<li> Most, however, leave my hair feeling stiff and even looking dirty if I leave it in until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also sometimes use it on wet hair to scrunch a bit of body into place while drying.</li>
<li> Also use a shine serum on my wet hair as well... to counter some highlighting damage.</li>
<li> This product was exactly as expected.  </li>
<li> I know will go flat and limp.</li>
<li> I have coarse thick hair and often work long hours as an RN.</li>
<li> I was concerned this might be a watered down version of the product but upon trying it find it to be performing as expected.</li>
<li> Yet, doesn&#x27;t look terribly stiff if you spritz it lightly on dry hair.</li>
<li> If you over spray though it can feel too stiff...</li>
<li> This product works well without being too stiff and sticky.</li>
<li> This was very stiff and stayed in my hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get in my area at times.</li>
<li> I have thick curly hair, chin length.  </li>
<li> If you need serious hold, this is the spray for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this spray. I have coarse thick hair and often work long hours as an RN. It will keep my hair in place..If you over spray though it can feel too stiff...It is perfect for me and I have used it for more than 10 years. I have tried several different types of products that say they will do a certain thing but I always go back to Freeze and Shine,</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I must always have it around.  It is a strong hold, and at times I only use it when curling my hair with a curling iron, and then when I comb out my hair I use a softer hair spray from Paul Mitchell. But when I want to make sure I want my hair to stay longer (such as a party, wedding, etc) I use&lt;br /&gt;freeze and shine.  Love it, Love it. I never try anything else, I stick with what I know works. Oh I forgot.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is allergic to scents, and this does not have a scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and will continue to do so. It&#x27;s true, it does give your hair a finished shine. I Love It.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great for me because I have very black hair, and sometimes it just looks dull.  If I use another name brand hairspray, it just makes my hair look even more duller and lifeless. This Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine spray is great for me because it does everything that it says.  It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and keeps my style all day long.  Will never be without it!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  It helps to shape dry hair in addition to giving on all day hold to your styling</li>

    <li> It has taken me years to find just the right combo of products to manage my hair. This stuff is awesome. I have very fine hair, after I use the curling iron and comb out my hair exactly as I want it, I just lightly spray this in the areas I know will go flat and limp. I dont think it&#x27;s meant to be used all over,  but it&#x27;s great for spot treatments.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesnt leave hair feeling gunky. Great smell too.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years.  In my opinion, this is the best hairspray on the market.</li>
    <li> I know - this is practically from the stone age... my hairdresser can&#x27;t believe I still use it.  But I&#x27;ve never found anything better.  I have thick curly hair, chin length.  I uses some gel while I blow drying it, then scrunch in some of the Freeze &amp; Shine and finish blow drying.  I can usually count on my hair looking nice for 2 days.  I spritz a little water on it the second day and scrunch it up to bring it back to shape ofter sleeping on it.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff. Love the smell. Love the hold. I use it like a spritz hair spray, to hold my style in place. Works quite well. Doesn&#x27;t quickly lose it&#x27;s hold. Yet, doesn&#x27;t look terribly stiff if you spritz it lightly on dry hair. Also sometimes use it on wet hair to scrunch a bit of body into place while drying. Was recommended by a friend, and after trying, I&#x27;m sold. I look for this when I run out... Also use a shine serum on my wet hair as well... to counter some highlighting damage. Freeze &amp; Shine is now a must-have part of my essential duo!</li>
    <li> Came very fast and good service I would recommend to others to order from here packaging was good also Thanks</li>
    <li> best hairspray out there - supreme hold and doesn&#x27;t look greasy or feel too crunchy</li>
    <li> This product works well without being too stiff and sticky. The scent is not as \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; as many cheaper hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried. I also appreciate the fact that Paul Mitchell products are not tested on animals. This is important to me and is worth paying a little more for.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  hold the hair style all day, the hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff and doesn&#x27;t get dirty.  I will continue by it.</li>
    <li> The Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray, 16.9-Ounces Bottle is the best hairspray ever. I am using this for years now and just love the strong hold. The price for this big bottle is very good compared to stores like CVS where you get the smaller bottle at this price</li>
    <li> We just returned from a cruise on a sailing ship in the Caribbean and Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray saved the day (and night).  Great product to use when you might need that extra protection from the wind.</li>
    <li> LOVE Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Freeze and Shine. I love the smell. Seriously....I LOVE it. Sometimes I use it just for the smell. :) But for real, I have curly hair and I use this to help hold in curl and hold out moisture. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up in my hair, or dry my hair out at all. I have also used it when I straighten my hair and it holds out moisture, adds a great scent and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff. Love this stuff!(this isn&#x27;t a strong hold hairspray!)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5 years and would not change from anything else. I wear my hair as a flat top and this gives the lasting hold I need to get through the day. Have not considered changing because the quality of Paul Mitchell products. Shipping was quick and it was secured very well to prevent leakage during shipping.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as expected.  I love Paul Michell Feeze and Shine, and the flexible shine verion of the product as well.  I switch between the two all the time.  I was concerned this might be a watered down version of the product but upon trying it find it to be performing as expected. I am so glad to have an online source for this. It&#x27;s hard to get in my area at times.</li>
    <li> best hair spray ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products that do give my hair body.  Most, however, leave my hair feeling stiff and even looking dirty if I leave it in until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM F&amp;S spray the body, yet it feels natural and clean.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> great hairspray....just what the label says....freezes your hair in place with a shiny finish</li>
    <li> Not like the one I purchased from the beauty supply. This was very stiff and stayed in my hair. Where as the other held my hair but was not stiff and brushed out easily.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  Arrived quickly and enjoying it every day.</li>
