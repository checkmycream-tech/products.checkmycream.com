<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Smells like Jaegermeister....but on a good way.</li>
    <li> Works as others have posted, just a few drops and you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I use it during fall and winter when i grow my beard great product smells great and made my beard to smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> first time trying the beard oil,  love it!  I love all Honest Amish products!</li>
    <li> Slightly reduced beard dandruff. I liked how it softened my beard and gave a modest aroma. I still use it with my short-cut beard and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very neutral scent. Perfect oil softened my beard. And helps to tame hairs. Best no frills oil. Especially if you are avoidant of ostentatious scents.</li>
    <li> Amazing, at first I was skeptical  (got it as a gift) love this stuff!</li>
    <li> A nice product that works well in my beard.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband after reading all the good reviews. The product seemed fine but I knocked it off the shelf onto tile floor and the glass container smashed. When I asked my husband about replacing it he said he didn&#x27;t like the scent (&amp;#34;cinnamony like Goldschlager&amp;#34;) and he asked my to find a different product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it is my all-time favorite and a necessity in my life ( in my beard ) !!!! I have tried shopping around and have a bathroom full of many different products for my beard some i found online some i my found in boutiques somewhere referrals. But my all time favorite is what I get from all honest Amish A far surpass any other product I found out there. I&#x27;m not one to give credit where credit&#x27;s not do that&#x27;s not in my DNA and believe me if I didn&#x27;t like this product I would not be given it a review. The satisfaction that I&#x27;ve had with this product has made growing a beard a joyand made grooming pleasurable . I will continue to buy this product as long as I can . I just tried the beard oil for the first timeand I was using the balm before with great satisfaction but I&#x27;m sold on the oil it kicks but , thank you guys for your product</li>
    <li> Lovely smell and conditions the beard</li>
    <li> I love this product the smell the feel the way it makes my beard look and the way it moisturizes my hair and mostly my skin under my beard. Lets just say my skin lets me know when i forget to use it with the beard itch we all know about. this oil takes care of that well leaving my skin and beard looking and feeling great! great product!</li>
    <li> I needed a product that would soften and condition my raspy bear hairs.  Not sure why thay are so thick and stiff compared to the rest of the hair on my head, probably because I shaved in the past. Was skeptical on the cost but the reviews were helpful and good ao gave it a try.  I love this stuff. It makes my van dyke (often confused with a goatee) softer and also smell terrific.  Those close to me have noticed and commented favorably.  Also, I color my beard because I&#x27;m too young to have grays in it and this oil counteracts the irritation, discomfort and itch caused by use of those chemicals.  I might be mistaken but I think it also makes the color last longer too. I&#x27;m very conservative with it as a little goes a long way for me. I just pour a dime-sized amount into my hand and apply it thoroughly with my finger then gently mop off any excess oil from my face.  It works for 3-5 hours and I re-apply at night for extra conditioning.</li>
    <li> My new favorite beard oil!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, it shipped quick and applies wonderfully. The oil does have a faint black licorice scent as mentioned by other reviewers BUT this scent disappears shortly after product application unless you are using too much of the product and not allowing it to properly absorb.</li>
    <li> Very good beard oil, keeps it shiny and clean look, easy to apply</li>
    <li> I love this. fantastic product. excellent service.</li>
    <li> First time ever using any type of beard oil.  It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other similar products but it works really well.  Leaves your beard soft, manageable, smelling good, and relieves that beard itch and dry skin.  They say you can rub the leftover oils that are on your hands, into your skin.  I usually just run my hands through my hair a few times and it works just as well as any hair tonic by keeping rouge hairs in place all day.  Good stuff.  It does what it says it does and more so.  Some people say the smell is strong.  To me it does smell like Jagermeister but I&#x27;m ok with that.  After a few uses with the constant removal of the cap the strong smell starts to mellow out to a more lighter sweeter scent.  I see no reason to try any other beard oil at the moment.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves his gift!</li>
    <li> Husband loved the oil, and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> The item came packaged very well with lots of padding. It has a nice spicy scent and the oil is a good consistency. Makes the beard smell very nice. It is also double the amount for less than the usual price for premier beard oil.  It seems to be a very good buy and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried the product for the last week and so far it seems to be helping to soften my beard.  I expected quicker results but I can afford to be patient.  My beard is not going anywhere.  I received the product in the time frame promised.  I rather like the packaging.  I a civil war reactor and it will not standout from a distance if someone sees me using it in the morning after I dunk my face in a bucket of water.</li>
    <li> Wow! I LOVE this stuff. I use it on my beard and also on my head. (I shave my head.) For years I&#x27;ve had major itching and dry skin on my forehead and face. (Seborrheic Dermatitis the doc says.) I use this oil and also the Honest Amish Beard Balm on my beard but also on the rest of my face. This combination has virtually eliminated the redness on my forehead and face. I know they don&#x27;t sell it for this purpose but it has made my dermatitis virtually disappear with regular use.  I will continue to reorder, and reorder, and reorder....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first beard oil so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to but it smells great and leaves the beard looking good!</li>
    <li> Great product, great branding (love the honest wage bit on the packaging)! Well worth the money. Unfortunately about 1/3 of the oil leaked out into the box before I even got it -- they should put a better seal on the bottle. Still very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My brother told me about Honest Amish products. I wish I had started using them earlier. My beard was always flaky and the ends of the hairs split. The beard oil fixed these problems in a couple of days. I also use the heavy duty beard balm, ans couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard soft and easy to comb. Love the very mild scent as well.</li>
    <li> The product lid was not secured in the packaging, just not quite screwed on all the way, and the bottle was only about 2/3 full. Fortunately the other items in my shipment were all shrink wrapped, so the only loss was the oil itself and the well oiled cardboard box. That said, the product is wonderful and it seems like a simple accident, not worth returning. I have purchased 1 oz bottles of oil for more than the cost of this 2 oz bottle, so no biggie. Again great product though, smells just like the Honest Amish balm, which is a good thing. Taking off one star for the packaging, not the product.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite beard oil. Love the smell of it and one bottle will last me many many months</li>
    <li> I had the beard balm previously, which I loved except for the portion control. This oil has the same great scent, leaves my beard soft and soothes my skin, but it *so* much easier to get the correct amount! 2oz doesn&#x27;t sound very big, but I expect this bottle to last me months!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it. Smells good.</li>
    <li> Use this daily in my beard - my wife loves it and says I smell like Christmas cookies. I love the smell as well, and it keeps the beard soft and looking healthy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since using this. My wife loves the smell and loves how soft my beard has become.</li>
    <li> helps keep my whiskers down.</li>
    <li> Great product it has a fantastic assortment of essential oils. Looking forward to purchasing the wax!</li>
    <li> This stuff works even better than the Honest Amish Beard Balm. As long as you don&#x27;t put too much, it won&#x27;t come off on your hands. It makes my beard look shiny and conditioned, but not to the point that it looks greasy. Definitely helps with split ends too.</li>
    <li> Great product my beard has never smelt so good and felt so soft</li>
    <li> My husband has a sexy, full beard. The scruffy, dirty feel of unconditioned facial hair? Not as appealing. I bought this oil as a gift and am so impressed with the results! Almost instantly, my husband&#x27;s beard was shiny, clean and soft! Every bit as glorious as he is! I would recommend this product to anyone wanting healthy, attractive facial hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. Much better than the balm. Smell is fantastic, in my opinion. Instantly adds shine and softness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble growing my bear before because my skin would get irritated as the hairs come through my skin. This is no longer the case thanks to this product. All natural and it smells amazing. I highly recommend purchasing the balm as well. Use the oil at night before you go to bed and the oil in the morning when you wake up to style. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product in question and I will plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> Buy now this is the best product I have found for my beard not just me but my wife noticed within a few weeks my beard getting thicker and a lot bigger great smell as well</li>
    <li> I have tried other oils this is by far a great buy. I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews in concerns with the smell ( root beer). After a short while it goes away leaving a soft manageable beard.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Smells like wood!</li>
    <li> Great for the beard works as advertised</li>
    <li> Bought this product and have noticed immediate results. The smell is fantastic and really helps the beard to look neat and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought the HA Classic Oil.. well, let&#x27;s face it.. because it was significantly cheaper than what I was using. Significantly. It seems to work pretty well in keeping my beard  oiled but I wouldn&#x27;t do &#x27;classic&#x27; again. I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so you may not run into the same thing but I find that, when I first apply the oil, it almost has a very faint almost fruity smell to it. I thought, &amp;#34;Oh.. well that&#x27;s nice enough.&amp;#34; And I don&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m chewing bubble gum because it&#x27;s VERY faint. While rubbing it in, I started smelling something a little more licorice like. Well, that&#x27;s kinda nice too. Manlier than fruit. But within 10 or 15 seconds.... apparently &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Amish smells like a barnyard. I dunno... for that almost real Amish experience? It&#x27;s bearable as long as I&#x27;m not going to be around anyone. What I&#x27;ve taken to doing is rubbing on the oil and then doing a quick rub of the other stuff I had. The Honest Amish oil is a supplement to the other. Again.. it may just be me. It still works. Maybe your nose will do something different. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard oil on the market. The smell alone is worth the money. Lasts a good while also. I have bought 2 bottles so far.</li>
    <li> Smells good and is working out very well for my husband.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I can really tell a difference in his beard! It looks so much better and well kept. He loves it too.</li>
    <li> Works great but i can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other  beard products in the past and this one is the best! Good moisturizer for a stubbornly dry beard and a woodsy, subtle scent that never overpowers.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that often suffers from &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I try to be consistent with this product. When I&#x27;m not, I notice the difference in my beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I bless my beard with this oil, it feels incredibly soft and provides a noticeable difference in texture.</li>
    <li> I have a really course thick beard about 3-4 inches long. I have tried both the honest amish beard balm and this beard oil. For my beard the balm worked better at making my beard softer but the oil was amazing for my skin. The oil wasn&#x27;t as oily as the balm on my skin due to it soaking in better. I probably won&#x27;t buy the oil again but definitely the balm. I have used almost the whole bottle of oil just to make sure I knew if it was to take a few days to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but not sure it does much to help straighten my curly beard.</li>
    <li> Great product! After about a week or so of use, I began to see significance difference in my beards&#x27;s texture and color. The smell is OK but I just don&#x27;t like the smell of liquorice, so it might just be me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve tried the balm and the oil and both of them work perfect! The difference between  them is the texture you would get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I took out a star because the dripper  that comes with the oil was broken.</li>
    <li> Give to my boyfriend, he loves it, and smells really good, his beard looks much more health and shining ❤️</li>
    <li> This beard oil was a real disappointment. I was attracted to the all organic ingredients. After a few weeks of use I am going to have to toss it. It irritates my skin and caused a burning sensation. I am going back to my old oil even though it is more extensive .</li>
    <li> Day One:  I rubbed a little of this oil in my beard and it seemed to help with the itchiness.  My first impression was satisfactory.  Day Two:  I woke up in a Cabin to the smell of flapjacks.  Confused, I walked outside to see my Beard chopping wood and drinking whiskey.  My beard calmly explained the situation, fed me a delicious breakfast, and took me home.  Day Three:  I put some more oil in my beard and it seemed to work as advertised.  Still confused about yesterday.</li>
    <li> product was received promptly.  Thank you.  pleased with product</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not sure it does anything for my beard.</li>
    <li> This was a good idea. Beard oil has turned out to be very helpful and this brand, even without a personal experience with a competitors product, is wonderful. Scent is apply described but not overpowering. It is possible to use too much though. Read tips and watch videos.</li>
    <li> i like this better than the balm because the oil soaks right in and it makes the face hair soft. soft hair means better growth even when cut.</li>
    <li> Great product works very well for me and my beard leaving it soft and smooth plus beard smelling great with no tangled hair when I brush it.</li>
    <li> My husband, and most of his beard club members, love Honest Amish.  Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I like it...good stuff.  Wife said the hairs on my face are much softer, and easier for her to pull and drag me around by.  So long as she happy, I&#x27;m bleeding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***  I&#x27;ve now bought my 4th bottle.  I&#x27;m still very happy with the quality of this product, and how well my beard looks with it in.  Fragrance is nice, and not overpowering.  It also goes away after about an hour or so, so it&#x27;s not the first thing coworkers notice about you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep making it, and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> one of the best oils i have used</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband, hes very strict about how he shapes and cares for his facial hair, and he only uses organic products and oils.   Heres his review -&gt;&#x27;&#x27;Good quality beard oil, helps to eliminate/prevent beardruff, Ive been using it with 100% organic argan oil.  Overall 3-4 drops Of honest amish oil ,along with 2 squirts of argan ,  keeps my beard (&lt;~1\\&quot; in length) feeling fairly soft thru out the day.  It gives a nice shine, its non greasy ,and helps curb beard itch for the most part. Only thing Im not crazy about is the smell, it has a clove oil, mixed with black licorice odor, not to strong, but still itll have u smelling like a baked ham.  Id like to try the honest amish premium beard oil. Dont be greedy Roscoe, send  some premium beard oil my way. Cheers...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Does a great job of keeping beard shiny and soft. Great value for 2 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> This beard oil is awesome! Smells great and makes my beard feel soft. I like the way it keeps my skin moisturized and cures the itchy scratchies! Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Works just great.  I like the scent but I also like black licorice, which if you mix it with a masculine woody scent,  is what this smells like to me.  The scent fades fast, which is fine.</li>
    <li> Use to use beard balm not anymore I&#x27;m a changed beardley MAN beard oil is the way to go</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works decent, smells really nice (not too strong, but there for sure).  I especially like the little squeese stopper that lets me get out as much as I need vs risking pouring a ton into my hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for any length beard , very mellow scent.&lt;br /&gt;Have purchased 3 bottles so far.</li>
    <li> really makes a difference, will never do without it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Honest Amish waxes for years, but used oils from other places. When I saw they had an oil too, I pounced. This oil does not disappoint. It keeps my beard soft, tangle free, and healthy. It also keeps my beard under control and from getting TOO frizzy. It has a nice, soft scent; no over-powering perfumes here. There are certainly other really good oils out there, but this is certainly my favorite.</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard healthy, hydrated, shiny and soft.  Results with the first application.  Great scent.  A fair price for a large bottle.  I will only ever use Honest Amish beard oil and wax.</li>
    <li> great product, I thought I read somewhere this was a scent free product which it is not. but it works well. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Served the purpose very well.  Recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and leaves beard soft. Only takes a few drops.</li>
    <li> As described, beautifully packaged. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my coworker who is growing his beard out. He loves it. Now his beard looks well kept instead of all tangled &amp; rough. His beard is now soft &amp; well laid.  I also bought him a brush &amp; comb set.</li>
    <li> Really smooth on the skin, great feel very natural, great for grooming!!</li>
    <li> It smells very strongly of black licorice</li>
    <li> Helps soften and control wy wirey beard.</li>
    <li> Good smell, makes beard shine. Cool packaging. Smell last for a short time. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I have yet to really give this a shot.  I&#x27;ve been running the Honest Amish conditioner more than I have this Classic Beard Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the few times I have tried it, its worked great!  A little goes a long way and a single bottle should last my 1-2&amp;#34; beard &amp; mustache for quite some time! :)</li>
    <li> The scent it subtle but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does a good job of penetrating the beard hair and lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the beard balm from Honest Amish, and while I liked the scent and its conditioning power, it was just too heavy to really work into my beard.  It did work well for my mustache, which isn&#x27;t very filled in nor as coarse/curly hair as my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The classic beard oil smells exactly like the regular balm...perfect!  Its not pine-y or forest-y, nor is it musky or &#x27;fresh&#x27;...I guess I&#x27;d call it a manly &#x27;spice&#x27; scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Its much thinner than a different brand I&#x27;d been using, much closer to that of pure jojoba oil (which I also use on the beard).  This makes it a lot easier to apply, especially if the beard isn&#x27;t damp (it&#x27;s hard to keep short beard damp after all).&lt;br /&gt;The dropper could be a little better constructed, but its not problematic either...just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had issues with any irritation nor pimple formation.</li>
    <li> Honest Amish beard oil quite simply cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other beard oils and always come back to this stuff. The scent is fresh, clean, and manly...has some black licorice and root beer tones to it. Not at all overpowering, but it&#x27;ll pleasantly stick with you for several hours. The oil itself feels great and really works wonders for the beard. We have very high humidity lately, and it totally bushes out my beard. This oil tames it, nourishes it, and helps the beard lay nicely. It&#x27;s not at all oily or greasy if you get it on your skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is comparable with other oils on the market, but comparatively speaking, most other brands only give you one ounce, where Honest Amish gives you two. TOTALLY WELL WORTH IT. And it&#x27;s all natural and organic. Great for your face and doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue for sensitive skin. If you want your beard to look its best, buy this beard oil.</li>
    <li> Smells good without being too overbearing. The bottle is larger compared to other products in the same price range. It definitely helps keepmy beard soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing product; I ordered this for my fiance and his beard has never been softer! Has a pleasant smell as well; very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Bought has a gift for my fiance, he likes it: subtle smell, nice package, easy to use dropper. In his words &amp;#34;it works well, but the smell could be a little less like anise&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far i haven&#x27;t seen any results so i don&#x27;t know how to rate this product at this time</li>
    <li> Smells good. Keeps my beard less itcy and makes it look well groomed</li>
    <li> this stuff smells great and makes my beard look healthier.</li>
    <li> I use this at night before bed and it makes my wife love the smell of my beard.  It has also stopped what many people call Beaddruff.  I use the original wax in the  morning for styling and use this at night to condition my hair and skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost a week now and can tell a huge difference in my beard and face health.  Anyone getting into beard care, this is the product for you.  Good Job Honest Amish.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil. Hints of bourbon and black licorice. A few drops in the beard and work it in, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Keep the beard healthy and gets rid of any dry skin under the beard. It also has a nice aroma to it.</li>
    <li> Just got two bottles of this and hot damn its the best!!! The smell is a little peppered but I can catch a hit of bourbon! I&#x27;d recommend any of their products!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It&#x27;s been a week and his beardruff is already almost gone. It has a really good smell and it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Honest Amish! I got this for him and it has lasted 4-5 months already and still has plenty in the bottle! A little goes a long way and the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as others I have smelled.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! For oilers, I highly recommend, as a balm person balm certainly lasts longer. Great company as well customer service as well as great price. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great product. I haven&#x27;t shaved in 3 months,trying to start a good soup saver. Used Honest Amish and loved it. Kept my beard from looking like a wild mess. Smells great. Not greasy and very little needed to apply to keep my beard looking great. Would recommend this product. Eye dropper used for measuring is a very good tool.</li>
    <li> Worked just like all the reviews claimed.</li>
    <li> I had got this as a present for my husband but due to the very strong and unpleasant smell of the product he is unable to use it.</li>
    <li> Great value on a quality product.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple weeks, noticeably softer and healthier beard hairs. They feel happy.</li>
    <li> 1st time user of beard oil, DID NOT want something scented. Oil soaks in quickly, not greasy, and leaves beard lookin smoooooth!</li>
    <li> Great gift.  As described and expected.  Would recommend and re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the beard balm, and I really like them both. They smell great, and I generally hate scented things.</li>
    <li> This oil works well and is easy to apply. It helps keep my beard soft and manageable. The smell is sort of like pine and it does linger awhile. I am in the process of trying out other oils, so I will likely have more to add later.</li>
    <li> I received the balm as a gift and immediately purchased the oil and wax. Fantastic products for that beard that all men are proud of.</li>
    <li> Used one time. Can not stand the smell.</li>
    <li> Just started growing my beard in early November. Before then I never went more than two days without shaving. I used Argan Oil until about a month ago when I decided to give this a shot. This stuff is awesome! First time I used it I was overpowered by the smell but that was due to a mistake on my part. Trust me guys, do not over do it with the dropper. I used a whole dropper because I was used to the Argan oil lol. 5 or 6 drops go a long way. The oil leaves my beard super soft and smelling good all day. This will be my go to product from now on. And the Honest Amish guys have the best customer service,  I had a few issues with orders and they fixed it instantly. Very happy I found these guys!</li>
    <li> Seems to make beard more manageable but not sure if it stops beard flakes from dry skin..time will tell. Good smelling stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 months now i think. It helps with my mild eczema even.  Hairs less coarse, takes a comb easier, skin healthier, and i loose less in the shower.  My buddy (he and i are having a 1 yr no shave contest) have both bought this.  His eczema is FAR FAR worse, and he uses this on other areas of his body, and it goes away.  He is in no way affiliated with the amish, so not a snake oil salesman.</li>
    <li> Kinda adore this stuff. Smells nice and makes the beard feel all soft and look shiny. Ha.</li>
    <li> Husband started growing a bread and was about to shave due to the condition of his bread... he still has his bread. And it is soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate him or me. Scent is nice also</li>
    <li> Smelled pretty earthy early on. Wasn&#x27;t a giant fan of it the first few days but it grew on me. Love the smell now. Oh, yeah, love what it does to my beard, too. Guess I should throw that in there.</li>
    <li> Applies well and smell good.</li>
    <li> Just recieved this amazing product after only having to wait 3 days to recieve. Very speedy. Ive used it once and can tell a difference already. It does have a black licorice smell but it just reminds me of jager which i enjoy lol. Very good product and yes i recoommend. It has 7 oils in it compared to 2 or 3 oils like most beard oils.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. I love the smell and like other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t last long and isn&#x27;t strong. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my beard or make it look oily.</li>
    <li> I love it... Everything I expected it to be. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase Honest Amish products</li>
    <li> Makes my beard look 50 years younger. Good product. This is my 2nd order and I wish I looked as good as my beard dose.  P.S. My cat loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it on toast in the morning with my coffee also. Read the above post!!!</li>
    <li> Gift-recipient was very happy with product</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works. My wife has been complaining about my beard being bristly, and I have had skin irritation on my upper lip for months. After about a week both issues were gone. I&#x27;ll be buying this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sketchy but good</li>
    <li> First time ordering it.  Great for conditioning my growing goatee.  Love Honest Amish hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps with the manageability of my beard greatly. Nice smell but not too strong. Would buy again. Great service with quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Makes me want to ride in a horse drawn buggy</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Resolved dry, itchy skin and beard dandruff under my beard.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product that conditions the hair to a gorgeous shine and it smells wonderful! My handsome husbands beard is that much more cozy and kissable.</li>
    <li> I recommend it to any man with a beard...</li>
    <li> Ive tried other beard oils and this one kicks ass. No strong smell. Works great</li>
    <li> Stopped my face from itching</li>
    <li> Smells great and gets the job done. It&#x27;s a good conditioner for your skin, and will make your beard happy! ;)</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> smells like yagermeister out of the bottle but when you put it one the smell dissipates quickly and leaves you with a soft beard, this however is not great if you plan to sculpt your beard, in that case use a wax</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a grave before shave brand oil and Honest Amish is just amazing! My wife loves the smell which I will not bother describing because it&#x27;s truly unique. The other oils felt like it disappeared within an hour but this leaves my beard feeling conditioned throughout the day! 5 stars! Now excuse me while I order some more! Additionally, I will mention that 2oz last around 6 weeks with 4 months worth of beard growth and I use it daily after every shower (Refreshing). Fantastic product, I encourage everyone to check out their &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; soaps and other products as well.</li>
    <li> Really awesome product. Nice smell. Works amazingly. Have used several others that were good. This is just better somehow. Wont be the last thing i try from them.</li>
    <li> My son loved it. He said it made his beard very soft.</li>
    <li> So far so good! After almost a week, my beard looks healthier and is already feeling softer!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! Loves the way it smells (I do too!), no more &#x27;beard-druff&#x27; and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
    <li> I have used a few different beard oils and this one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried. Love it!</li>
    <li> You have a beard? Buy it. End of story. It adds sheen. Man does it look sexy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It has an entrancing scent that changes every time I smell it and I just can&#x27;t quite pin down. Most likely due to the interesting combination of apricot, almond, and avocado. Not overpowering either, if you&#x27;re worried about that. Gives a great sheen and makes my beard far softer than it was with brushing alone.</li>
    <li> A  big learning curve, but now my 20 inch beard is honest and tame! Great woodsy aroma.</li>
    <li> It was a Valentine&#x27;s day gift. Highly liked and appreciated</li>
    <li> fairly strong sent of black licorice which i happen to not like at all. Other than that the oil is fairly thick but spreads well throughout. If it were a different scent I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Virgin Argan, Golden Jojoba, and Kukui oils. This is how a beard oil should be made. If you have ever used any of Honest Amish&#x27;s Beard Balm or Classic Beard Wax, the smell is very similar to those. My fiance and I love the smell. Honestly, all of the Honest Amish products I&#x27;ve tried (I own some Original Beard Balm, Classic Beard Wax, Extra Grit Beard Wax, this product of course, the Classic Beard Oil, and the Natural Patchouli  and Bark Soap) make growing a beard better! Great Products.</li>
    <li> Love honest amish products. Previously bought the wax, and was extremely satisfied. The oil smells great and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is the first beard oil I have ever bought and I don&#x27;t think I can ever go without it.  I grew out a bear last year for no shave November grew it 2 months, at the end of two months it was so bristly I had to shave it.  I&#x27;m now 2 months in to a new beard using this oil and my beard is so soft and manageable it is amazing.  I absolutely recommend Honest Amish Beard Oil to anybody.</li>
    <li> Great product for your beard.</li>
    <li> Great item and great company. ordered this for a friend initially then got a set for myself as well. i get really dry skin under my beard and this really helped keep my skin from drying.</li>
    <li> Best beard oil!! Will never go without it again!!! A must have for all bearded men!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff wish aroma was a bit stronger</li>
    <li> Daily use has made my beard awesome looking and feeling.  Anyone can grow a beard, but when you use this product.  You rock an awesome beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan Honest Amish products. They all work and smell great. A full 2oz for less than what the other guys charge for 1oz. I have a thick tactical beard and it loves this stuff!. Half a dropper full worked into this facial extravaganza is all it takes. I rub it in as soon as I get out of the shower and work it through with a few strokes of a fine comb. It keeps this masterpiece as soft as the fur on a baby bunny&#x27;s belly, and tangle free too. The only con is my inability to concentrate due to the constant distracting sound of panties dropping.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. The smell is a little strong at first but fades quickly. My beard is on the shorter side and this oil does a great job of softening the hair and making it lay down. I use it daily and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best product that I have used for beard itch!  Love it!  No other product comes even close.  Love the packaging and the distribution method as well.  Very nice and well thought product.</li>
    <li> Love this beard oil.  Nice aroma and gives the beard a bit of a sheen, finish up with Amish Beard wax and a soft boar bristle brush and you are looking good.  Thanks for this product.</li>
    <li> Good beard oil at a great price. Arrived quickly, and well packaged as is a problem with some beard oils. Comes with a dropper that works well. I was not a fan of the smell, it&#x27;s not overly stron so if you don&#x27;t mind anise or a J&amp;auml;ger type smell this will be perfect. Just not the scent me or my girlfriend wanted. But that won&#x27;t affect my rating since its relative.</li>
    <li> Great beard oil. Have a one year length in beard and this oil is better than others I&#x27;ve tried. Great scent too</li>
    <li> Best oil ever!!!!! Although I love ALL Honest Amish products. Great people, great company, Amazing customer service!!</li>
    <li> After growing a decent length goatee, was frustrated that it was stiff and brittle feeling. Researched a bunch of beard oils and settled on this one. After almost a week, was amazed how soft it became.  My wife actually said she likes the goatee now.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves your beard smelling nice and makes your beard soft and manageable. I would definitely buy this brand again. The size is much bigger than the other brands I&#x27;ve bought at relatively the same price.</li>
    <li> Bought this when my beard was long and thicker in the winter. It definitely stopped the beard dandruff but it left my face feeling kind of oily. I moisturize my face and what not but this was just a little overkill. The scent is fine and didn&#x27;t bother me but I kind of enjoy my own musk.</li>
    <li> I have a short beard, not super long, but this stuff works great and smells great. It has a woodsy (is that even a word?) pine smell. Makes me smell like a lumberjack and the ladies love it! Makes my beard soft and feel great.</li>
    <li> Bought this based upon the reviews. This doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to grave before shave products. The softness and sheen are virtually nonexistent.  In a nutshell, honest amish is far less than I expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves my beard shiny and soft as promised.  The smell is soothing.</li>
    <li> It works great, smells good (the scent dissipates pretty soon after application), and leaves no oily residue or sticky feeling. My only complaint was that the lid was not on the bottle as tight as it should have been, and it arrived with an oily label and a cap that was not quite snug. Didn&#x27;t stop me from using it thought, and it feels great for daily use!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Cool packaging, works great on my beard! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and company. I&#x27;ve tried both the beard oil and balm and both have exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> This beard oil does a good job softening my beard. I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;My wife, on the other hand, does not like the anise/black licorice scent. It is not a strong scent, but I definitely get whiffs of it all day, and she noticed it from the other side of the car.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably have to find another product that she will enjoy.</li>
    <li> Makes the beard feel great and manageable</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products but this stuff works so great I just had to.  I was experiencing beard and moustache dandruff and was getting very frustrated.  Regular face and head moisturizers just weren&#x27;t working.  So, I did some research and found this stuff.  Not only did it solve the dandruff problem, but it smells great and has help my beard, which was somewhat patchy, come in much fuller.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> great product, helps with itching,  gives nice shine to the beard. will definately  purchase again</li>
    <li> When you put it on you will shine....The oil is so concentrated is does not mix in beard very well</li>
    <li> I have been growing a glorious manly beard,  but suffered from dry itchy chin and wild scratchy beard hairs.  My girlfriend was of course impressed by the beard,  but less excited by the wild hairs that poked and scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a number of beard oils and conditioners, but had trouble finding one that worked.  This was further complicated by the fact the my significant other is allergic to lavender, and everything has lavender oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found Honest Amish Beard Oil.  No lavender.  A few drops after showering and my beard is neat and soft.  No dry chin skin.  No wild hairs.  And my beard smells tremendous and manly, vaguely like licorice.  My girlfriend loves licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result,  my beard is epic,  and my girlfriend is now my fianc&amp;eacute;,  with a wedding coming up in a few weeks.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is entirely due to Honest Amish Beard Oil,  but it would be unfair to deny the role this product has played in persuading the most wonderful woman in the world to marry me.</li>
    <li> I love this beard oil it smells great and keeps my beard soft. Great stuff</li>
