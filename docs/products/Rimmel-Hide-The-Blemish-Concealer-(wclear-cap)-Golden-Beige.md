      <li>Like that this mascara stays on without flaking, yet also washes off easily with a face cloth &amp; water.</li>
      <li>I liked it at first because of its lengthening, but I could never ride my bike with it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get this in eyes it can sting but is fine just on lashes.</li>
      <li>This one still proves to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have tried many varieties of many brands of mascaras, my old favorite was CoverGirl clump crusher.</li>
      <li>The mascara goes on smoothly with a \\&quot;medium-not-too-thin\\&quot; consistency.</li>
      <li>This mascara really does deliver amazing length.</li>
      <li>the brush is super easy to maneuver&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many times I will like a mascara for the first week</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and after two weeks you really see a difference!</li>
      <li>This stuff is good even though I don&#x27;t think it really grows your lashes by much</li>
      <li>I purchased 2nd one since this working good.</li>
      <li>If you truly want longer natural lashes, I recommend cleaning your eyelashes with a mild yet effective makeup remover where your lashes are not being pulled and all makeup traces are removed.</li>
      <li>Nothing extraordinary but do their job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a make-up connoisseur but super picky.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>My lashes did actually grow and they look amazing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even worth trying.</li>
      <li>This mascara is light enough that even my stubborn lashes were able to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>are fibers in this mascara and it can be tricky to apply it, but the end results are worth the effort.</li>
      <li>I find that Maybelline&#x27;s the falsies volum express is far better, and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have very straight hair, including my eye lashes.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more shortly.</li>
      <li>If I notice in 3 or 4 months that my lashes have actually grown longer, I will be sure to update this review.</li>

      <li>I also don&#x27;t need to use eyelash curler since this mascara not watering in first use</li>
      <li>* the small end is perfect for inner eye corner lashes&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it at first..</li>
      <li>/&gt;For beginner mascara users - applying one layer will pretty much do nothing to change your eyelash appearance.  </li>
      <li>I do use this in conjunction with Maybelline&#x27;s Full and Soft Mascara (to thicken my lashes) and then the Rimmel for lengthening.  </li>
      <li>I love how black it is and makes my lashes nice and long.</li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go to a funeral or be caught in a downpour and expect it to hold up, but a watery eye here</li>
      <li>Initially I really liked this but as time went on it really started to clunk up to the point that I looked a mess.</li>
      <li>This was better than my last mascara, but it clumps easily, so I have to be careful when I&#x27;m applying it.  </li>
      <li>I really like the mascara wand brush.</li>
      <li>i have not seen much improvement.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes.</li>
      <li>IT REALLY ACCELERATE LASH GROWTH?</li>
      <li>Thanks to this mascara</li>
      <li>It really does lengthen the appearance of your lashes.</li>
      <li>really helps to emphasize my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I use it on days I don&#x27;t have much make up on</li>
      <li>I love this as a mascara, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth, so I&#x27;m not sure how true those claims are.  </li>
      <li>Takes forever to dry and smudges easily but makes eyelashes look longer</li>
      <li>Within 6 weeks my lashes were &#x27;normal&#x27;, and in 4 months I have as much length and volume as if I were wearing falsies, thanks in part to Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator Mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure the mascara causes your lashes to grow any faster or longer, but it will keep the lashes you have in good shape and prevent breakage because your lashes are soft, flexible, and not brittle with this</li>
      <li>The Ardell doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;accelerate&#x27;, but it does deep condition your lashes and protects lashes from breakage during sleep - think of it as you would conditioner your hair to keep it healthy, it&#x27;s the same principle.</li>
      <li>It works really well for coating top lashes in the traditional upward horizontal sweeping/curling motion, but also works well on individual and bottom lashes by vertical application with tip of</li>
      <li>The extreme black is a great intensity, better than most extreme black colors.</li>
      <li>At 4 weeks it was just about the same as when I first opened it, maybe better because it had a chance to dry a bit.</li>
      <li>I can still see new lashes continuing to grow in!)</li>
      <li>Since mascara should be replaced every 3 months minimum, I feel I really got my money&#x27;s worth, especially since it is a bargain to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;DOES</li>
      <li>/&gt;OVERALL, pretty much exactly what I want in a mascara, FINALLY!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them ALL from high end</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended as part of my lash care and regrowth routine.</li>
      <li>Apply Rimmel Lash Accelerator as part of normal makeup routine WITHOUT use of eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>The brush is one of the new types of plastic/rubber bristles, and it is tapered at the ends but full in the center.</li>
      <li>Apply moderate coat to lashes, then hold lashes in an &#x27;up&#x27; or curled position with lash comb (or I prefer to use side of my finger ;-))</li>
      <li>The mascara really isn&#x27;t water resistant, but I do not worry about it running or having spots where the lashes touch my skin in a typical day, and I have very long lashes now touching eyebrows (see growth tips below).</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as full as other products do.</li>
      <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell if it encourages lash growth, though.</li>
      <li>So far I like the way it makes my eyelashes look</li>
      <li>The Endless version did not really do any better at lengthening.&lt;br /&gt;MASCARA</li>
      <li>LONG MASCARA STAYS FRESH: I have now used this same tube for 11 weeks.</li>
      <li>Eye lashes grow very slowly and typically only grow to a certain length, hence why you don&#x27;t have to trim them, so even if this mascara is able to chemically induce longer growth, I suspect it&#x27;ll take months to be noticeable.</li>
      <li>Only improvement would possibly be to have it a little more water resistant during wear.</li>
      <li>It stays wet a little longer than most, which did take a bit to get used to.</li>
      <li>With ALL the other mascaras I have tried, even if I heat up the eye lash curler first, the mascara weighs my lashes down so much that they go back to being straight.</li>
      <li>The regular Lash Accelerator Mascara is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;CHARACTERISTICS &amp; APPLICATION:</li>
      <li>I just received my mascara today, and have only put it on and washed it off twice thus far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve come across in this price range (I refuse to spend a ton of money on mascara). I&#x27;ve tried others, but always come back to Rimmel Lash Accelerator.</li>
    <li> So far it is working great! Wand easy to use and love the brush tip!!!</li>
    <li> favorite mascara because my eyelashes have noticably grown</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and after two weeks you really see a difference!</li>
    <li> Average mascara,  i have not seen much improvement.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first because of its lengthening, but I could never ride my bike with it. Sweat + mascara -&amp;#62; no good</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I wear. It&#x27;s great and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was better than my last mascara, but it clumps easily, so I have to be careful when I&#x27;m applying it.  :-(  I don&#x27;t know if my lashes have grown any, so for that part of the description I can&#x27;t answer.</li>
    <li> Initially I really liked this but as time went on it really started to clunk up to the point that I looked a mess. The brush is really awful but after working with it, it looks okay.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as full as other products do.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my go-to favorite for adding color &amp; curl to my lashes. I do have long lashes to begin with, but they are tipped in blonde so unless I wear mascara, it is difficult to see that.&lt;br /&gt;This wand makes it easy to apply, does not clump as alot of others do.&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply one coat of this &amp; then follow it with a coat of Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion for added volume &amp; length.&lt;br /&gt;...the perfect &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;... ;)</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry and smudges easily but makes eyelashes look longer</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands through out the years. This one still proves to be my favorite. It enlongates my lashes without making them too chunky. Perfect and a perfect price. This is the only mascara I will ever use! I just proved it again! I bought a different brand but I instantly regretted it. I will be buying more shortly.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this based on the reviews.  I absolutely love this mascara.  I have been using Mally&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara but at $20 a tube, I wanted to find a cheaper alternative.  I have short, thin, blonde eyelashes and the color of this mascara really helps to emphasize my eyes.  I do use this in conjunction with Maybelline&#x27;s Full and Soft Mascara (to thicken my lashes) and then the Rimmel for lengthening.  When I use both the Maybelline and the Rimmel, I get the same effect as I did with the Mally and save $$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make-up connoisseur but super picky. Rimmel makes some of the best AND most affordable mascara. This stuff is good even though I don&#x27;t think it really grows your lashes by much, it&#x27;s a good mascara anyway. Their other stuff I don&#x27;t care for the mascara is a MUST.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t blessed to be born with lush and long eyelashes.  Thanks to this mascara, it made my eyelashes look longer and thicker - with multiple layers, that is.  Also, the shape of the wand seems to work out well for my short-length eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve tried those other curvy or whatever-creative-shaped wands, they barely touched my eyelashes and just created a mess on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beginner mascara users - applying one layer will pretty much do nothing to change your eyelash appearance.  Don&#x27;t blame the brands if that is the case for you.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes. I use it on days I don&#x27;t have much make up on and I just want my eyes to look awake.</li>
    <li> I get complements on my lashes multiple times a day now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that you HAVE to use primer or else it gets clumpy.  Also, if you get any in your eye it starts to water and won&#x27;t stop for at least 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will definitely be purchasing this again.  My lashes did actually grow and they look amazing.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. I find that Maybelline&#x27;s the falsies volum express is far better, and much cheaper. I was amazed how well it does as a mascara. Have not found anything that actually permently thickens or lengthens lashes</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara.  I have tried all the store brands.  This just makes my lashes pop and add length and definition.  Move over Great Lash! Rimmel is here to stay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it came out and I love it. I love how black it is and makes my lashes nice and long.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. I will warn you, it takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;There are fibers in this mascara and it can be tricky to apply it, but the end results are worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I like it at first..then it ends up under my eyes.</li>
    <li> So far I like the way it makes my eyelashes look I don&#x27;t know if they will grow at all but I am content with the look.</li>
    <li> I am a mascara snob!  I&#x27;ve tried them ALL from high end (Dior Show) to the $.99 ones at the drugstore (well, ok, maybe $1.99).  Anyway, I always go back to this Rimmel Lash Accelerator one!  This is why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It defines each lash so well&lt;br /&gt;* It never clumps on the brush&lt;br /&gt;* the brush is super easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;* I can do 4 or 5 coats and it doesn&#x27;t cause spider-eyes&lt;br /&gt;* the small end is perfect for inner eye corner lashes&lt;br /&gt;* it never feels heavy or brittle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be devastated if Rimmel ever stops making this one!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2nd one since this working good. Nothing extraordinary but do their job. I&#x27;m happy! I use serum at night and day time mascara with this and growth very long. I also don&#x27;t need to use eyelash curler since this mascara not watering in first use so it&#x27;s actually good my eyelash don&#x27;t get hurt by curler anymore. I&#x27;m happy and put on subscribing to get 20% more discount with Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> (Edited @11 weeks use, reordered 2nd) This mascara is AWESOME! HIGHLY recommended as part of my lash care and regrowth routine. I have tried many varieties of many brands of mascaras, my old favorite was CoverGirl clump crusher. Rimmel Lash Accelerator clumps less, flakes less and stays softer, not brittle, and is easier to remove. Also tried the &#x27;Endless&#x27; version of Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator, and it had more issues with application, some initial clumping and minor flaking, although still preferred to Covergirl and other brands. The regular Lash Accelerator Mascara is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;CHARACTERISTICS &amp; APPLICATION: The extreme black is a great intensity, better than most extreme black colors. The mascara goes on smoothly with a \\&quot;medium-not-too-thin\\&quot; consistency. It stays wet a little longer than most, which did take a bit to get used to. I now prefer this slightly thinner and wetter consistency because it gives me time to separate the lashes and comb/hold them &#x27;up&#x27; for a curl without having to use those evil eyelash-ripping pinching curler contraptions. I can also build volume with this mascara by applying several coats, and it coats to the tip of the lash without clumping on the ends, so lashes appear as long as naturally possible. The Endless version did not really do any better at lengthening.&lt;br /&gt;MASCARA WAND: I really like the mascara wand brush. The brush is one of the new types of plastic/rubber bristles, and it is tapered at the ends but full in the center. It works really well for coating top lashes in the traditional upward horizontal sweeping/curling motion, but also works well on individual and bottom lashes by vertical application with tip of wand.&lt;br /&gt;MASCARA WEAR AND TOUCH-UP: The formula is flexible when dry and it does not flake or crumble, and seems to wear well through a 12 hour day without reapplying. If you do want to touch it up, no problems with the current mascara clumping or crumbling underneath. The mascara really isn&#x27;t water resistant, but I do not worry about it running or having spots where the lashes touch my skin in a typical day, and I have very long lashes now touching eyebrows (see growth tips below). I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go to a funeral or be caught in a downpour and expect it to hold up, but a watery eye here or there can be managed. I would not expect a heavy application to hold up during a workout or outside in extreme heat, but a light application should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;HOW LONG MASCARA STAYS FRESH: I have now used this same tube for 11 weeks. It showed no signs of drying out or breaking down until about week 9, and I used it average 4-5 days a week. At 4 weeks it was just about the same as when I first opened it, maybe better because it had a chance to dry a bit. I am still wearing it, waiting for my reordered tube and putting up with shortened daily wear time.  Many times I will like a mascara for the first week or so when it is freshly opened, but the formula will degrade quickly and within two weeks I am dealing with bad mascara - not the case here. Since mascara should be replaced every 3 months minimum, I feel I really got my money&#x27;s worth, especially since it is a bargain to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;DOES IT REALLY ACCELERATE LASH GROWTH? I&#x27;m not sure the mascara causes your lashes to grow any faster or longer, but it will keep the lashes you have in good shape and prevent breakage because your lashes are soft, flexible, and not brittle with this formula.&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL: I personally remove mascara with coconut oil, so I cannot speak to ease of removal with other products, but two passes with the oil is sufficient to remove all traces of mascara. The battle for long lashes can easily be lost by a mascara that is too difficult to remove - you tug at eyelashes causing fall out - no problems here with that.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, pretty much exactly what I want in a mascara, FINALLY! Only improvement would possibly be to have it a little more water resistant during wear. I do not know if there is awaterproof/resistant version, I haven&#x27;t seen one, but I would give it a try, and if not, Rimmel please make one!&lt;br /&gt;LASH REGROWTH AND LENGTHENING ADVICE - If you truly want longer natural lashes, I recommend cleaning your eyelashes with a mild yet effective makeup remover where your lashes are not being pulled and all makeup traces are removed. KEY POINT- never pull at your lashes, ever! I use refined coconit oil &amp; remove traces of oil with a baby wipe before the next step. I then apply Rapid Lash to the base of my lashes at night, let dry, then coat my lashes especially tips with Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator. Don&#x27;t get this in eyes it can sting but is fine just on lashes. The Ardell doesn&#x27;t really &#x27;accelerate&#x27;, but it does deep condition your lashes and protects lashes from breakage during sleep - think of it as you would conditioner your hair to keep it healthy, it&#x27;s the same principle. Must wash off the lashes in a.m. or mascara application will suffer. Apply Rimmel Lash Accelerator as part of normal makeup routine WITHOUT use of eyelash curler. Apply moderate coat to lashes, then hold lashes in an &#x27;up&#x27; or curled position with lash comb (or I prefer to use side of my finger ;-)) while mascara dries. Expect that some mascara will come off (onto your finger) during this process. Build mascara to desired thickness and length repeating the &#x27;hold to curl&#x27; process. You don&#x27;t have to let it completely dry between coats, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the application either way.&lt;br /&gt;MY LASH REGROWTH STORY -- Through a 6 month botched &#x27;experiment&#x27; to enhance my look by using false strip lashes &amp; glue of various brands, most of my natural lashes fell out, and I became &#x27;addicted&#x27; to falsies since my lashes were gone. Had to go with no lashes to try to regrow - not a good look, but whatcha gonna do? I saw little results of regrowth until I started the daily routine I outlined above. Within 6 weeks my lashes were &#x27;normal&#x27;, and in 4 months I have as much length and volume as if I were wearing falsies, thanks in part to Rimmel&#x27;s Lash Accelerator Mascara. (And now at 6 months my lashes are over twice as thick and reach my eyebrows! I can still see new lashes continuing to grow in!) I hope they never discontinue this mascara, it&#x27;s great! Obviously I love love love makeup, been wearing makeup for 27 years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading this review, hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This mascara really does deliver amazing length. I am very pleased with my purchase for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- This mascara is incredibly black! I have naturally brown eye lashes, but when I only put mascara on one eye, then compared, my natural lashes appeared almost blonde in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;- This mascara is a very light weight solution. I have very straight hair, including my eye lashes. With ALL the other mascaras I have tried, even if I heat up the eye lash curler first, the mascara weighs my lashes down so much that they go back to being straight. This mascara is light enough that even my stubborn lashes were able to hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;- It is soooo easy to remove. When it really comes down to it, I don&#x27;t know any woman who isn&#x27;t going to fix their make-up after crying or getting caught in a rainstorm anyway, so waterproof mascara is not important to me, nor have I ever desired to be washing off my mascara for 10 minutes. This mascara is as easy to remove as it is to put on, and I love that!&lt;br /&gt;- It really does lengthen the appearance of your lashes. I have tried a lot of lengthening mascaras from all price ranges, and I truly was shocked at how well this mascara worked, even with only a single coat. It delivers length, just like it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as making your lashes grow longer, I am not sure yet. I just received my mascara today, and have only put it on and washed it off twice thus far. Eye lashes grow very slowly and typically only grow to a certain length, hence why you don&#x27;t have to trim them, so even if this mascara is able to chemically induce longer growth, I suspect it&#x27;ll take months to be noticeable. If I notice in 3 or 4 months that my lashes have actually grown longer, I will be sure to update this review.</li>
    <li> I love this as a mascara, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth, so I&#x27;m not sure how true those claims are.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lashes look any longer or fuller, but like I said, I do like it as a mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump up or make me have spider lashes.</li>
    <li> Like that this mascara stays on without flaking, yet also washes off easily with a face cloth &amp; water. So far I can&#x27;t tell if it encourages lash growth, though. I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I sometimes need to use waterproof mascara, depending on my activities.</li>
    <li> The product is so dry that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not even worth trying. I can&#x27;t really tell if you the product works or not because it was very difficult to apply. Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I can tell that my lashes are getting stronger and longer using this product.  It&#x27;s also at a very good price.</li>
