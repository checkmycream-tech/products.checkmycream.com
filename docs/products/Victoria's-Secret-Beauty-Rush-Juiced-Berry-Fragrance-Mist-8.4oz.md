      <li>The smell is pretty similar, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>

      <li>and I went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to buy more for her ..........</li>

    <li> It smells wonderful, definitely isn&#x27;t the exact Victoria secret spray that you&#x27;d have to shake up but it smell almost exactly like it, or it is exactly like it. I love it, so delicious. Reason for the 3 stars is because the bottle I received was broken. The spray cap wouldn&#x27;t spray, only drip down onto the bottle itself, but I did still love the smell. I got my money back and will be re purchasing in hopes for a non defective bottle. Fingers crossed!</li>
