      <li>You have to get used to the &#x27; teeth&#x27; - as they can scratch when you put this on, but it&#x27;s comfortable for</li>

      <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
      <li>These are a great alternative to tight headbands.</li>
      <li>so the hairbands with the rubber lining just slide right off.  </li>
      <li>Price was exceptional given that, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time, as I would not have ordered others at the same time from other sources.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast</li>

      <li>The first one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Yep, these are exactly what is described, three packs of three headbands.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a mess when it&#x27;s humid, and these are super great at holding my hair back off my face when I&#x27;m running or hiking.  </li>
      <li>I wear in the day when I want my hair out of my face and they are easy to sleep  in when you want to keep your hair back</li>

      <li>tried broke on me; and the rest stretch out way too fast.</li>
      <li>They streach out too much.</li>
      <li>They hold really well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I looked everywhere for one of these. Hadn&#x27;t seen it for years. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment love the classic headband :)</li>
    <li> I sew these combs inside the rims of my wigs.I cut them in half.one for,the other for bottom.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to keep her growing out bangs out of her face.  The product description is of a three pack, and 3 different colored combs are pictured.  However, what comes is a total of NINE combs -- three 3&#x3D;packs.  Price was exceptional given that, but it would have been nice to know that ahead of time, as I would not have ordered others at the same time from other sources.  I spoke to the company about this, and they said they would change the product description, but they have not.</li>
    <li> A great and easy way to get your \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; Scunci Comb Stretch.  A good price, excellent service.  I have been using these for years and then one day they were not to be found in the stores.  So ordered them and got enough to last years.  Highly recommend this seller.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I wear these during the summer. Keeps my hair off of my neck.</li>
    <li> Love these hair combs and they can be hard to find in stores now.  I have thick wavy hair that&#x27;s a mess when it&#x27;s humid, and these are super great at holding my hair back off my face when I&#x27;m running or hiking.  I also use them when my hair is wet and smooth my hair down for a work day look.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for - something to actually HOLD my hair back.  Unlike the TONS of hairbands on the market, this is the only product that actually stays in place for me.  I have thin, straight, slick hair - so the hairbands with the rubber lining just slide right off.  I tried the headbands with the mini teeth - those stayed longer, but fell off as well. Now these, these stay in place.  You have to get used to the &#x27; teeth&#x27; - as they can scratch when you put this on, but it&#x27;s comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM - gonna use them for my sports... and when I wash my face, etc,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon.  Can not find them in stores anymore.  I also like that they come in 3 packs of 3 combs.  I go through them quickly as I have very thick hair and stretch them out easily.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the reviews here because I was familiar with the product already.. oops! Like someone else said in an older review, \\&quot;3-pack\\&quot; means three packs of three combs each. I think I&#x27;m set for a few years. Other than that surprise (which, true, made the price all the better), everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> I cannot use these! I have thin hair and it just slides right off! Other than that it is exactly what I ordered, so I cannot complain about that.</li>
    <li> I use to love these headbands but haven&#x27;t been able to find them in years. So I was very happy when I came across these. They are perfect for when you are having a bad hair day or just want to get the hair out of your face. Shipping was super fast and I was given a few extra in my package so I&#x27;m one happy girl! I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
    <li> I wear in the day when I want my hair out of my face and they are easy to sleep  in when you want to keep your hair back</li>
    <li> Yep, these are exactly what is described, three packs of three headbands. Others said they break, but I&#x27;ve always &#x27;warmed&#x27; them up before using. Ie: stretch them out in your hands before putting on. Helps relax the plastic I think. These works perfectly for my short, but growing out hair. Love them. So glad to have this many multi pack.</li>
    <li> I remember these from middle school and I thought it would work perfect for my hair.  I chopped it all off and donated it, and it is just long enough for apony tail, but the little flyaways drive crazy... These last for one wear only.  They streach out too much.</li>
    <li> I have used these since I was in grade school but found them unavailable in our local stores. I work in a deli and needed a way to keep my hair contained but don&#x27;t like to pull my hair tight these are perfect for that.</li>
    <li> worked for what I needed</li>
    <li> I started buying these in the stores over 20 years ago; and I loved them. I like these too; but the&lt;br /&gt;quality is not the same. I rated them the way I did because they are pretty close. The first one&lt;br /&gt;I tried broke on me; and the rest stretch out way too fast. But, this is the only place I can&lt;br /&gt;buy these; since they are not in the stores anymore. If I ever need more I will buy them from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon again. I like the products here; and will continue to use Amazon in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love these and haven&#x27;t been able to find them again.  I didn&#x27;t realize the three pack meant 3 packs of three!  Very happy, this is awesome.  My hair is thinning because of medications and these make my hair look full, without a lot of time and hair products.</li>
    <li> They get caught up in my hair too easily.  Difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Quality is equal with the price. I am satisfied with this product. Yay yay!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> These are great to get your hair off your neck. They hold really well and if you have fine hair you can cut them to make them smaller .</li>
    <li> Anyone with long hair should give this a try.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic, poorly constructed.  Upon opening, one immediately broke, one was missing the clasp and one provided one day of wear.</li>
    <li> Useful, very hard to find item nowadays.</li>
    <li> Use to wear these back in the 90&#x27;s. Order these. Haven&#x27;t had any break. I do have a fairly small head. Pretty flexible. I do take care when taking them on and off. Decent price.</li>
    <li> Really cute and what a great bargain!  I used pencil curls to do my daugher&#x27;s hair (check pinterest for ideas), and then pulled it back with this for her to be a flower girl.  So cute!</li>
    <li> I had looked everywhere for these but couldn&#x27;t find them. Remembered them from when I was a kid. Really helps to hold short hair out of your face when regular headbands just slide off.</li>
    <li> These are so hard to find in the stores. They work well and i am glad i bought two packs.</li>
    <li> I hope Scunci never stops making these combs. Because of this product I can style my short, slowly growing hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually never passionate about products, but I am about these combs.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have these since they are now hard to find in stores. These are a great alternative to tight headbands.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping my daughter&#x27;s bangs out of her face.</li>
    <li> For the price these were awesome! I received 3 sets of 3 and I handed some over to my sisters and I carry a few in my handbag just in case. They are durable and versatile and the basic colours suit anything!</li>
