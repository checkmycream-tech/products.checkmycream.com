<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had zits and naturally dry skin - it&#x27;s a lovely combination that never gets talked about. If you have zits you have oily skin right? Wrong. Anyhow, I needed to find a moisturizer that would quench my dry skin without clogging up my pores and exacerbating the zits. Enter Acure. This cream (together with the rest of the line) has been a godsend - nurturing my skin into clarity and balance. No more acne and no more dry scaly skin. The fact that the ingredients are organic, food grade, pronounceable and avoid all those nasty chemicals that accumulate in your body AND that these products are highly affordable.... I&#x27;m now an Acure girl for life!</li>
    <li> My skin reacts to everything but likes this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to say much. It&#x27;s ACURE, and acure has became one of my favorites brands. Never dissapointed me. The Oil Control Facial Moisturizer leves your skin toughly soft, moisturized withaout any greasy feeling. My only complaint is that the package is so small, but you just need a little for your face and neck, so i think the bottle will last. Try it and go for other Acure products, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this line of organic skin care products. This is great for when my skin has break outs, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> i have excessively oily skin. without an oil control product, after just an hour or two my makeup will start to slide off. plus, it looks gross. i previously used both Dr. Brant and Murad primer&#x27;s before which worked well until I move to LA. since, i&#x27;ve spent a great deal of money trying new products and nothing has worked except for this. what&#x27;s great is you just need a very small amount each time you use it. and it&#x27;s about half the price of what i was buying before!</li>
    <li> Best oil control moisturizer every!</li>
    <li> Really sad that this moisturizer didn&#x27;t work out with my skin. I&#x27;m a fan of other Acure products and have been recently battling a new onset of hormonal acne. Bought this to help control the oil and breakouts. I liked it initially, but after 3 weeks or so I started to notice that this product was actually clogging my pores. Started getting lots of little bumps all over. Also, its on the thicker side and doesn&#x27;t spread very easily. Otherwise, the smell is nice and so are the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This made me break out. Little red bumps.</li>
    <li> Most \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; or \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; lotions are actually a little drying. This one is still creamy and moisturizing. Love the ingredients and the company!&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second bottle. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, i have recommended it to others. no residue and works great</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I have very problematic acne prone skin and this stuff works great for me. I haven tried so many moisturizers. Normally, I break out anytime I use a moisturizer. Not with this stuff though. It gives just the right amount of moisture and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion. I live in desert and have oily skin. I mix it with my liquid zinc oxide based sunscreen and it works well for me!</li>
    <li> Update: I have bought this product from the same seller multiple times. The last time the seller sent the wrong Acure product. They sent Acure Sensitive Facial Cream for dry skin instead of Acure Oil Control Facial Moisturizer for oily/acne prone skin. The packaging is very similar - easy mistake to make. I plan to keep what they sent and reorder what I need because I like the Acure line. If you order this double check it before you use it and make sure you&#x27;ve received the right product for your skin.  Repeat purchase - I love this moisturizer. It has a light minty/herbal scent and can be thinned easily with water for a lighter moisturizer during the summer. Although, full strength is probably recommended for the oil control. I like the fact that it moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy - it has a natural skin or satin finish. Their eye cream is great as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very light but very effective. Adds moisture without being greasy and does not clog pores.</li>
    <li> I found Acure organics when Birchbox delivered some free samples including an organic cleanser. I searched this product line and discover this amazing moisturizer with a lot of organic ingredients that are beneficial to skin/face. So far, I&#x27;ve added this moisturizer to my skincare routine to keep my hormonal breakouts at bay. Aside from regular facial spa and at home skin care routine, I haven&#x27;t any huge pimple breakouts each time of month. very promising skincare product at affordable price. I&#x27;m an organic skin care freak, and loving it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I&#x27;m 42 with combination acne-prone skin.  My T-zone is an oil slick!  I have tried other moisturizers that were supposed to control oil and they either don&#x27;t work or feel really dry and flaky on the skin, which makes it hard to put primer and/or makeup on.  This moisturizer has a nice pleasant scent, is moisturizing to my drier parts and does a fine job of controlling oil in the oily parts.  The fact that is has acne-fighting ingredients and anti-aging properties is icing on the cake for me!  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> So far this cream is great for my oily skin. I enjoy the silky feel it has when gliding onto my face (especially since I sometimes have delicate and painful areas). So far no complaints besides the smell that is just something that I will have get use to.</li>
    <li> Pros: it is healthier than regular mositurizers&lt;br /&gt;it does help my skin to feel less dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I think it might give me more black heads but that could also be bc I eat so much junk food :((((</li>
    <li> I bought the lilac cleanser and loved it so I decided to try the matching cream moisturizer. Unfortunately, I am not a fan. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it has made my breakouts worst. When I STOP using it for a few days I see a positive change in skin. As soon as I begin again the break outs are back. So NAY for this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and I really don&#x27;t think I like this moisturizer. First, my face feels pretty dry and tight after application. Second, I was hoping i would see some decrease in breakouts based on the description but I don&#x27;t see any change at all. I know sometimes it takes a while of continued use to see some real change, but I&#x27;ve been through almost the entire tube at this point. Considering the hefty price tag, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again. For reference, I have combination skin (slightly oily nose, forehead, dry everywhere else and prone to acne).</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne-prone skin and am continuously searching for non-toxic, natural beauty products (I scan everything by EWG Skin Deep religiously). I love ACURE&#x27;s Lemongrass shampoo and conditioner as well as their facial cleaners. Their ingredients are spot-on. Unfortunately this moisturizer did not offer any oil control. In fact, it seemed to make matters worse. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I would recommend this to someone who has the occasional dry patch since my face seems to be an oil-slick regardless of what I do :P</li>
    <li> EDITED REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I have started an acne regime that includes sulfur and BP. Since this really drying I only use this on my T zone for day use. I don&#x27;t seem to find any acne spots, and my skin isn&#x27;t irritated by it anymore. So YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I only gave a 2 star because this product caused acne, dried me out, and made my skin very sensitive to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone somewhat sensitive skin, I bought this product because I really like there eye cream and have heard other wonderful reviews about their moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me (acne prone, senstive, combo skin) then be cautious while buying, and don&#x27;t use a ton of new products along with it.</li>
    <li> This product works so well - it has a fresh lemony scent, and lathers nicely. I do feel like it does a great job cleaning my skin - I have had no issues with residual makeup and it is gentle enough to remove eye makeup too! it is all organic, which I also love and the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> This cream can feel very heavy but all you need is a little bit and it absorbs so nicely! Every time it goes on I feel like it is a drink of water for my skin I&#x27;m only a 21 year old male but this stuff has helped call my shaving irritation because I feel as though it almost has a cooling effect, I notice a half hour later my skin still feels cool and light love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful, and daily use has helped my oily skin. It is not greasy, I love this product</li>
    <li> My new fave day cream. I don&#x27;t get that \\&quot;oily midday shine\\&quot; since I&#x27;ve started using it. Acure seems to be a great line.</li>
    <li> I have mature, sensitive skin which can also be oily.  It has been difficult to find just the right moisturizer, until now.  I love this product because it&#x27;s derived naturally and does what it says, controls oil.  Highly recommend it for those with skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer to replace the Estee Lauder lotion that I was using which was discontinued recently.  And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer.  This cream is great! It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream. Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all. My face feels healthy and nourished with each use and for a 1/3 of the cost too! My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews. But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product. I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try. It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have found that \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; usually meant alcohol was a major ingredient. But alcohol is so drying for my skin  that it would leave my face red and irritated.  Not this stuff. It doesnt contain alcohol and seems to be completely natural. I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle. Instructions say use it at least twice a day but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
    <li> This is a thick and luxurious face moisturizer which provides a slightly matte finish. Smells and feels great, and moisturizes well. I didn&#x27;t notice it cause additional acne breakouts. I don&#x27;t know what the stem cells do but it sounds good. I ran out and am using another products that I don&#x27;t like as much. I will buy this again soon.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer supreme. :) Not too greasy and absorbs very well.. And the smell is quite pleasant. I&#x27;m in love. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about a week. The lotion is very lightweight , The smell is a bit too natural for me , But it seems to control my oily spots and keep my breakouts less.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t much for me as far as oil control, I find that I still get shiny pretty quickly after applying it but it is light enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying it to my chin and breaking out the next day like it happens with the Acure day cream for normal skin. I also found that it provides enough hydration to the rest of my face, doesn&#x27;t make it feel too dry or too greasy, just a good balance.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels nice on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, though I can&#x27;t vouch for its oil controlling properties. I have pretty oily skin and within ten or twenty minutes of washing my face and applying this lotion (which feels light going on), my skin begins to visibly secrete just as much oil as it always does.</li>
    <li> Love Acure shampoo and conditioner (our most preferred brand), but this just didn&#x27;t work as well as we had hoped. It&#x27;s ok and maybe it will work better for you. You won&#x27;t find better ingredients anywhere, as Acure is just the best.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using my old moisturizer again.  I started using Acure and my acne cleared up.  (I was also using a derma roller to help it clear up.)  I used my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; moisturizer that I keep in my duffel bag when I went camping, and I came home with a faceful of zits.  I resumed using Acure (along with derma rolling my face) and my acne has again disappeared.  This is a winner.</li>
    <li> This product is only effective if used in conjunction with the face washes that Acure offers.&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e used a few of their products so far for about 3 weeks and the products seem to work best together to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same PH levels or something, IDK but I&#x27;ll be using their face washes for a while. This particular product I&#x27;m still weighing in on, so can&#x27;t say I love it. But their green scrub and sensitive care face wash and lotion is AMAZING for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Before using this moisturizer my skin was very irritated and acne prone.  I thought I had rosacea on my cheeks and was becoming very self conscious because people kept telling me I was red or sunburned.  I was using Oil of Olay oil free moisturizer at the time.  When I started using this moisturizer the redness faded within a matter of days.  My bumps have become less visible and are mostly on my forehead-the stubborn flat bumps.  My skin still gets oily over time, especially after wearing it at night before bed.  I wear this under makeup and it works really well.  It has a pleasant scent.  I do wish the bottle would be bigger.  For the price it isn&#x27;t very much and it&#x27;s pretty thick so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  It is the best I&#x27;ve used and actually improved my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial oil control moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it so much that I have two bottles waiting. I was a bit reluctant to buy it coz of the price but it is so worth it. It is better than more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love my Oil Control Facial Moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, and gives my face a natural radiant look.  There is no oily residue like other moisturizers. This is by far my favorite face cream. I also like the fact that this product is vegan, and paraben and sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I love the purity of this product. The whole line is very well rated on EWG&#x27;s site as well so I can feel good about it. This product really does control the oil. I have always suffered from such greasy looking skin and always have a permanently shiny face. I use a light oil blend with this on top and I have no shine! Just a beautiful matte finish for at least 10hrs or so. So happy to finally love my face again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week and like it a lot. I have a classic t-zone face, oily nose, forehead, dry cheeks.  I was looking for a moisturizer that would not make my make up slideoff by midday and so far this cream helps with that a lot.  Most oil controlling creams are gel-like serums but this is an actual cream which I prefer.  My face is noticeably less shiny and my make up is staying on better so I&#x27;m not having to dab my face during the day.  For the price, it&#x27;s doing a better job than Dr Perricone and Clinique oil control creams.  A great find without all the chemicals.  I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> This lotion made me break out in white heads and pimples...sad because I was hoping, with the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; earth friendly ingredients it would clear my skin, but no luck. It does smell nice and I felt it had good application, my skin soaked it up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> first of all this product comes in a small 1 oz tub which is like a sample size to me for the price of the product. I had such high hopes for this product but it failed me. I thought because it has natural ingredients it will work for my skin but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it at all. I have tried this product a couple of different times just to be sure it was the product and I get breakouts every time I use it. but I do like Acure sensitive skin face wash and their argan oil.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels and smells.  I like the pump; 2 pumps does my whole face. I will try other products By Acure because of the excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! My skin soaks it in immediately without feeling greasy. I would reccommend this product to anyone with combination/oily skin, and it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> This is a light day cream that definitely helps control oil. I wear it under my foundation. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough for me.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and clean, no artificial scents. Makes my skin feel refreshed. Moisturizing without feeling wet, dries within a minute.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t know about the healing blemishes part. Maybe I&#x27;m just too blemished.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product practically disappears into your skin, leaving an almost matte finish and feel. I love the way it smells and the way my face feels after I&#x27;ve put the moisturizer on: soft. I use about a pump and a half and that&#x27;s all I need to cover my face and much of my neck. I follow this up with the Devita&#x27;s moisturizer with sunscreen since sun protection is vitally important to caring for one&#x27;s skin. By late morning or mid-day, my face feels oily again (and, honestly, that could be due to the sunscreen) but I then give it a pat down with Urban Decay&#x27;s De-Slick Powder and I&#x27;m back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say this, since I&#x27;ve switched to all natural and organic skin care products--Acure Organics, Devita, Yes to Tomatoes, and Desert Essence--I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments from friends on how lovely my skin looks. Of course drinking water, eating right, and exercise are key too, but one can&#x27;t go wrong with Acure and with this moisturizer in particular. It feels and smells great going on and is loaded with good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ll add is that I believe I go through a bottle of moisturizer about every 1.5 to 2 months or so. The pump stops pumping out product before the bottle is actually empty but, when that happens, one can simply unscrew the top and then tap the opening of the bottle onto the palm of the hand to get the remaining product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the excellent ingredients, and the way it makes my skin look and feel, this moisturizer deserves every one of these 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using a few of the Acure products for two weeks now and love them all. I have VERY oily skin. I was skeptical about this moisturizer and have been pleasantly surprised by the results. It feels and smells nice. Absorbs well. I have experienced no breakouts after using this. My skin seems less oily and appears more healthy. This is a keeper. The Acure eye cream is amazing!!! The cleaser has also been really good. The cleaser is nice as it does not over clease like many products. Can&#x27;t wait to try more Acure products.</li>
    <li> I actually use this at night. It&#x27;s a very thick cream, but it absorbs really well and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. You don&#x27;t need much….a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling so so soft. A light feeling moisturizer that does it&#x27;s job. My new favorite. Love it</li>
    <li> Keeps skin moist and comfortable while reducing oily shine.</li>
    <li> Move acures products but I think this one made my combo skin oiler. It does feel light but a tad bit greasy.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  I keep seeking to feel the standard oily moisturizer and it is not.  It feels nice and has a pleasant smell.  Looking for the other results such as less acne and oily skin. I believe that it will work.</li>
    <li> moisturizes but wasn&#x27;t anything special for me</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this product for acne prone skin. This is definitely not good for acne prone skin. This product clogs your pores to the point that little white spots will appear all over your face, and any pimples that are already present will not heal because they&#x27;re so clogged. I used this product and my skin broke out worse than it ever has in my life. I absolutely hate this product, complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel super soft</li>
    <li> There has been so much hype about argan oil, but unfortunately this just doesn&#x27;t work for my face.  The oil control factor was short-lived and the texture didn&#x27;t work at all for using under mineral makeup.  This cream very quickly caused whiteheads and left my skin blotchy and bumpy.  However, I love this brand&#x27;s pure argan oil as a body moisturizer (a few drops go a long way).</li>
    <li> this cream works well and is especially suited to work all day to counteract oily skin. Perfect for teens alike.</li>
