    <li> I usually love infusium products... but this one made my hair a little hard when air dried</li>
    <li> It thickens my hair and leaves nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have curly revelious  hair.... this product make it soft and shiny. ... my hair loves it..</li>
    <li> I was a little careful about this product until my stylist said its ingredients were OK. For those of us who were born with bad hair, it&#x27;s amazingly light. It&#x27;s very thin, so it&#x27;s hard to control how much you use if you just pour into your hand. Most useful if you put it in a spray bottle; just spray a little on (with a small spray bottle, it was only four or five \\&quot;spritzes\\&quot;)and massage it through your hair. That little bit instantly clears tangles without leaving any residue on your hair. No glop to stick the hairs together or risk it breaking when you try to separate them apart. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was that I haven&#x27;t used it often enough to make sure it&#x27;s not drying my hair out. Have been using it when I really need a good hair day, as opposed to ordinary day, but it&#x27;s got real promise. (Am also using Rusk Thick spray-on volumizer to give my hair body after it&#x27;s dry and before styling. Check that out!)</li>

The resulting set whether I air dry or blow dry, lasts longer, is fuller, bouncier and shinier, too.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I was debating between original and volumizing formulas.  I chose the volumizing.  I still like the original best.</li>
    <li> meets expectations. great buy. Larger size not usually available in stores. Excellent damage control conditionerave used infusium products for many .</li>

    <li> Fabulous for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I used to use this as a kid.  I was sitting behind a woman at a conference with the shiniest hair.  She told me this was what she used, so I went looking for it.  Couldn&#x27;t find in stores.  Makes my hair super soft and shiny, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have to order 2.. because I use one on my horses too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice/see any difference in my hair, however, it could also be because my hair was also under stress from doing a home perm.  If I see a change in future uses, I will update this rating.</li>
    <li> It just takes a very little to untangle hair. Unlike other conditioners, there is no oily residue. My hair when dried is fluffy and nicely conditioned. I highly recommend.</li>
