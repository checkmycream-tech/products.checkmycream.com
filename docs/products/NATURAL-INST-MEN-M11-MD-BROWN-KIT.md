<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When the package arrived the outside shipping package was in tact but inside the product was torn apart and everywhere. Also one of the bottles had a hole in it and was leaking all over. I&#x27;ll likely never get that stain off of my counter.</li>
    <li> The color level is satisfactory, but some other factors weigh against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves were too small for my hands.  One hand too easily split the glove open.  My hands are not unusually large.  The gloves that accompany other haircoloring packages are satisfactorily extra large to fit all hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color system takes longer to develope, 10 to 20 minutes depending on needs.  It might be a better prodeuct for persons with an allergic reaction to other hair coloring products, but it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to me.</li>
    <li> About to pick this up I hope it doesn&#x27;t leave a redish copper tone like Just for me</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, and it really makes his hair look great--not fake at all.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for quite awhile and he loves it.  It is easy to apply and quick (he only has to wait 10 minutes) and it gives his hair color a boost.  We both like the fact that it is natural product and of course, the color looks great on him.  And it does last about 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> The application instructions are not as simple as Just For Men.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Does ok at first, never lasts long enough, they all seem like this though.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product ten years ago and liked it. Over the years it has become very difficult to find in any store, even the ones Clairol says sell it. Walgreen&#x27;s sells it on-line for $6/each if you buy two or more with free shipping for a $25 purchaase. I get 4-6 weeks of color from one treatment. I have tried other brands when this product was unavailable but they do not last more than three weeks for me and splatter a lot during application.  Hair color will stain anything it touches, unless removed immediately, so careful application is essential. This product also provides a tube of hair conditioner that is very useful and lasts more than the time between applications of hair color. The latex-free gloves are good, stay put on the hands during application and are great for wrapping the applicator bottle for disposal, so residual color doesn&#x27;t get anything else. I find that leaving the color on the hair for about 10-15 minutes givess me an additional week between applications.  Too bad the product is not available in stores any more, but as long as Walgreen&#x27;s or Amazon vendors have it, I&#x27;ll stay with it.</li>
    <li> perfect and easy hair color for men with early gray hair</li>
    <li> The gloves are useless.  Too small and tear easily.  What happened to the good ones they used to give you?</li>
    <li> I really think this hair coloring is excellent....very easy to use-just pour one bottle of liquid into another, shake and rub into your hair....wait 10 minutes and rinse, but don&#x27;t shampoo.But pay attention to the timing-the time the hair coloring is in your hair prior to rinsing!  I had an experience similar to another reviewer-I have a lot of gray hair, so I left the coloring in for longer-15 minutes-as per the instructions.  Wow!-my hair was very, very dark....next time I&#x27;ll try more like 8 minutes.  I did the allergy test-btw, it colors your arm a dark brown and you can&#x27;t wash it for 48 hours, so pick a place that isn&#x27;t obvious...I put it on my forearm because I figured I could monitor it more easily there-yes I could-I could see a large dark-brown circular spot on  my arm.  It was embarrassing-might as well have said, \\&quot;hey world!-I&#x27;m trying out coloring my hair!\\&quot;.  No reaction to the coloring agent, however.  Very good product-the color looks natural and has lasted two months so far , becoming more the brown color I wanted initially.</li>
    <li> i just love it and i will always purchase the same products for my personal use.i cant live without it</li>
    <li> Great hair color, covered all my white hair. Better than just for men</li>
    <li> Love the product but the delivery was not so good came in a soft back the boxes were crushed all the bottles were out od the boxes but did not come open was surprised about that  soft pack not a good idea last time they came in a box no problem.</li>
    <li> Great product  easy application with great results</li>
    <li> Good, can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Works great, and easy to apply. Actually, more then enough inside the package to color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Few more minutes staying on your hair before shampooing, gives a better color.&lt;br /&gt;For sure, thickens your hair. Suggest using the clairol natural instincts after one day getting a haircut.</li>
    <li> Does the job &amp; better than the rest. Last a long time also.</li>
    <li> too complicated - Just for Men seems easier to use</li>
    <li> Covered gray well.Darker than med brown. Works better than the womens product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  You hair color looks natural and lasts.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, way better and longer lasting then JFM but watch out as its messy and will stain bathroom vanity&#x27;s etc...</li>
    <li> Good quick color.  Easy to apply.  Low cost.  Color turns out the way you want.  Have purchased many times over years.</li>
    <li> I put this formula in my hair on a Friday night as I was taking my wife out for a evening out and slow dance (it was our anniversary}.  Before I took her out, I bought this kit and I was really kinda scared that I would funny or my wife would laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really comfortable walking out of the shower and combing my hair.  I wasn&#x27;t grey, also, I wasn&#x27;t dark-brown again...I just got back a few more years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife complimented me a number of times...but, I didn&#x27;t know if she was just being sweet.  I went to work the next Monday and a couple of girls in the office asked what did on the weekend.  I told them that my wife and I had an anniversary and I felt really refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody suspected a thing because it&#x27;s a really mild color change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I will continue to use it every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helps you in any way, Please hit the \\&quot;YES\\&quot; button bellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I wish you the Best.,&lt;br /&gt;RLM</li>
