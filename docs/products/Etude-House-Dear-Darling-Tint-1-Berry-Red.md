### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve found works the best is pairing it with a lip liner.</li>
      <li>The best tint I have!</li>
      <li>so you can apply it perfectly on you lips.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so impressed!</li>
      <li>That said, I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the color.  </li>
      <li>Great price and great stain!</li>
      <li>It was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>Good product, I should have gotten another color.</li>
      <li>Has a nice flavor, stays fairly well.</li>
      <li>Love this lip stain!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>is amazing.</li>
      <li>It also have this nice cherry scent to it</li>
      <li>I really do love the color of the product though: it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>This is a great substitute for the original Benetint - just a hint cooler.  </li>
      <li>It was very easy to apply but would recommend wiping excess off on a tissue before you apply to your lips.  </li>
      <li>I found that applying the smallest bit of product on the lips and working up from that most effective, though not efficient.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s a jelly based tint it does wear better than a water based one, and once it dries there&#x27;s no smudging or moving around.</li>
      <li>than more stains.</li>
      <li>I love the color of the tint.</li>
      <li>I would buy this again if I had more options on color.</li>
      <li>I was a lovely color, just too dark/bright for my coloration.  </li>
      <li>MY DAUGHTER LOVE IT,,,NICE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>ok i bought it</li>
      <li>I will be buying more colors...</li>
      <li>so if you do accidentally taste it, its not nasty tasting.</li>
      <li>it was a cheaper alternative to my lost original stain, but i am now loving this one even more.</li>
      <li>very pretty and build able, nice smell and taste as well.</li>
      <li>i might say that it is a lot better than the Fresy Cherry Tint one &amp;#60;# &amp;#60;#### great deal;) they gave me whole heaps of sample, and even wrote me a letter!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t this cheap when I bought it or I might have suspected the quality was sub-par.</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous and it does not dry out my lips.</li>
      <li>Easier to apply to cheeks because it doesn&#x27;t sink in so quickly.  </li>
      <li>My very first lip tint</li>
      <li>Goes on super smooth, it feels light and looks super natural</li>
      <li>Berry red is more of a hot pinkish color, but can be more subdued if you layer it a bit.</li>
      <li>The product is like jelly and the shipping package was super nice with a box, bubble wrap, a few samples, and a cute thank</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into to the lip like a stain.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for a matt stain which gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>The texture is light and not too sticky with a pleasant fruity smell that was not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I really do recommend this lip tint for people are new to lip products or makeup because it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
      <li>Is really light more then I expected...</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s almost the same color, and I used that underneath, and the color that produces when you top it off with this tint is spectacular!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love Etude House lip stain......cheaper than the big names and works just as well..</li>
      <li>I personally prefer stains that have the felt tip (like a Magic Marker) type of applicator.  </li>
      <li>This is my first lip tint</li>
      <li>Its a gorgeous cherry pink color, but if i i close my lips it goes away and just turns a light pink color</li>
      <li>One thing to keep in mind is, that tints can dry out lips, and this one is no exception, so make sure you moisturize well before</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color, and even when it wears off (which it does a lot, the only con there is) it leaves a little bit of coloring, the brush is what really impressed me, it&#x27;s almost at an angle</li>
      <li>The doe foot applicator has a nice medium size, it&#x27;s not too big, or too small, application is pretty easy with it.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t not dry out my lips as unlike most stains it had a very slight oily feel which provided more &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The product itself was just as i expected: cute and works well.</li>
      <li>hahaha.</li>
      <li>It was better when I opened the box and saw how carefully everything was wrapped along with some samples.</li>
      <li>The product is very gel like and a lot of product is on the wand.</li>
      <li>how much color you want on your lips.</li>
      <li>Those doe tip applicators provide too much product IMO.  </li>
      <li>It disappeared from my top lip completely within an hour, leaving my lips two widely different colors.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you will get more stain than you can deal with in the short time you have to properly apply a stain.  </li>
      <li>Color lasted for a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>I love the applicator on this, it reminds me of my much more expensive YSL gloss.</li>
      <li>Its just very natural.</li>
      <li>For those who like natural makeup, I highly suggest you to use lip tints.  </li>
      <li>The tint has a dark, berry red color in the tube, but turns more into a vibrant pinkish red on the lips.</li>
      <li>The Dear Darling Tint comes in a clear plastic tube, which is lightweight, but sturdy, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being swirled around in your bag.</li>
      <li>Gives me a soft looks</li>
      <li>When I applied it it looked like an old person with marks or watercolor type.</li>
      <li>The color is a bit paler than expected and the consistency is very wet, more like a gloss than a stain.  </li>
      <li>and it last pretty long.</li>
      <li>and after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside could be, that it has a very floral scent, but it&#x27;s only detectable when you open the tube, on the lips the fragrance disappears within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The color is a nice touch for a casual day.</li>
      <li>More of a subtle lip stain that stays all day long.</li>
      <li>You can put a little on for a subtle pink/red look or you can layer it on for a much more vibrant color.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something a little more natural and subtle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best tint I have! Goes on super smooth, it feels light and looks super natural</li>
    <li> Has a nice flavor, stays fairly well.</li>
    <li> Doen&#x27;t stick at all, does not change the pigment of you skin. Once you put it on any evidence of the product is gone in moments. Not something I want in a lip color/stain</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE IT,,,NICE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Thick jelly-like consistency (if i spell it right?), SO blend-able, tinted a lot but doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. GEEZ. i might say that it is a lot better than the Fresy Cherry Tint one &amp;#60;# &amp;#60;#### great deal;) they gave me whole heaps of sample, and even wrote me a letter! &amp;#60;### so wroth it waitinggg~~</li>
    <li> took a long time&lt;br /&gt;This product dried my lips out. My boyfriend did not like the smell and the look. When I applied it it looked like an old person with marks or watercolor type. YUCK! never ever buy this</li>
    <li> This is the worst tint I&#x27;ve tried. It disappeared from my top lip completely within an hour, leaving my lips two widely different colors. To balance them out, I licked my bottom lip and wiped and all the color came off. This is supposed to be difficult to remove. it never sunk in properly and left a sticky feeling behind. The color berry was just red. No tinge of berry whatsoever. It wasn&#x27;t this cheap when I bought it or I might have suspected the quality was sub-par. it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I love the applicator on this, it reminds me of my much more expensive YSL gloss. The texture is light and not too sticky with a pleasant fruity smell that was not overwhelming.  It isn&#x27;t a hard-core stain and would wear off after a couple of hours.  That said, I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the color.  It was bright pink on me and seemed to be very artificial.  The color reminded me of something that would come in a kid&#x27;s princesses play make-up kit. blurg!  I was hoping for something a little more natural and subtle.  I would buy this again if I had more options on color.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s so hard to find affordable and quality lip stains in the US (even some of the more expensive brands leave something to be desired). So I took a chance on Etude House and I don&#x27;t regret it. Great price and great stain! You can put a little on for a subtle pink/red look or you can layer it on for a much more vibrant color. I also put it on underneath lipstick to help cover the fact that my lipstick inevitably wears away. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Its a gorgeous cherry pink color, but if i i close my lips it goes away and just turns a light pink color so i have to re-apply every hour. and it tastes somewhat yummy so if you do accidentally taste it, its not nasty tasting.</li>
    <li> This is my first lip tint and I&#x27;m so impressed! It&#x27;s such a pretty color, and even when it wears off (which it does a lot, the only con there is) it leaves a little bit of coloring, the brush is what really impressed me, it&#x27;s almost at an angle so you can apply it perfectly on you lips. The product is like jelly and the shipping package was super nice with a box, bubble wrap, a few samples, and a cute thank you note with contact information in case something is wrong. I really do recommend this lip tint for people are new to lip products or makeup because it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is a great substitute for the original Benetint - just a hint cooler.  Easier to apply to cheeks because it doesn&#x27;t sink in so quickly.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Omg the seller sent the lip tint in about 3 weeks before the actual delivery time. It was a pleasant surprise. It was better when I opened the box and saw how carefully everything was wrapped along with some samples. The product itself was just as i expected: cute and works well. The color is a nice touch for a casual day. Thank you!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! There is not lip stain quite like it. Berry red is more of a hot pinkish color, but can be more subdued if you layer it a bit. Make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing if you use this stuff though, it will dry out your lips pretty badly.</li>
    <li> very pretty and build able, nice smell and taste as well.</li>
    <li> Love Etude House lip stain......cheaper than the big names and works just as well..</li>
    <li> Love this lip stain!  Its not an overpowering color either. More of a subtle lip stain that stays all day long. I layered on a simple gloss.</li>
    <li> This tint is definitely a lot less pigmented than I thought! Though that might&#x27;ve been my fault, since tints usually tend to be on the lighter side. However, you can darken it up with two or three coats! What I&#x27;ve found works the best is pairing it with a lip liner. I have a lip liner from etude that&#x27;s almost the same color, and I used that underneath, and the color that produces when you top it off with this tint is spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this tint is so delicious and fruity, but the taste is frankly horrible. I really do love the color of the product though: it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This was darker than I expected so I have given this to a friend.  I was a lovely color, just too dark/bright for my coloration.  The color was a blue-based dark pink versus orange-based pink which is exactly what I was looking to buy.  It was very easy to apply but would recommend wiping excess off on a tissue before you apply to your lips.  Otherwise you will get more stain than you can deal with in the short time you have to properly apply a stain.  I found the stain lasted about 3 hours but then wore off.  About average for stains in my experience.  I personally prefer stains that have the felt tip (like a Magic Marker) type of applicator.  Those doe tip applicators provide too much product IMO.  It didn&#x27;t not dry out my lips as unlike most stains it had a very slight oily feel which provided more &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; than more stains.</li>
    <li> The Dear Darling Tint comes in a clear plastic tube, which is lightweight, but sturdy, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being swirled around in your bag. The doe foot applicator has a nice medium size, it&#x27;s not too big, or too small, application is pretty easy with it. The tint has a dark, berry red color in the tube, but turns more into a vibrant pinkish red on the lips. The color is buildable, so it&#x27;s up to you how much color you want on your lips. Since it&#x27;s a jelly based tint it does wear better than a water based one, and once it dries there&#x27;s no smudging or moving around. One thing to keep in mind is, that tints can dry out lips, and this one is no exception, so make sure you moisturize well before and after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside could be, that it has a very floral scent, but it&#x27;s only detectable when you open the tube, on the lips the fragrance disappears within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this tint, because I can wear a brighter lip color, without going overboard with it.</li>
    <li> Is really light more then I expected... Gives me a soft looks</li>
    <li> WOULD LIKE IT IF THE STAIN LASTED LONGER</li>
    <li> My very first lip tint and I love it. I will be buying more colors...The color is gorgeous and it does not dry out my lips. It also have this nice cherry scent to it and it last pretty long. Lips tint are suppose to be water down a little just enough to create a little hint of color to your lips(if you apply only a little). For lip tint, you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot like lipstick and it&#x27;s not sticky. Its not glossy like lip gloss either...hahaha. Its just very natural. For those who like natural makeup, I highly suggest you to use lip tints.  (;</li>
    <li> ok i bought it bc it was a cheaper alternative to my lost original stain, but i am now loving this one even more. it works like a stain probably should, a little tricky to apply evenly, and dries + itches my stupidly sensitive skin but i do not even care bc the smell. is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the tint. A couple reviews mentioned it dried the lips, which never occurred for me. What I did find difficult was the application of the tint. The product is very gel like and a lot of product is on the wand. When applied, it results in uneven color and way too much product on the lips. I found that applying the smallest bit of product on the lips and working up from that most effective, though not efficient. Color lasted for a decent amount of time. I did notice the medicinal smell and taste but it was temporary.</li>
    <li> The color is a bit paler than expected and the consistency is very wet, more like a gloss than a stain.  Doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into to the lip like a stain.  It also has an odd flavor but I don&#x27;t know how to describe the taste.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for a matt stain which gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, I should have gotten another color.</li>
</ol>
