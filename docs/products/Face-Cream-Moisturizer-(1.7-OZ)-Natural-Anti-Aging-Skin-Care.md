<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a mineral oil allergy, so all of my skin care products must be completely free of petroleum/mineral oils. Most creams and lotions I can use are outrageously expensive or just don&#x27;t work. This cream is very affordable and is wonderful for my skin. And the subtle fragrance is really pretty. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this face cream!  Super light and not at all greasy.  Noticed my skin feels smoother and even looks more even.  Very nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Love this cream!</li>
    <li> I have used half bottle so far, and do feel my skin is smoother, my skin has  discoloration from age, dark spot from sun burn, not sure if this cream will help. There is no  information regarding on benefit on label, please let me know as I will continue using this. Have bought two more bottles to give away to my friends, how ever my first bottle cost was $10.00 but few weeks later price was $13.00. Is there Rose ingredient in?</li>
    <li> After a couple of years of searching for a replacement for L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Honey moisturizer (which they discontinued!!:() and several &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34; creams later (unsatisfying) this Rose &amp; Pomegranate Face Cream is PERFECT.  It&#x27;s light, refreshing to my sensitive skin, and makes it feel soft and comfortable.  That&#x27;s important!!  And, the label is pretty as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face cream! It moisturizes wonderfully without making my face look greasy or feel heavy-will recommend this to my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product will help with wrinkles as some products claim, but it feels absolutely light and wonderful on my skin.  The smell is so pleasant, I look forward to having this as my last self-care act before bedtime.  I enjoy using it and don&#x27;t worry about what it does cosmetically.  I&#x27;m really too old to care much about all of that youth-oriented stuff.  I just enjoy the feel and smell of this product.  I encourage you to try it.  Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the face cream I have been waiting for my whole life!  I decided to wait until I had finished the jar before I left any feedback and I still LOVE it. I have not only used this cream as a face cream (I think I would love to be in a tub of this :} )I have used it on my toes and arms and legs and...well all over, including my hair were it helps the fly aways and the ends of my hair soak this stuff up. I am so pleased with this. My second jar is on its way to my house right now.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you LilyAna Naturals for a lovely, lovely face cream,&lt;br /&gt;Diana Redlin</li>
    <li> This daily moisturizer and anti-aging skin cream seems to nurture my skin.  I live in a semi-arid area and need a really good quality moisturizer and this product is proving to be just that.  The jar I received is a bit like thinned pudding...but as others have indicated, a little goes a long way.  As I am 70 years old, the aging spots are just there and I don&#x27;t concern myself with the way my skin has changed over the years.  HOWEVER, the dryness of living where I do needs this replenishing natural skin cream.  Believe me, I have tried many...and thus far, this is on the top of my list.  I have also appreciated the personal contact from the makers.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought both face cream and eye cream, i like their face cream much better than the eye cream, no smell, feels quite natual.</li>
    <li> Best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great products. I will be your repeater.  &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 90 year old Mother who has been looking for the perfect face cream and she loves it. GREAT price and quality!!</li>
    <li> This is a very thick yet non-greasy cream, a little goes a long way. After use every day for the first few weeks the small lines at the corners of my mouth had diminished, after several months of use my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; are barely visible. At 61, my skin is starting to get dry in the winter and this moisturizer absorbs easily keeping my face feeling nourished all day, it works well as a skin protector in cold weather. It leaves no lingering scent so it is great for those sensitive to odors or for men who want a natural moisturizer without a perfume. I was pleasantly surprised that this cream reduced the look of red splotches on my face when nothing else would. Since this is one of the few unscented and natural &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; diminishing creams available I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple effective and well designed cream. Thank you so much for not adding lots of extra ingredients😄</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream absorbs into my skin and a little goes a long way. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The texture of the cream is light and it&#x27;s moisturizing nicely leaving my skin feeling good. I&#x27;m also using it around the eye area. This is the 2nd jar so far. Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Really like the face cream, I have acne prone skin in some areas of my face, but dry sensitive skin in other areas. It softens and makes my skin give a natural glow. My friend said whatever you are using, keep using it,</li>
    <li> Great cream! It&#x27;s not heavy or oily. If anything it&#x27;s a little too light. I really like how it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like some face creams. I have not noticed any difference in wrinkles and reducing age spots. I am still on my first container, though.</li>
    <li> This face cream is non-greasy and seems to benefit my skin.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the scent, but it dissipates quickly and is non-offensive.  I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to speak for its long term benefits, but so far it is very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Nice product and a good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Very light, does not break me out and has even out my skin tone.  Love it!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Loving this cream!!! So far it&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t increase the redness of my skin. (I think I hear angels singing :-) ). Thank you!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absorbs well into the skin and feels very natural. No irritation whatsoever and i use this as my night cream.</li>
    <li> I have to add my praise.  This is very nice - not too heavy while still moisturizing.  I have spent much of my life outside, work and pleasure,  and it shows as I have gotten older.  This seems to help. I probably use a bit more than most people, but like I said above.  Thank you for such a nice product.  Am ordering my second jar.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  It&#x27;s so soft and absorbs into your skin without making it feel greasy.  I can see a difference in my skin quality in just a couple of weeks using this product.</li>
    <li> My mother and I just love this face cream, it doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin and it works. Both I and my mother can see a different in our skin, smooth and younger looking.. Also it helps to drink a lot of water, and eat a little healthier :)) buy it ladies wish they made this in a bigger jar or a buy one get one free:)) Tamara</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this face cream. I must admit the graphics on the jar caught my attention but the performance of the cream will keep me as a customer. The fragrance is very light and pleasant. Having worked in floral shops I noticed that the scent is very similar to fresh cut roses. This cream works well as a foundation for makeup and powder as well as being great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this cream for about3 weeks and it worked ok. Its not greasey or sticky. I would like to use it longer to see how it works toward wrinkles and lines</li>
    <li> This face cream is perfect for my skin and the price is just right too</li>
    <li> This appears to be a skin cream with nice texture, but it smells terrible! I can not find the process to return it, even though it say it has a money back guarantee.  It was not outrageously expensive so I don&#x27;t feel that bad about tossing it. It was worth a try.</li>
    <li> Great thick face cream!  Face does not feel dry after it soaks in.  Does not leave face feeling oily either.</li>
    <li> My name is Teresa Hill. I am 61 years old. I ordered this face cream about a month ago. I must say, bar none, that this is the best face cream I have ever used. I highly recommend it. Try it and see and feel the difference right away! I will be ordering this product again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face cream!!! It absorbs from the time I go from my bathroom to bed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Sometimes I notice the sent more than other times I apply it, but it&#x27;s never overpowering. I will continue to buy this as it leaves my face extremely soft without clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and liked the ingredients listed so decided to give this cream a try. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy layer on the face. But I still prefer gel moisturizers. The scent reminds me of olives.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to keep in my locker at work for when I ride my bike in / workout over lunch and shower there. I usually use a different brand but thought I&#x27;d try this as I was buying other things for my locker on Amazon. I noticed a few things after using this cream a couple times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It is nice and light. I don&#x27;t find it to be greasy or pore clogging.&lt;br /&gt;- The ingredients seem of good quality and non harmful.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It has a very, very strange smell. I can&#x27;t place it but it smells vegetal, and definitely more than a natural cream smell. I can smell it when it is on my face and I don&#x27;t like that. If it smelled like rose &amp; pomegranate, that&#x27;d be different.. but this is just weird. This doesn&#x27;t keep me from using it but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;- The jar is small for the price. The stuff I usually use (First Aid Beauty from Sephora) is around the same price and I get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this if you dislike fragrance, but if you don&#x27;t mind, this could be a great cream for you! I won&#x27;t buy this again but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, I get dry flakey  patch around my nose and my mouth and also greasy forehead. But after a week of this product my face is smoother and I&#x27;ve had no dryness</li>
    <li> SMELLS NICE, AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AMAZING AND HYDRATED ALL DAY. LOVE IT UNDER MY MAKEUP FOR A BASE LOTION</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found and tried this moisturizer, It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! The texture is light and goes on smooth and silky and it moisturizes my dry skin so well without feeling greasy at all. I don&#x27;t know if the moisturizer is supposed have this benefit but my face feels firmer. I love the light rose scent and most importantly It&#x27;s natural. Wonderful customer service! Please don&#x27;t change the formula like most companies usually do, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Joyce C</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I am noticing improvements in my completion! It&#x27;s becoming more even and less red. This product actually moisturizes and smells wonderful! Will definitely buy again and recommend!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth.  Gave 4 stars because it is a little oily.</li>
    <li> Lovely cream - not overly scented, or too heavy. This is my second jar purchased from LilyAna.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is noticeably smoother and feels very soft. Only 4 stars because it stings a bit going on and the smell takes getting used to, smells like fermenting fruit.</li>
    <li> The cream has a very pleasant smell and a little bit goes a long way.  My skin is smoother and has a glow.  I will continue using this cream.</li>
    <li> It is liquid and with a weird color and weird smell, it smells like vinegar, so I guess the cream is spoiled</li>
    <li> This is a quality product...my skin soaks up the moisture. Some products sit on top of the skin, you can feel this one penetrate leaving my skin well moisturizers overnight. No breakouts, at all</li>
    <li> This cream is good if not perfect for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> very gentle and emollient cream soaks in well and provides lots of moisture to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too. I keep mine in the fridge because I don&#x27;t want it to spoil. Don&#x27;t know if its necessary, but that&#x27;s how natural this product seems to be. Ingredients are amazing too. Aloe, Coconut Oil, Jojoba and Rose. I can tell this container will last me A LONG time, but I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because the product actually stinks ! Please add a little fragrance  !</li>
    <li> I love how light and thin this is. And the smell is great! I would recommend this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients in this cream! I can&#x27;t wait to try the eye cream!</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizing face cream. It is non greasy and absorbs very quickly. A little goes a long way. I ordered two, almost 2 months ago, and have used only about 2/3 of the first container. I use it on my face and neck after every washing, so usually twice a day. There is very little scent, which is good because I do not like added fragrances. My face and lips have not become chapped or dry this winter, even when sitting near the ceramic space heater or from being outdoors, and it has been very cold this winter. This is the first time I ordered from LilyAna and I would definitely order from them again. I noticed they responded to every question a customer asked. Customer service is great, and the product is great as well. I like that they are a small company making quality beauty products with ingredients you can pronounce. I previously used neutrogena anti wrinkle serum which I liked, but it is more expensive and the last time I bought it, the bottle was empty within a few weeks, I think they forgot to fill it at the factory.</li>
    <li> My face has lost the scaly white patches and is soft and supple.  A little of the rich hydrating cream goes a long way and it has a very light, pleasant fragrance!</li>
    <li> This cream is emollient and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy film.  The suggestion to refrigerate the cream during hot weather is a good one and the bonus is a nice cooling treat.  This cream does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> the description is accurate. Very light, texture and smell. I love it. The moisturizer is amazing. I love it and it is so natural so I feel I&#x27;m being very, very good to myself.</li>
    <li> Yes, love the cream..&lt;br /&gt;good enough to eat..&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I was originally holding judgement, because I know that creams take some time to be effective, so I was going to wait to review. But honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;First, this company has extremely efficient customer service. I received my original order, and she emailed me ahead of time to indicate that there could be some separation. It was so hot in California that day that it separated and actually leaked out into the packaging! I wrote her, telling her, and not even an hour later she was shipping out from her personal stock, instead of those held by Amazon. Wow! I received the package soon after, and I must say I&#x27;m addicted. The cream smells lovely, and the fragrance is not strong. Very subtle, but refreshing. I have an oily face, especially at my hairline, so I use stronger face cleaning products. Right after, I apply the cream all over my face and massage it in. My face feels smooth and not greasy at all. I use about two finger dips and it covers my whole face!&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream and will be buying some to give to my mother and sister for Christmas, thank you!</li>
    <li> When I received this, the oil had separated; so I just took a plastic spoon and mixed it real good and put it in the refrigerator.  This cream is very light and skin absorbs it quickly.  Not much at all is needed.  There&#x27;s a nice light scent to it also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not as thick as other similar products and doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first jar of this wonderful face cream. I am a 62 year old Hispanic woman and lately people have been complementing me on the way my skin looks.  They say it looks fresh and healthy. My fine lines have diminished, my make up lasts all day and my skin feels moisturized constantly. I can not think of anything else I have been doing that has helped my skin this way. I only used it for two months, so far, and the results are obviously visible.  It has been a long time since anyone complemented me on my skin.  I am definitely impressed with the results and will continue using this product.  Thanks LilyAna!</li>
    <li> Love love love this face cream. Super moisturizing without feeling heavy and oily on your face. I have oily combo skin with acne and this is yet to be the best product I&#x27;ve come across. I love it! I use day and night. My skin feels so soft. Fine lines are slightly going away. Thank you Lily Ana!</li>
    <li> In the right price range for most women. I&#x27;m noticing how well it works , it&#x27;s light and creamy. Only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I have been trying many creams and this has been wonderful, lots of compliments on my skin., I am 56</li>
    <li> It moisturizes so well.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!!  I didn&#x27;t realize how much until I finished the bottle and used something else.  I t does give a radiance to the skin that my other creams do not.  I just ordered another jar.  I love that the cream has natural ingredients compared to all the chemical ones that are in most others.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying your eye cream and face cream!  I will be reordering :-). I have such sensitive fair skin with a multitude of allergies plus Rosacea so have had a very hard time finding something that does not irritate my face but have finally found that product :-). Not to mention I try using only organic whole food items. I am very happy I found you!</li>
    <li> Have used this cream for a few weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I have extremely sensitive (and old) skin.  This cream is smooth and creamy.  I have had no breakouts and have experienced no irritation, which is amazing.  I believe I&#x27;ve finally found the right cream and at an affordable price.  I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this product!</li>
    <li> I like that it is light and goes right into the skin. I just wish it were just a bit more heavy. I will buy it again so I think that it is good--I hate the real heavy stuff because then I&#x27;m wiping some off...Thanks..</li>
    <li> Love this skin cream! Goes on smooth and has very little odor. Leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Well... Disappointed because I absolutely loved the eye cream by this company and thought I would try the face cream. Something is off- it smells funky to say the least.</li>
    <li> This is best face cream! I don&#x27;t need all the preservatives and artificial ingredients on my face. For those that say the smell is bad, it is a natural smell and does not linger at all once it is absorbed. I have purchased face creams that were so perfumed that it made my face break out. I myself do not want that on my face. I have some dry patches on my face and this soften them right up so they were smooth and my foundation went on much better. Thank you for this face cream!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant face cream with no odor or greasy feeling. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really really love this stuff!! I&#x27;d compare it to Cliniques hydro. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;so lite on the skin and yet it&#x27;s not oily. I WILL buy more in the future&lt;br /&gt;and I WILL recommmend to friends. I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled upon it. It may&lt;br /&gt;be the BEST cream I&#x27;ve ever used . Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cream. I have been looking for many years for a cream that would be a good fit for my skin. I have very sensitive skin, I break out easily, and of course being 40 fine lines are definitely a concern. I did a little research on Amazon, and I saw so many positive reviews for this cream that I had to try it. It&#x27;s been a month and I already feel a significant difference! My skin feels healthy and moisturized. Some creams that I have tried before were either too greasy or left my skin tight, LiliAna Naturals Cream is the perfect balance. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great stuff, look forward to applying it after the shower.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, its non greasy, easily absorbed and combines well with other face products.And it smooths on easily.</li>
    <li> Great product will definitely be using this for a long time. I have so many people telling me how beautiful my skin looks and what are you doing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a lovely moisturizer.  I am very picky and have tried a lot of skin care products...  LilyAna Naturals provides a product which moisturizes my skin and soaks in - unlike several other brands I have tried and the product just lays on top of the skin.  I am definitely a person who is scent oriented and love aromatherapy products.  Very happy with the Rose &amp; Pomegranate Face Cream and would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry and sensitive skin. Most product I put within an inch of my eyes eventually swells up my eye area. This product has been moisturizing my skin with no irritation or issues. Feels light and not greasy and does an amazing all-day job.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this face cream. I have to be very careful what I use on my face as I have very sensitive skin and get so frustrated when I purchase products and have to throw them out as I cannot use them. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin texture since using this cream as it absorbs deep into my skin and feels soft and not heavy and greasy. I use it at night and since it is not greasy I use it under by foundation during the day. I am so glad I purchased this product. It was an added bonus when I realized this is a family run business from my home state of MS. Gail</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly into your skin and causes no irritation.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I was leery of this product, but neighbor recommended it.  Now I love it.  No fragrance, smooth application, leaves skin soft and full feeling.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try an all natural face cream. I love this LilyAna face cream! It feels so good on my face.:) Happy, happy customer!</li>
    <li> I really like the face cream as it was what I was searching for and I have been searching for awhile.  I just wanted a face cream that was made from natural ingredients, no testing on animals, a face cream that faded the darker skin on my face, anti aging.  I am 55 years old and I would recommend your product to others.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling smooth. I can apply makeup right after application giving me a good base to work with.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  There are so many wonderful features I don&#x27;t know where to start.  You start by unscrewing the top.  There you are met with the sweet smelling hypoallergenic cream.... Creamy and luscious in its texture and scoop it out with your fingers and apply to your face.  Not too much... A little goes a long way but the very act of massaging this super hydrating moisturizing cream  with your fingers not only makes sure it&#x27;s evenly applied but stimulates your skin as well.  No pumps or tubes here.... What you see is what you get and you get so much!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, less is more when applying.  With such a quality product it&#x27;s easy to have it last a long time without having to constantly buy more.  I have super sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product.  Actually it&#x27;s been a blessing. This is why;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With super sensitive skin you tend to find the products offered for you to be overtly expensive, animal tested and filled with chemicals that don&#x27;t address not only your sensitivity but in my case my age.  I am 40.  I have wrinkles.  But with this cream I have not had an allergic reaction and my face glows!!!!  The appearance of my laugh lines have diminished and my skin is super soft and supple.  I just really like this cream.  I bought their eye cream as well after using Oz&#x27;s stuff... And I love it as well.... And it will last longer!!!  My crowsfeet have visually disappeared.  They won&#x27;t go away until they invent a time machine for skin aging but your cream gives it the nutrients it needs.  Thanks LilyAna for getting it right.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a month now. It is not only a great face moisturizer, but also seems to have curative ingredients. From time to time I have had to use metrogel to alleviate a small patch under my eye. Since I started using this cream, it is gone. No metrogel needed. Maybe it&#x27;s the jojoba oil, since I also from time to time use an essential oil mixture. But, whatever it is that&#x27;s causing the improvement, this face cream is working for me. I am 65, with skin that needs whatever help it can get! Thank you to LilyAna, I will be buying this again and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent item! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! I&#x27;ve bought it twice now;)</li>
    <li> It is nice to use as night cream. It is a little bit greasy for use during the day. It works wonders. My face is smooth when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product, and was so excited to try it. Within the first day of using it, my skin went crazy. It left my skon so oily, and wax like feeling. And the smell was absolutely unpleasant. I returned it in less than a week of recieving it.</li>
    <li> Lovely creme I am happy with the texture of this creme lightweight and quickly absorbing perfect for the day.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It really works!!!!</li>
    <li> skin feels smoother and moisturized</li>
    <li> Was still Alittle oily for Me, but I have trouble in &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone areas but used on lower cheeks/chin and great on Neck area !</li>
    <li> Wow, what a wonderful face cream!  It looks and feels rich and decadent, but with a light touch, (a little goes a long way), my combination skin is happy, happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can pronounce, (and recognize), all of the ingredients, and I love the light, delicate fragrance!  Overall just a reall exceptional product and I&#x27;m really pleased I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Light, but does the job.  My 15 year old daughter loves it too! So much that I had to hide the jar from her.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This cream is very nice and emollient. I usually use it during the day, as my skin is so dry that I need the extra thickness and protection of the cream. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Like the  eye cream but haven&#x27;t used this one yet.  I am sure I will like it.</li>
    <li> Already seeing a difference after two days. Godsend in the winter.. I was so ify about buying this, I looooooove it.</li>
    <li> The scent is of neither rose nor pomegranate, it puts me off from using the cream regularly. It seems to be working well to keep my skin firm though, so am giving it 4 stars and taking away a star for the bad smell.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I am 24 and starting to show signs of wrinkles and I have already seen an improvement with this cream.  I put in in before my foundation and I actually feel like it makes my foundation look better.  My Mother is in her 50&#x27;s and loves it as well!! We can&#x27;t wait to buy more !! Also I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any problems.</li>
    <li> This cream has a truly offensive smell. I can&#x27;t wear it enough to review the quality of the cream, so... Waste of $.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Kept my oily skin hydrated but not greasy. It smelled wonderful also without being overpowering. Will def repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is such a rich, creamy, gentle cream, and smells great!  I am on my second jar now and plan to continue using this product.  I think it is helping reduce my breakouts and lighten some acne scars I have.</li>
    <li> Light and moisturizing facial cream.  I wanted an organic cream for my face and this has worked well.  I haven&#x27;t had acne from the moisturizer like I would with other products.  I&#x27;m not sure that my wrinkles have improved but maybe a little.  Overall I am happy with this product and they small package does last a while.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best moisturizer i have ever used i can tell i big difference in my skin, its soft and i can tell my skins complexion is noticeably smoother also, im definitely getting more.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Don&#x27;t like the scent and it makes my skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I really like the way this makes my skin feel.  It is very creamy and smoothly glides over my skin.  Great customer service...I had an issue with the package in shipping. Sheryl of LilyAna shipped out another the next day and I got it right away in excellent condition.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase. A gentle cream with a pleasant aroma of pomegranate has a light texture. I use it as a daily cream. My skin is smooth and elastic. Thanks a lot for this face cream!</li>
    <li> This face cream is truly amazing. I have very sensitive finicky skin, so I&#x27;m always nervous to try new things on my face. Thankfully this has been so great. My skin is soft, not greasy or dry, clear, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it. So I&#x27;m always recommending this stuff! You will love it.</li>
    <li> GOOD CREAM - HEAVIER THAN I USUALLY USE.</li>
    <li> Both the product and the seller earn five stars. The face and eye cream are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It&#x27;s the only one my daughter will use. We r both in love with it.</li>
    <li> I like this so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and no problems with any allergic breakouts or sensitivity. You need to use quite a bit of it for dry skin, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all.</li>
    <li> I started with the eye cream and it worked so well that I just had to order the face cream. It moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy and the best part is it&#x27;s all natural. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve had and it&#x27;s only my third day using it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this face cream! It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs well and makes my skin look better with and without make up.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for night or day since it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This face cream is vey light and smells great.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I live in a dry climate (AZ) and I have been so used to having flaky, dry,  skin under my eyes and under my bottom lip + oily forehead and chin, but this moisturizer seems to even out my combo skin. It was just what I was looking for. Like the other reviews,  a dab/little goes much further than I was expecting since this isn&#x27;t thick creme. And just a dab does the trick for my whole face. I am not a fan of the smell which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars (it kinda reminds me of an old woman) but I love how this has improved my complexion and moisturized my face.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and lovely seller. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A light pleasant cream for day use, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and leaves no sticky feeling.  It has a very light woodsy rose smell that does not get up your nose or in your throat as some fragrances can, and it fades away quickly, just leaving smooth soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;May 2016 update ....... I&#x27;m purchasing this product again because it is a great day cream, goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel comfortable. I would purchase to give to my friends as a gift, or just to get them to try it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very light, almost too light. Perhaps this is best for summertime use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s another face cream.  I would not order it again though.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1L7L6UXHCQPT2]]I bought this face cream at the recommendation of a friend. I&#x27;m all about anti-aging creams as long as they don&#x27;t have any funny smells or leave a weird residue. Check out my review of this product that I actually have grown to love.</li>
    <li> This product is very creamy and feels great on my face. I just wished they made it in a larger jar.</li>
    <li> Packing and delivery okay. Face cream as expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great face cream. Very light and aloe vera helps my rosacea.  No scent. Just right. Excellent customer service as well. Very pleased so far and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product with natural ingredients - perfect for any skin type.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the eye cream first and absolutely loved it. The cream is a great consistancy, its slightly thick in texture in a good way, no dripping, doesmt slide off your finger, its easy to apply around the eye area in a tapping motion. Its not greasy at all, it goes on smooth and I was able to put on makeup seconds later. The moment you purchase you get a separate email from the company explaing how to use and that it can be used on different areas as well.  I loved it so much and the price is perfect, I had to try the face cream. I use it morning and night.  Its not heavy.  Soaks in your skin quckly.  The jars are beautuful, I leave on my dresser for show, leaving it out also reminds me to use.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit funny, seems to work great.</li>
    <li> the cream not good for me.</li>
    <li> smells great and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer! I have oily yet sensitive breakout prone skin with some dark spots from past breakouts- this cream keeps my face moisturized without being greasy! My skin actually gets less shiny since using this then it has with any other moisturizer that I have tried in the past (and trust me I&#x27;ve tried a lot many of which were a lot more expensive). My skin has overall improved in brightness, clarity and the spots are starting to fade. It is very gentle and soothing and I use it morning and night! Love that it is natural (only drawback to that is the scent but at least you know it&#x27;s not filled with perfumes). Buy it you will not regret it!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most moisturizing face cream I have tried. Very impressed with how it made my skin feel. Love the fact that the ingredients are nontoxic.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple moisturizer and, have to admit, I bought this product along with the eye cream because I liked the packaging. I really like these products. The cream absorbs into the skin and leaves my face feeling supple and soft. I am sensitive to many skin care products, but I have had no negative reaction to these. I plan to buy both the skin and eye cream again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the face cream. My skin feels so supple and I can tell a difference already. The service was great and quick.</li>
    <li> Really love this face cream. Feels like it hydrates my skin perfectly. I use it in the morning on top of a glycolic acid and night over retinol. Those are great products but they need a great moisturizer. I was under the assumption for years that I didn&#x27;t need moisturizer because my face can get oily. My own &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; moisturizer. I&#x27;ve learned a lot since then. I&#x27;ve tried so SO many serums and creams, bunch of hype and a bunch of money. All the matrixyl, dmae, syn-coll, retinols, aha&#x27;s, actives, and of course HA are pretty useless or even make the skin worse without a good moisturizer. I&#x27;m not going to give up my other products but I really think that this is what my face craves. Yes, I feel it has plumped my skin and no it did not break me out. I do think that this cream has made my face look healthier, aka more &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34;. I mean really, that&#x27;s what most of us are going for here, right? Definitely around my eyes, mouth, and laugh lines. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; Wonderful Face Cream!!! I have combination skin and this product moisturized very well without breakouts. I keep it in the fridge along with the Eye Cream that I love equally! My skin has improved since using both creams, and fine lines and wrinkles have softened after the first use.  It has a light, lovely smell without being overpowering and a little goes a long way. Customer service at LilyAna Naturals is fantastic and very informative about their products.  I have finally found the perfect natural Face Cream, Love it!!! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased a dozen moisturizers once I realized how loaded with chemicals Clinique has become.  By far, this is the best moisturizer I have encountered.  I even gave some to the mom of a 8-month old baby with severe rosacea on his cheeks, and it helped him. It is shrinking the red circles from the outside border, until they are 1/3 the size after only a few weeks.  It seems to improve everything ... and you can&#x27;t get better than that!  It has improved my complexion.  I am 65 and have very sensitive skin..  It is a pleasant product to use -- smells nice and has a nice consistency.  Seems to have made any little age spots on my hands look better.  A beautiful product.</li>
    <li> Great night moisturizer. I wake up to nice skin. It does work well. The only thing I would ask is for a better scent than the existing one. A light orange, vanilla...something not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love it.  The smell is fantastic,  it&#x27;s nice and light for summer. Thrilled with the quality of ingredients.</li>
    <li> This face cream is very thick and you only need to use a tiny bit so the jar should last a long time. I like the ingredients and the way they make it. It soaks into the skin quickly and there is no after greasy feel. I use mine over the coconut oil i put on my face, my first step in softening. It is perfect for aging skin, but no matter what age you are it is never too soon to start caring for your skin.</li>
    <li> I really like how this cream makes my face feel so smooth and does not leave a residue!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the face cream and the eye cream and, I must say, I love both of these products!!!  I have noticed a marked improvement in the texture of my skin.  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future, some for me and some for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> The product itself is wonderful, but the packaging is sort of cheap and leaks.  I&#x27;ve lost half the product from leakage out of the lid.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get serious here... Every. Single. Face moisturizer I used failed me - until I gave in and bought this one. Before, I had to apply moisturizer four, five, six, or more times before my skin would be satisfied - and this was before leaving the apartment for work! Now, I apply this cream once after my morning shower - and it&#x27;s all I need. I have found the Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;I feared this moisturizer would make my skin feel greasy, which is something I can&#x27;t stand. And I&#x27;ll say this - the first three days? It did. My skin felt greasy and oily, but I stuck it out because the winter drying out my skin was even less desirable than that I-Must-Have-Worked-On-An-Oil-Rig-All-Day feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I have put up with dry winter skin for too many years! NO MORE! I shouted inside the privacy of my own mind.&lt;br /&gt;So I toughed out those first three days. Not sure what changed after that - but it isn&#x27;t greasy-feeling anymore. I can touch my face ten minutes after applying it and not come away with greasy fingers, which is great news because those first three days I could apply the stuff and ten hours later my fingers would come away pretty slick feeling. It was a bit of an ew there at first. I have been using this product since December 19th 2014, and it is now February 2, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Now my skin feels oh-so baby soft. I also suffer fewer breakouts now that my skin isn&#x27;t dry, flaky, cracked, irritated, etc. Long story short, I guess I&#x27;m just really pleased with this purchase. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; fresh. Appears thick but absorbs very quickly. I like to add another layer on after the first one soaks in. My skin feels smooth &amp; looks refreshed after a nights sleep.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this cream feels and the way it lasts.  The ingredients are pure and natural and do not irritate my extremely sensitive and dry skin.  About two years ago, I had a bout with &amp;#34;perioral dermatitis&amp;#34;, which is essentially a hideous rash that started under my nose and covered the lower half of my face for several months.  Research has linked this with SLS, which is in almost everything (toothpaste, creams, shampoos, soaps, etc). I&#x27;d always used primarily natural products, but not totally.  Now I am always on the hunt for natural but very effective anti-aging, moisturizers.  I am very happy with this cream and particularly with the customer support provided by this company.  I love that they follow up and that they respond to any questions and concerns very graciously.  I get the impression this is a small company that cares about delivering quality and excellent service and earning repeat customers the old fashioned way (rather than through the smoke and mirrors of the modern marketing machine).</li>
    <li> Use this product every day. If you use it right after showering, it won&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. The bottle was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be, but that&#x27;s ok, as a little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too oily for my skin type. But overall its great.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this cream but it is not for me. It stings and turns my face red after applying. Makes my skin look really bad and makes me feel very dry once it&#x27;s soaked in which is weird because it is greasy when applied. I&#x27;m going back to Eucerin.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  I have sensitive skin so no breakouts and no stickiness on skin.  The smell is wonderful and love the texture - use it day and night.  A perfect addition to my skincare! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have found this wonderful face cream which has convinced me to switch brands after decades! It is everything one would want in a face cream and above all mostly organic! It is absorbed perfectly in a soft and non-greasy way and with a pleasant and mild natural fragrance. Thank you LilyAna!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 4 days, twice a day applying it after I&#x27;ve gently washed my face. My skin loves the stuff! It&#x27;s cleared my complexion, almost like it&#x27;s evened the color of my skin tone. I have great skin, but this stuff has made it plump, and vibrant, and I dare say glowing. Im sure the emulsifiers are to blame for plumpness. Great ingredients, everything you want your skin to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip- put it in the fridge and apply it while it&#x27;s cold.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; effects a lot of other users experienced but it smells great and I love the consistency- I just feel good about putting it on my face!</li>
    <li> This cream don&#x27;t do anything..</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and not greasy . Smell was a little different but its amazing and my skin loves it</li>
    <li> I truly love the way this cream makes my face feel. It is not greasy at all like some creams. It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth! It is light enough to wear under your makeup.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for complicated skin. I love how it makes my face feel!</li>
    <li> Really nice texture. Skin is soft and not greasy. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream so far.  It absorbs fast and my skin feels very soft.  Been using for about 7 days.  Hope it will help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My LilyAna face cream and eye cream is amazing.  I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any problems.  My skin feels wonderful, soft, not greasy and radiant.  I am so glad I found it and will continue to use it.  My search is over.  Thanks LilyAna!</li>
    <li> smell strong and bad like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. I am afraid to put it on my skin because sensitive skin can not handle artificial fragrances. I hope this is not a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; masking scent.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and have difficulty controlling shine throughout the day. I have been using this face cream for only about a week but have noticed a difference. It seems like it is taking longer for my face to shine. It smells pleasant and is a great consistency. Service was great. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I love it.  The smell is light and it moisturize without been greasy.  I wish it was offered in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Works wonders and you don&#x27;t need much. And it smells divine too! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have an oily face so I have to use oil free moisturizers. The consistency of this one feels greasy at first but it provides the right amount of moisture. I really enjoyed it until my face started breaking out. I have sensitive skin so had it not been for the break out, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream!</li>
    <li> It probably works well for a lot of other people especially if you have dry skin. I don&#x27;t really like the smell, although it is very easy to get used to. However, when I used it, it broke out my face. Probably will find someone to give it away to.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love the texture of this face cream. Very light, which is important if used around the eyes. It contains fabulous ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just bought this facial cream.It glide on smoothly on my sensitive skin.I also like the fact that it&#x27;s made with wholesome ingredients, and to top it off it smell good and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product for winter chapped/wind burned faces.  Heavy duty cream that absorbs well.  A very natural product.  My dog loved it as well, he ate the jar, which he is not known for.  Thankfully, they do not use harsh products, so my dog was able to enjoy his &amp;#34;rose and pomegranate&amp;#34; treat without falling ill.  But now I am left without...hoping they can restock soon...</li>
    <li> I love this product, my face looks and feels very soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent day cream, good under makeup.  Not rich enough for my dry skin at night so I use the eye cream all over my face.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This face cream performs as well as it looks, smells and feels.  I love that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
    <li> I write very few reviews, if any at all, but I must say that this is absolutely the best natural face cream I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for almost a month now, and I can definitely see the positive results.  My skin is softer and smoother.  It has also minimized the dark spot on my nose from where my eye glasses rest - this has really impressed me.  Also, this face cream is not greasy at all.  I do not have to use face powder to cover any shininess.  The ingredients are all naturalI, and I simply love it.  This will be the only face cream I will use as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> Just got the item yesterday and I love it. I wish I would have bought more with the coupon code I recieved for $1.79. Hope to see more offers.</li>
    <li> Before LilyAna, i would buy expensive Origins and Clinique products. Lilyana moisturizes my skin without breaking me out. The price is better too.</li>
    <li> I love the way it made my face softer, and I had a couple of scars that got noticably lighter!</li>
    <li> Been using every expensive face cream out there. This is a lovely moisturizing cream; my lines seem softer skin is dewy. Very pleased will reorder.</li>
