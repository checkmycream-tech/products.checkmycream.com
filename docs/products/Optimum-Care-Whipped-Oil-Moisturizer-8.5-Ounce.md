    <li> I use this product because it makes my hair so soft and well moisturized. It tames my unruly grey hair too. I love it! I can never find it in stores when I need it so Amazon will be my go to place from now on. I also use the Optimum Perm in Super along with it. I have used these products faithfully for many years.

    <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s because it was on sale and decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not using it right or what, but it leaves my hair greasy. I don&#x27;t put much in, and I have long and thick hair.</li>

    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I needed a daily hair moisturizer, although I do not like the build-up feel of any hair product. Optimum didnt make my hair feel weighed down, which I really like. I would recommend the product as a great hair moisturizer. The ordering process was as always, Amazon Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
