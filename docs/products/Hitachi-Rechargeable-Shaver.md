      <li>I was very impressed by the quickness of the delivery - surely the fastest I&#x27;ve ever experienced online.  </li>
      <li>coz of this I bought this shaver for a good shave and good looking ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing they still sell this shaver.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
      <li>Perfect for traveling as it has its own built in electric prongs for charging and also handles different volts with a flip of the switch.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>&quot;, clients love it.</li>
      <li>now I can shave five times or more</li>
      <li>The trimmer is a feature that most shaver do not have.</li>
      <li>Not as fast a shave as with the higher end models but excellent size and durability for travel.</li>
      <li>This shaver is the best compared with the other brands I have used before.</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE AND EASY TO CARRY ALSO.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>The problem is - it takes a good 10 minutes to get a decent shave.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery as well :)</li>
      <li>The shaver has good heft: not excessive</li>
      <li>Shaveroutlet also has a free video on their site instructing on how to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that are extremely light.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>razor charging light did not come on,and after trying to take a charge w/o the light coming on,the razor died within 30 seconds</li>
      <li>good travel shaver if you want something different ( all-in-one unit, nothing else to carry).</li>
      <li>Pretty cheap case</li>
      <li>The Hitachi is ultra-quiet and easy to handle, shaves close enough, and is very comfortable on my face.</li>
      <li>new one, is as impressive as my 1st.&lt;br /&gt;Shave decently close, not as noisy as my aged one.</li>
      <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s dual voltage, 120 and 220, so it can use in many world regions (you will, of course, need an adapter to fit other countries&#x27; outlets).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>the replacement razor took more time to to be delivered back to me than I thought it should.</li>
      <li>I replaced the battery with one that is higher capacity (batterymart.com)  </li>
      <li>It seems to keep a charge pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using my old wahi shaver which is far better than this Hitachi shaver</li>
      <li>It proved an excellent choice, at least for me, so much so that I just bought a second identical one through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lithium is packing the most energy per gram and has no memory issues, but is still relatively rare in rechargeable shavers, and typically pushes the price up (well North of $100), so it&#x27;s probably overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A very close shave.</li>
      <li>I originally had a client of mine bring me back this shaver from Japan on one of his deployments about 8 years ago.</li>
      <li>very well made, high quality&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nickel-Metal-Hydride is a good compromise, packs more energy, has less of a memory effect and a longer life-span (measured as number of charge-discharge cycles): it also has the added bonus of a short recharge time (typically one hour), though it can be damaged by overcharging.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK to use, good for traveling, but the blade seems not strong and sharp, also the battery life is short after each charge.</li>
      <li>not working as smooth as I expected</li>
      <li>However, if you consider the modest price, this little shaver remains an outstanding value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
      <li>The better AA battery shavers are usually louder, smoother, faster, and cheaper.</li>
      <li>Luckily a Japanese friend of mine brought several back from her last trip to Japan: apparently they are easy to find there, and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Contrary to common belief, it is possible and relatively easy to replace a NiCd battery in a shaver: the appropriate replacement can be found on the web from sites like &amp;#34;shaveroutletdotcom&amp;#34; for a modest $15 including shipping and only a very basic amount of soldiering is required to replace it.  </li>
      <li>The old shaver never traveled as well as this one, no cords to worry about and plenty of charge for 5 days.</li>
      <li>: you slide out the outlet prongs and plug it directly into an outlet.  </li>
      <li>I use to use the old one and it still working till today</li>
      <li>The battery is a nickel-cadmium technology, with a limited life span: after four years my first Hitachi was no longer keeping the charge for even one day (it&#x27;s rated for 21 minutes or seven shaves @ 3 minutes per shave).  </li>
      <li>The rotary norelco, it replaced, made no mess, all the whiskers were contained in the shaver.</li>
      <li>Most of the weight is due to a very well made small electric motor: when I took apart my old one to replace the battery (see note about battery technology below)</li>
      <li>This shaver makes a mess of whiskers on you, this may be normal for foil shavers, I would not know as this is my first.</li>
      <li>BATTERY TECHNOLOGY:&lt;br /&gt;NI-cad is, relatively-speaking, the oldest rechargeable battery technology, and has three main disadvantages: if kept regularly under charge it will soon develop a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; of this fact and last much less than its rated capacity,  a shorter life span, and it provides less electricity per gram of weight compared to more modern technologies, such as Nickel-Metal-Hydride or Lithium.</li>
      <li>Fits one hand and quiet, it vibrates more and is slow to shave.</li>
      <li>Nice shaver but not perfect.  </li>
      <li>No cord: while this is typically an advantage (which is why I listed it under &amp;#34;likes&amp;#34;) because there is nothing to forget home, it can also be a disadvantage because there is no option to use the shaver in a &amp;#34;corded&amp;#34; mode, for example when the battery no longer holds a charge: the shaver is either in your hand or plugged in, but not both at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>The foil actually sets it apart from almost all other shavers in this price range: even the name brands in this range tend to have inferior, thicker foils which do not allow for a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I use it for my hair cutting clients when I need to shave the top of their heads to be bald or their faces without using a razor!</li>

    <li> ITS VERY GOOD. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. ITS SAVE MY TIME AND COST ALSO. EASY TO USE AND EASY TO CARRY ALSO.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver. Easy to clean. You can charge it without messing with wires. I love it.</li>
    <li> Does its job for 2 years. Wish battery could have been replaceable.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. This shaver is the best compared with the other brands I have used before. I strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> By mistake I plugged my same prior shaver in the wrong voltage outlet without unjusting the voltage switch in the shaver. It&#x27;s a good thing they still sell this shaver.  I was very impressed by the quickness of the delivery - surely the fastest I&#x27;ve ever experienced online.  What a fantastic seller!!!  Would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> good travel shaver if you want something different ( all-in-one unit, nothing else to carry). Fits one hand and quiet, it vibrates more and is slow to shave. The better AA battery shavers are usually louder, smoother, faster, and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I used this as a shaver and trimmer. The trimmer is a feature that most shaver do not have. This is the second one that I have ourchased.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd unit. My 1st is still here as a back up unit.&lt;br /&gt;This new one, is as impressive as my 1st.&lt;br /&gt;Shave decently close, not as noisy as my aged one. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday/365 days a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE.</li>
    <li> Not as fast a shave as with the higher end models but excellent size and durability for travel. I am currently using it for my daily shave, but I can see myself reluctantly buying the replacement foil for my old expensive shaver at the same price as this entire shaver. The old shaver never traveled as well as this one, no cords to worry about and plenty of charge for 5 days.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver but not perfect.  A very close shave. I replaced the battery with one that is higher capacity (batterymart.com)  now I can shave five times or more instead of two times before  recharging.  This shaver makes a mess of whiskers on you, this may be normal for foil shavers, I would not know as this is my first. The rotary norelco, it replaced, made no mess, all the whiskers were contained in the shaver.</li>
    <li> not working as smooth as I expected so I don&#x27;t used it anymore I&#x27;m still using my old wahi shaver which is far better than this Hitachi shaver</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK to use, good for traveling, but the blade seems not strong and sharp, also the battery life is short after each charge.</li>
    <li> razor charging light did not come on,and after trying to take a charge w/o the light coming on,the razor died within 30 seconds the replacement razor took more time to to be delivered back to me than I thought it should.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun and Remington foil razors for over 40 years, and bought this razor on a whim. The Hitachi is ultra-quiet and easy to handle, shaves close enough, and is very comfortable on my face. The problem is - it takes a good 10 minutes to get a decent shave. (Perhaps that is due to the very small, single cutting head.) Also, it is a bit awkward having to plug in the entire razor to recharge, and the trimmer is a little difficult to use. After almost two weeks of s-l-o-w shaving, I purchased another Braun.</li>

However, here again the price of the shaver goes up proportionally.</li>
    <li> It has a very bad battery</li>
    <li> I use to use the old one and it still working till today coz of this I bought this shaver for a good shave and good looking ..</li>
    <li> I originally had a client of mine bring me back this shaver from Japan on one of his deployments about 8 years ago. My dad used it and managed to break it, he has dementia. So I found it again on Amazon and bought it from them. I use it for my hair cutting clients when I need to shave the top of their heads to be bald or their faces without using a razor! It shaves so close I call it \\&quot;baby butt smooth\\&quot;, clients love it. Works just as well as Brauns $300 razor at 1/10 of the cost! Perfect for traveling as it has its own built in electric prongs for charging and also handles different volts with a flip of the switch. Quick delivery as well :)</li>
    <li> great shaver. holds power as long. cut close as advertised</li>
    <li> Works great. The head comes off hard for cleaning.It seems to keep a charge pretty well.Pretty cheap case but it works for now.</li>
