      <li>I like it better.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I purchased a couple of jars since they were cheap.</li>
      <li>I used this product in conjunction with an LED Light therapy series of treatments.  </li>
      <li>I read is almost like a miracle, and that the first application was the most drammatical.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t really done anything with the scars but it has made my face look more rest.  </li>
      <li>Overall for the price, it is a good product.</li>
      <li>9,000IUs is the perfect amount to treat dry skin, light scars, and for overall moisture.</li>
      <li>They went away on their own in about the same amount of time, but this one wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>

      <li>All clear and golden-clear vegetable oil consistent e oil is not e oil and will not transform your beauty except make you look and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i use it on my lips because it makes them soft and supple,&amp; its organic unlike most chapsticks which just make your dry lips shinny!</li>
      <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep on using them and wait a little more to see IF scars fade.</li>
      <li>Using a cotton ball wastes product, and using your finger isn&#x27;t the most sanitary thing.  </li>
      <li>After about 6 weeks, the scar is almost completely gone.  </li>
      <li>Now my skin is almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also makes your skin feel incredibly amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>Home Health - Natural Vitamin E Skin Oil, .5 fl oz]]</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that much acne, just a couple of scars left.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>This is fine until you&#x27;re almost done (it&#x27;s only a .5ounce bottle...very small) and then nothing comes out.</li>
      <li>9,000IU is a great consistency -- not too thick where you can&#x27;t rub it and not too thin.</li>
      <li>I had some other areas treated that left some less obvious marks, light enough to cover up.  </li>
      <li>Some of the jars were a little open when they got here, there was not too much lost, but everything was greasy.</li>

<li> Heavy and high quality.</li>
<li> The bottle is smaller than I expected (my error for not looking at the size I was purchasing).</li>
<li> it is a little too thick, it is hard to apply, but works better when blended with some carrier oil.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a scar left from &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; off a dark spot on my face.  </li>
<li> The scar was really dark and obvious, and I couldn&#x27;t cover it with make-up.  </li>
<li> I think I read the same article as the person who wrote the previous review did.</li>
<li> Not pure vitamin e.</li>
<li> cannot see the the oil is NOT dark brown nor a THICK</li>
<li> This is normally fine, but with this small bottle it becomes nearly impossible to get the last bit of oil out.</li>
<li> /&gt;DONT fall for the dark brown bottles</li>
<li> I had to leave the bottle upside down for 5 minutes just to get the remaining oil</li>
<li> and provide little to no healing effect.</li>
<li> /&gt;- .5 ounces is really small</li>
<li> e oil is VERY VERY VERY dark brown, has a consistency that is VERY thick and will transform your beauty.</li>
<li> Some products are vitamin E in a secondary oil carrier - this product is 100%.</li>
<li> Cutting the gel capsules open was a pain.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply from the jar it comes.</li>
<li> isht is FAKE.</li>
<li> /&gt;they know it&#x27;s fake.</li>
<li> i know someone who uses it for cold sores!</li>
<li> but I had the worst pimple scar on my face that should&#x27;ve taken like 2 weeks to fully heal.</li>
<li> However, the bottle that this product comes in is the worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I learned along time ago that this type of skin oil was good for any skin problems one may have. Mainly was purchased to help the visual effect of scar tissue to become less noticeable. Don&#x27;t let the words &#x27;skin beauty&#x27; throw you. This helps your skin period.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% pure Vitamin E oil. I got it for my chickenpox scars. It hasn&#x27;t really done anything with the scars but it has made my face look more rest.  So, maybe not so much for the scar but it is a good thing for smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time with no damage. The bottle is smaller than I expected (my error for not looking at the size I was purchasing). I can buy Vitamin E from a local store for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this in liquid form.  Cutting the gel capsules open was a pain.  I&#x27;ve been using this on a scar left from &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; off a dark spot on my face.  I used this product in conjunction with an LED Light therapy series of treatments.  The scar was really dark and obvious, and I couldn&#x27;t cover it with make-up.  After about 6 weeks, the scar is almost completely gone.  I had some other areas treated that left some less obvious marks, light enough to cover up.  They went away on their own in about the same amount of time, but this one wouldn&#x27;t budge. I do wish it came with a brush (like a nail polish brush) inside the bottle.  I cleaned and sanitized an old one and use it, but the cap, on the brush, doesn&#x27;t fit.  So, I have to keep it separate from the bottle.  Using a cotton ball wastes product, and using your finger isn&#x27;t the most sanitary thing.  I also use it on my lips.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This skin oil is awesome &amp; works wonderful!  I had surgery on my thumb &amp; I used the oil &amp; the scar is not noticeable!</li>
    <li> This vitamin e oil is actually quite nice. 9,000IU is a great consistency -- not too thick where you can&#x27;t rub it and not too thin. However, the bottle that this product comes in is the worst. There is no brush or dropper connected to the cap. So, you have to pour the vitamin e out. This is fine until you&#x27;re almost done (it&#x27;s only a .5ounce bottle...very small) and then nothing comes out. I had to leave the bottle upside down for 5 minutes just to get the remaining oil out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- 9,000IUs is the perfect amount to treat dry skin, light scars, and for overall moisture. I mixed this with my body lotion and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky or oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- .5 ounces is really small&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle doesn&#x27;t have a brush or dropper on the cap. This is normally fine, but with this small bottle it becomes nearly impossible to get the last bit of oil out.</li>
    <li> this is really great brand of vitamin E oil i know someone who uses it for cold sores! but i use it on my lips because it makes them soft and supple,&amp; its organic unlike most chapsticks which just make your dry lips shinny! and provide little to no healing effect. this is much better! for my lips it is only this &amp; or cocoa butter chapstick.</li>
    <li> I have received this product two nights ago and wow I love it. I have suffer from acne for so many years that it left acne scars. So from a suggestion of an article, I order this product. Now my skin is almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a pimple forming on my forehead and now it seems that it&#x27;s not there. I love this product so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS!!!!![[ASIN:B00014GBZ8 Home Health - Natural Vitamin E Skin Oil, .5 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> The reason i give this product 4 stars is because it does&#x27;t have a dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;But it has a good price and i really like it, i&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> it is a little too thick, it is hard to apply, but works better when blended with some carrier oil. Overall for the price, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> isht is FAKE. e oil is VERY VERY VERY dark brown, has a consistency that is VERY thick and will transform your beauty. All clear and golden-clear vegetable oil consistent e oil is not e oil and will not transform your beauty except make you look and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a placebo! i hope they go to &#x27;you know where,&#x27; for selling this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they know it&#x27;s fake. that&#x27;s why they cover up the whole bottle so that us who know hat it&#x27;s supposed to look like cannot see the the oil is NOT dark brown nor a THICK consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT fall for the dark brown bottles either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;further proof that they are BSers!!! who should burn in you know where.</li>
    <li> I think I read the same article as the person who wrote the previous review did. I purchased a couple of jars since they were cheap. The seller shipped them so VERY fast, they got here 4 days before the delivery estimate. I have been using it for a week now. I read is almost like a miracle, and that the first application was the most drammatical. Well....it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me yet. I don&#x27;t have that much acne, just a couple of scars left. They still are there. I keep using it to try to see if, over time, they will eventually fade, and I purchased the product, so I gotta do something with it. I still stick to my Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula. I like it better. It works faster. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep on using them and wait a little more to see IF scars fade. This product could use a dispenser. It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply from the jar it comes. Some of the jars were a little open when they got here, there was not too much lost, but everything was greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this product , not greasy and it works!! I hope they have it in a bigger squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> 100% Vitamin E Oil. Does not contain carrier oil. Heavy and high quality. When comparing vitamin E oils look at the ingredients closely. Some products are vitamin E in a secondary oil carrier - this product is 100%. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it but I had the worst pimple scar on my face that should&#x27;ve taken like 2 weeks to fully heal. The vitamin E cleared it up within 4 days. This stuff is very good for any skin affliction that might take awhile to heal like eczema scars or pimple scars. It also makes your skin feel incredibly amazingly soft.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!!! amazing as part of my mix.</li>
    <li> Not pure vitamin e. It has vegetable oil in the mix as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ill probably find another vendor for my next order.</li>
