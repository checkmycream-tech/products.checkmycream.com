      <li>I have used it for many many years, accordingly I was happy to find it at your shop thanks a lot</li>
      <li>Just dont srpay it on clothes - skin - :).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t buy cologne online only in store, but aside from that bit this is a GREAT cologne!</li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more as soon as this one runs out.</li>
      <li>Not too strong - not too soft - its perfect and worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This EDT is a nice, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a more citrusy/lighter smell than the Intense which I feel is more suitable for day wear.</li>
      <li>thought it would smell strong</li>
      <li>na, its fine.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too sweet and has a great masculine smell.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my stepson, but liked it so much that I got some for my husband</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>It was the exact same product, smells delicious, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>love for it made me wish to check out Play Intense, which I have now ordered online via a vendor, I just hope what is delivered is the scent I sampled in store...</li>
      <li>like it too much. :-)</li>
      <li>but Play has pretty much been very much imho worth the investment</li>
      <li>What happens when you go to buy something on Amazon and you use 1-click without checking your basket first?</li>
      <li>Love it, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>I seen this scent for the first time in another store at a very pricey rate.</li>
      <li>but wanted something new and fresh.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Intense version yet, but I plan to.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>he told me about GPlay and Play Intense.</li>
      <li>Not the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Not wanting to smell like Justin Timberlake, I passed on Play (haha).</li>
      <li>It has a leathery, citrus scent that makes it very versatile.</li>
      <li>Very androgynous scent, not too manly.  </li>
      <li>I WAS not a daily perfume user, do not need due to my heredity I guess to wear antiperspirant or deodorant, I am not a smelly guy, even when sweating... and don&#x27;t like heavy scents, but this was light, melodic and attractive enough for me to really immediately enjoy it.</li>
      <li>This is one I would highly recommend to anyone and for me it&#x27;s lasted awhile.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is very light, doesn&#x27;t last a long while, but something about it makes me want to spray it on the collar of my winter coat</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and the scent lasts all day and still smells good by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This is an absolutly devine sent, i tried out a few aftershaves and i came across this one, its a masculine light aroma with has a lasting effect and is tried and tested and adored by the opposit sex, definately a winner for a night out or a first date</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this brand for last 5 years and this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing the real thing next time.</li>
      <li>My 16 year old daughter helped me pick this out before I want on vacation to see my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>Like all other fragrances, go to the store and try it on yourself first.</li>
      <li>It is light enough for the summer (citrus) but has hints of leather and extracts from virile stags prancing in a wooded state park (or at least the chemicals evoke that image).</li>
      <li>About a few years ago when this cologne first came out, all Givenchy Play advertisements had pictures of Justin Timberlake all over them.</li>
      <li>, I have used half of the smaller bottle, and now wish I had gone with the large.</li>

    <li> Love this cologne and so does my husband. Smells so good We will purchase this again in the future. Thanks</li>
    <li> I smelled this coming from a customer one day, asked him what it was... he told me about GPlay and Play Intense. I went on by JCP... formerly not a frequent buyer of colognes- I more pick up oils from street vendors... I am a big fan of Tunisian Frankincense.... but wanted something new and fresh. I WAS not a daily perfume user, do not need due to my heredity I guess to wear antiperspirant or deodorant, I am not a smelly guy, even when sweating... and don&#x27;t like heavy scents, but this was light, melodic and attractive enough for me to really immediately enjoy it. The second I sampled GPlay (tried out at the makeup place in J C Penney, \\&quot;Sephora\\&quot; not all have them but a few in our area actually have the makeup/scent area)... I immediately fell in love with the scent. It is very light, doesn&#x27;t last a long while, but something about it makes me want to spray it on the collar of my winter coat so the smell is there every time I put it on. My lady LOVES this scent on me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love for it made me wish to check out Play Intense, which I have now ordered online via a vendor, I just hope what is delivered is the scent I sampled in store... I have to say, especially in store, the price of perfumes and colognes are ridiculous... I am sorry but 53 for a small and 71 for a large is just too damn much... but Play has pretty much been very much imho worth the investment, I have used half of the smaller bottle, and now wish I had gone with the large. I can say without a measure of a doubt, I will buy a large size of the Play scent when/if the small one I have is gone, I don&#x27;t think i can do without it now... like it too much. :-)</li>
    <li> This is an absolutly devine sent, i tried out a few aftershaves and i came across this one, its a masculine light aroma with has a lasting effect and is tried and tested and adored by the opposit sex, definately a winner for a night out or a first date (it will go down well)on the town or just even at work, definately distinctive and designer, i wear this everyday and use the shower gel wich i always keep avaliable in the bathroom. i rate 10/10 comes close to Jean Paul Gautier and Allure Chanelle sport for men which come at a 9/10 all i can say the seeing is believing or in this case Smelling xxx</li>
    <li> I ordered this for Dad, but he only wears it once in a while. I think he still prefers Jovan&#x27;s musk (circa 1984.)</li>
    <li> This EDT is a nice, fresh scent.  It reminds me of Hugo Element (peppery), but sweeter.  A great every day cologne.  The bottle is nice too, the spray button is covered by a rubber piece.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Intense version yet, but I plan to.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my stepson, but liked it so much that I got some for my husband (I have been known to spritz a bit on myself!) and brother.  A little goes a long way, and the scent lasts all day and still smells good by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing Play Intense for a few years now, but decided to get this as well as my day cologne. It has a more citrusy/lighter smell than the Intense which I feel is more suitable for day wear. Love it, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and daughter love it! My 16 year old daughter helped me pick this out before I want on vacation to see my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever.  Very androgynous scent, not too manly.  Perfect for people who like to smell good without making everyone choke when walking in a room.</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying cologne only since I have read reviews about fake knock off versions. I have been wearing this brand for last 5 years and this is the real deal. Smells great it&#x27;s not too sweet and has a great masculine smell.</li>
    <li> What happens when you go to buy something on Amazon and you use 1-click without checking your basket first? You order what ever was in your basket....my son figured this out. He knew that I make several purchases a week and he put it in my basket without telling me. I was surprised at the price and the quality that I did not even get mad at him! He is 15 and he heard that the girls at school liked the smell of this cologne so he thought he should get some so he too would smell good! I liked it so much I bought a bottle for my husband. Usually I get him Aqua Di Gio and I pay upto 90.00 a bottle so the price tag for this was wonderful in comparison. From what my sons twin sister reports, all the girls love how Chris smells now!</li>
    <li> About a few years ago when this cologne first came out, all Givenchy Play advertisements had pictures of Justin Timberlake all over them. Not wanting to smell like Justin Timberlake, I passed on Play (haha). What a mistake! This is good stuff. It has a leathery, citrus scent that makes it very versatile. This is the kind of cologne you can wear every day. You can go from the office to the bar/club without a hitch. It is light enough for the summer (citrus) but has hints of leather and extracts from virile stags prancing in a wooded state park (or at least the chemicals evoke that image). The scent lasts all day, but NOT ON YOUR CLOTHES. Spray it on your body (wrists, neck) and on your hair. A few spritzes should do it. Any more and you will look/smell tacky (see: stag beetle, not stag deer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $40 for this bottle on Amazon and now it&#x27;s even cheaper at $33. It costs $54 at the department store. Unlike some other colognes I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, this does not seem to be old stock, or if it is, you can&#x27;t tell because the cologne lasts all day and night. Like all other fragrances, go to the store and try it on yourself first. My ball-and-chain sniffed this on the tester paper and thought it was disgusting, but when she smelled it on me, let&#x27;s just say she revised her opinion. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Item came just as described. Will be purchasing more as soon as this one runs out.Packaging and everything was legit!</li>
    <li> I seen this scent for the first time in another store at a very pricey rate. It was the exact same product, smells delicious, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy cologne online only in store, but aside from that bit this is a GREAT cologne! It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorites and the ladies definitely compliment me on it all the time. This is one I would highly recommend to anyone and for me it&#x27;s lasted awhile. I&#x27;ve had it a couple years and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used it for many many years, accordingly I was happy to find it at your shop thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Not the real stuff. Very faint and you&#x27;ll end up using at least twice as much, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing the real thing next time.</li>
    <li> I had this product years back so I knew what I was getting. Has a great smell to it. So that&#x27;s why I gave it a great score.</li>
    <li> This smells great and ladies are loving it!</li>
    <li> Not too strong - not too soft - its perfect and worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would smell strong ( like you aveto spray it in the air and walk throught it)&lt;br /&gt;but na, its fine. Just dont srpay it on clothes - skin - :).</li>
