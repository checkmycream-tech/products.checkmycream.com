      <li>But, I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and was glad to see Amazon had it.</li>
      <li>I love this Color thank you</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars since it costs more than it should</li>
      <li>Have used L&#x27;Oreal for many many years.</li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I love this hair color.  </li>
      <li>I have used this color for many years now.  </li>
      <li>I love this color, and the color process includes a tube of preconditioner for your ends.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>so my figuring out how to use this product so that the final result perfectly matches</li>
      <li>SURE THEY HAVE A &#x27;REPLACEMENT&#x27;</li>
      <li>So glad to be able to find my favorite hair coloring.</li>
      <li>I also love the &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I can no longer find this in the stores and fortuantely was able to get it online.  </li>
      <li>lol Excellence Creme hair color leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Order process was quick and simple and I am very happy with the product and the condition it arrived in.</li>
      <li>NOT an essential, but THIS is REALLY good conditioner, so go ahead, treat yourself!  </li>
      <li>this is easy and quick!  </li>
      <li>This color is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Calculate precisely what time</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair and have been through a variety of shades by L&#x27;oreal over the years.</li>
      <li>I had no idea they made a \\&quot;light reddish blonde\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and am satisfied with the results,but I wish it was still available in the UK as it it very costly to have to purchase it from the USA.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, Natural Strawberry Blonde</li>
      <li>It is, by far, her favorite!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just the right color so far so good</li>
      <li>-  If ultra-concerned about how bright this&#x27;ll be, then only leave the dye on for 17 minutes.</li>
      <li>Gray coverage is good as well if after applying the color, the hair is covered in plastic (shower cap) and wrapped in a towel to add some warmth during the entire developing process.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I am delighted that amazon are stockists and hopefully will not have a problem in the future.</li>
      <li>YOU ALWAYS GET TRUE COLOR,</li>
      <li>I used to be able to go more than four weeks before I had to dye my hair, now within two weeks my gray is back.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It stays fresh longer than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Love the light reddish color to the blonde</li>
      <li>My natural color has turned flat over the years and light reddish blonde lightens up my tresses perfectly.</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was still readily available, particularly in the UK.</li>
      <li>This is the best permanent haircolor I&#x27;ve found for keeping the red a little longer.  </li>
      <li>The price is slightly higher, but it gets delivered right to my door.</li>
      <li>Better to underdo the timing of this, as that can easily be fixed by dying it again after it&#x27;s dry once more.  </li>
      <li>was just exactly what I wanted it</li>
      <li>Exercise caution, though, in that this dye will really only be effective if your hair is already light (blonde or red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this color!  </li>
      <li>The remainder of the developer creme, kept in its original bottle, and the permanent color creme, kept in its original tube, I put back in the Excellence creme box.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cover the grey as much as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>If, however, you wash out the hairdye exactly 18 minutes after you first began applying it:  </li>
      <li>Look at a clock for the exact time.  </li>
      <li>I used the shade darker than this, \\&quot;reddish blonde\\&quot;, for months, but I preferred the color left after it had mostly faded away from weeks of shampooing.</li>
      <li>Just exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Exact colour I wanted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d look like a cartoon character or rebellious teenager for the first two weeks or so.</li>
      <li>Also, the color is not as crisp as it used to be-</li>
      <li>I find that most of their dyes make it painfully obvious</li>
      <li>4:  After 18 minutes has gone by since you first began applying the dye, get in the shower and wash it all out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this color and Amazon is the only place I can find it now!!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use and is very close to my natural color.  </li>
      <li>I like the LIGHT Reddish Blonde as it&#x27;s very close to my original hair color.</li>
      <li>Might not cover the grey as well as I would like, it does wash out over the grey after a bit, but, still very nice.</li>
      <li>Thanks ever so much!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal 9RB for a very long time, maybe 10 or more years.</li>
      <li>But, they can also restassured that if they DON&#x27;T leave the mixed hair dye on too long, it WON&#x27;T come out too bright or brassy.  </li>
      <li>my ....nice and easy strawberry blonde 72R</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little to red, not as red-blonde as I would like.</li>
    <li> Great color and will order again</li>
    <li> Been using for very long time because the color is just right for me. Looks natural which is what I want since I&#x27;m not a teenager who wishes to look artificial.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; awesome gray coverage; beautiful color. I receive a lot of compliments about my hair color; love the conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> Love this color and the keratine pretreatment!  My hair looks and feels great!  Can&#x27;t find this color in the store!  Thanks ever so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and am satisfied with the results,but I wish it was still available in the UK as it it very costly to have to purchase it from the USA.</li>
    <li> Even though its Loreal I am beginning to see that all haircolor with peroxide is going to look drying and brassy after a very short while.  This is not exception.  Going to try cellophanes color to fill in gray hair.</li>
    <li> I was blond to start, Loreal 9RB did not take on my hair.  I went to Loreal 8RB and it took tooo well.  I went to &amp;#34;OOPS&amp;#34; and went back to my former haircolor.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend 9RB, except, maybe, to a person who has never colored their hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Covers all the grey and leaves my hair feeling so soft but manageable.</li>
    <li> Wish I could find this color at the store but like it very much I can buy it here!!! Thank You</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color.  If you want true non blue based red hair that is a light color- this is the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS PRODUCT SINCE IT CAME ON THE MARKET--SOME 20 YEARS--AND IT IS STILL THE BEST ONE OUT THERE! YOU ALWAYS GET TRUE COLOR, NEVER LOOKS LIKE IT WAS &amp;#34;JUST DONE&amp;#34;.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS THEY SEEM TO HAVE DISCONTINUED MY COLOR -- 9RB -- AND I AM NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT!  I&#x27;M SURE THEY HAVE A &#x27;REPLACEMENT&#x27; THOUGH SO WILL INQUIRE WITHIN!  CAN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY ENOUGH!</li>
    <li> Thank you I&#x27;ve got my red iconic head back!!! I totally loved it andIt was just exactly what I wanted it</li>
    <li> Thank you, just what I needed to cover that gray!  Thanks for offering L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence Crème with Pro-Keratine Complex</li>
    <li> Produces the color I want! Great color for my hair and skin tone. Just wish it was available in local stores.</li>
    <li> Love this color and Amazon is the only place I can find it now!!  Was paying to have my hair professionally colored but decided to go back to doing myself to save money.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair, but was so disappointed when I thought they had discontinued the 9rb - amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> It seems that all reddish blonde colors have become almost impossible to find  --  this is easy and quick!  ANd even quicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this color!  I think it looks like rose gold.  A coupe people god me it looks pink, just so you know.  But I&#x27;d rather be a pink haired old lady than a blue haired one!</li>
    <li> - I&#x27;ve used this 9RB Excellence L&#x27;Oreal hair dye for 10 years now.  It really is my natural color (before graying!) so my figuring out how to use this product so that the final result perfectly matches the color displayed on the box adds a wonderful help to my life.  With the positive reinforcement of looking as beautiful as I should in the mirror!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:  Throw away the tube of pre-color serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  Applying this prevents the coloring dye from working; that is what the pre-color serum is for.  But if you wanted to prevent that, why on earth would you have bought the coloring dye to begin with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:  Mix an equal amount of the developer creme with the permanent color cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - You could mix ALL of the developer creme with ALL of the permanent color cream; that&#x27;d automatically be 100% just right.  I use a ceramic bowl and a spoon to mix, mix, mix those two cremes very well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  I&#x27;m as low income as it gets.  So, I estimate as carefully as possible what 1/2 of the permanent color cream is once it&#x27;s in my ceramic bowl, and then what 1/2 of the developer creme is when I add that to it.  The remainder of the developer creme, kept in its original bottle, and the permanent color creme, kept in its original tube, I put back in the Excellence creme box.  A month or two later the saved, not-mixed developer creme and permanent color creme still work every bit as well as they would&#x27;ve originally.  So, with one box of L&#x27;Oreal Excellence 9RB creme, I can dye my shoulder-length hair twice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3:  Look at a clock for the exact time.  Calculate precisely what time it&#x27;ll be 18 minutes from now.  Next scoop up the mixed hair dye from the ceramic bowl with your fingertips (I do NOT have sensitive skin; but I&#x27;ve never had to wear gloves) and rub it into your DRY hair as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  Hair grows starting from inside your scalp to out.  Therefore, you need to focus on rubbing tight right against your scalp, using firm scrunching motions with your fingers against your scalp, to ensure your hair&#x27;ll come out looking nicely colored for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  Applying the dye all over only takes about 5 minutes.  Next, wash your hands well and wait.  Hairdye will drip off a bit.  It&#x27;ll permanently stain things and isn&#x27;t the safest substance either, so I usually wait right in the bathroom.  It could be a good time to  start shaving your legs (how I use that wait time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4:  After 18 minutes has gone by since you first began applying the dye, get in the shower and wash it all out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  Washing it out with just plain water or else with shampoo seem to have always had the exact same results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  If ultra-concerned about how bright this&#x27;ll be, then only leave the dye on for 17 minutes. But, leaving it on less than 17 minutes just won&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - WARNING:  The longer the hairdye is left on AFTER 18 minutes the brighter and brassier it&#x27;ll appear!  Ignore the instructions that come with the hairdye about leaving it on for 30 to 40 minutes.  Doing THAT would be sure to give you color as bright as a clown!  If, however, you wash out the hairdye exactly 18 minutes after you first began applying it:  Tah-dah!  Your hair will come out precisely the same light reddish blonde color that&#x27;s shown on the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 5:  After the shower water runs clear because all the dye has washed out of your hair, apply the conditioning treatment and leave it on for 5 minutes or so.  It&#x27;s just regular conditioner.  NOT an essential, but THIS is REALLY good conditioner, so go ahead, treat yourself!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 44 year old Caucasian woman with graying, naturally curly, light reddish-blonde hair.  People with other skin and hair colors, or with straight hair, will probably need to change that 18 minutes to find the time that works just right for THEM.  But, they can also restassured that if they DON&#x27;T leave the mixed hair dye on too long, it WON&#x27;T come out too bright or brassy.  Better to underdo the timing of this, as that can easily be fixed by dying it again after it&#x27;s dry once more.  Then, on the second try, just leave the dye on a touch longer.  No problem.  Mine now comes out perfectly every time, having figured this all out on my own.  Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> Update 8/13/14:&lt;br /&gt;This summer the first box (I ordered 2) did not completely cover my white hair (Gingers get white, not gray). The temples and new growth did not take and within 4 weeks there was alot showing. I did the second box and got the same results - no coverage. Also, the color is not as crisp as it used to be- a tad dull. Not sure if product is really old but the color is blah and my temples and new growth are white!  I will write the mfr and see what I can learn - Will share if they reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my natural color (with lots of white now) and cannot find this shade anywhere in the stores in Houston! Was so happy to find it here... It was delivered as promised on time. I love it because the color is multi-dimensional and it doesn&#x27;t small nasty or drip.  I will be buying it again!  The only thing I would take a star away for is that it only ships right away if it is an \\&quot;ADD ON ITEM\\&quot; - that part stinks!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to order this on line since for some unexplained reason none of the stores (of any variety) carry this color number 9RB.  I&#x27;ve used this for probably 20 years and it&#x27;s always been great.  Might not cover the grey as well as I would like, it does wash out over the grey after a bit, but, still very nice.</li>
    <li> Same as what was ordered. Will order again.</li>
    <li> on a redhead...color is a little brassy......miss my ....nice and easy strawberry blonde 72R</li>
    <li> I love this Color thank you</li>
    <li> I love this color and it is getting hard er to find locally.  The vendor was wonderful and very prompt. I would definitely use them again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, but have been having problems finding my color in the stores. As a result, I began purchasing it online. The price is slightly higher, but it gets delivered right to my door. It does not run, and comes with a conditioner that makes the color last longer. I love it.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I needed.  Can&#x27;t find this color in local stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this color for many years now.  It is easy to use and is very close to my natural color.  I have to buy it from Amazon now since the stores around here aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore.  I gave it 4 stars since it costs more than it should and I can&#x27;t use the coupons that L&#x27;Oreal gives out.</li>
    <li> I love it, just the colour I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I had many compliments on this beautiful color. I would purchase this product again and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for my faded red/gray hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just the right color so far so good</li>
    <li> This color is no longer available. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll so when these are gone!</li>
    <li> My favorate L&#x27;Oreal color of all times. Order process was quick and simple and I am very happy with the product and the condition it arrived in. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to lighten red hair. I also love the &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; formula as it does not drip, etc.</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to find my favorite hair coloring. I have not been able to find it in my area for the last few months. Amazon is the best go to place I have found. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellence balance between red and blonde...</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product religiously!  It is, by far, her favorite!  The price is right and the product is the best!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color.  It stays fresh longer than others I&#x27;ve used and I keep returning to L&#x27;Oreal.  Red hair color is notoriously difficult and tends to fade quickly.  This is the best permanent haircolor I&#x27;ve found for keeping the red a little longer.  Gray coverage is good as well if after applying the color, the hair is covered in plastic (shower cap) and wrapped in a towel to add some warmth during the entire developing process.  I also keep the color on about 40 minutes vice the 30 minutes recommended in the instructions.  I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and after using this product, my hair feels silky and is much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this in the stores and fortuantely was able to get it online.  The product has performed as it should and I am very pleased with the results.  I have used this product and color for years now.</li>
    <li> I am a strawberry blonde to redhead.... this is a nice summer color but does not cover grays. I am only gray around the temples but gray enough to see and bother me. This lightened my hair color a bit but did not add color to the white-grays at all... so I am in no better position than where I started (except have to wait to re-color so I dont damage my hair more.)</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Have used L&#x27;Oreal for many many years.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this because only my hairdresser should know that I color my hair. lol Excellence Creme hair color leaves my hair soft and shiny. My natural color has turned flat over the years and light reddish blonde lightens up my tresses perfectly. I especially like the tube of conditioner that comes with the kit.</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair and have been through a variety of shades by L&#x27;oreal over the years. I find that most of their dyes make it painfully obvious your hair was just dyed... and not in a good way. It was even worse with their red shades. I&#x27;d look like a cartoon character or rebellious teenager for the first two weeks or so. I used the shade darker than this, \\&quot;reddish blonde\\&quot;, for months, but I preferred the color left after it had mostly faded away from weeks of shampooing. I finally ran across this shade! I had no idea they made a \\&quot;light reddish blonde\\&quot;. Now, I get that natural strawberry blonde without waiting for the dye to fade out. It&#x27;s perfect right out of the box. I wish more stores kept it in stock!</li>
    <li> Old and used? Will not order again!</li>
    <li> I love this color, and the color process includes a tube of preconditioner for your ends. Color stays true for a long time, especially using the Evercream shampoo line. People stop me just to compliment my hair color. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have had a real struggle to buy this particular hair colour . It is not available in any shops  in London for some reason. Anyway, I am delighted that amazon are stockists and hopefully will not have a problem in the future.</li>
    <li> This was very easy to apply, I love the comb for applying the color! However the color is not really a strawberry blonde as stated. It is a pretty blonde shade, but no red tones at all. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Love the light reddish color to the blonde</li>
    <li> At last my natural colour in a box! Wish it was still readily available, particularly in the UK. Please continue to stock it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover the grey as much as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> It gave me the color that was on the box, but it is no longer the color for me-however, that is not the fault of L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Natural Strawberry Blonde</li>
    <li> Exact colour I wanted. Delivery in 2 days which was exceptional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal 9RB for a very long time, maybe 10 or more years. I like the LIGHT Reddish Blonde as it&#x27;s very close to my original hair color. But, I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and was glad to see Amazon had it. I don&#x27;t like the new formula! It doesn&#x27;t hold for as long as it used to. I used to be able to go more than four weeks before I had to dye my hair, now within two weeks my gray is back. I haven&#x27;t changed any of my other hair products, been using the same stuff for years, so can only think it&#x27;s the new formula. Gonna have to try another brand.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the model on the packaging:  Although this dye has a little strawberry blonde in it, it&#x27;s still an amazing option for those who want a very natural red-head look.  Exercise caution, though, in that this dye will really only be effective if your hair is already light (blonde or red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hoping that they never discontinue this shade!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair color, and it&#x27;s hard to find.  Thanks Amazon for always having what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I used this today, the color and texture are just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve looked for this color for about six years.</li>
