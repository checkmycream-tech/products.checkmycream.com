      <li>said:)</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I plan to go here alot more often  </li>

      <li>I should have known better</li>
      <li>and i am not only pleased with the price but with the superb quality as well</li>
      <li>Needs to be fuller and maybe more pieces to work better.</li>
      <li>I honestly love it.</li>
      <li>I still love and wear!!been buying hair all over town slc</li>
      <li>Better off going to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and getting them there or ordering them off their website.</li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>I feel in love.</li>
      <li>trust me your money would be better off somewhere else.</li>
      <li>I along with 7 more agents in this town wear extensions.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend :)</li>
      <li>I will be buying more(:</li>
      <li>Look real, feel real, I love them.</li>
      <li>But all in all they curl great and are so soft!</li>
      <li>These extensions are not that bad...light weight and easy to clip in.</li>
      <li>Gets tangled way too easily</li>
      <li>This IS 100% real human hair, which is the best kind of hair extensions you can get because you can apply heat freely, dye, wash, whatever you would normally do to style your real/natural hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it makes my hair more beautiful &amp; long and full.</li>
      <li>Delivery was early, they were packaged fine, no lint, no smell, and length was amazing!</li>
      <li>so it looks fine.</li>

      <li>All I have to say, is they better be worth the wait</li>
      <li>The color is nice &amp; feels real.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy overall.</li>
      <li>They are cheap, and</li>
      <li>but besides that this is a legit product that I personally enjoy using and I fully recommend</li>
      <li>The hair was a really good quality for the price, the only reason I give 4 stars instead of two is because I felt the packaging could have been better.</li>
      <li>I will most certainly order again soon!</li>
      <li>For one you need to order two packages to feel like you have the correct thickness for a full head of hair, and two who wants a head full of clips on top of clips like that pulling on your hair?!</li>
      <li>definetly worth the money I paid!</li>
      <li>so I just take the straightener to it lightly and do really quick strokes that seams to not burn it off</li>
      <li>They were bright red</li>
      <li>like bright red!</li>
      <li>I had to order 2 sets just to make it look like I have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>We got the hair and my daughter was able to put it in and blend in very well.</li>
      <li>THE HAIR IS NOT AS FULL</li>
      <li>I really would have bought some cheaper and better from Sally beauty supply</li>
      <li>Although they are really hair you might want to buy more than one set.</li>
      <li>okay if you just want straight hair.</li>
      <li>I love they so much, They are everything I hope for.</li>
      <li>Definately worth it to spend more money on the real stuff.</li>
      <li>the hair needs to be thicker, its beautiful just way too thin , you have to purchase more than one to have a full head</li>
      <li>I have bought numerous sets of extentions and these were pretty good for the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrible. I ordered dark brown and it came in red. States it&#x27;s real hair but I tried to dye it to match my hair color and it didn&#x27;t change AT ALL. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING</li>
    <li> Havent recieved product its been 45 days since purchase</li>
    <li> VERY thin. Although they are really hair you might want to buy more than one set.</li>
    <li> Extensions are a completely different color than they appear online. They look very cheap. I dislike the product I received. Too much of a hassle to return though.</li>
    <li> i received mine really fast. i absolutely love them.the only issue i had was that i would&#x27;ve liked for the extensions to be thicker.</li>
    <li> Was not at all what it said. Only seven pieces of hair not ten, too thin, can see right through it.single not double pieces. They had dirt in them. Looked like bugs.  I just want my money back. Very upset.</li>
    <li> The color matched perfectly I was very pleased on how real the hair feels and how I can curl, straighten and wash with no problem. BUT there is not enough hair on each track. I have to wear all of them in order to make them look good and not all of them fit :( very disappointed ugh...</li>
    <li> Delivery was early, they were packaged fine, no lint, no smell, and length was amazing! I have really thick hair and one package was more than enough I am very satisfied, I have not curled them or dyed them yet tho but it&#x27;ll probably turn out great. I will be buying more(:</li>
    <li> I bought these extentions just to add more volume to my hair! i got these to blend them in with my other extentions and they blended really well!! If you buy these i recommend buying about 3-4 packs.  They are very thin about 100grams each section and its not enough to make your hair look natural ! i recomend buying Milani Hair extentions or from sallys then buying these and blending them in ! &#x3D;}</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they were so thin at the ends that my stylist cut about 2 inches. But all in all they curl great and are so soft!</li>
    <li> I just got mine this morning, and they&#x27;re just what I hoped for (:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought different extensions in the past that were more expensive and these are actually extremely good, especially for the price they&#x27;re at. GREAT service, shipped fast! I&#x27;m happy overall.</li>
    <li> I love they so much, They are everything I hope for. This was the second time I bought extensions (they frist ones bring horrible and low quality), and they were so lush and soft and Iam actually wearing them now and they are simply wonder. I plan to go here alot more often  when I need to buys some. I really would recommed these!</li>
    <li> Good but slow timeing</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them.  And the color is perfect. I&#x27;d recommend them if your hair is medium brown and you know how to use them.</li>
    <li> It says you can curl or straighten but when I use my straightener on them it literally conches the hair completely off so I just take the straightener to it lightly and do really quick strokes that seams to not burn it off</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible quality! Will never wear these. They are horrible. The hair has lint and other debris attached to it. Its gross</li>
    <li> I thought it was real human hair. It&#x27;s synthetic hair. It said it was 100 grams but its to thin.</li>
    <li> I order a lot of extensions online and i am not only pleased with the price but with the superb quality as well</li>
    <li> Hair fell out alot more then i would have liked, and it always tangled up. i wouldn&#x27;t buy again.N</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter that&#x27;s 11 and they matched her hair perfect and they are very easy to put in also they are thick and look like real hair in fact she doesn&#x27;t even use all of them she only puts 6 in that&#x27;s how thick they are we are very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is synthetic hair and has a red tint to it it is definitely not 02</li>
    <li> These extensions are just perfect I bought some other ones that were dark brown and they matched perfectly. I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding so far and the wefts are done well. The hair itself is fluffy and light out of packaged I have not washed it yet so I am not sure what it will look like after being washed. Do not overuse product on these you will end up with dead greasy looking hair.</li>
    <li> They are absolutely amazing. I was so terrified to order these because of the bad reviews but they are perfect but I&#x27;d recomend ordering two because they are a little thin but not to bad!!!!</li>
    <li> Came in five days. I have naturally thickish curly hair (16 yr old mixed people probs haha) and they blended. I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t, but they did. Super happy! Buying from this seller forever! I can wash them and dye them and they still look good. Like after a shower I don&#x27;t have to dry them... My hair can be curly and they have a little wave to them when wet so it looks fine. All around amazing! You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get these :)</li>
    <li> These were defineitly not was I was hoping for, very very thin and stringy also had quite a few split ends. My hair is 17 inches long and I just wanted a little longer length but it&#x27;s far too thin to wear straight, it&#x27;s very obvious that it&#x27;s not real. Also I paid for two day shipping and revived it in 5, overall; not impressed.</li>
    <li> I still love and wear!!been buying hair all over town slc and this is the better way to go need to buy two for this detailed good deal love love how cheap could of been thicker over all good shipping took two weeks since i order from china post</li>
    <li> These are amazing and so soft and  real just like the review said. I will most certainly order again soon!</li>
    <li> I think the hair is way to  thin it was very noticeably I had extensions on.. Didn&#x27;t like waist of my money</li>
    <li> came from china so i cant return it.  hair is thin and limp. doesnt even look like real hair.</li>
    <li> Disliked. Very thin at the ends. The color was more of a very light brown when I was expecting dark brown. Wouldnt spend my money on them.</li>
    <li> These were god awful. I bought them thinking they would be a little thin and that would be the only issue but no. 1. They definitely were not human hair that silicone feel never goes away. 2. They so do not hold a curl. 3 they shed bad. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> I just got mine about 5 minutes ago.. I opened them &amp; they stink. I got all the stuff off of them &amp; ran my fingers through them and pulled out a gob of hair. I looked at the quality of the clips and the hair is so thin you can see the clips through the hair.  I put them back in the package already .. there not even worth wearing.</li>
    <li> I wish they were alot thicker but you get what you paid for i hardly use there ones their not as good quality as i wished and after a few curlings ive done to them i notices at the ends it looks sort of like when you burn not human hair</li>
    <li> was received on time and the product is great was I expected. THE HAIR IS NOT AS FULL BUT ITS WEEL WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> This product is not worthy of any stars. This is not my first time ordering hair extensions and what I recieved is NOT human hair! I&#x27;m very angry that I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels like doll hair .</li>
    <li> These are synthetic .. I waited a month for these thinking I can straighten them, dye them whatever and when I first got them I straighten them out so glad it was a single piece but it melted on to my straightener . tried dying them didn&#x27;t work stayed the same dark brown. Guys don&#x27;t waist your money on these.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to the reviews. Too thin and the hair started falling out the moment I opened the package. Not good, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my hair more beautiful &amp; long and full. The color is nice &amp; feels real.</li>
    <li> These were the most beautiful extensions I&#x27;ve bought yet and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I highly recommend these extensions. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed.  I along with 7 more agents in this town wear extensions.  I was going to recommend then to go to Amazon.  I&#x27;m sorry to report they are way to thin, not a straight edge at bottom and if u try to use a hot iron on them they fry..hence that I paid again for Real Human Hair and got  synthetic.</li>
    <li> these are the WORST extensions i have ever ordered! for one, they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;human hair.&amp;#34; it&#x27;s like doll hair. i couldn&#x27;t style it..at all. &amp; two, it wasn&#x27;t in &amp;#34;dark brown.&amp;#34; they were red! like bright red! they didn&#x27;t even last me a week. i&#x27;ve never had a problem ordering from amazon..but this, definitely was a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> For one you need to order two packages to feel like you have the correct thickness for a full head of hair, and two who wants a head full of clips on top of clips like that pulling on your hair?! Better off going to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and getting them there or ordering them off their website. Also had a weird smell to them. Def not satisfied.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to recieve this item but they were shipped from china lol im not exactly sure they are real cause real hair is usually soft and these are kind of rough but ill see what happens when i wash them theyre thin when you look at them but really thick when you put them in. The length is correct they are super long real or not i love this product! These hair extensions are in fact real. After applying tons of conditioned the moisture came back and the feel as healthy as if they were still attached to the head. I straightened and curled them with no problem at all if they were fake the strands would have melted together and I&#x27;m proud to say that they did not. Being into cosmetology I am very pleased with this product!It deffinately deserves five stars!</li>
    <li> Alright, so I read every review before buying these and I ignored the bad ones thinking they were just picky customers. But I literally wore them twice before I have to throw them away. They&#x27;re not real hair, and they get tangled in less than a minute. Also they don&#x27;t curl at all. When I held a piece over a lighter they were melting like plastic, not singeing like real hair. Waste of money for sure.</li>
    <li> the hair needs to be thicker, its beautiful just way too thin , you have to purchase more than one to have a full head</li>
    <li> DOES NOT CURL. This product is synthetic all the way. Tangles easy and if you try and brush the hair, it gets matted and disgusting.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give zero stars.  I waited for over a month for these extensions  to arrive.  When I got them they did look very nice and full but they are NOT real hair as advertised.  I tried straightening one of the wefts and it shrunk up and melted together.  Very disappointed.  I Want a replacement made of REAL hair as promised.  I don&#x27;t want to pay to send the hair back either.  So mad right now!! Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. If you have a problem with the product the seller is helpful and does what they can to work with you and make you happy</li>
    <li> These had like no hair on them and the color was so off. worst buy for hair extensions. trust me your money would be better off somewhere else.</li>
    <li> sucks don&#x27;t buy. its fake hair and its a mess wish I didn&#x27;t buy this..waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and while the color is what we expected, the clips constantly fall off/out of the track. I would NOT spend the money on these again.</li>
    <li> Horrible, I wanna barf when I look at the hair......This hair ain&#x27;t no Remy. The quality is poor, and the packaging is even worse. False advertising.</li>
    <li> Poor poor never received</li>
    <li> For starters let&#x27;s clarify that these extensions are only 100g, it takes anywhere between 150-250g for a full head, so don&#x27;t order just one pack thinking it will blend and be full because it won&#x27;t. The hair is very pretty, soft, and shiny however I have not even worn them once and hair is already falling out in chunks....the chunks can be put back in just looks like poor craftsmanship. If you intend to wear extensions everyday, I do not, I would look into a better quality piece.</li>
    <li> Took them to be done perfessionally, they were to light and would not take in the dye.....not real hair......would return for my money if I could.</li>
    <li> I ordered remy human hit extensions and received synthetic hair. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The shipping time was rediculous and it is not human hair because I flat ironed it and it once and it now feels stiff. Definately worth it to spend more money on the real stuff. This was definitely false advertisement. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> You know that saying, &amp;#34; you get what you pay for!&amp;#34; Same with this item. HORRIBLE!!( hair is too thin, unable to curl, nor you can not brush with a comb without hair coming out;(( this product is for people with very thin hair that needs a boost. Not good for women of hair!/</li>
    <li> I was so upset with this item because it says it&#x27;s human hair in the description, also there name is coco human hair and when I received it in the mail I found out it was synthetic hair not even a little bit of human hair it was shiny and it def. Wouldn&#x27;t match anyone&#x27;s hair or looked like a barbie dolls hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone when I tried straightening it some of the hair fell out.</li>
    <li> I like that my stuff came earlier then they said. really nice people. i just wish they put where its coming from haha. Other then that i was happy.thank you!</li>
    <li> I am only giving this product a one star because i have to. This item is a waste of money. They state that they are 100% human hair and they definitely are not. They are like silk and they do absolutely nothing but make you hair look stringy. They do not take curls whatsoever even with product and they barely straighten. Terrible quality extensions.</li>
    <li> Not human hair. Clips broke when first used. Worst order I&#x27;ve made</li>
    <li> I was not that impressed with the clips that hold the extension in nor how stringy the ends of the extensions were. But the hair was very easy to straighten or curl.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on March 5th, and I still have not received them. When I looked at my estimated arrival date, it said between March 29th and April 16th. I was not even given a shipping option, just forced to use regular, standard shipping. All I have to say, is they better be worth the wait or it&#x27;ll have just been a huge waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering extention, i love them so much the hair is so soft and they dont damage that easily</li>
    <li> These extensions are not that bad...light weight and easy to clip in. I had to dye them for the color I wanted but it worked. They are not super thick, they cannot be worn straight but they look good curled.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.. very thin and fake hair.</li>
    <li> really thin, if you have thick hair you will need a LOT!</li>
    <li> I have bought numerous sets of extentions and these were pretty good for the money. They are very long and shiny, one pack would be sufficiant for length but if u have short, fine hair like mine u need two packs to make it look natural...color was a bit lighter then depicted and not a big fan of the clips so far, but they are a good cheap buy for a change up. I was also very pleased with the shipping. They came really quick :) one last note, once u get them let the, air out a bit before putting them in, they dont smell bad, just processed or something</li>
    <li> I loved these extensions. They&#x27;re great. They were a little thinner then I expected, but they work just fine. Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Really wouldnt have gave this a star at all if it didnt make me. But iteam doesn&#x27;t curl or style at all. Just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Fake hair. This just pisses me off. You sell lies and disappointment, but in all reality where do you get real human hair for 20$? I should have known better but if you say you&#x27;re selling 100% real human hair then you sell 100% human hair.</li>
    <li> This hair was not what I ordered. The picture shows the brand I usually get, but when they arrived they were synthetic hair, very poor quality, wouldn&#x27;t take the dye, wouldn&#x27;t curl, and turned into an uncontrollable tangle mess after only a few days. NOT worth it</li>
    <li> Hair is not real..tangles and cant curl it</li>
    <li> Needs to be fuller and maybe more pieces to work better. Just seems thin and needs more hair per section</li>
    <li> The hair I received messed up so quickly, and it wasn&#x27;t a number 2! So dissapointed</li>
    <li> These were horrible! They were bright red and they were synthetic so I wasn&#x27;t able to dye them, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed, these were absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> It is nice quality hair. The only problem  I have with it is that it was thin. I needed another pack.</li>
    <li> This hair is great! So soft!! I read some bad reviews and was a little scared about what I was getting. But they are so soft. They aren&#x27;t dark brown. They are a medium brown. But they took so well to hair dye! And they are still soft! I recommend these to anyone who wants to add length or volume. One lack is a little thin but two are amazing!</li>
    <li> These were very cheap and very cheaply made. I had to order 2 sets just to make it look like I have a full head of hair. A total waste of $90.00. If I could I would return. Do not recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> We got the hair and my daughter was able to put it in and blend in very well. definitely recommend if you are interested in hair extensions.</li>
    <li> its not real human hair. dores not curl up but for the price great buy</li>
    <li> This hair is not real it is fake as can be...NOT REMY NOT HUMAN FAKKKKE ITS A SCAM DONT BUY NOT even packaged right!!!!!</li>
    <li> the hair extentions are a little thinner than expected but they are the right length an color as listed in the description. definetly worth the money I paid!</li>
    <li> Althought it  is good quality synthetic they&#x27;re unnaturally shiny, coarse and obviously not human hair. I&#x27;m extremely upset that I wasted money on this,  I have no use for them and I definitely would not reccomend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty and long! I honestly love it. The packaging was crap, left a dint in it... Also... They aren&#x27;t human hair. These were the only cheap extensions i could find and wanted to dye them lighter, but the dye wouldn&#x27;t take. That&#x27;s very dissapointing. Otherwise, pretty good stuff!</li>
    <li> Like:&lt;br /&gt;The color&lt;br /&gt;That there 20 inches long&lt;br /&gt;Full head&lt;br /&gt;Human hair&lt;br /&gt;High quality&lt;br /&gt;Grams&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy in my hair&lt;br /&gt;Fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Came Earlier Then Expected ! 😊 .. But, Its NOT Real Human Hair ... It Is Dark Brown &amp;&amp; Long As Expected ..</li>
    <li> These are 20inch dark brown. BUT THESE ARE NOT HUMAN HAIR. They are SYNTHETIC. They tangle they can&#x27;t be dyed nor curled. Which is very disappointing. And I only get 50%  back of my money which is very upsetting.</li>
    <li> Very thin, extremely straight that its hard to curl, and they don&#x27;t dye.</li>
    <li> Gets tangled way too easily</li>
    <li> Perfect! Look real, feel real, I love them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not human hair. Melted under heat and not the right color. I got blonde and I ordered dark brown. After waiting for 2 months for the package I got the wrong stuff.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Recieved order a month and half later! Description says REAL HUMAN HAIR. I received SYNTHETIC HAIR! worst purchase ever!</li>
    <li> If they was real human hair they should curl...and they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t curl them and loses strands constantly. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do anything it that is said you can do them I really would have bought some cheaper and better from Sally beauty supply</li>
    <li> This IS 100% real human hair, which is the best kind of hair extensions you can get because you can apply heat freely, dye, wash, whatever you would normally do to style your real/natural hair. Now the wefts are thin which means you&#x27;ll probably need two packs like I did but besides that this is a legit product that I personally enjoy using and I fully recommend</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering hair extensions. And man can i say they are wonderful!! they are a dark brown. NOT black. They are very soft and are easily to be combed too. I feel in love. not only cuz i missed long hair but that fact that it was amazing and human hair. i would reccomened this item to EVERYONE it is anazing. and only took 1 week for shipping. (: Ill be ordering more soon.!</li>
    <li> they cant not be curled like advertised!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Unless you want to be ripped off, do not buy these hair extensions. They do not color or curl. The only way they do curl is if you heat up a piece and then wrap it around your finger for it to curl. If you want to return them, they only offer 40% of your money back. Other than that, you get what you pay for. They are cheap, and okay if you just want straight hair.</li>
    <li> I just love the clip in hair extensions, even though I have not put them in just yet. Yes they are thin, but what do you expect with hair that cost only 17 dollars. I have thick healthy long hair, so ordered two, so nowI will order two more, to have a different style. I think that this hair is a great investment!</li>
    <li> Hair wouldn&#x27;t curl disappointed.  Prompt customer service.</li>
    <li> Is there any chance i could get this in two days ? I have Prom and i really want to wear them !</li>
    <li> The ends get matted very easily, but the hair itself is a really good dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to sew more clips onto them, and make the clips that were already present, fastened down tighter cause after I wore them twice, they came off the track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, and then you get them wet, they have a cute natural wave to them. I like it.</li>
    <li> 7 pcs - was suppose to be one pc - color great&lt;br /&gt;wrong color on top one - was red and not human as advertised</li>
    <li> I just received these! Love them. They&#x27;re really soft and they come in dark brown like the packg said:) Very pleased. They&#x27;re beautiful.</li>
    <li> More better than expected... I will purchase the same one soon to make sure I will have a back up one.</li>
    <li> The hair was very thin I bought two packs and I still hardly had a pony tails worth I would not recommend these hair was already falling out and didn&#x27;t feel quite like real human hair....</li>
    <li> The hair was a really good quality for the price, the only reason I give 4 stars instead of two is because I felt the packaging could have been better. Also the hair had many pieces of lint in it and needed to be washed prior to using but other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product . The hair did not match the grams of weight and made my hair look like string. The extensions did not blend at all and i would not recomnmened</li>
