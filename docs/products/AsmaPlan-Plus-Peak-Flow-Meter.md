<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the product.  Easy to use, easy to clean. I would recommend this product. Great price.  Shipped earlier than expected, which was a definite plus.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for daycare, grandparents, etc to know when my daughter needs her inhaler. Makes people much more comfortable with know when she needs it. Plus it goes down to 50 I think. Which is great for her since her peak flow is 100. I bought another one before this and it didn&#x27;t go low enough for her.</li>
    <li> Needed a simple flow meter to use for my asthma. This one is small enough to carry in a purse if needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been recommended by my daughters doctor to get a peak flow meter.  The one they recommended, wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Stick&amp;#34; to the setting.  This makes it really difficult for a 10yo to mark the final output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS METER DOES stick the highest setting.  Works flawlessly.  This solves a problem, and answers how well my daughter is breathing.  I liked it so much I bought a 2nd (one for Moms one for Dads).</li>
    <li> Item as described/pictured and easy to use. All one piece.</li>
    <li> peak flow meter for kids and adults.  Really a no frills meter.  Easy to use. Somewhat bulky for trips however.</li>
    <li> This works great for what I was needing,  Easy to travel with and put in my purse.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Not accurate at all. Way off scale.</li>
    <li> A solid product, at a great price and shipped quickly. Could not have asked for more.</li>
    <li> The numbers on my peak flows were rubbing off. This was the cheapest option on the market at $12 at the time. It is consistant with the peak flow meters I got from my pulminologist, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> asthma and COPD must have. it give you an objective result on how short of breath you are</li>
    <li> Seems cheaply made.  I wish I&#x27;d spent more money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use.  Fit in most bags</li>
    <li> Since I was diagnosed with asthma, I wanted to know what my peak flow is so I can know when I need to up my meds. This peak flow meter works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Have not had to use it but tested out ok.</li>
    <li> this is a great thing to have to check how you are breathing during the day.This way you dont have to medicate unless itsvery low peak flow</li>
    <li> Had used a flow meter years ago and recently had to use it again. The price was good compared to more expensive ones and does the job quite well</li>
    <li> It does what the description says. It is very simple and easy to use. I had a few problems with the part that moves getting stuck, but it was easy to fix and does not occur very often.</li>
    <li> Just a expected. Fast shipping! A+ experience!</li>
    <li> I did not like the item</li>
    <li> Good quality and very accurate.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The the numbers are very, very small and close together.  I have decent eyesight but even my 9 year old has to &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; look at it to figure out the reading.</li>
    <li> This one offered through Amazon beats every pharmacy I had contacted, and often by more than 30% which is a substantial discount. I recommend anyone looking for a flow meter to look no further than Amazon because you WILL NOT find the same quality meter, same model for the same price, period.</li>
    <li> Not sure how you can &#x27;like&#x27; or &#x27;love&#x27; a peak flow meter. This meter does its job and it is VERY basic.</li>
    <li> it works nice and easy for my 12 year old and she says always that she doesnt have time to waste...</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work and its not accurate. do not waste your money like i did</li>
    <li> Would absolutely recommend. The peak flow meter offered at the pharmacy was $25.&lt;br /&gt;This one was a great price, delivered quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and a great price. Good tool for measuring peak flow. Side note: I&#x27;m a Registered Respiratory Therapist.</li>
    <li> Good service, Great price</li>
    <li> The peak flow meter is a necessity when one has asthma but insurance does not cover it. being able to buy this was a God send for me, the price here at pharmacy was too high for my very limited budget. Thank you!</li>
