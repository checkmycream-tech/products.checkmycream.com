      <li>but I&#x27;m sure she will as she uses your product faithfully!</li>
      <li>This product works great at removing makeup and leaves skin feeling clean but not greasy.</li>
      <li>This product is far and away the best.  </li>
      <li>Then the rest of my face tends to be oily and this is where I tend to have most of my break-outs and blackheads.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, Mrs. Kelly Lang  P.S.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure to follow up with a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>So if you buy this product make sure you love it and or have tried it somewhere else</li>
      <li>My favorite face wash -</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this item in the stores anymore, and am so glad Amazon sellers still stock it.</li>
      <li>I love this item.  </li>
      <li>Can easily remove eye makeup too!&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face feels clean and smooth all over, but most important my acne has dissaperared.</li>
      <li>I just wish I could still get it in stores but the most gentle and best remover of makeup and NEVER leaves my face dry!</li>
      <li>my face looks youthful, glowing and smooth..</li>
      <li>and I am so excited to see what I look like in three months from now.</li>
      <li>I have dealt with Rosacea for most of my adult life and most cleansers aggravate my skin and cause scaliness.</li>
      <li>it leaves my face feeling silky clean, almost like you have already applied a foundation primer.</li>
      <li>It does clean my face, but I have not seen miracles yet.</li>
      <li>Your skin feels clean and refreshed and would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a huge amount (economical), and it removes makeup and dirt like a dream.</li>
      <li>Good face cleanser, simple to use.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I have tried many cleansers over the years, as I have dry skin and am always looking for a gentle yet effective one.</li>
      <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X Restorative Cream Cleanser has been a favorite of mine for quite a while.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, fresh.</li>
      <li>Product is very gentle - removes all of my makeup with no problems.  </li>
      <li>I also purchased the Olay rotating cleansing brush and I love how it gets all of my makeup off and exfoliates at the same time!</li>
      <li>Thanks for having it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got very senstive skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
      <li>This cleanser didn&#x27;t effectively remove my makeup AND it dried my skin out to the point of peeling.</li>
      <li>I have used for a long time and they really do not have a good replacement that I have found as of yet.  </li>
      <li>Not good if you&#x27;re looking for something to help make your skin look clean and smooth!</li>
      <li>Rich, creamy, completely cleans and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>I recently switched to Oil of Olay Prox from a different cleansing system and must say that I fell in love with the Oil of Olay products.  </li>
      <li>I truly have a hard time believing that this is my own skin.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m completely sold now</li>
      <li>I am 49 years old</li>
      <li>Not everyone wants to use a gritty cleanser on their face, especially in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I recently tried Beauti Control and wasted 300 bucks on an entire collection that didn&#x27;t even come close to how fantastic this makes my skin look.</li>
      <li>To me this is poor customer service and Amazon needs to screen their sellers better especially about their return policies.</li>
      <li>This really makes my skin feel deep cleaned and does not leave it feeling tight afterward.</li>

    <li> Product is very gentle - removes all of my makeup with no problems.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, fresh. Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out in the least bit.  I&#x27;ve got very senstive skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to Oil of Olay Prox from a different cleansing system and must say that I fell in love with the Oil of Olay products.  I can achieve the same effect as the more expensive cleansing product and now I have purchase Oil of Olay Prox for my mother.  Your skin feels clean and refreshed and would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This cleanser didn&#x27;t effectively remove my makeup AND it dried my skin out to the point of peeling. Not good if you&#x27;re looking for something to help make your skin look clean and smooth!</li>
    <li> This product works great at removing makeup and leaves skin feeling clean but not greasy. My husband was using mine so now I must buy two.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleansers over the years, as I have dry skin and am always looking for a gentle yet effective one. This really makes my skin feel deep cleaned and does not leave it feeling tight afterward. Fave!</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes me break out really bad plus leaves my skin really dry. Do not like this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love the Pro-X cleansing system and this cleanser does a great job but....  It tends to dry out the skin on my face.  I have to make sure to follow up with a moisturizer.  Also it&#x27;s a little difficult to cleanse without sometimes getting some of this cream in your mouth, taste pretty bad.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the Pro-X so perhaps my process will improve.</li>
    <li> Ordinary cleanser, no foam or lather. Has a weird smell, did not like it. Difficult to pour/squeeze due to poor design.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this item in the stores anymore, and am so glad Amazon sellers still stock it. I am elderly, and have tried a thousand facial cleansers over the years. This product is far and away the best.  You don&#x27;t need a huge amount (economical), and it removes makeup and dirt like a dream. Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh. Not too dry, and not too greasy, at all.  I use it at night, and put on moisturizer after use. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they stop making it altogether.</li>
    <li> I am so sad that Olay decided to discontinue this product.  I have used for a long time and they really do not have a good replacement that I have found as of yet.  I will super sad when they are all gone.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bunch of oil of olay product&#x27;s to make up a gift pack! I haven&#x27;t heard how they like it yet but I&#x27;m sure she will as she uses your product faithfully!</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash - I just wish I could still get it in stores but the most gentle and best remover of makeup and NEVER leaves my face dry!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to review a cleanser.  It does clean my face, but I have not seen miracles yet.</li>
    <li> I have T-Zones on my face, which means I have oily areas across my forehead, down my nose and chin. Then the rest of my face tends to be oily and this is where I tend to have most of my break-outs and blackheads. I just started using this product one month ago and it has completley re-invented my skin. I no longer get the extreme dry spots or oily areas. My face feels clean and smooth all over, but most important my acne has dissaperared. I use this product with the Olay Pro-X power scrubber in the morning and at night and then apply Olay Pro-X deep wrinkle treatment. I truly have a hard time believing that this is my own skin. My skin truly improves by the day. I have only been using this regiment for one month now and I am so excited to see what I look like in three months from now. Thank you for making an affordable product that actually works.  Sincerely, Mrs. Kelly Lang  P.S. I am 49 years old and I got I.D&#x27;d for purchasing a bottle of wine the other day! That hasen&#x27;t happened to me in years.</li>
    <li> Good face cleanser, simple to use.  Ordering process was also flawless.  Received product in less time than predicted.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! I also purchased the Olay rotating cleansing brush and I love how it gets all of my makeup off and exfoliates at the same time!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for me, but oil of olay discontinued it and I don&#x27;t like their other cleansers.</li>
    <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Restorative Cream Cleanser has been a favorite of mine for quite a while.  I love this item.  Rich, creamy, completely cleans and does not dry out your skin.  Can easily remove eye makeup too!&lt;br /&gt;What I find disappointing it that Olay has replaced this product with an exfoliating cleanser.  Not everyone wants to use a gritty cleanser on their face, especially in the winter.  C&#x27;mon Olay, please keep this product on the shelves.  This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER.</li>
    <li> This is the best item for cleaning your face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and at the end of the day I always come back to this.  I recently tried Beauti Control and wasted 300 bucks on an entire collection that didn&#x27;t even come close to how fantastic this makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> I would give this product and seller less than 1 star if allowed! This product dried out my skin. It made my face very tight, caused skin to flake and left a red rash. I use the other Olay Pro X products without any problems . I contacted Amazon and the seller for a refund. The seller denied a refund and closed out my request without offering any other solution. To me this is poor customer service and Amazon needs to screen their sellers better especially about their return policies. Not everything you buy thru Amazon can be returned despite their ads saying returns are simple. This is the e-mailed response I received from the seller &amp;#34; Products that make contact with skin/ human contact are not eligible for return, since they can no longer be resold. Thank you, Nick Ross, manager SafetyNet.Sales&amp;#34;. So if you buy this product make sure you love it and or have tried it somewhere else or you will be out of the $$$ you paid!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with Rosacea for most of my adult life and most cleansers aggravate my skin and cause scaliness. This product works miracles! Every time I wash it leaves my face feeling silky clean, almost like you have already applied a foundation primer. I am so disappointed that they have discontinued it because I don&#x27;t have a good replacement. I ordered some extras so I could have enough to last a year or two. I wish they would reconsider and keep this on the market.</li>
    <li> The pro x line from oil of Olay is awesome...my face looks youthful, glowing and smooth..I just love it. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m completely sold now</li>
    <li> I works for me......no breakouts.......as usual they have discontinued making it so I buy all I can find. Thanks for having it.</li>
