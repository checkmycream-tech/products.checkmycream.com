### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Henna hut has the best quality henna on the market!</li>
      <li>The week after I henna my hair feels incredible!</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>The best for my 4a hair.</li>
      <li>the color is very good.  </li>
      <li>but because I am very pleased w/the ease of use, color and longevity of color, I will purchase again!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
      <li>but it is a very nice color.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful hair dye makes my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
      <li>This product is a nice alternative to chemical disfigurement.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and</li>
      <li>Not horrible</li>
      <li>Great value at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>or more</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have lost many family members to cancer</li>
      <li>This mixes easily and is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Truly easy.  </li>
      <li>Buy some cheap latex &amp;#34;exam gloves&amp;#34; to put it on with, and leave it on for an hour or so while you&#x27;re working (or playing) at your computer.</li>
      <li>It was such a deep, beautiful color--I was thrilled!</li>
      <li>I like Henna Hut&#x27;s all natural products but with that being said they don&#x27;t yield good results as planned all the time.</li>
      <li>Use it once a week or so to maintain the appearance of your hair; although if your hair grows very fast, you might need to apply more often.</li>
      <li>so I appreciate the clean smell I get from this days after using it.</li>
      <li>even though I bought it from the health food store it was still super toxic.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use and it and will be needing more later on this year</li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s more natural looking.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m persistent to keep experimenting with mixing until I find the right ratio/formula.</li>
      <li>Bought it from the actual website and since I had always had wonderful results with their burgundy batch, I decided to try the dark brown for my mom&#x27;s hair and my hubby&#x27;s beard.</li>
      <li>the oils in your beard and hair won&#x27;t allow the henna dye to work its magic properly so be sure to wash first with mild soap and lightly scrub with an old toothbrush it may sound silly and seem like a part that most don&#x27;t feel like taking the time to do</li>
      <li>No other &#x27;natural&#x27; hair product makes my hair as lovely, soft and smelling amazing for days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used their products several times but in red and it worked great.</li>
      <li>It does fade naturally though and never shows a strong ring around the root area.</li>
      <li>Would appreciate it very much.</li>
      <li>but it is very important if you want the Henna Dye to work properly ...</li>
      <li>I use it to dye my beard, which is mostly salt and pepper, but with a white patch on my chin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to someone else who wants a more natural approach to coloring their hair.</li>
      <li>I have had many days where I barely got any coverage on my grays to just spotty coverage , with only a handful of times of full to satisfactory coverage before it begins to fade out in about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Just keep in mind unlike their 100% Henna, this product is not as finely sifted as I would like, feels gritty when you rinse it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would darken to a very flat looking dark brown if I repeated the process over a week or a month with one or two more applications</li>
      <li>Very scant gray coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all to much to for me when the more chemical colors can be applied to dry hair and shampooed out after 30 minutes with instant results and pretty highlights.</li>
      <li>Love the color the Burgundy gives, but Dark Brown is garbage!</li>
      <li>This henna is very finely milled and goes on smoothly, no chunks!</li>
      <li>It only takes 45 mins to process(just with hot water) but I leave it on for an hour or more since I like mine almost black.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week, and even with me going swimming several days a week in a public, chlorinated pool, it works fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 60 minutes, I rinsed the indigo paste out in the shower and, wow!</li>
      <li>Not to mention after the first co-wash, even the blue was gone and I was back to just straight gray.</li>
      <li>I mixed the powder up with water in a glass Pyrex measuring cup with my gloved fingers; I wasn&#x27;t certain if metal silverware would react with the powder somehow.</li>
      <li>At one point in 2012 I bought a large quantity of packets, and didn&#x27;t need to reorder until recently (Jan 2014).</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty short right now, so I didn&#x27;t use the entire 100 grams, but I left it on for an hour as I watched TV.</li>
      <li>However, the instructions have changed on the package (shorter suggested leave-in time) and it completely DID NOT WORK.</li>
      <li>which is great because my hair was very unhealthy before due to using chemical hair color...</li>
      <li>I must be getting used to my new color, because it doesn&#x27;t look as deep to me now that I&#x27;ve washed it again (and used conditioner that time), but my husband says it&#x27;s the same.</li>
      <li>I only got spotty coverage and some grays turned gray in color not dark brown.</li>
      <li>Henna Hut&#x27;s 2 step process of 100% Henna &amp; Indigo Powder was too much of a time constraint for me and switched to Dark Brown to save time.</li>
      <li>It barely covered some of the grey on my mom for 1 week and on my hubby there was no dark brown coverage at all, his whites looked blue grey and reverted back to natural color within a week.</li>

<li> Henna Hut&#x27;s 2 step process of 100% Henna &amp; Indigo Powder was too much of a time constraint for me and switched to Dark Brown to save time.</li>
<li> It barely covered some of the grey on my mom for 1 week and on my hubby there was no dark brown coverage at all, his whites looked blue grey and reverted back to natural color within a week.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m resorted to keep trying as often as needed because chemical boxed dye destroys my hair making it dry and brittle &amp; causing major hair loss.</li>
<li> I used Dark Brown Henna 3 times back to back in just over two days with little success.</li>
<li> But the dark brown didn&#x27;t color the gray or the old red.</li>
<li> Dark Brown hasn&#x27;t completely won me over</li>
<li> My white hair now looks grey.  </li>
<li> Unless you&#x27;re very scrupulous about using it (i.e. thick and often) it might leave a somewhat salt and pepper appearance; but that&#x27;s actually what I want</li>
<li> My grays turned slightly blue (due to the indigo) and had NO hint of brown or red from the henna.</li>
<li> I also highly recommend the henna or dandruff shampoo from this company and the green tea conditioner!</li>
<li> It really smelled like tea leaves and dirt, which I did not honestly find</li>
<li> On the back of the package it calls it &#x27;henna&#x27; but of course, as this color is basically indigo, it&#x27;s not really henna.</li>
<li> Out of frustration on the third day for the fourth consecutive time however, against their very specific instructions,  I applied on night before washed- air dried hair not freshly washed hair as they recommend.</li>
<li> I finally bit the bullet and just ordered some Harvest Moon dark brown dye.</li>
<li> Was left with small &#x27;sand-like&#x27; particles that were difficult to wash out the first day.  </li>
<li> Although I realize it is a losing battle, at least I don&#x27;t have to go out of my way to use more dangerous products.</li>
<li> I have been using this brand of Dark Brown Henna Dye for my hair and beard for about 2 yrs now</li>
<li> I have been using Henna Hut dark brown dye since 2010.</li>
<li> I mixed it until it was thick like yogurt and then, still wearing plastic gloves, started slathering it all over my hair.</li>
<li> Works just as well as the henna I buy at beauty stores, but cost a lot less.</li>
<li> One packet usually lasts about 3 or 4 applications since I only do root touch ups on a small area.</li>
<li> I have been using this brand of henna for a year and a half and continue to do so indefinitely.</li>
<li> I really hope this can be sorted because I don&#x27;t want to go back to chemical hair dyes :(</li>
<li> (the package says to wait 18-24) and the shampoo suds were a little bit blue-looking.</li>
<li> Dark brown hair!</li>
<li> Waste of my money and time.</li>
<li> SUPER disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what combination did the trick</li>
<li> Usually any health food store brand shampoo or conditioner has no smell after just a couple hours of getting out of the shower</li>
<li> I waited the requisite 24-48 hours in hopes that it would darken, alas no.</li>
<li> JFM chemical garbage (which should be illegal).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been getting sick of the highlights the sun&#x27;s been giving me and, nervous about using a home dye kit around my birds (fumes can kill), I decided to look into henna.</li>
<li> I will never buy another brand, been there, done that and what a disappointment!</li>
<li> If you henna, you must use this brand, you will not be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works well if you&#x27;re patient- Leave on for 1 hr. or more and you&#x27;ll get results. Doesn&#x27;t blister your face like that JFM chemical garbage (which should be illegal). This product is a nice alternative to chemical disfigurement. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This product works well ....I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This mixes easily and is easy to apply.  It takes a bit to rinse out.  The instructions say that it will turn white hair blue but that it will darken over night.  My white hair now looks grey.  I&#x27;m sure it would darken to a very flat looking dark brown if I repeated the process over a week or a month with one or two more applications but I am not up for this.  You need to wash your hair before applying, wait an hour, then rinse out but wait 18 to 24 hours before shampooing.  It&#x27;s all to much to for me when the more chemical colors can be applied to dry hair and shampooed out after 30 minutes with instant results and pretty highlights.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of Dark Brown Henna Dye for my hair and beard for about 2 yrs now and i have had no issues with the color showing up or staying , you must take the time to do the prep before you apply the mixture especially on beards the oils in your beard and hair won&#x27;t allow the henna dye to work its magic properly so be sure to wash first with mild soap and lightly scrub with an old toothbrush it may sound silly and seem like a part that most don&#x27;t feel like taking the time to do but it is very important if you want the Henna Dye to work properly ...Harvest Moon is the ONLY Henna Hair and Beard Dye i have tried and its the ONLY one i play on trying</li>
    <li> The best for my 4a hair. Regular use of it has made my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting sick of the highlights the sun&#x27;s been giving me and, nervous about using a home dye kit around my birds (fumes can kill), I decided to look into henna. I finally bit the bullet and just ordered some Harvest Moon dark brown dye. On the back of the package it calls it &#x27;henna&#x27; but of course, as this color is basically indigo, it&#x27;s not really henna. Regardless, the powder arrived in the mail Saturday, and that evening I washed my hair twice and then towel-dried it as directed. I mixed the powder up with water in a glass Pyrex measuring cup with my gloved fingers; I wasn&#x27;t certain if metal silverware would react with the powder somehow. I mixed it until it was thick like yogurt and then, still wearing plastic gloves, started slathering it all over my hair. My hair is pretty short right now, so I didn&#x27;t use the entire 100 grams, but I left it on for an hour as I watched TV. (I did my eyebrows, too.) It really smelled like tea leaves and dirt, which I did not honestly find unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 60 minutes, I rinsed the indigo paste out in the shower and, wow! Dark brown hair! It was such a deep, beautiful color--I was thrilled! I waited 21 hours to wash my hair (the package says to wait 18-24) and the shampoo suds were a little bit blue-looking. I must be getting used to my new color, because it doesn&#x27;t look as deep to me now that I&#x27;ve washed it again (and used conditioner that time), but my husband says it&#x27;s the same. So I&#x27;m very pleased! I would highly recommend this product to someone else who wants a more natural approach to coloring their hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!!!  Love the color the Burgundy gives, but Dark Brown is garbage! Very scant gray coverage.</li>
    <li> Works well, non-toxic. I use it to dye my beard, which is mostly salt and pepper, but with a white patch on my chin. Unless you&#x27;re very scrupulous about using it (i.e. thick and often) it might leave a somewhat salt and pepper appearance; but that&#x27;s actually what I want; it&#x27;s more natural looking. Buy some cheap latex &amp;#34;exam gloves&amp;#34; to put it on with, and leave it on for an hour or so while you&#x27;re working (or playing) at your computer. Then take a shower and rinse it out. Use it once a week or so to maintain the appearance of your hair; although if your hair grows very fast, you might need to apply more often. I use it once a week, and even with me going swimming several days a week in a public, chlorinated pool, it works fine. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Henna hut has the best quality henna on the market! I will never buy another brand, been there, done that and what a disappointment! This henna is very finely milled and goes on smoothly, no chunks! It only takes 45 mins to process(just with hot water) but I leave it on for an hour or more since I like mine almost black. It does fade for me....by the end of four weeks it is time for me to re-do because of the fading and also my roots. It does fade naturally though and never shows a strong ring around the root area. The week after I henna my hair feels incredible! I get compliments on it all the time though which is great because my hair was very unhealthy before due to using chemical hair color...even though I bought it from the health food store it was still super toxic.  I have been using this brand of henna for a year and a half and continue to do so indefinitely. I also highly recommend the henna or dandruff shampoo from this company and the green tea conditioner! No other &#x27;natural&#x27; hair product makes my hair as lovely, soft and smelling amazing for days. Usually any health food store brand shampoo or conditioner has no smell after just a couple hours of getting out of the shower so I appreciate the clean smell I get from this days after using it. If you henna, you must use this brand, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great! Works just as well as the henna I buy at beauty stores, but cost a lot less. Stays on for 10+ shampoos.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and it and will be needing more later on this year</li>
    <li> Bought it from the actual website and since I had always had wonderful results with their burgundy batch, I decided to try the dark brown for my mom&#x27;s hair and my hubby&#x27;s beard. It barely covered some of the grey on my mom for 1 week and on my hubby there was no dark brown coverage at all, his whites looked blue grey and reverted back to natural color within a week.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dye makes my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Just add water and go!  Truly easy.  Only left in my hair for 1.5 hours.  Was left with small &#x27;sand-like&#x27; particles that were difficult to wash out the first day.  Not horrible but because I am very pleased w/the ease of use, color and longevity of color, I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Great value at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna Hut dark brown dye since 2010. At one point in 2012 I bought a large quantity of packets, and didn&#x27;t need to reorder until recently (Jan 2014). However, the instructions have changed on the package (shorter suggested leave-in time) and it completely DID NOT WORK. My grays turned slightly blue (due to the indigo) and had NO hint of brown or red from the henna. I waited the requisite 24-48 hours in hopes that it would darken, alas no. Not to mention after the first co-wash, even the blue was gone and I was back to just straight gray. SUPER disappointed. What happened?? Waste of my money and time. I have tried to call customer service several times, but after one missed call, they have not tried to return any of my subsequent messages. I really hope this can be sorted because I don&#x27;t want to go back to chemical hair dyes :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used their products several times but in red and it worked great. But the dark brown didn&#x27;t color the gray or the old red. It was as if I didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> Henna Hut&#x27;s 2 step process of 100% Henna &amp; Indigo Powder was too much of a time constraint for me and switched to Dark Brown to save time. I like Henna Hut&#x27;s all natural products but with that being said they don&#x27;t yield good results as planned all the time. One packet usually lasts about 3 or 4 applications since I only do root touch ups on a small area. I have had many days where I barely got any coverage on my grays to just spotty coverage , with only a handful of times of full to satisfactory coverage before it begins to fade out in about 2 weeks. My south asian roots are feisty &amp; stubborn by nature so I&#x27;m resorted to keep trying as often as needed because chemical boxed dye destroys my hair making it dry and brittle &amp; causing major hair loss. I used Dark Brown Henna 3 times back to back in just over two days with little success. I only got spotty coverage and some grays turned gray in color not dark brown. Out of frustration on the third day for the fourth consecutive time however, against their very specific instructions,  I applied on night before washed- air dried hair not freshly washed hair as they recommend. I also added about a tablespoon of Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; Hesh Amla Powder with some Indigo powder from another brand (Zenia) and left it on about 2 hours and finally got satisfactory coverage. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what combination did the trick but I&#x27;m determined to keep going. Just keep in mind unlike their 100% Henna, this product is not as finely sifted as I would like, feels gritty when you rinse it. It may be the added herbs versus 100% henna. Dark Brown hasn&#x27;t completely won me over but I&#x27;m persistent to keep experimenting with mixing until I find the right ratio/formula. Please leave a review if any of you guys get around a specific method/formula that has proven to work out for you. Would appreciate it very much.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and the color is very good.  On stubborn grays you might have to wait longer than and hour or two but it is a very nice color.  Also the plus is it is not toxic.  I have lost many family members to cancer and I am trying to minimize my families exposure to chemicals.  Although I realize it is a losing battle, at least I don&#x27;t have to go out of my way to use more dangerous products.</li>
