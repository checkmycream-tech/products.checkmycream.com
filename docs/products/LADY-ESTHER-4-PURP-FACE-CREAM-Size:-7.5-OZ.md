      <li>I have been using Lady Esther face cream for many years</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>When opened, the product appear to have separated and it was in Orly liquid on the top.</li>
      <li>Of all the face creams I have ever used, Lady Esther is my favorite one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite product for removing eye makeup.</li>
      <li>Lee Pharma places a blotter on top of the face cream therefore causing moisture to build up on the blotter causing mold to form.  </li>
      <li>She is almost 88, and is glad this product is still available.</li>
      <li>My mother used Lady Esther for a facial cream for over 50 years and her complexion was beautiful.  </li>
      <li>everyone ask her how she has such beautiful skin...</li>
      <li>However after mixing it up it seemed to stabilize and has been fine.</li>
      <li>It is excellent for taking off heavy makeup or just as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!  </li>
      <li>It is truly better than any of the new products that are out today.  </li>
      <li>It is an excellent moisturizing cream and does not dry out my skin like some other face creams do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon now offers it for sale.  </li>
      <li>Not close to original product....buy a natural product</li>
      <li>If you can get it with the pink lid, that is the original packaging by the original manufacturer...</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my Mom she has been using it her whole life and has no wrinkles at age 80😊</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this face cream.  </li>
      <li>My Mother who is 96 has used it all her adult life.  </li>
      <li>My mom used this when she was young and passed it on to me.  </li>
      <li>I now have started to use it and it  does make the skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product that feels like it&#x27;s really removing all of my makeup</li>
      <li>Her skin is smooth and very few wrinkles.  </li>

    <li> My Mom has used this product for decades.  Her skin is smooth and very few wrinkles.  She is almost 88, and is glad this product is still available.</li>
    <li> My grandmother and mother have used this cream forever and have amazing skin.  I am not sure why I ever left it, but I am back now!</li>
    <li> Mother in law has used all her life, she is 80 and looks like 60! Very good stuff in her opinion.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this at night for 50 yrs. faithfully. She is 78 and her skin doesn&#x27;t look a day over 58...everyone ask her how she has such beautiful skin...she contributes it to Lady Ester.</li>
    <li> When opened, the product appear to have separated and it was in Orly liquid on the top. However after mixing it up it seemed to stabilize and has been fine.</li>
    <li> If you can get it with the pink lid, that is the original packaging by the original manufacturer...Lee Pharma just slaps its sticker on it.  BUT, if you receive this product in a white container with a white lid manufactured by Lee Pharma don&#x27;t always count on there not being mold inside the lid.  Lee Pharma places a blotter on top of the face cream therefore causing moisture to build up on the blotter causing mold to form.  There should be a topper that is specific for this product.  Even though I have contacted Lee Pharma, the product still is a hit or miss with the growing mold.  Yuck!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 55 years and I have had the most beautiful skin all my life!&lt;br /&gt;I attribute a good part of it to Lady Esther!</li>
    <li> Of all the face creams I have ever used, Lady Esther is my favorite one.  It is an excellent moisturizing cream and does not dry out my skin like some other face creams do.  I have been using Lady Esther face cream for many years and I love it.  I highly recommend Lady Esther face cream to people of all ages who want to have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom she has been using it her whole life and has no wrinkles at age 80😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lady Esther 4 purpose face cream for over 30 years.  It&#x27;s my favorite product for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used this her entire life and she kept the wrinkles at bay her entire life.  Now I use it to remove my eye make up every night.  It&#x27;s the only product that feels like it&#x27;s really removing all of my makeup and it moisturizes my face so its helping me keep the wrinkles at bay.  Just wish the product was still in drugstores like it used to be.  Now it&#x27;s almost $20.  Some versions have a very nice mild scent some do not and it doesn&#x27;t appear that you get to choose.</li>
    <li> Sehr geehrte Damen und Herrn,  die Creme war ein wenig teuer aber sie ist es wert.   Der Service von Amazon ist klasse!  Die Sendung war schnell da und das Packet war in Ordnung.  Thank you very much!  Whith king regards  Manfred</li>
    <li> My mother used Lady Esther for a facial cream for over 50 years and her complexion was beautiful.  I now have started to use it and it  does make the skin so soft.  It is also great on heat rashes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this face cream.  I&#x27;ve used it for decades as did my mother and my grandmother.  We used to buy it at a local pharmacy but they stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon now offers it for sale.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and as described.  Very good service and delivery.</li>
    <li> Lady Esther is a product from years ago.  My Mother who is 96 has used it all her adult life.  Believe it or not at 96 she has very few wrinkles.  It is excellent for taking off heavy makeup or just as a moisturizer.  It is truly better than any of the new products that are out today.  When I go to Arizona where it is very dry, this is the only product that I use.</li>
    <li> My mom used this when she was young and passed it on to me.  I am now 79 years of age and I have always used it.  With this product no need to use anything else.  Saves alot of money and I have a beautiful complexsion, no wringles.</li>
    <li> My Mother-law loves this stuff and has  been using it for years.  We have a hard time finding it in stores so I was so happy that I found it on Amazon!! The price was reasonable and the convenience of getting it delivered was awesome!!</li>
    <li> My mom has used this face cream for years and swears by it.  This was a gift for her. I know she will use it forever. She is almost 80</li>
    <li> Lady Esther Face Cream is is absolutely the best for removing mascara and eye makeup.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> My mom has used Lady Esther for years and it is hard to find now. She was very pleased to get it.</li>
    <li> Not close to original product....buy a natural product</li>
