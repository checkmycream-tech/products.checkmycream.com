      <li>Sweet and yet not to overwhelming.</li>
      <li>My item arrived quickly and is more convenient and a bit cheaper than buying it at the store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light scent</li>
      <li>I thought it was awfully cheap for VS</li>
      <li>Nice smell,but doesn&#x27;t privde much hydration</li>
      <li>was no longer available.</li>
      <li>It is sweet and fruity, no over-the-top smell, just an appealing scent.  </li>

      <li>I did get a refund, but would have liked my wife to have her present.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and is one of my favorite scents in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion line.  </li>
      <li>it makes you skin feel soft and lasts most the day.</li>
      <li>I first got a whiff of this cream at the doctor&#x27;s office when a patient walked by, and I quickly called out to please tell me what the fragrance of the perfume was.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much for your attention.</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I happen to love this scent a lot and would recommend for scent purposes, just not for a moisturizer in the middle of the winter season</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend and buy again :)</li>
      <li>I love it especially matching it with my spray</li>
      <li>I went through my first bottle so fast it might as well have been travel size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order and will definitely be buying again in the future!</li>
      <li>never was much of a lotion person, but my mom got this as a gift</li>
      <li>And came in really fast</li>
      <li>I just would not buy this product again because the smells doesn&#x27;t really satisfy me.</li>
      <li>It kind of smells a little old to me.</li>
      <li>scent is nice and loud but it doesnt last long</li>
      <li>Therefore, the lotion leaves my skin feeling hydrated and very soft.</li>
      <li>It was purely bought for an extra smell from the spray I use.</li>
      <li>Mango Temptation was as good as it got, well this proved me wrong.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 14, never too young to learn about proper skin nourishment.</li>
      <li>Arrived way earlier than expected and was exactly what I wanted at an unbeatable price.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent by Victoria Secret.</li>

<li> Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long..</li>
<li> the softness doesn&#x27;t last long</li>

<li> It was dumb of me just to buy it like that.</li>
<li> no, this is not Victoria Secret.</li>
<li> these a dis-continued items from Victoria&#x27;s Secret because when I went on a business trip .</li>
<li> I thought that Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fantasies</li>
<li> It&#x27;s Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion</li>
<li> cant go wrong wit vicz secret.  </li>
<li> My wife loves this lotion, although it is a bit expensive.</li>
<li> As always, Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotions are a must buy for me!</li>

    <li> Very good product with a very good smells</li>
    <li> I really love this smell. It is also moisturizing.</li>
    <li> As always, Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotions are a must buy for me! I love this one in Pure Seduction scent. It smells great and lasts quite a while compared to other lotions I have used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a no no, this is not Victoria Secret. I want to think I got the bad lemon. So disappointed</li>
    <li> This cream has been a favorite of mine for many years.  It is sweet and fruity, no over-the-top smell, just an appealing scent.  I first got a whiff of this cream at the doctor&#x27;s office when a patient walked by, and I quickly called out to please tell me what the fragrance of the perfume was.  It was lotion!  Even better.  If you like a sweet, fruity fragrance, then this one &#x27;s for you!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! And came in really fast</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my sister, along with some other VS stuff. She loved it. Smells great... really refreshing.</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion and it smells amazing! It is definantly what I expected and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> From what I detected of these body spray&#x27;s,lotions and shower gel&#x27;s I know for a fact these a dis-continued items from Victoria&#x27;s Secret because when I went on a business trip . I stopped at a V.S store and I was told the following fragrances I sought online or at a retail store was no longer available. So that&#x27;s why these items are only being sold online but at any event I have received my lotion and look forward to using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is one of my favorite scents in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion line.  My item arrived quickly and is more convenient and a bit cheaper than buying it at the store.</li>
    <li> I got this for the lady friend and she loves the smell. I also got the same smell spray to go with it. nice scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the excellent product</li>
    <li> This is a scent for the books. I went through my first bottle so fast it might as well have been travel size. I thought that Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fantasies Mango Temptation was as good as it got, well this proved me wrong. My daughter and I each have to have our own bottle, and my son has ordered us not to wear it around his buddies. In the words of a 17 year old boy, that stuff made my mom smell like a cougar and my sister smell like jail bait. She&#x27;s 14, never too young to learn about proper skin nourishment.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion, although it is a bit expensive. I think it smells great, too.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SMELLS GREAT, PERFECT TO CARRY AROUND IN THE PURSE ALSO IN  THE CAR... THIS IS A GREAT LOTION ITS ALSO AVAILABLE IN A SMALLER SIZE OERFECT FOR POCKETS...  :)</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend. Too fruity for me but she loves it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend, she LOVES this lotion! It was a really great deal, arrived on time and was exactly what seller said! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells delish, formula absorbs quickly and moisturizes well, and just as good as purchasing in the VS store. I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> What can I say????????????????// VS pure seduction wins again!!!! My daughter was delighted she has two and will last her awhile.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this lotion so I ordered it as a gift among others, and it would have arrived at the opportune moment. However, it never arrived. I waited for the recommended time after not receiving it and contacted the seller. I did not get a response from them until I later contacted amazon. I did get a refund, but would have liked my wife to have her present.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. My skin gets dry sometimes and this lotion does the trick but also leaves my skin smelling great! :)</li>
    <li> I love any Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fragrance. I use the body wash everyday and that leave my skin soft. Therefore, the lotion leaves my skin feeling hydrated and very soft. The great scent lasts too.</li>
    <li> To be honest, the lotion part stinks as in poorly moisturizes. The smell is heavenly. It&#x27;s Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion so I mean it&#x27;s not supposed to be some state of the art lotion. It was purely bought for an extra smell from the spray I use. I happen to love this scent a lot and would recommend for scent purposes, just not for a moisturizer in the middle of the winter season lol!</li>
    <li> scent is nice and loud but it doesnt last long</li>
