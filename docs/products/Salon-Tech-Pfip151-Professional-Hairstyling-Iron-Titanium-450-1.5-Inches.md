    <li> Do not recommend...cuts off constantly. Will not hold heat &amp; cuts off all the time. I have a $20 iron that works better than this one. Not worth the $$!</li>
    <li> Love it --works great! Heats up quickly. Like the no-tangle cord. I have curly hair and one pass and hair is straight.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron! I&#x27;ve had the 1&amp;#34; for quite some time and decided to give this one a try. No complaints about anything... it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, perfect size. Leaves your hair like silk and very shinny.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this crap. The product is as useless as it can get. I bought this flat iron about a month ago. When i used it for the first time i did not use any serum. The result was not good. My hair looked wavy and nobody could tell i had done anything to it. I bought a hair serum and then tried straightening my hair. It looked awesome. But guess what, that was the only time it worked. I try to use it again and start to see the red light on it blinking. I stopped thinking that maybe it has not heated. I wait for a good 5 mins and it still keeps blinking. I unplug it and leave it for a few mins. When i try to use it again it did work. I was able to straighten my hair but the result wasn&#x27;t that great. Next day, when i start seeing wavy hair, I decide to touch up and guess what the plates do not heat up. Luckily for me i realised that was an issue on 29th day. Yes, it is going back first thing tomorrow morning. I suggest, you keep away from it because you never know if the issue is going to surface within 30days or later. If it happens later, you won&#x27;t be able to get your money back and will have to deal with this junk of a product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  Enhances her beauty.  I&#x27;m still ugly, but, of course, I don&#x27;t use the iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and within one week the blue light indicating that it&#x27;s hot would suddenly turn to red within minutes and turn cold . I have to unplug it and start all over again . This is a nuisance. I still have the product and it still does it</li>
    <li> I have been using hairstyling iron for at least 20 years now.  This is by far the best I have used.  I &amp;#34;always&amp;#34; spray my hair with heat protectant prior to using it.  It&#x27;s also best if you properly care your hair..like hot oil, spend a little time with extra conditioning!</li>
    <li> LOVED it. best Iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, however it just died out on me this week and I&#x27;ve only had it 8 months.</li>
    <li> my friends had 1 and i try it... its work really good... thats why i got the sane one...&lt;br /&gt;but my werent work good or same like my friends has....</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this iron and recommended it.  It is by far the best one I have purchased yet.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars! This was a suggestion by a friend and I am glad I took it! My last hair iron was quite expensive and &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after two years! It didn&#x27;t have that smooth finish on the plates lie this new one! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have owned this flat iron for 1.5 yrs.  It has been terrific until recently, the connection of the cord at the base of the iron appears to be loose.  Now the iron will turn on/off if I move the cord slightly.  I have reached out to the manufacturer, but I suspect that they will not do anything since this is beyond the 1 yr warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next step is to try and fix it myself.  I would have expected the iron to last longer than 1.5 yrs given the price and the fact that it&#x27;s supposed to be professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Manufacturer cannot help b/c it is only a 1 yr warranty.  They do not help with repairs b/c they say that their manufacturer is located in Korea.  They have also indicated that by purchasing this item from a non-authorized seller, I have essentially purchased the product &#x27;as is&#x27; and take on the risk myself.</li>
    <li> The professional hair styling Iron is very nice, and the service very good, thank you !!! and those very wonderful.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and blowing it out doesn&#x27;t have to be an over whelming process anymore, after using this product I dry my hair however and soon I use this flat iron it is instantly transformed to Silky, shinny, straight beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Only flat iron that leaves my hair silky and flat. My stylist uses it on my hair I loved the results so bought it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair frizzy and full of static.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this iron.  Quick and easy to use. Makes hair super shiny! Buy it you will be happy you did!</li>
    <li> I am in the beauty business.  have been for 27 years.  THis is the only iron I use.  It heats up so quickly I don&#x27;t need to preheat at ALL.</li>
