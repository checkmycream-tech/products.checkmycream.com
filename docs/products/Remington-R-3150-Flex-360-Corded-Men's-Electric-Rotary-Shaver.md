<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For a piece of plastic junk it is not too bad.  Needs a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think you people would have the sense and smarts to put a headline in front of this box.</li>
    <li> Some improvements have been engineered. The trimmer driver pivot is no longer plastic. Will I have to junk my ( for the same reason) 2 broken razors or is there a retro replacement I can purchase? I don&#x27;t expect any results from my writing this. I think these reviews are just a sellers at-a-boy and serves the purchaser no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
    <li> This razor works very well, But I should have ordered a Cordless type instead. For the price it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> It works and has a cord.  Feels cheap and plucks my beard with a bit of pain.  Go for Norelco in my opinion if you like a rotary razor.</li>
    <li> I like a corded shaver.  Does its job.</li>
    <li> great price.  i use it constantly and wish i had gotten one sooner. why pay a fortune when you just need a shave.</li>
    <li> This is an OK shaver, but I would recommend spending a few more bucks and get something with a higher rpm and better shave.</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave. The cord is too short. I have to use a cord from an old razor to have enough length to shave and see myself in mirror. The shaving head seems very delicate I&#x27;m afraid to take it apart to clean it. I also dont like that it&#x27;s hinged and not removable from the main body. I wish I would have spent more money and bought the Norelco corded for $5.00 more.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this R-3150 shaver after a decades old Remington DA-307 gave up the ghost. I didn&#x27;t need a rechargable one anymore, so this seemed a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking it, it seemed pretty lightweight compared to the old one, but of course it doesn&#x27;t have batteries. That&#x27;s probably mainly why. When I turned it on, I was surprised at how quiet it was. A soft buzz, instead of a loud buzz. Was the motor running full speed? But I put it on my face, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it removed all my stubble. It just works. The trimmer works fine as well. Compared to the flat, fixed cutting head on the DA-307, the flexible rotary cutters are a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by many, the cord is on the short side, but I have outlets at chin-level in my bathroom, so it&#x27;s no big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is that I&#x27;m very pleased. Need to see how well it lasts, and how much cleaning/maintenance it requires. FWIW, the cord is the same as for the DA-307, and probably for other Remingtons, so I can put another cord in another bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add, a few months later, I still like it very much. But the comments about it not cutting long hairs very well are correct. For a days growth of beard, it&#x27;s great. But if you trim the sideburns, and try to smooth out the hair that remains with the rotary cutters, they won&#x27;t do it. Need to keep swiping the trimmed sideburns with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Being Afro-American, I&#x27;m not supposed to shave against the grain, so I shaved in the directions my facial hair naturally grew.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the shaver only cut \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hairs. Seeing that some were still there, I took a chance and shaved in a small circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;Next thing I know, my hairs are being pulled. In the same fashion a manual razor did when I went against the grain and ended up with razor bumps that lasted almost two years, mind you.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to Magic Shave and Bump Razors.&lt;br /&gt;The power cord can stretch out five feet and about three or four inches.&lt;br /&gt;The razors make a dental sound when they spin. Made my mouth feel numb.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, Not as well built as my Norelco but that one was made over 20 years ago!  Hope this lasts as long!</li>
    <li> Great but still say you can&#x27;t beat a razor</li>
    <li> This is a very good inexpensive shaver. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick comfortable shave that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Another birthday present.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have been a happy Remington Microscreen customer for many years.  However, this rotary shaver is nowhere near the quality of the Remington MIcroscreen models.  It has a wimpy motor that barely moves the blades fast enough to cut.  My beard is tough, and this shaver can&#x27;t handle it--it requires a lot of time just to get all whiskers cut, and I need another shave after about 6 hours. I bought this shaver while on a road trip, and would have returned it if I had still been in the same city the next day.</li>
    <li> The first issue is that the cord doesn&#x27;t stay in the shaver. It&#x27;s coiled and so the slight tug this gives pulls the cord out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, there are a lot of cheaply made little plastic parts that are sure to break. Fortunately, I only wanted a backup to my razor. So, if I use it only once a month or so, or to just trim the corner of my mouth where a razor cut would hurt a lot, then it&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not my fathers Remington. It&#x27;s not worth $33; perhaps worth $15.</li>
    <li> Bought this on June 7, 2012. Today is July 27, 2013. Turned it on this morning, flipped up the trimmer and it went flying across the room. Lasted 13 months. Not so good. I had a Norelco before lasted me 15 YEARS...I just bought another Norelco today. Anyway, the cord on the Remington is way too short like other reviews stated. The main head comes off too easy. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get a Norelco..Much better quality..</li>
    <li> Cord kept slipping out, but was able to fix it.&lt;br /&gt; Razor itself works fine. Figured it was easier to&lt;br /&gt;fix the cord than return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll cut to the chase. I&#x27;m 83 years old with sensitive skin. I got this shaver today and tried it out right away. After I finished shaving I threw my two other electric shavers  ( one an expensive Norelco) into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these few words don&#x27;t tell you something then maybe you will never learn how great this shaver is.</li>
    <li> It works. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have to go over a spot more than once to get a close enough shave, but it&#x27;s a lot better than having to wet my face, put cream on, and use a regular razor. It&#x27;s great for the price. Cord&#x27;s short, like everyone else said, but if you have an outlet near your mirror, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father and works ok at best.  he had another older version that just bought blades for and it works 100% better.  I use this now to rough over my face between regular razor shaves.  ok at best.</li>
    <li> I like corded devices.  Battery driven devices are inadequately powered for my needs and recharging is bothersome.  This is a simple plastic device that may not last as long as costly shavers but the low price allows total replacement for less then repairs needed to maintain most popular shavers.  Keep it clean as directed and you receive very good service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap razor.  It does the job, but not very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d personally suggest spending a couple extra bucks and getting something with better rotary heads.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver at a very affordable purchase price, it will last me for years as did the one that it has replaced.</li>
    <li> This is simple to use and maintain. Very effective and is not expensive. I would recommend this to others and I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one for my son.</li>
    <li> SHIPPING AND PACKING WAS FANTASTIC BUT THIS SHAVER IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY, IT DOES A FAIR JOB BUT HAVE TO USE CONVENTIONAL RAZOR AFTER USING THIS ONE</li>
    <li> first time using an electric shaver. I didn&#x27;t pay alot of money becasue i wanted to test it out, not as close a shave as a razor.</li>
    <li> This would probably get five stars from me if it didn&#x27;t have a slightly loose cord.  Occasionally if I&#x27;m not paying attention, the cord will come free from the base of the razor.  It happened more before I took the time to stretch the cord a bit and relax the coils.  Other than that it is an excellent razor.  It gives me a pretty good shave even over scar tissue, and it is easy to use.  The clipper blade is a really nice touch as well, since it lets me keep my hair cut looking neat for longer.  Overall a great purchase, and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is looking for an excellent razor for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> T6HIS RAZOR WORKS GREAT.  iT SHAVES CLEAN, THE COST WAS LOW AND i LOVE IT.  THE ONLY MINUS, IS THAT THE CORD SHOULD BE LONGER.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT  IT IS BY FAR THE BEST ELECTRIC  RAZOR THAT I HAVE HAD IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.</li>
    <li> For the price, this shaver is adequate.  It shaves my beard, and that&#x27;s all I want!  I recommend it to those who do not want to pay a high price for a mere shaver.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this shaver just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years, this one is very rough and uncomfortable to shave with.  I have to go over the same area over and over and can&#x27;t seem to get a close shave with it.  I found that I had to hold the beard trimmer blades open with my fingers while trying to use it for sideburns otherwise it just flips closed on you when you move it the wrong way.  The trimmer is underpowered and jams easy.  If you want to save some money, spend a few extra bucks and get a better shaver, it will be worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I tried this and returned it right away.  I thought it might be better than the Norelcos I&#x27;ve tried.  I only buy cord only shavers as I have a number of Remington rechargeables almost dead in my drawer, and I don&#x27;t want to pay $40 for new batteries for each.  But I was lucky,  This week I was able, through Amazon, to buy two Remington Microscreen 2 cord only shavers---no batteries, no waiting to charge, no dying out, quiet, and the cords are straight so no pulling against you.  I felt lucky as there is only one left and the dealer says they&#x27;re all gone, since Remington no longer makes them.</li>
    <li> Very durable and shaves well. I had original blades in over a year and just tap to clean and dont do a full clean but about every two months and still works very well. I burned up 3 phillips in under a year so this remington is quality built.</li>
    <li> I was in need of electric razor to shave my head. I did not want or need a battery use. This model reviews were good so I decided to try. Yes, the cord is short but I just use a short extension cord. I use canned air to clean the head after each use. I plan to purchase new head to keep for later. After about three months use razor is doing a good to great job shaving my head. I do not use razor for my face. For the price this razor is a great purchase. I could not justify $200-300 bucks for a razor to shave my head. Who would have thought the cheaper price model would have such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: APRIL 15, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving this little razor. For the money this product is the best. Still using original heads to shave my head. I have not encountered any problems using or maintaining this razor.</li>
    <li> Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!</li>
    <li> That means it can&#x27;t be charged.  That&#x27;s the only downside I&#x27;ve seen with this thing.  With my last electric, I could multitask in other rooms while I shave, but with this one, you&#x27;re confined to an outlet at cord&#x27;s length.</li>
    <li> Very surprised at the closeness of the shave. If you don&#x27;t mind a cor on your razor, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor, so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It seems to do its job well. The cord is a little short, but if you stretch the coil, it helps. The pop-out trimmer is very helpful.</li>
    <li> The shaver does exactly as indicated, an it shaves very nicely.  In addition, it&#x27;s very quiet in use.  If it broke, I would not hesitate to buy another one.</li>
    <li> No battery to charge, and a bargain.  Not as close as my foil Panasonic, but cuts faster.  Very quiet, too.  The cord could be longer, but not a big deal.  Does a nice job on the neck, must be the flexing head and cutters.</li>
    <li> Remington made my last razor and it lasted close to 10 years, I expect the same from this one. I will say it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the head speed my last one did but I don&#x27;t have a ruff beard so it doesn&#x27;t effect me. A heavy beard might wear this out faster.</li>
    <li> Ordered  for my dad  to  replace his Norelco which he used for years He  loved it  and actually feels he  gets  smoother  shaves with this shaver</li>
    <li> This razor replaced my old trusty electric razor I had for 9 years.  This Remington razor cuts effortlessly and is light in weight.  The price was good for the high quality.</li>
    <li> The Remington Shaver works very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver, for a friend. He likes it a lot. I will order another one for him, when this one plays out.</li>
    <li> Every thing works great, my only complant is its really plasticy. But the razor it self cuts great.  The trimer cuts hair so fast, I shaved off a big chunck of my hair on accident:D I got in 3 days</li>
    <li> In spite of the picture above showing the head being held under a stream of water, the Remington R-3150 Flex 360 is NOT washable! I called Remington to confirm. Treating it as shown in the picture puts you at danger and can ruin the shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well, generally.&lt;br /&gt;However, the power cord at the shaver end does&lt;br /&gt;not fit well and drops out when the shaver is held upright. That&#x27;s a hassle. Not what i expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband he is in awe, he loves it so much it is a very smooth shave and so far we&#x27;ve had no problems its about the best shaver I found and he absolutely loves it. great item for the money.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband he really likes it thank u  have had problems with it no broken on him or nothing.  worth buying.</li>
    <li> It dose a great job, runs strongly and quitely,dosn&#x27;t miss spots,gentile on my face,and easy to handle. Buy it and you will love it to. Affordable</li>
    <li> Not a close shave at all! Also leaves face irritated and burned almost! Occasionally shocks me when it gets wet.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this product is terrible. My previous Remington shaver blew a fuse when I was in Europe, and I wanted to replace it with another Remington. This is without a doubt the worst shaving product I have ever purchased. If I could give less than a star rating I would. The shaver literally feels like it is ripping the hair off your face. My face burns for hours after every use. I was hoping that if I gave the shaver time, my face would adjust. I have had the shaver for 13 months and no change whatsoever in the pain department. What a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I had another of these shavers but it was the rechargeable kind and the battery wore out so I decided to try the corded one this time. For the money this little shaver holds up to the more expensive ones, at least it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This product is awful. Trust me, it tugs and pulls, and takes me 15 minutes to shave every couple days. Ludicrous. However, you might be thinking you get what you paid for. But that is just not the case. The shaver I had prior to this, one where the company name starts with a B, worked so much better than this and cost the same. This shaver is just unacceptable, and this spamming of 5 star reviews by people who work at Remington should not go by unnoticed. This is just simply deception.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my dad and he is very pleased with the performance of the shaver.  In fact, he is so pleased, he had me order a second one as a back-up.  He likes the head on the shaver and says it shaves very close without grabbing and pulling his whiskers.</li>
    <li> This shaver is no where near the quality of my last 2 Remingtons which each gave me 6 or 7 years of&lt;br /&gt;good close shaves.  They were sturdy, this one is flimsy, less powerful and takes longer to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is sore from snagging and pulling if I skip just one day of shaving and I don&#x27;t have a heavy&lt;br /&gt;growth either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has been cheapened to the point where I&#x27;m going to toss it out and buy a Panasonic or a&lt;br /&gt;Phillips.  I have owned both and found them to be satisfactory for a few bucks more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor knowing that the cord might be somewhat short and that it would not match the quality of a Norelco shaver that lasted almost 20 years.  I was attracted by the feature of a built in trimmer shared with the Norelco.  This shaver provides a reasonably good shave. One has to be very careful in cleaning it, as once opened, it is easy to drop the top parts into the toilet.  However, my main complaint is with the cord, which does not stay securely in place and putting the slightest tension on it will cause it to come loose, with the resultant loss of power.  I find myself about an inch from the mirror as I endeavor to keep this device running smoothly.  I am about to contact the manufacturer to determine if they have engineered a fix for this problem, or what else can be done for me.</li>
    <li> es una maquina de afeitar buenísima  la recomiendo ful es lo que esperaba es una marca que ofrece muy buenos productos</li>
    <li> El paquete llego en perfectas condiciones aquí a Venezuela!... los recomiendo, gracias por prestar este servicio. saludos desde América latina bye!</li>
    <li> Philips Shaver is much better than this&lt;br /&gt;no battery&lt;br /&gt;rough&lt;br /&gt;negative comment&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy this one ,or you will regret.</li>
    <li> I agree with most all the other reviews about the Remington R-3150 Electric Rotary Shaver that the electric cord is far too short. It really requires the user to have an electrical outlet VERY near where you&#x27;ll be using the shaver. It seems ridiculous to have to use an extension cord! However, it does operate very quietly and seems to get the job done well enough on my light beard. It is recommended to open the rotary blade section and clean it out after each use and to use the included tiny brush to clean the rotary blades once a week. Unfortunately after I took apart the rotary blades to brush them I had some difficulty in putting all those small pieces back together to get the shaver to function again. After a few attempts I finally succeeded, but now, when I open the rotary blade section to clean it every day, all the blades fall out. So I stopped cleaning it daily. Hopefully it will last quite a while before it gets clogged up.</li>
    <li> Shaver would shave better if the rpm&#x27;s were faster - the slow speed hampers getting a close shave. The inner shaver holder is made of flimsy plastic which I doubt will hold up very long.You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This razor is a basic product that works as advertized. I would recommend it to any man who uses an electric shaver. I am glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great gift! Got it for my boyfriend and he loves it! Totally worth the price! Did not buy the powder that came as a combo thou</li>
    <li> Came in the mail, I unpackaged it and it seemed very light weight.  I plugged it in to charge the battery - HOWEVER i found out there wasn&#x27;t a battery.  It only works when it is plugged in.  Other than that (Which is a HUGE Deal) it works good.  Shaves nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough?  Is that how it was suppose to come?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> this very good stuff i like it . very good blade ,good use full travel item this working on 110 220 volt.</li>
    <li> It is painful to use and  It gives a poor cut.  You should not buy. Does not have cover to protect blades.</li>
    <li> Never had a electrical shaver.This is my first and I wish I would have used one much sooner.Very quick and no shaving cream needed.Takes minutes to shave.Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I thought it would do a better job on the neck. It just does ok .</li>
    <li> After less than six months of normal everyday use this razor broke. Granted it&#x27;s not a top of the line model, but come on, Remington.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this shaver. I like the cord only option as I don&#x27;t have to worry about battery life. I was really amazed at how close of a shave I got on this shaver. I also like the flexibility of the rotary heads. It is simple but it&#x27;s really all I need and I think anyone buying this for 25.00 with free shipping on Amazon would be very pleased. It doesn&#x27;t have a bag but that&#x27;s an easy fix. Hope this helps you in your decision.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty amazing shaver for the money I spent. Shaves close and smooth. The electric cord is a bit short. Other than that, terrific buy. Can&#x27;t beat it for about $25.</li>
    <li> Why buy replacement blades for Norelco when you can buy a whole new shaver for less? Cuts clean, is quiet, a great buy.</li>
    <li> Most of my friends like to use safety razors and all kinds of fancy shaving stuff and bag on electric shavers. So I had avoided electric shavers, and used your basic disposable razors since forever. I hate them, and generally ended up in beard territory before I&#x27;d get around to shaving. I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to take a chance on an electric. It&#x27;s so much simpler - a couple of minutes everyday and I&#x27;m good to go. Cord could be a bit longer or more flexible, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This shaver does the job. Gave me an close shave, may take a moment longer than pricer models. But a close shave nevertheless. Love it for $25</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for 45 years.  I have owned Remington Micro-screen and Norelco cordless and corded.  I lost all faith in the cordless variety when I half-shaved with mine while the battery crapped out.  The low-speed pinching and pulling my beard converted me to a lifetime corded shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally wore holes in the Norelco heads (which ripped up my neck and chin).  When I found out their replacement cost was $32.99, I spotted this Remington on Amazon for $24.99.  After reading the user reviews of 3-4 corded shavers, the price tag of the R-3150 (and its high user feedback) made this purchase a real no-brainer.  I have used this product for 3 weeks. It as good as (and maybe better than) any shaver I have ever owned.  I would unhesitatingly give it my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with my new Remington R-3150 Flex 360 Corded Men&#x27;s Electric Rotary Shaver. It is fast and easy to use with excellent results. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone who is looking for an economical purchase in electric shaving. This unit is quite superior to other brands I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;used in the past.</li>
    <li> Shaved quite clean, cheap, but no lid inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment also very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Worldwide voltage is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Can not be washed.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast and the thing actually works. Obviously not so good on thick course hair, but for a travel shaver I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> You can certainly spend a lot more for a shaver... and wind up with something that doesn&#x27;t shave as well as this inexpensive Remington.  The replacement blades cost nearly what the whole shaver sold for, so when I come to needing new blades, I&#x27;ll just get another shaver.  I knocked off one star because:  who among us likes being manipulated like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is plenty long enough for me, but if you&#x27;re the sort of fellow who likes to practice his tango moves during his morning shave... you might want a longer cord.  I&#x27;m a stand-still-while-shaving kinda guy---but I started out with those old double edged razor blades with which you could easily cut your throat open if you danced all around your bathroom. Be still when shaving---it&#x27;s going to be a long day and you need to focus.</li>
    <li> It feels extremely cheaply made. The head doens&#x27;t completely come off when I want to clean it and it feels like it&#x27;s going to snap off.  It also doesn&#x27;t hug my face during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a cap.  This matters when you travel. I find shavings all over my travel bag even though I clean it prior. The head also sometimes come off during travel and completely empties out the shavings into my bag.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying more than twice as much for cordless razors - I had no use for the cordless function, and the batteries were usually the first thing to fail.  In one case the razor would not function if the battery was inoperative.  This does the job nicely at a great price.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well. It did seem to take a few uses for the shave to become pull-free (guess the blades/screen have to hone-in together or something like that), but then it gave a close, pull-free shave on both short and longish whiskers--and the trimmer worked well also.  Performance is better than that of my previous, famous-brand, expensive, rechargeable, triple rotary razor was.  Do wish it came with a head cover (but maybe the heads don&#x27;t need protecting anyway), and yes the blade retainer mechanism does seem a bit flimsy and easy to accidentally release.</li>
    <li> Pros. Works well enough. Cons. Cord is so short your head should not be more then 18in. from an outlet, Not much power from something that&#x27;s plugged into the wall, works better on the head then the face....</li>
    <li> great tool for the price I used to use a cordless one this is great. I would definetly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is well designed for your hand. But it does not shave as close as I would have hoped.&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman and use it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Never use it on your underarms - it bites!</li>
    <li> We bought this a year ago and it is still going strong! Great battery life and gives a great shave. Best razor I have ever bought for my husband.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the brand. He has had several Remington Products and always been satified and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well.  Have been using a better known brand for over 50 years.  This one works just as well for a much lesser price.</li>
    <li> PERFORMANCE&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close, uniformly, and smoothly.  Includes a &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer to trim your sideburns or moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;Not impressive.  Doesn&#x27;t feel powerful.  The &amp;#34;guts&amp;#34; inside the shaver head look flimsy. Yet the bottom line is that the shaver works well, and not a single reviewer has complained about it breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORD&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I prefer a plug-in shaver rather than having to periodically recharge a shaver, and having to replace the shaver after a year when the batteries die.  The cord is more than long enough if you have a plug near your bathroom mirror.  The cord is coiled, and so the shaver is easy to put away without tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer is mistaken, the shaver head IS removable, easily removable (and replaceable--indeed, Remington wants you to buy a new shaver head every 6 months).  It opens out on a hinge, but then you can pull it out at the hinge (see the instructions).  Unfortunately, the included little brush is nearly worthless for cleaning the head, you can brush and brush for 10 minutes and still have alot of hair left behind.  With the head open, simply gently tapping the side of the head against the side of your sink can dislodge most hair.  A little blast of canned air does a great job---so good that I doubt that it is necessary to sub-dis-assemble the shaver head (for the special &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; cleaning) as described in the instructions. [[ASIN:B000U08SYK Innovera 51505 - Compressed Gas Duster, 2 10oz Cans/Pack]]  Actually, full dissasembly/reassembly is easier than it looks, there are only two parts (counting the three identical blade heads as one part), and they fit together only one way, so don&#x27;t be afraid of fully disassembling the shave head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISINFECTING&lt;br /&gt;If a sick person or someone with a skin condition uses the shaver, there is a good chance of spreading infection to anyone else who uses the shaver, or even reintroducing the infection to yourself.  Take the shaving head off and immerse it in a saucer (or plastic jar cap) filled with 1/4&amp;#34; of isopropyl alcohol for a few minutes.  Swab out the rest of the compartment with cotton swabs and alcohol, or alcohol wipes.  After disinfecting, lubricate the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUBRICATION&lt;br /&gt;Although household oil works fine, [[ASIN:B000VV0ETK Wahl 18 Clipper Oil]] is inexpensive, and probably worth buying with the shaver. Just smear a little on the outside of the metal shave heads, run the shaver 10 or 20 seconds, and wipe off the excess.  Although more expensive, you might also consider a small tube of Teflon lubricant. [[ASIN:B002L5UL92 Finish Line Extreme Fluoro 100% DuPont Teflon Grease, 20g Syringe]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GETTING A CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with an electric shaver is less of a ritual than using a manual razor, so it is easy to forget that shaving immediately after a hot shower gives you the quickest, smoothest, shaves.  But do NOT shave IN the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same &amp;#34;shave first with-the-grain&amp;#34; rule which is important with a razor also applies to using an electric shaver--especially if you have a tough beard. However, that&#x27;s impossible to do with this shaver, because the three rotary heads cut in all directions regardless of how you use it.  Men with very tough beards may be happier with a signal-foil non-rotary electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING A SKIN BRACER&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol-based &amp;#34;skin bracer&amp;#34;, does temporarily dry (and tighten) the surface of your face exposing more hair to be cut closer, and may help control infections (and prevent contaminating the shaver) if you have a skin condition.  In any case isopropyl alcohol should do the job and be cheaper.  If you use alcohol or &amp;#34;skin bracer&amp;#34;, give it a second to dry before using the shaver.  If your face is wet with alcohol, then your face hasn&#x27;t tightened yet, and the alcohol might remove all the lubricant from the blades.

    <li> The item worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great, even with Thick Beard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electic shavers for over 45 years. If you want a shave that&#x27;s nearly as close as a blade in under for 40 seconds, this will work perfectly well. The trimmer also gets the job done to near perfection.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. My husband loved it, thanks for the fast shipment!! Would recommend this razor for others to buy.</li>
    <li> One of the most awful products I have ever tried to use. The blades don&#x27;t cut facial hair so much as they pull your hair and skin directly out. The cord is short and there is no battery. Do not purchase unless you intend to pull a prank on a friend or you have a thing for immense pain and frustration.</li>
    <li> Shaves well and fast. Cord is just long enough and back trimer is great for side burns. Very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always owned a cordless/battery-powered shaver. I currently use it to primarily shave my head. While the cord on this unit is short (it&#x27;s still more than usable), it runs/spins SO MUCH FASTER that there&#x27;s NO COMPARISON. With a cordless shaver, it would ALWAYS seem to loose its charge/slow down before I&#x27;d finish. I should have got a &amp;#34;corded: shaver years ago!!</li>
    <li> The razor does a close and quick shave and an unbeatable price. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yes! BECAUSE ITS ONLY 25 DOLLARS, but it is easy to clean and works perfectly. The cord is coiled which is great and the length is pretty good, could be a bit longer I suppose, but I really have no problem what so ever with it. My wireless razor has a shorter cord!</li>
    <li> Had the rechargeable battery version of one a lot like this.  Never had any power.  The A/C cord gives it all the power and speed that a much more expensive rendition of it lacked.  Same high quality smooth shave.  Attractive price.</li>
    <li> Excelent, everthing was ok, then item is new in box and works like I tought. The item is like de pictures.</li>
    <li> bought 3 as gifts.  young men and they are learning to use them.  No complaints other than they pull, but that is their fault for waiting to long to shave,</li>
    <li> You can spend more, a lot more, and not get a better more comfortable shave. This is a corded shaver without a battery which I prefer as they are longer lasting and more reliable. I also find the corded razors deliver more consistant power. A carry case for travel would rate a fifth star. One suggestion I offer is to simply clean the blades in place (the compartment flips open) with the included brush. Removing them for a more thorough cleaning is unnessary and a real hassle reassembling. A po-up trimmer at this price is an unexpected plus.</li>
    <li> For the budget minder consumer this shaver fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job of shaving,the triple heads are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;No compliaints,,,recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a much more expensive Remington that was starting to struggle after a couple of years, feeling a little light in the wallet at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done and is easy to clean, but definitely a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; choice. It&#x27;s already starting to blunt and nip after only a few months, although I ought to note that I don&#x27;t look after these things especially carefully and don&#x27;t shave every day giving it a harder job to do when I do shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate it as \\&quot;OK\\&quot; nonetheless, it would be unreasonable to expect too much at this price.</li>
    <li> The packaging for this thing probably cost more than the product.  I had to use a tactical folder&lt;br /&gt;knife to slice, pry, and dig the packaging open.  In the process, the shaver fell on the floor and&lt;br /&gt;one of the shaving heads was ruined.  I examined the shaver, and concluded it was junk anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic, plastic, and more plastic!  I threw the thing in the garbage without ever using it.&lt;br /&gt;I remember the days when Remington made high quality products!  NO STARS for this turkey, they made me&lt;br /&gt;give it one.</li>
    <li> this razor provides me with a smooth/good shave in between my normal safety razor uses, no nicks,no pulls, just a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many shavers in my lifetime, this one works well but it is the first one I have ever purchased which did not have a little case and a plastic snap-on cover for the shaver heads. I travel around and need these things. They should at lease TELL YOU that you do not get these things.</li>
    <li> the remington i purchased at amazon,  is a great razor. it is the 2nd one i have had. i recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great and since it&#x27;s corded, there&#x27;s no battery to wear out after a few years. Not as close as a blade, but good for an electric.</li>
    <li> No shaving products these days rival the Norelco shaver of the past. This Remington is a nice light weight product that I think will serve me well for many years. It shaves close and is easy to manuever. The shortcoming of the product is the power cord. It is too short and tightly coiled. This causes the plug to pull out of the wall socket easily.Otherwise this product offers flex heads, trimmer and low noise. Good product.</li>
    <li> close shave, cleaner face, shave less often, at age 93 just what I needed.  Never&lt;br /&gt;realized that there would be such a difference.</li>
    <li> Granted, the price was very low, but I guess you get what you pay for - broke within a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> great value ALMOST perfect shave.  little weak under nose and on chin,  for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  PTL</li>
    <li> it sucks it still pulls like my old razor plus its corded didnt relise it was corded till i got it. this product sucks.</li>
    <li> For the price of replacing the blades on my cordless shaver, I got this whole shaver instead. I think it cuts better than my expensive Phillips-Norelco. I agree with other reviews that the cord is too short, but that is a problem that is easily solved.</li>
    <li> THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS SHAVER IS IT TENDS TO POP OPEN, BUT I HAVE PROPPED UP AGAINST A WALL. COULD BE THAT..BLADES HAVE REMAINED SHARP AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE. REQUIRES THOUROUGH CLEANING EVERY 2 WEEKS  AS ALL DO; A TRICKY MANEAUVER.</li>
    <li> does not cut very close otherwise ok- cleaning is easy- asks for ten more wordsso have added ten more words</li>
    <li> At first turn on/off when I flipped open the head all three cutters fell out as they apparently were never secured by the holding ring. No recurrence after I secured them. It&#x27;s hard to beat a good safety razor shave but it does a decent job as long as I use a pre shave lotion.  The cord is rediculous.  Not only is it short but the coiling is too tight making shaving a bit unpleasant unless you are right by the electrical plug.</li>
    <li> Works great a little difficult to clean! Otherwise easy to handle and cuts nice. comparable to other shavers. Better than battery shavers</li>
    <li> I dislike weak battery stuff and all the &#x27;floating head&#x27; gimmickry. I want 120 v power and I want a simple shaver. Just purchased this shaver and it works great right out of the box.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an identical product I use. I would puchase it again. Pas on my satisfaction with this product.</li>
    <li> This is ok for the price. Blades are sharp and it is light weight since it is plug-in only. The cord is a little short and it does not shave as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> Looked at many electric to replace one I have had for over 30 years.  What was important was no batteries, and had to have a sideburn trimmer.  This had both.  It is not nearly as well made as my previous one.  It also is quite involved to take out the blades and clean them with a brush.  On the old razor this was easy to do. I now clean it with the brush that was furnished and blow into it to get out, hopefully, the cut up hairs the brush did not get to.  It shaves good, but have to go over the same area a few times.</li>
    <li> my gripe with cordless razors is that they bite when you get down to where you need to charge them. My new Corded razor shaves the same every single time. So comfort is rated higher that convienence. My hats off to the company that still knows corded over cordless.</li>
    <li> I purposely purchased a corded razor, because my last rechargeable would not work plugged in if it had a low charge.  I find the razor sufficient, my 5:00 shadow appears much sooner.  I find I have to hold the plug to the outlet while I&#x27;m shaving so it won&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> Excellent close shave, but you **must** use a good thick layer of Lectric Shave or some similar product, otherwise you&#x27;ll get major razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s running, it sounds like a cheap little motor, but it cuts just fine.</li>
    <li> Hubby has one like this and I use it for me. Bought one for myself and one for my son so now we are all happy.&lt;br /&gt;Good price too.</li>
    <li> I dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut smoothly, evenly, and super close. My skin is left very soft after I shave and cleaning this product is very easy (I haven&#x27;t used water on them). Shaving under the chin can be a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it then you&#x27;re golden. I recommend hydrating your skin with lotion or aftershave directly after using this product to avoid irritation if you also dry shave.</li>
    <li> it did not give a very close shave and cleaning was cumbersome and time consuming , the power was great and impressive . corded much better than a cordless</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend and he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wanted a corded razor as to not bother with charging the battery. Often, while being charged, a rechargable razor does not function at full speed when trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;This works great, HOWEVER, there&#x27;s always a &#x27;however&#x27;. The cord is actually detachable(go figure) so it wants to unplug while using. I guess as the cord gets stretched this may be less of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very smooth shave. The cord is short so I have to stand closer to the mirror which makes it easier to see my face.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I dont have to charge a battery anymore. Its always at full power, and if no plugin is around then really what is the point of shaving.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son.  It is a well made razor with good functionality.  Hope he uses it well for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful and makes my husband look attractive.  I like to look at him with use of Remington.</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these over the years.  This is first one I purchased from Amazon since my previous big-chain-discount retailer no longer carried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely buy the &#x27;corded&#x27; razor to avoid any battery malfunctions.  The cord is long enough for me, and it does stretch out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this low price is that when you need to buy new blades (every year or so) it is pretty much exactly the same price to just buy a complete new razor.  (Approximately $25.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> it is pretty loud but it cuts close and doesnt rip hairs out its not wireless it has to be pluged in but its a nice shaver</li>
    <li> I am completely new to electric shavers, and not really comfortable with this. Besides the feeling of my skin having to go with the wiskers, I have a feeling that this is just the way electric shavers are. I am very impressed with the design. The flip out sideburn trimmer is ingenious, and the world electric compatability is really neat. May be handy for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old self-cleaning cordless shaver battery finally died after about a year, which promptly made it a plastic brick that cost me $110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I vowed I would never again buy a shaver without a cord and shopped around Amazon for a well-reviewed, dependable corded shaver. This guy cost less than 1/3 the price of my old one, has no cleaning fluid to buy, has no footprint for cleaning station which clears up my bathroom sink, is relatively easy to clean, and should last until the motor literally falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you do need to open up the head to clean out the little hair trimmings, and although it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, I could see the hinge fastener (or the hinge itself) on the lid breaking.  That would destroy the head. Not sure if that can be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> It seems to shave as well as my old Norelco,  of the same &amp;#34;3-head&amp;#34;  type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very quiet.  As I am used to cleaning my previous razor for so many years,  I will have to learn,  and adapt to,  a little bit of a different system for removing the parts,  to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,  at about $35.00 cost,  I feel I made the right purchase.</li>
    <li> This was for my bf and he loves it. The side trimmers are what really make it great. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;It shaves, but not as clean as needed,  worse than an expensive Norelco, which died in 18 months, but better than a cheap Norelco which died in a week.  All the electric shavers follow the Gillette tactic requiring a new head every year, in the olden times a shaver worked for 16 years(an old, not made in China Norelco). So, each and every electric shaver is a rip-of. This Remington is not so bad.</li>
    <li> If your facial hair is to long the hair will get pulled by it leaving you to get pissed off and throw it against the wall</li>
    <li> It it not sharp enough? Have to go over &amp; over same spot several times to cut any &amp; all hairs.</li>
    <li> I dont like to give really bad reviews but this is the worst product bought at Amazon in 6 years! Wont even shave, I couldnt believe how bad it did, if you disagree thats ok, Im sending it back and staying with my old Braun,Steveo</li>
    <li> The Price is RIGHT and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the performance. I prefer a Razor which I can plug into the Electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and small.  Easy to handle for someone who does not need extra frills.  Cleans easily and is also small enough when packed for a trip it fits good in a small suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely heavy beard (I shave in the morning and practically have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 1030am). For years I have been using a norelco shaver to knock out the growth in the morning, and then follow it up with a mach 3 razor to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Remington for my father, but he never used it. Last week my faithful Norelco went kaput, and I was forced to use the this Remington R-3150 that was collecting dust in my father&#x27;s drawer. Two things struck me immediately.  1) The Remington, unlike the Norelco, did not hurt my face when I shaved. 2) The shave was so close, I no longer needed to do a follow up shave with my Mach-3 razor.  I won&#x27;t lie, the Remington feels much cheaper and fragile than my Norelco, but the shave is far more efficient and exponentially more comfortable. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheap price of this razor, it is AWESOME. You will not find a better razor at this price point, period.  I will only use electric razors that bare the Remington name from this point forward!</li>
    <li> like the headline says its worth the price if you looking for a good cheap replacement for razors. after two replacement set you would need for razor it pays for it self. there is a bit of tugging and pulling a first but after one use its runs smooth. just don&#x27;t let your facial hair get to long but if it does just use the flip up shaver to start then finish off with the main head. i also recommend pre-shave lotion as it does make a world of difference,</li>
    <li> Quality was not expected from this brand name.  Cheap material. Cord to short and to tightly wound. Blades pull rather than cut. Poor construction with loose fitting parts. Not representive of the Brand name I would have expected it to be.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Bought for my teenage son and have not had any type of problem with the rotary shaver.  Bought extra heads, but have not had to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a relative&#x27;s friend who is severely handicapped. His past two razors had removable cords, &amp; they tended to &amp;#34;disappear.&amp;#34; As the cord to this is attached, he should have no problems. My relative says the shaver does a god job &amp; he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR AS A BACKUP. I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO PLUG IT IN. ALL TO OFTEN BATTERY RAZORS SLOW DOWN AND START TO &amp;#34;PULL&amp;#34; WHEN SHAVING. THIS RAZOR NEVER PULLS AND IS ALWAYS READY FOR THE NEXT TIME. 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5 BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE THE CORD TO BE A LITTLE LONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE.</li>
