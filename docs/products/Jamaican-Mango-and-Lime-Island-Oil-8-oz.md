    <li> I love this oil and its not just for people with dreads...its for all types of hair. It makes your hair shiny but not so oily. Which is great to me!!!</li>

    <li> I really like this product. Usually after i get my braids done, my scalp would get dry and flaky after a couple days. With this product I just apply it before bed, in the morning and before i go outside and my scalp is clear and shinning. It smells great and my roots and hairline seem to be improving.I don&#x27;t ave to worry about dandruff when I scratch my head because I know that there is none to fall out because of this product,</li>
    <li> This product did what it said it would do. I will buy again. Great good thanks Get it for you want your locks to look and feel better.</li>
    <li> This product contains ingredients that I would not recommend for African American hair.</li>
    <li> My son has locks and this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered - keeps his hair looking great.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I think that was the best rating for it at the moment. It gives the hair a awesome shine.</li>
    <li> love the scent.  light tingly.  scalp feels nourished when i use it.  I will try some other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Too oily..very difficult to rinse out of my hair</li>
    <li> I have long locs and I use this product on a regular basis to moisturize my scalp. I would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and it&#x27;s works perfectly. I got it for my girlfriend but I ended up using it more than her</li>
    <li> This product works wonders to oil the scalp and help ladies who have braids or sew-in weaves. It is light, not too oily, great smelling, and it penetrates the scalp nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my locs. My hair and scalp have a tendency to stay very dry and other products I&#x27;ve used would cause build up in my locs. Since I&#x27;ve been using Jamaican Mango and Lime Island Oil, I no longer have build up, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch nearly as much, and my hair is healthier and more nourished. This product also has a really nice scent. The ingredients are a combination of the following oils: Mineral Oil, Castor Oil(Ricinus Commonis Seed Oil), Carrot Oil(Daucus Carota Sativa Seed Oil), Jojoba Oil(Simmoondsia Seed Oil), Olive Oil(Olea Europaea Oil), and Tea Tree Oil(Melaleuca Alternitolia Leaf Oil).</li>
    <li> I use the full line of mango n lime and just like the others, I find that the island oil is also good. I have been using it on my locs for a lil under a year and I really like it. The liquid is a lot thinner than the cactus oil and it runs less also. I use it on my scalp and the leave-in conditioner on the locs themselves. Although it has a spout, I poured it into a spray bottle and so applying it to the scalp is not messy at all. I use it twice per week normally and sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to coz my scalp is still oiled. It doesn&#x27;t tingle or anything but it works well...for me at least. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, it smells good, no build up and moisturizers my hair! Definitely a keeper! I love all their products!</li>
    <li> This oil is the best. It moisturizes your hair very deeply and last a long time. The scent everyone loves as well. My wife added a spray top to it and she sprays it in our scalp and also on the end of our dreads and massage it all in. I&#x27;ll be buying this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to use on my locs. Smells great and keeps my hair looking great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells. It feels good in my hair. I use it on my hair and face. Don&#x27;t get it on your eyelashes though. It is an oil. Oils make my eyelashes uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I like it.</li>
    <li> still trying to get used to the sent. stronger than i imagined. but, does smell good.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Does not leave any oily residue. Greta for my locks and keeping my scalp free form dandruff.</li>
    <li> If you are a guy with a shaved head,or just want to moisturize your skin,apply all over after showering.Then towell off lightly.This stuff works great and has a awesome smell.And it is so damn cheap.</li>
    <li> I add this product to my homemade loc spray that includes: water, JM&amp;L Island Oil, Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Doo Grow Mega Thick Growth Oil.  My hair is left shiny and is growing like a weed!</li>
    <li> havent used it personally yet but ive used it on clients with locks and they give it a thumbs up for their scalp care</li>
    <li> This oil works magic. A little leaves my scalp moisturized for a full week, no itching and prevents breakage.</li>
    <li> Long lasting worth every penny</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Lasts a long time. Smells great</li>
    <li> I use this on my locks...it makes them smell amazing....works okay to moistureize my locks...but again...the smell is intoxicating...my bf loooooves it!</li>
    <li> Love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
