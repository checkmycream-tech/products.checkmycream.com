### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>He is very happy with them, as well.</li>
      <li>These are an awesome solution.</li>
      <li>These extenders work great.</li>
      <li>:o)</li>
      <li>Presto MAGIC!</li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of some favorite pants!</li>
      <li>This solves the problem nicely.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the early &amp;#34;not showing, but pants not quite fitting&amp;#34; days of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>We were also very pleased with how quickly we received them after ordering!</li>
      <li>Can be a bit tricky to work over some pant buttons, but very secure and discreet.</li>
      <li>I used this product and it works ok.</li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>I love these extenders.  </li>
      <li>They are so much better than the 2 piece extender.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind also that your zipper won&#x27;t be able to go all the way up since the pants are now wider.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use them that often.  :-)</li>
      <li>But there is magic in them, they allow you to get into your jeans or pants and still breath.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and invisible once installed on pants.</li>
      <li>So, slightly less than perfect.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit on all buttons.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous item</li>
      <li>I move the original button on my pants in closer and use the extender.  </li>
      <li>Other than this it works great.</li>
      <li>They are very sturdy and on most jeans they are just right to stay on even in the wash.</li>
      <li>That tiny bit of space makes the difference in moving up a size, or staying in your favorite jeans.</li>
      <li>no give, person with limited hand mobility wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get it on pants.</li>
      <li>During those time when I am up a few pounds it is amazing how just an inch is a relief.</li>
      <li>These really do add an inch to the pants.</li>
      <li>I gained some weight recently and bought these so that my pants would still fit.  </li>
      <li>Did not fit around most buttons</li>
      <li>Hubby has a few pair of jeans that fit fine but are a little snug around the waist.  </li>
      <li>The only fault I have is you must have the large buttons on the pants or this extender slips off the button.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers...I agree that these should have a little bit more flexibility.  </li>
      <li>Pops on quickly and gives your waist a little extra room.</li>
      <li>Too large for one but not large enough for the next size.  </li>

<li> The only down side is that as stated they are hard plastic which means they don&#x27;t stretch at all.</li>
<li> I bought  pair of levi&#x27;s that were just a little too tight</li>
<li> So I bought these hoping to not have wasted my money.</li>
<li> I always gain wait after the summer and ths little piece of plastic saves me a bunch of money!</li>
<li> Hard to use and didn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
<li> Hard plastic,</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money totally worthless haven&#x27;t found anything it works with.</li>
<li> For those times when it&#x27;s just too darn hard (or painful) to button your pants!</li>
<li> and I am very disappointed</li>

    <li> In order to use these, I will have to put smaller buttons on my jeans.....the loop is NOT flexible at all and I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money totally worthless haven&#x27;t found anything it works with. Hard plastic, no give, person with limited hand mobility wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get it on pants.</li>

    <li> I love these extenders.  They are so much better than the 2 piece extender.  I move the original button on my pants in closer and use the extender.  I can finally zipper my pants.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the early &amp;#34;not showing, but pants not quite fitting&amp;#34; days of pregnancy. Can be a bit tricky to work over some pant buttons, but very secure and discreet.</li>
    <li> During those time when I am up a few pounds it is amazing how just an inch is a relief. They are very sturdy and on most jeans they are just right to stay on even in the wash.</li>
    <li> These may look like tiny plastic loops, and they are.  But there is magic in them, they allow you to get into your jeans or pants and still breath.  That tiny bit of space makes the difference in moving up a size, or staying in your favorite jeans.</li>
    <li> Woo hoo!!  Presto MAGIC! Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of some favorite pants! Fabulous item :o)</li>
    <li> I bought  pair of levi&#x27;s that were just a little too tight but I couldn&#x27;t return or exchange them as I had left them in my closet for awhile. So I bought these hoping to not have wasted my money. These are an awesome solution. Pops on quickly and gives your waist a little extra room. The only down side is that as stated they are hard plastic which means they don&#x27;t stretch at all. Keep in mind also that your zipper won&#x27;t be able to go all the way up since the pants are now wider.</li>
    <li> I gained some weight recently and bought these so that my pants would still fit.  They work Well, I have bought this twice!</li>
    <li> Did not fit around most buttons</li>
    <li> I love these things. Bought two packages, one for me, one for my husband. He is very happy with them, as well.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers...I agree that these should have a little bit more flexibility.  They don&#x27;t fit on all buttons.  So, slightly less than perfect.  But they get the job done.  Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use them that often.  :-)</li>
    <li> My husband was between sizes in pants.  Too large for one but not large enough for the next size.  These extenders work great.</li>
    <li> Hubby has a few pair of jeans that fit fine but are a little snug around the waist.  These extenders are just what he needs.  I got the 5 pack as he has a tendency to misplace things and this way he has extras until the &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; ones are found! We were also very pleased with how quickly we received them after ordering!</li>
