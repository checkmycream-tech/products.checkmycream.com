<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked this product. Its great for circulation. I was paying twice as much to get it at WalMart &amp; then they stopped carrying it. This actually works for circulation, the pain is gone!!! Thank you once again!</li>
    <li> Used a few days and it seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;Did cause some stomach upset at night on the 2nd dosage and stopped using for a while.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this product.</li>
    <li> All went well fast shipping</li>
    <li> So far my legs aren&#x27;t hurting like they were, hope it keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Have Been using this product a long time now.Works well for me.</li>
    <li> Helps my husband anytime he has leg cramps.  Clears the pain and the cramp away in just about 15 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Love this product! A+ quality.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my varicose veins.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and it does not work for here... maybe it will work for other but i doubt..</li>
    <li> May have helped a little bit. I did not buy the 2nd month, so it may be a formula that takes a couple of months to show a difference.</li>
    <li> I would have given this five stars but I want to use it long enough to make sure I&#x27;m getting results. Quick delivery, free delivery, packaged nicely, and the spider/varicose veins on the back of my knee have lightened. I&#x27;m excited to see what happens when I&#x27;m done with the whole bottle. I only had been taken one a day (kept forgetting the second dose) so results might be faster for others that are diligent with the two times a day. Hope this helps someone that&#x27;s tired of looking at those veins on their legs</li>
    <li> actually seem to have some benefit as advertised</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything yet but I&#x27;ve only been taking them two weeks so it would be unfair to post a complete review until at least 90 days have passed. Will update then</li>
    <li> Great product... Seeing immediate results. Shipping was fast and uncomplicated.</li>
    <li> My doctor, who is listed as in the top 10% of Washington Doctors, prescribed a daily dose of two horse chestnut pils a day to mitigate the excess fluid bild up in the lower legs and feet.  In my case this is due to weak valve function in the arteries and viens of the leg, a condition common with individuals over 60 years of age.  The results of taking the pills has been excellent I no longer have to wear support hose and the swelling has been reduced by about 80%. However, for when I take part in activities that require prolonged standing I will also wear the support hose.  Please note: I am flooded with emails, high among them discout offer from Amazon, and will not respond to emails on this subject.  If you have this condition I suggest you consult your doctor or take horse chestnut for a month (can&#x27;t hurt and it is inexpensive) and see if it helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife.  With the slightest of impacts, she would get large black-and-blue bruise marks on her skin that would spread out from the point of impact.  She read in the February 2015 Special Report supplement to the Mayo Clinic Health Newsletter that &amp;#34;some people with this type of bruising report benefit from taking an herbal product, horse chestnut tablets, twice daily&amp;#34;.  And benefit she did.  She has been using it for a few weeks and now she only gets small marks at the point of impact and it does not spread like before.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me a great deal. There were days I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain in my legs. I have been taking 1 capsule every 12 hours for 6 weeks now and the pain has stopped. I have forgotten to take it 2 or 3 times and I notice a little discomfort. I thought it would give me heartburn, but I take it after breakfast and after dinner and haven&#x27;t had a problem.  I don&#x27;t know for how long I will take them, for that I guess I&#x27;ll have to ask my doctor in my next appointment.</li>
    <li> Horse Chestnut may sound like a joke.  Believe me I have not experienced pain in the veins of my legs since taking horse chestnut.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item as described. Great store. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it locally.  Ok</li>
    <li> I have poor circulation and I am diabetic, this product has helped me so much that I have recommended it to my friends and have ordered for them.</li>
    <li> Taking this regularly as directed on the bottle halted the progress of varicose veins in my leg. They didn&#x27;t go away, but they didn&#x27;t get any worse. When I stopped taking it, the veins started spreading again. So I&#x27;m back to taking it, but it does make me nauseous. I&#x27;ve learned though that when I take it with high-fat foods, it doesn&#x27;t make me sick. I can have it with a whole milk smoothie in the morning, or a burger and fries at lunch, and I&#x27;m fine. But when I take it on an empty stomach, or with cereal and almond milk, I feel terrible almost immediately and the feeling lasts for an hour or more. So I&#x27;ve adapted my diet accordingly. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have spiders veins and sometimes one of my legs hurts at the end of the day (or at the beginning). After reading the reviews about Horse Chestnut, I decided to try it. This is my third month that I am taking the pills. However, nothing has changed. The spider veins haven&#x27;t changed color (as I read in some reviews) and my leg was really sore three days ago. I am disappointed but I am planning to continue taking these pills for a while since they are more natural and my veins are not getting worse. Maybe they will start making effect through the time (I hope).</li>
    <li> It is Green Medicine so it is most of the time a slow process and sometimes it works in some individuals while not in others. In my case it works. After having the pills for some weeks I can say I notice healthier legs and improved circulation. Delivery was on time. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I take this to help my blood circulation and it does help quite a bit.  Recently when I ran out of pills, my hand fell asleep pretty bad.</li>
    <li> REally has helped my circulation issues!</li>
    <li> Just started using this and feel that there have been small improvements. Hopefully with continued use of this and the bye bye vein leg cream I will get the results I want. Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I took only two capsules and had terrible pain in my intestines.  It is my sensitivity to it,  as I got older. Few years ago it did not bother me. Than, I did not take long enough to see if it works.</li>
    <li> I took this product faithfully until the bottle was empty.  I have pinkish/blue spider veins in 3 spots on my legs.  This did absolutely nothing for them. I read such great reviews and I have no idea if they were legit or not, but I can tell you that this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and am very please with it</li>
    <li> Keeps me from getting grape clusters coming out of my back side. If you know what I mean, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it&#x27;s cream. I have spider veins, lots of them on my legs, genetic and age. Applied topical cream and took capsules every day, after a month, no result. Not even 2 percent!!!</li>
    <li> I took 2 pills a day until I was done with all of them and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the spider veins on my legs, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Product itself came very promptly.  But at this time, I&#x27;m not able to give a complete review because I&#x27;ve only been talking for 2 months. Though I will say the pain has gone away in my veins, but if I&#x27; m standing for a long time it does come back.  Would I recommend it?  For the price, yes.  For the results- I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been taking  it enough yet for an amazing review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done some research on this herb online, and all of the medical sites say this is a &#x27;folk remedy&#x27; for hemorrhoids.  Maybe the white coats aren&#x27;t convinced, but I am.  Hemorrhoids are not subject to placebo effect.  You have them and suffer or they go away and you don&#x27;t.  After treating a persistent problem with cortisone suppositories with limited benefit for a year, I tried this in desperation.  For a couple of weeks I didn&#x27;t notice a benefit, and then a couple of weeks later I noticed I didn&#x27;t have issues any more.  It wasn&#x27;t a magic, over night effect.  But gradually the problem went away.  I still am careful not to strain and limit duration of sit downs, but things are MUCH better down there since I started taking these a couple of months ago.  Good enough evidence for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with Natural Care Homeopathic Ultra Vein-Gard Leg Therapy Cream, 2.25-Ounce, so I am not sure if it was one more than the other or the combination of the two, but I have seen results. It is amazing, and I will definitely be reordering when I&#x27;m am finished with the bottle.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about 3 months, all I can say it works, my veins in some part of the body disappear but others areas still there but from green or blue color now became like pink.  Im so happy, before I just to wear those spray make up on my legs everything I wear skirt but now I am little free of those things.  So far so happy...  Still taking my pills...</li>
    <li> I ordered this  item on the recommendation of a friend and reading articles about severe leg cramps. I ordered it and took it faithfully for a month at first no change in the leg cramps that kept me up  nights and afterward made my entire legs hurt due to the severity of the cramps not just in calf but in arch of foot behind the knee and above the back of the knee terrible. Doctors have tried for years to help me with these cramps. the only thing that did help was quinine sulfate prescription only but has been taken off the market due to its effect on the heart and  circulation. anyway i&#x27;ve tried every thing from drinking cider vinegar, taking mega dozes of potassium and drinking lots more water, you name it i tried it. but these  did help after about a month now i take them about 3 times a week .. I still get a cramp once in a while maybe two nights in a row and they are still bad but it used to be 4-5 nights a week now  its less than 3 nights a month so these have helped. I recommend them they helped me and I had about given up trying and trying to deal with the cramps that left me so tired so much of the time. hey if it helped me maybe it will help you too.</li>
    <li> On the first day my legs do not ache, are not swollen and itchy and no night cramps!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it was bad.  I can only suggest that I didn&#x27;t really have much of an effect from it.  I might not have been taking enough, and my symptoms might not be enough that this would help.  I have tried other supplements that are working, so I won&#x27;t say this is a bust.  Only that my minor problem with what this seems to solve really wasn&#x27;t affected.  If you have it bad, I just don&#x27;t want to turn you off from a potential help.  As a, generally, cynical buyer... I have come around a bit on these things.  Doctors... aren&#x27;t always very helpful, nor are the medicines they push, more and more, higher and higher doses... crazy.  Worth a shot, even if I wasn&#x27;t for me.  Mainly because, unlike doctors, this supplement actually did no harm on the side.</li>
    <li> My varicose vein stop hurting me,and I am able sleep at night,no heavy legs,while I am taking those.Gonna order it again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I am very disappointed. I can&#x27;t seem to find anything to help with my leg lymphadema.</li>
    <li> After taking this pill, I felt very nauseous and the next day morning, I had a really bag stomach cramp and diarrhea!! Too bad my body rejects this supplement.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware of the return policy because the seller do not accept return/refund for opened bottle. Now I end up having to throw away this vitamin supplement. What a wast of money!</li>
    <li> Helps with circulation</li>
    <li> I have bought this supplement along with the chestnut cream.  Do not see the results yet.  I should give it few more weeks.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my Mom to help with her swollen ankles in place of high doses of lasix. Seems to be working. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for my grandpa,and just this 2 bottles made his legs feel better while tried many physical and chemistry things. It does work! I&#x27;ll buy it for him next time!</li>
    <li> I was allergic to it!  Was a fast ship.</li>
    <li> I recently had a very bad allergic reaction to Ciprofloxacin; which in turn caused several problems including joint, tendon, and lower leg fatigue.  I was treated for joint problems but not the lower leg fatigue.  My lower legs felt tired as if I had ran several miles and had a lactic acid build-up.  All test for any obvious reasons were negative.  I found out about Horse Chestnut and thought it may help and that my lower leg circulation may be the problem.  I have been taking it now for a few weeks and the fatigue has greatly decreased!!!  It really works and I am very satisfied and encouraged by the results. I have much better stamina in my lower legs since taking it.  It almost changed immediately!!!...I checked around and did not find better product for the price; most were only 250-300mg and cost more. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this and in about 2 weeks I saw a difference in less pain in my legs. Will continue to take.</li>
    <li> I love this product, really helped with swelling of ankle area.</li>
    <li> I buy horsechestnut regularly from this brand and find it helps improve my leg circulation. I also use it daily to prevent varicose veins. I have searched around and recommend this brand for the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with venous insufficiency at a relatively young age. Despite good health, plenty of exercise and a mostly whole food diet, my ankles were constantly swelling and my lower legs felt heavy and tired at the end of every day regardless of my activity level. My doctor&#x27;s only &amp;#34;treatment plan&amp;#34; was compression socks and foot elevation. Research led me to horse chestnut, which began to help noticeably after a couple of weeks. The swelling has been significantly reduced and my legs no longer feel like they&#x27;re ready for bed by 4pm. Two things to note, though: 1) It causes marked nausea if I take it on an empty stomach, and 2) If i fail to take it religiously (one tablet, twice a day), my symptoms begin to recur fairly quickly. But I&#x27;m so thrilled to have an alternative to 30+ years in compression socks that these downsides are negligible.</li>
    <li> started using this and have noticed an improvement on my veins. they are defintely less visible and legs feel less heavy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m too inconsistent to tell if it works.  but can&#x27;t blame the product.  I accidentally had one order sent to jail to an inmate I send books to.  They were giving him such a bad time about receiving Horsechestnut!</li>
    <li> Works for other things than advertised ;)  I took these pills based on recommendations from a forum.  I woke up in the morning real surprised.</li>
    <li> my leg was just swollen on day I put my hand on my leg and a dent was left where my finger was I had water on my leg I went to the DR took the water pills but I said it has to be something else that can help my cramp and swollen leg came across this and it was a blessing it work I don&#x27;t have to wear my tight stocking at night as much but I do put them on just in case but I don&#x27;t really need them. But this horse chestnut work it really work add grape seed extract also that help with the cramps also ...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the positive results, if there are any. No adverse effects from product.</li>
    <li> The capsules work and the price was good.  More words, more words, more words, more words, more words, more words...</li>
    <li> This brand of Horse Chestnut for leg veins is best because its ingredients are not as bad as the ingredients of other brands for healthy leg veins, and it actually works. I purchase this product for the veins on my legs that stand out. Since taking this product, those veins are less noticeable. I have also notice that the black and blue marks I sometimes get on my body from bumping into something are disappearing quicker.</li>
    <li> It is working i guess</li>
    <li> I started taking this and within approximately five days I started to see less swelling in my feet and legs.  I think that it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivered and well packaged.work very well for my fathers,he said is good for the leg pain .</li>
    <li> Recommended by doctor for better blood flow.  Not running like a horse yet, but came quickly and not terribly costly.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and was very happy to be able to get it so quickly and at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Marj</li>
    <li> I have a very serious complicated history of recurrent life-threatening blood clots (DVT) and it&#x27;s associated maladies including chronic venous insufficiency, lymphedema, raynaud&#x27;s syndrome, may thurner syndrome as well as other complications spanning 2 decades of recurrent occlusions cutting off flow from my leg. I have occluded every major vein in my leg, repeatedly. I have experienced massive chronic ulcerations, the worst took 3 years to close up but left a huge deep black scar.  It is not unheard of for my leg to gain 20 pounds by swelling. Yes, it gets huge. Medical doctors do not have any answers, despite having gone to the full gambit of specialists, repeatedly.  I&#x27;m simply left to manage as best as I can. The one thing to note, from *all* my specialists, is they are absolutely stunned as to the visible HEALTH of my affected leg especially after they review 20 years of Doppler studies, venagrams, and MRV reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a small fortune on my health and my leg vein health.  Among supplements, Horse Chestnut tops my list as being vital for the health of my leg.  There are many interesting reports on horse chestnut and vein health, especially regarding chroniv venous insufficiency which means the valves within the veins do not work as well as they should.  Horse Chestnut works well with my other supplements including plenty of omega 3s, a good whole food sourced multi such as new chapter, magnesium, vitamin D (very high dose), vitamin K2- mk7, turmeric, aloe, spirulina, ginger and the myriad of other supplements that I take daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Way contains Horse Chestnut seed extract 250 mg (standardized to 20% aescin) and calendula 100 mg per capsule.  The directions state to take 1 capsule twice daily with food or water.  The customer service is 800-9NATURE or the naturesway website.</li>
    <li> I have seen and felt a difference in regards to vein swelling so I would recommend this product.  I have been using the product for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Im waiting for results it been taken it for about a week.</li>
    <li> Perfect! A+A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I have terrible varicose veins in my left leg from my groin through the knee is one thick cord with blue bulging knots along the way. It was so painful I went to see a vascular surgeon who said I needed surgery. Not convinced, I decided to research herbal remedies for varicose veins.  I found substantial evidence in favor of horse chestnut and ordered this extract. Guess what? It worked! That same night within a couple of hours of taking the extract the pain subsided! I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it worked for me! No more burning, soreness, heaviness or itching, needle pins, etc..&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me was that I am also sensitive to getting nauseous/headache within an hour of taking it so I needed to find a smaller dose or a time released formula. I tend to be really sensitive to meds but this may not be the case for you. It&#x27;s definitely worth taking a chance on it, it works great for circulation and keeping the painful, uncomfortable effects of varicose veins or venous insufficiency (its formal medical term) away. The veins won&#x27;t  disappear visually (at least not at the low dose I&#x27;m taking - one a day) but it&#x27;ll keep the pain and discomfort in check.  It feels and looks to me like they have been reduced and don&#x27;t bulge out as much. I had bulge that was red and inflamed-looking before I took the extract but has since gone to normal color and has not come back. Highly highly recommend horse chestnut for varicose veins! Can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> This rating is for the Horse Chestnut Cream AND the supplement.  I had to give a star rating for each, and thought I&#x27;d give it a 4 to start, and work my way from there.  I plan on updating as I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Horse Chestnut Cream:  Started on 7/3/13,  is a deep taupe, thick yet smooth consistency, smell is medicinal like a Bengay type of smell.  It&#x27;s not a repulsive smell and the scent began to fade after about 20 minutes or so.  Scent eventually was completely gone.  It gave a cooling feel when applied to the varicose veins on my lower legs, (calves, shins, behind knees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Horse Chestnut supplement by Nature&#x27;s Way:  started on 7/1/13. Taking 1 pill, 2xd, with food.  No tummy upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/15/13 - No noted changes.  Been faithful with both the cream and the supplement.&lt;br /&gt;7/21/13 - Slightly less bulging of the varicose veins and they don&#x27;t seem to pop out as often.  It&#x27;s a very slight difference but something is better than nothing.  The trial continues.  I&#x27;d like to completely finish the bottle of Horse Chestnut AND the Horse Chestnut Cream.  The cream is tedious to keep up with and I can see how easy it could be to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; or \\&quot;pass\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not quitting and will remain faithful to it.  I keep it with my toothbrush since I&#x27;m there every morning and night.  It insures I won&#x27;t forget to apply.&lt;br /&gt;8/2/13 - Soon to be finishing up the first bottle.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the veins aren&#x27;t as dark in color, &amp;thought they still protrude on &amp; off throughout the day, it&#x27;s not quite as much, AND easier to go back in!  I will not be stopping the supplements, but am beginning to question my need for the cream.  In all fairness, I will finish the full container of the cream before making the decision whether or not to buy again.  I will be staying on the supplement as my gut is telling me, that this is what&#x27;s really helping.  I suspect that the cream would be if I had discomfort in areas, (in which I do not).&lt;br /&gt;9/21/13 - In the past three weeks, I&#x27;ve been less consistent with the CREAM and when I saw that there wasn&#x27;t a change in the appearance of color and size of the veins, it helped me see the cream alone wasn&#x27;t causing the improvements.  It may be that the pills I&#x27;m taking are the cause of the improvements!  Maybe this cream will be helpful if you have pain, but since I haven&#x27;t any pain, I am opting not to purchase the cream again.  I will remain on the pills.s, I&#x27;ve been less consistent with the CREAM and when I saw that there wasn&#x27;t a change in the appearance of color and size of the veins, it helped me see the cream alone wasn&#x27;t causing the improvements.

    <li> I ordered this product in hopes it would help my problems with swelling and inflammation of legs.  Within the first week of use, I was able to see noticeable visible results and reduction of leg discomfort.  After just three weeks of use the outer skin of my legs is healing nicely.  Previously used Lasix and ProCaps Circulation &amp; Vein Support capsules.  Neither of those products displayed the wonderful results of Horse Chestnut.  I like the convenience of just needing to take just two capsules.  I do take them with food to help avoid any potential stomach upset.  This products results exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been working fine my legs don&#x27;t get numb anymore, I will continue to purchase this item in the future :)</li>
    <li> My veins are pretty mild at this point in time, but one vein feels tender like a bruise. Two pills a day seems to stop that discomfort. I still wear compression garments most waking hours, but if I want to go without for a special occasion I can do so without feeling that tenderness. I feel fairly confident that it isn&#x27;t a placebo effect since I took the pills for a while, thought they were doing nothing, the tenderness came back, and then the tenderness went away once I started taking the pills again. The appearance of my veins didn&#x27;t change any like other people said their veins did. I just wish there was more long term research about this product . . is it safe to use forever? Can pregnant women take it? Who knows . . .  :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year....it is helping the veins in especially my left leg...give a try but don&#x27;t expect instant results.  I had double knee replacements a month ago.  I use support hose to avoid a blood clot...the combo of hose and this med have definitely helped me.</li>
    <li> No negative effects. Haven&#x27;t used product long enough yet to leave a valid review.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations expected</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted and needed and fast shipping -- thank you!</li>
    <li> Be sure to check with your doctor before you purchase. My doctor said not right for me. I do like the nature&#x27;s way brand &amp; trust it.</li>
    <li> I took an entire bottle of this stuff as directed and noticed absolutely no difference in the look or feel of the veins on my legs.  It didn&#x27;t hurt anything, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> My legs feel so much better after taking these pills! Normally they feel heavy but now they feel great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has those bad dark looking places on his ankle due to poor circulation. I can honestly say I see them gradually going away so it has to be doing something.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with swollen ankles and my cardiologist suggested I try Horsechestnut Extract in place of a water pill. So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems, but have only been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I read that this product would work on those tiny red veins that you sometimes see on the surface of your skin and it does</li>
    <li> i love this one helps a lot to your veins</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!!!&lt;br /&gt;You could notice the difference but take it with meals it is to strong for the stomach</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taking horse chestnut for a year or so.  Can&#x27;t really tell if it is doing anything.  I have veins popping up and they surely aren&#x27;t going anywhere.</li>
    <li> I started ordering horsechestnut sometime in the fall of 2011. I was using a different brand until trying this one. I think they&#x27;re both good brands but I like this one better. If you have problems with edema in your legs due to vein problems like spider veins or varicose veins then give this a try. As long as I take this twice a day, my legs feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also try some hydrotherapy and avoid a shower head with forceful water pressure. Use a shower head that let&#x27;s the water run out gently on your skin. I found that the forceful water pressure on my shower head was adding to my leg aches and circulation issues; it made them worse. When your done showering, let a little cool water or cold water run down your body or just your legs for a few minutes (not too long), or take a cool bath, OR a warm bath with epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe vera gel is good for soothing leg aches due to painful varicose veins as well. You should give that a try in combination with horsechestnut and definitely research about hydrotherapy; it really does help. And good luck. I hope I&#x27;ve helped someone out there.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do: prevent me from having leg cramps at night. No problems with take in, almost tasteless. After using this for 6 weeks now, I found a good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Bought is for my mom. She loves it. Great product. It really helps with her veins swelling.</li>
    <li> I have  a standing-out wains on my legs. After 1 months of taking these, they are normal. I&#x60;m just happy.</li>
    <li> My local store has every supplement under the sun except Horse Chestnut. I have bad circulation and wanted to give it a try. The product supplied through Amazon does the job. My circulation is improving, but don&#x27;t expect results overnight. The pills are good value, and easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> This gave me horrid stomach cramps. This IS a potential side effect so you need to try it to see if it has that effect on you. For the effect it had on me I couldn&#x27;t possibly give it more than one stars.</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from varicose and spider veins, as well as some circulation issues, I have tried just about everything.  So while considering yet another round of medical intervention in hopes of getting back in some fabulous shorts, I stumbled on some information about horse chestnut.  Even a little information was found on the Mayo Clinic site, so I decided to give it a shot.  Within about 16 days, I began to see a difference!  While it isn&#x27;t a cure and doesn&#x27;t reverse my condition, the color of my legs and ankles improved markedly.  Some of the veins are looking less prominent as well, and overall the feeling of my legs is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best news and proof positive of the impact horse chestnut has:  I went to my nail tech for a pedicure and she held my foot in her hands and said, &amp;#34;Oh my goodness!  What have you done?  The color of your foot and leg looks so much better!!&amp;#34;  My hope is that things continue to improve and at this price, continuing use is easy to justify!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working wonders for my foot and ankle edema!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and She is so grateful. No more pain in her legs, no swelling. She noticed a big difference after 3 days of taking the horsechestnut.  I think she lost weight as well. Great supplement</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference :(</li>
    <li> I have terrible varicose veins in my left leg. For the past couple of years they have been very painful. I went to my doctor who told me to get compression stockings which I do not like and had trouble wearing. In desperation I started doing research on alternative means for the pain. I came across these pills and the reviews were positive so I ordered a bottle. Being a skeptic I figured these would not help in the least. However, much to my surprise after taking these as directed I could tell a difference. I can tell when I forget and miss a pill because the pain starts back. I would recommend for people to give these a try. I will purchase more because they are just that good.</li>
    <li> Before taking horsechestnut extract I had a lot of trouble with leg pain and broken vessels.  Nothing will end varicose veins but this has helped take away the leg pain and slow down vein breakage.</li>
    <li> while there are other vein supporting ingredients I like to get in a vein product, I notice the difference when I ran out.</li>
    <li> Company was said they would get in touch with me re question after 48 hours - took about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Upon ingesting this product, I almost immediately developed a severely upset stomach. I think I took it without food, which may go against the directions on the bottle, but even so it should not have been *that* bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, without in any way altering my routine, supplementation or any other variable, I experienced horrible calf cramping at the gym - in both right and left calf muscles. It&#x27;s hard for me to isolate that to any variable other than the horse chestnut I had taken the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this product benefits many people, but I suggest that you get advice from a doctor or homeopath before starting a horse chestnut regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has some advice or insight as to why this stuff screwed up my gut so badly, I&#x27;d appreciate hearing it.</li>
    <li> Give it time; it will do wonders for your body health.</li>
