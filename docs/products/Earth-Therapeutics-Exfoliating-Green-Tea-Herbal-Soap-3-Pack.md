      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that having a bar in the bathroom practically doubles as an air freshener!    </li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Although it comes in a couple of scents, the green tea is our favorite.</li>
      <li>Dry skin and small lesions seem to just disappear, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how great I feel when that towel hits my body after such an invigorating encounter!!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually really sensitive to bar soaps, but this one hasn&#x27;t bothered me yet.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin soft and sometimes I don&#x27;t put on lotion.</li>
      <li>The exfoliation from the rice granules are just right - not too rough, but gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and the exfoliating property of this soap and have used it for the past several years.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause any burning or rash, lasts a long time, a little goes a long way and has a pleasant but low key fragrance.</li>
      <li>I placed a bar in the shower and when I went back a few hours later it had filled the room with a wonderfully sweet green tea scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda deceptive because the product seems natural, herbal, from &amp;#34;earth&amp;#34; etc, with only 3 ingredients listed....</li>
      <li>(the granules are a little scratchy, but the nice thing is that they actually come out of the soap, they don&#x27;t stay stuck in there like little barbs to come back and haunt you shower after shower).</li>
      <li>It does not dry it out, does not irratate my face and it does not cause my face to</li>
      <li>Also the soap doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and are made with all natural ingredients.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve  been using this soap for quite a few years</li>
<li> It also has this pebbly texture that acts as a mild exfoliant, but it&#x27;s not abrasive or annoying....</li>
<li> Which really is too bad because I adore this soap.</li>
<li> and it does not leave scum on the shower.  </li>
<li> Sadly, it&#x27;s become nearly impossible to find in stores.  </li>

    <li> I used to buy this  soap at bb&amp;b of coarse they stopped supplying it. It by far one of the best soaps on the planet.  There are few simple pleasures this is defiantly one</li>
    <li> As someone with skin that&#x27;s both dry and very sensitive, I run into trouble with a lot of exfoliating soaps being too harsh, but the rice bran granules in this bar are small enough to create a scrubbing sensation without being overly-scratchy.

    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a one star due to the ingredients not clearly stated on the package. It&#x27;s kinda deceptive because the product seems natural, herbal, from &amp;#34;earth&amp;#34; etc, with only 3 ingredients listed....now I&#x27;m no rocket scientist but I know it takes more than that to make soap. Here I will list the actual ingredients (which btw aren&#x27;t exactly earth friendly) contained in this product which I obtained from Earth Therapeutics myself.........Sodium Palmate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Water, Glycerine, Sorbitol, Fragrance, Palm Acid, Palm Kernel Acid, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Powder, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Menthol, Carmellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Yellow 10, Green 3.&lt;br /&gt;So my advice is, don&#x27;t ever buy anything that doesn&#x27;t list all the ingredients &amp; make sure those ingredients are safe.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best natural soap that I have used. I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of natural soaps, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t sting my skin. It smells really nice too, makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa. It does have little exfoliator granules in it, so if you don&#x27;t like that, you will not like this soap (the granules are a little scratchy, but the nice thing is that they actually come out of the soap, they don&#x27;t stay stuck in there like little barbs to come back and haunt you shower after shower). Over all, a very nice soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for over a year now and it&#x27;s the best for my skin type (combination skin). The exfoliation from the rice granules are just right - not too rough, but gets the job done. I&#x27;m usually really sensitive to bar soaps, but this one hasn&#x27;t bothered me yet. A must try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this soap for quite a few years and I absolutely love it.  It has a lovely fragrance, not too strong.  It also has this pebbly texture that acts as a mild exfoliant, but it&#x27;s not abrasive or annoying....just wakes up the skin.  The best part of this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a soap residue in your tub or shower.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> love it but won&#x60;t pay the postage, will do without.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  The smell is so fresh and clean and your entire bathroom smells wonderful after you use this soap in the shower.  Gets you clean but not dry and is very refreshing!!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and the exfoliating property of this soap and have used it for the past several years.</li>
    <li> I found the same soap at Ross for half the price. Still, it is a wonderful product and makes your skin feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> My friend got this soap for me and I really like them and good that I can buy them here, price was good.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any burning or rash, lasts a long time, a little goes a long way and has a pleasant but low key fragrance.</li>
    <li> wonderful for your face washing</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. It smells good, it gives a nice little scrub action&lt;br /&gt;and it has tea tree oil in it. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br /&gt;my skin at all. I&#x27;ve enjoyed for about eight years now.</li>
    <li> I will never use another soap again. This stuff is our absolute favorite. I love the smell and the exfoliating rice.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this soap but hate the costs involved in getting it. I just can&#x27;t justify spending the money it costs plus shipping. Which really is too bad because I adore this soap.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap.  Sadly, it&#x27;s become nearly impossible to find in stores.  Thank goodness I&#x27;ve had luck finding them online through Amazon!</li>

    <li> Have used this soap for many years. Have even given it for gifts to family members. Delightful smell and leaves you feeling fresh. Although it comes in a couple of scents, the green tea is our favorite.</li>
    <li> I got this bar soap for a b-day present probably 10 yrs ago and just absolutely love it. It smells wonderful,  no waste you just put 1bar on top of another, not slimy at all. Its moisturizing too! Only trouble is I have to order online because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>

    <li> I just love it, it is really aromatic when you use it and does not dry the skin</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have found for my face.  It does not dry it out, does not irratate my face and it does not cause my face to&lt;br /&gt;break out.  Love it!</li>
