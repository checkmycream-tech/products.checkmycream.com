<ol>
      <li>Very happy</li>
      <li>Really very nice, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>with the price, it is indeed a good buy.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the product that I bought.</li>
      <li>(so no knock-off for sure!)</li>
      <li>CLEAN is a great brand but overpriced at some stores.</li>
      <li>then that the fragrance is lovely.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I simply LOVE this perfume.  </li>
      <li>Box and product un used and I was very happy with entire experience.</li>
      <li>Many times I see an Amazon price vs the list price and think \\&quot;how</li>
      <li>She says it is her favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it because it is so feminine but without any \\&quot;fruit.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>This fragrance has a clean, linen start but also a nice bit of floral.  </li>
      <li>i love this beautiful parfum that reminds me of fine french soap.  </li>
      <li>I easily found it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>i love the scent, not too strong and not too mild either.</li>
      <li>&quot; I was at a popular cosmetic store that occasionally offers 20% off coupons but even more rarely are you able to apply that to perfumes.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful everyday fragrance to wear to work, shopping or lunch with the girls.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat this price for such a great smelling product.</li>
      <li>It was easy to purchase, came quickly, and best of all, cost HALF the price of what I used to pay at the store.  </li>
      <li>She has many clean products and this is her special &#x27;going out on special occasions&#x27; perfume.</li>
      <li>But I love this Fresh, clean scent.</li>
      <li>i will recommend this to those who want a fresh and clean scent :)</li>
      <li>Not citrusy like the original CLEAN.</li>
      <li>Got it in 2 days and its a good scent to wear to the office: Light and non-offensive and at a terrific price.</li>
      <li>I always receive compliments when I wear any of the Clean Fragrances and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item directly from amazon.com (not from a third party seller on Amazon) and it arrived perfectly!  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong but delivers a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>At that store this was at full list price.</li>
      <li>Clean Provence has a feminine fresh scent as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I got it at about a quarter of the price and it came quickly.</li>
      <li>that I know their products are new and authentic.</li>
      <li>The Fragrance smells wonderful, but the scent doesnt last long, and you have to use quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>It smells like flowers and fresh herbs.</li>
      <li>Was shipped quickly and I received fast and not damaged.</li>
      <li>I was one of the apprehensive buyers, expecting the item to be inauthentic, but to my relief, this item was 100% original and new and at a much cheaper price!  </li>
      <li>Just reminds me of a fresh field of flowers and clean laundry all at the same time.</li>
      <li>This one is little bit sophisticated but also fresh.</li>
      <li>Aside from the staying power it&#x27;s a real win/win but at 50% off you can afford to spray on a couple of times a day.</li>
      <li>I can put it on and go straight to work without offending anyone or giving myself a headache.  </li>
      <li>i really dislike smelling like fruit.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell of Clean Provence as it smelled less soapy than their other fragrances.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes as I get migraines.</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers about the short lasting power of this fragrance, but the same happens with the other Clean fragrances that I have (Warm Cotton and Shower Fresh).  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the scent, and it is unfortunate that the smell doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Lasts longer on my skin than the other CLEAN fragrances.</li>
      <li>Clean fragrances usually do not last that long despite EDP strength.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, packing looked the same as the picture on amazon.</li>
      <li>Bought for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas</li>
      <li>I found this perfume to be warm, smells slightly soapy with a fresh white musk dry down.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was brand new, still in its box, and smelled just like the tester at my local Ulta</li>
      <li>I have not yet had the opportunity to try Clean Provence in a heavily infested area-- will likely do that soon.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and feminine and I never feel like it is too heavy or overpowering.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of other purfum sprays, but it also goes on so much lighter and for me that is a plus.  </li>
      <li>My favourite CLEAN scent...very subtle smell.</li>

    <li> i love this beautiful parfum that reminds me of fine french soap.  I love it because it is so feminine but without any \\&quot;fruit.\\&quot;  i really dislike smelling like fruit.  This fragrance has a clean, linen start but also a nice bit of floral.  It doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of other purfum sprays, but it also goes on so much lighter and for me that is a plus.  I can put it on and go straight to work without offending anyone or giving myself a headache.  I would give it five stars if it lasted a bit longer, or were a lower price but for me I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Clean Provence has a feminine fresh scent as advertised.  My friends and family compliment me whenever I wear it.  As if that weren&#x27;t enough, I find that this fragrance, when applied liberally before outdoor activities, actually seems to repel mosquitoes!  I typically get bitten on average of 3x per mountain bike ride.  However, since using this product I&#x27;ve suffered no bites at all.. None!  Caveat: I have not yet had the opportunity to try Clean Provence in a heavily infested area-- will likely do that soon.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes as I get migraines. But I love this Fresh, clean scent. It is something I can wear to work, casually or a dressier night. Just reminds me of a fresh field of flowers and clean laundry all at the same time. The only negative is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day or very long so I&#x27;d bring a travel size or roller with you for touch ups during the day.</li>
    <li> Many times I see an Amazon price vs the list price and think \\&quot;how do I know it ever sells for the list price anywhere?\\&quot; I was at a popular cosmetic store that occasionally offers 20% off coupons but even more rarely are you able to apply that to perfumes. At that store this was at full list price. I liked the smell of Clean Provence as it smelled less soapy than their other fragrances. That said, like their other fragrances this only lasts a couple of hours tops. I decided to hold off on using the 20% off coupon and checked to see if Amazon carried it and I&#x27;m glad I did. Amazon carries this at 50% off the list price. Got it in 2 days and its a good scent to wear to the office: Light and non-offensive and at a terrific price. Aside from the staying power it&#x27;s a real win/win but at 50% off you can afford to spray on a couple of times a day.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product that I bought. I got it at about a quarter of the price and it came quickly. Very happy</li>
    <li> I found this perfume to be warm, smells slightly soapy with a fresh white musk dry down. Really very nice, pleasant smell. Lasts longer on my skin than the other CLEAN fragrances. Not citrusy like the original CLEAN. This one is little bit sophisticated but also fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful everyday fragrance to wear to work, shopping or lunch with the girls.  It isn&#x27;t too strong but delivers a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She says it is her favorite perfume. Shipping was fast, packing looked the same as the picture on amazon. That is all I can say about it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item directly from amazon.com (not from a third party seller on Amazon) and it arrived perfectly!

I was one of the apprehensive buyers, expecting the item to be inauthentic, but to my relief, this item was 100% original and new and at a much cheaper price!  I agree with other reviewers about the short lasting power of this fragrance, but the same happens with the other Clean fragrances that I have (Warm Cotton and Shower Fresh).  Clean fragrances usually do not last that long despite EDP strength.  I will be buying from amazon.com in the future now that I know their products are new and authentic.</li>
    <li> My favourite CLEAN scent...very subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Although this is an eau de parfum, it does not last! Not at all.    I LOVE the scent, and it is unfortunate that the smell doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Mom for Christmas and she loves it. She has many clean products and this is her special &#x27;going out on special occasions&#x27; perfume.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about a &amp;#34;clean, fresh&amp;#34; scent.  This was more like dirty dishwater.  I won&#x27;t use it and hope to find someone to give it to who likes it.</li>
    <li> Was shipped quickly and I received fast and not damaged. Box and product un used and I was very happy with entire experience.</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE this perfume.  However, the store where I used to buy it no longer carries this formulation.  I easily found it through Amazon.  It was easy to purchase, came quickly, and best of all, cost HALF the price of what I used to pay at the store.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my only daytime perfume. It smells like flowers and fresh herbs. I hate smelling like dessert -- vanilla, orange, berries, etc. This one smells like perfume should. I find it lasts plenty long.</li>
    <li> The Fragrance smells wonderful, but the scent doesnt last long, and you have to use quite a bit.  Other then that the fragrance is lovely.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price for such a great smelling product. CLEAN is a great brand but overpriced at some stores.</li>
    <li> I always receive compliments when I wear any of the Clean Fragrances and this one does not disappoint.  It is fresh and feminine and I never feel like it is too heavy or overpowering.</li>
    <li> i love the scent, not too strong and not too mild either. with the price, it is indeed a good buy. i will recommend this to those who want a fresh and clean scent :)</li>
