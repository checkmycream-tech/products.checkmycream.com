      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>For all you homeowners out there who love a refreshing light citrus scent in your home...</li>
      <li>THIS OIL REALLY SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Always a smooth easy transaction</li>
      <li>Steam extracted not chemical which is super important to me!</li>
      <li>The quality of this essential oil is fabulous, not oily, great concentrated scent.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh smell of tangerine all over the house.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy all of the oils i have bought from edens garden</li>
      <li>This oil smells lovely like freshly peeled clementines.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh scent of Tangerine.</li>
      <li>Love the crisp citrus fragrance...</li>
      <li>I recently ask them to days after placing an order if they could be sure to have my order sent as soon as possible and there were able to do so, great customer service.</li>
      <li>Good quality essential oil</li>
      <li>So fresh &amp; clean smelling.</li>
      <li>This has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>I just keep coming back for more!  </li>
      <li>Maintains fresh citrusy scent ...</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like a bowl of fresh tangerines.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly like fresh tangerine shavings</li>
      <li>Came quickly &amp; packed very well.</li>
      <li>I have tried using it many different ways</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Be sure and add coloring before adding essential oil.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different oils, and maybe because of the body chemistry or whatever, Tangerine is the scent that I like the most on me.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t last long but great for in the moment scent.</li>
      <li>I love the price and quality of Edens Gardens essential oil.</li>
      <li>This is a nice soft citrus for something different</li>
      <li>I am relatively new to essential oils and I&#x27;m glad I started with Edens Garden.</li>
      <li>little bottle with the nice label of what each oil does.</li>
      <li>Just like a real tangerine.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see how unless you only want it to smell good for a little while.</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>If you happen to like a little more &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; citrus scent then tangerine might be a choice you want to consider.</li>
      <li>last at least six hours...definitely satisfied and recommend...</li>

    <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
    <li> This oil smells lovely like freshly peeled clementines. I find it to be a very cheery citrus aroma. I absolutely love the scent but i have noticed it tends to fade faster then other oils. I like to mix it with other citrus oils in my diffuser. I am going to try making a perfume with it and hope the scent lasts a bit longer on my skin. I really enjoy all of the oils i have bought from edens garden i just wish the scent lasted a bit longer because it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase! This person is excellent to do business with. Everything was perfect (shipping, price, etc)</li>
    <li> I love all of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils. I will keep buying!!! The prices really are great for what you&#x27;re getting and I love that the seller combines shipping.</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped it would be! Just like a real tangerine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soft citrus for something different</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like fresh tangerine shavings</li>
    <li> I use this in making foaming soaps. Only requires 2 drops in a foaming soap dispenser.  Be sure and add coloring before adding essential oil.  Great essence!</li>
    <li> One of the best in my opinion. Maintains fresh citrusy scent ...</li>
    <li> i love this scent, works well with all of the products that i make, def buy again as m running out!</li>
    <li> great product would order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased essential oils before ordering this one.&lt;br /&gt;Being a lover of citrus scents, I wanted to add this scent to a lotion I was making.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it. It smells exactly like a bowl of fresh tangerines. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing soon.</li>
    <li> Smells good smells just like orange but still very good love the citric smells</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil for perfume making, and it is just what I needed. I like the face that it also has Therapeutic uses as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I use it to make my own, Organic Coconut oil,  body butters.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is delicious! If you happen to like a little more &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; citrus scent then tangerine might be a choice you want to consider. Did I say it&#x27;s delicious? Yes? Now I have to get more!</li>
    <li> EDEN GARDEN IS WONDERFUL!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different oils, and maybe because of the body chemistry or whatever, Tangerine is the scent that I like the most on me. I made a body lotion with tangerine and just a little bit of lemon. And I adore that combination. For some reason it put me in a happy, good mood. The quality of this essential oil is fabulous, not oily, great concentrated scent. Excellent.</li>
    <li> This was so good and juicy, it smells so good, it smells like  the juiciest sweetest tangerine you have ever smelled. This has quickly become one of my favorites. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong or too light, wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific but only lasts about an hour. Other reviewers said they use it to scent a room but I don&#x27;t see how unless you only want it to smell good for a little while. I have tried using it many different ways but it never lasted.</li>
    <li> The Edens Garden Essential Oils are the best quality and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great aromas...I&#x27;m going to go back and order a larger bottle now, I&#x27;m using it all the time! Also tried the Sweet Orange which also was wonderful.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL REALLY SMELLS SO GOOD. IT KIND OF LIFTS YOUR MOOD UP IT CHANGES YOUR MOOD FOR SURE. I LIKED IT.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the tangerine oil! It is turning into a favorite of mine in my diffuser! Excellent oil!</li>
    <li> great aroma. I felt the diffuser on while i left the house and came back a few hrs later. the beautiful scent was gone. doesn&#x27;t last long but great for in the moment scent.</li>
    <li> Fabulous oils!  I just keep coming back for more!  Use them in my homemade creams, cleaning products, fragrances, and cosmetics! Steam extracted not chemical which is super important to me! Always a smooth easy transaction</li>
    <li> Great essential oil from a excellent company who values their customers.</li>
    <li> Love the crisp citrus fragrance...smell just like tangerine peel...long lasting scent...last at least six hours...definitely satisfied and recommend...</li>
    <li> Love this oil &amp; manufacturer. Came quickly &amp; packed very well. Used oil to make scent diffuser &amp; am quite pleased. Love the fresh smell of tangerine all over the house. So fresh &amp; clean smelling. Will order larger bottle next time!</li>
