      <li>/&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>PH balance is great for everything that requires that.  </li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a good value for the money.  </li>
      <li>Amazing what you can find on Amazon when you are or aren&#x27;t even looking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For people with sensitive skin, this is the best soap.  </li>
      <li>to me this is the best natural bar soap on the market.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite.</li>
      <li>Rember from many years</li>
      <li>It has served my family well for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love the bars for washing my face in the morning and night.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most soap products.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate being able to get it fragrance free, because when I have a headache</li>
      <li>but I also am not having a huge oil build up</li>
      <li>I always keep it available, and my son uses it also.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t enjoy perfumey smells.  </li>
      <li>Have been using for years after a doctor prescribed for a skin infection and loved the way it leaves you skin soft with no residue.  </li>
      <li>Bar lasts a long time and is a great buy.  </li>
      <li>I have had a beard for 45 years and started using this soap because it rinses cleanly from my beard.</li>
      <li>but this magical little bar of soap is by far the best for me.</li>
      <li>think it has been working really well to keep my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>THe best thing is it is FRAGRANCE-FREE -  a hard thing to find these days!</li>
      <li>Yes, this product is very good and hard to find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product about 5 years ago and instantly loved it, not only did it really deep clean my face</li>
      <li>this bar right before bed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
      <li>good lather, you can use it on your entire body and still feel clean afterwards (not so with most facial bars), doesn&#x27;t dry me out, lasts a lot longer than other facial bars, not slimy like Neutrogena, and best yet, no hives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in local stores any more</li>
      <li>I do not care a bit to pay extra and have it shipped--that&#x27;s how much I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t stink,</li>
      <li>And it is really decently priced for such a great product that actually works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild but leaves your skin feeling clean, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
      <li>so it is really hard to find a really good cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
      <li>I bought this phisoderm fragrance free facial cleansing bar for my mom.  </li>
      <li>Either way, the product is gentle on the skin and does what it is intended to do, keep skin eruptions at bay.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Amazon customer service is usually very good, but I was on the phone for waaaaay too long regarding the ridiculous issue… Be aware that you are paying $15.56 for only 4 bars!</li>
      <li>Became aware of this product when I was in the hospital years ago and have been using it ever since as a soap for the face, shoulders, back, chest or</li>
      <li>For bed ridden patients it washes off easily with little rinsing and helps with skin breakdown.  </li>
      <li>However description is not clear: two bars to one pack, pack of four equals eight bars, right?</li>
      <li>The bars are long lasting when used as a bath soap, even more so when used solely as a facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It does clear your skin</li>
      <li>where ever you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen this brand anywhere since the early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Last time I purchaes in a store, price was $2 per bar; high premium to pay for access.</li>
      <li>Gentle cleanser for sensitive or dry skin</li>
      <li>Even where he crawls on his knees, his skin stays soft and not rough at all.  </li>
      <li>whatever else is popular lately, when you get out of the shower, then maybe there are other issues to check into - just a thought.  </li>

    <li> I originally purchased this product about 5 years ago and instantly loved it, not only did it really deep clean my face but it kept the acne at bay and it also works on your back and shoulders. I also have extremely sensitive skin so it is really hard to find a really good cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I have tried everything from the expensive handmade stuff to that junk you get on the infomercial but this magical little bar of soap is by far the best for me. And it is really decently priced for such a great product that actually works. I wish that they would sell it in stores again!</li>
    <li> Great. Pg balanced. Rember from many years agp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years.  Its my favorite.</li>
    <li> Became aware of this product when I was in the hospital years ago and have been using it ever since as a soap for the face, shoulders, back, chest or where ever you have sensitive skin.  It has served my family well for many years.  I can&#x27;t find it in local stores any more so I have to order it off the web.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a teen - about 45 years.  It does clear your skin and it&#x27;s PH balance is great for everything that requires that.  I always keep it available, and my son uses it also.</li>
    <li> This is our household bath and sink soap.  NOT just for facial cleansing.  I am allergic to most soap products.  I am NOT allergic to this.  It&#x27;s gentle, gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  Also, it&#x27;s a good value for the money.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over 30 years.  I have had a beard for 45 years and started using this soap because it rinses cleanly from my beard. A secondary benefit is my baby soft skin. It has been hard to find in recent years and I have been ordering it from Amazon for 3-4 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this phisoderm fragrance free facial cleansing bar for my mom.  THe best thing is it is FRAGRANCE-FREE -  a hard thing to find these days!</li>
    <li> Received as promised.  A quality product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used only Phisoderm bar soap on my face for decades.  I&#x27;m 65 now, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s mild but leaves your skin feeling clean, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but isn&#x27;t oily.  I appreciate being able to get it fragrance free, because when I have a headache I really don&#x27;t enjoy perfumey smells.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in stores, after I had been using it for several years.  The price per bar is a little over half of what I paid for a single bar at Walmart.  The bars are long lasting when used as a bath soap, even more so when used solely as a facial cleanser.  Either way, the product is gentle on the skin and does what it is intended to do, keep skin eruptions at bay.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin. Regular soap will break me out in hives, and even the fragrance-free facial soaps I find still give me acne, especially on my face and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s completely fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t stink, good lather, you can use it on your entire body and still feel clean afterwards (not so with most facial bars), doesn&#x27;t dry me out, lasts a lot longer than other facial bars, not slimy like Neutrogena, and best yet, no hives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local store stopped carrying it, and after trying another sensitive, frag-free facial cleaner, my skin is HORRIBLE. I do not care a bit to pay extra and have it shipped--that&#x27;s how much I love this product. It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I had another outbreak and now I can’t use this product. :( I’ve switched to raw African black soap, if anyone here needs another recommendation for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I love the bars for washing my face in the morning and night. I use a make-up wipe at the end of the day and this bar right before bed and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry but I also am not having a huge oil build up either.&lt;br /&gt;I think it has been working really well to keep my skin healthy.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is very good and hard to find. However description is not clear: two bars to one pack, pack of four equals eight bars, right? No, four bars total shipped. Would not have purchased at $4 per bar... Last time I purchaes in a store, price was $2 per bar; high premium to pay for access.</li>
    <li> if you have oily skin this has worked for me! I like how dry my face is after use. it works</li>
    <li> This item description is quite deceiving… I assumed I was getting 8 bars total based upon the fact it says $15.56 ($1.94/count) and 2-count (pack of 4)! When the package arrived I only received 4 bars total. Amazon customer service is usually very good, but I was on the phone for waaaaay too long regarding the ridiculous issue… Be aware that you are paying $15.56 for only 4 bars! RIP OFF!!!</li>
    <li> Gentle cleanser for sensitive or dry skin</li>
    <li> Finally a bar soap that is truly fragrance-free and works.  Been looking for years for something that doesn&#x27;t stink.  If you feel that you need to smell like flower or whatever else is popular lately, when you get out of the shower, then maybe there are other issues to check into - just a thought.  I hadn&#x27;t seen this brand anywhere since the early 70&#x27;s.  Amazing what you can find on Amazon when you are or aren&#x27;t even looking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the bad part, the description of packaging is deceptive.  Amazon should halt this behavior.</li>
    <li> to me this is the best natural bar soap on the market. been using it for 10 years now. but now it&#x27;s only found on-line , not in any stores in new york at least.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for years.&lt;br /&gt;Only one I am not allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin allergies, this is the one to try.</li>
    <li> For people with sensitive skin, this is the best soap.  Have been using for years after a doctor prescribed for a skin infection and loved the way it leaves you skin soft with no residue.  For bed ridden patients it washes off easily with little rinsing and helps with skin breakdown.  I use with my handicap child who is too heavy to get in the tub and we are sponge bathing until we can get a lift.  Even where he crawls on his knees, his skin stays soft and not rough at all.  Bar lasts a long time and is a great buy.  Will continue to buy.</li>
