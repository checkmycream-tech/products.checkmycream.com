      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s so soothing and smoothing on your skin.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, is super lightweight and non greasy.</li>
      <li>I want this to be great for me for many reasons; it completely cleared my skin (amazing), it completely mattified my skin (amazing), the texture of the cream is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for (gel cream), and the smell is quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>For many years I used Biore oil free moisture, but they stopped making it.</li>
      <li>Very fruity but nothing overwhelming, and the smell doesn&#x27;t last, but while you apply it it&#x27;s smells awesome!</li>
      <li>Well this product is just fabulous</li>
      <li>Andalou Naturals Acai + White Tea Oil-Free Moisturizer is very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy or shiny, doesn&#x27;t cause acne and provides the perfect amount of moisture for my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>It is quite good for mature acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it soaks right in without feeling oily.</li>
      <li>It has a funny smell, but if you*re looking to use a moisturizer that is just okay for oily skin, then this will do.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>Pro: Super light &amp; non-greasy, yet still provides the moisturizing needed after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
      <li>This product is so special for my skin.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my face feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this oil free moisturizer</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and will continue to use the products in the future.</li>
      <li>It is very light, makes the skin soft and does not make it oily!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and was looking for something light, hydrating and not greasy to wear under makeup.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been pleased with the value and product size, function and all aspects so far.</li>
      <li>I was not sure where I would find this at home and was really happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Also, 1 bottle has lasted me for more than 6 months and it is still not empty.  </li>
      <li>The feeling on the skin is really good too, it feels a little silky</li>
      <li>Just ordered a new bottle for when my original one runs out.</li>
      <li>It also helps control oil, after wearing it all day I can see a noticeable reduction in oil-even on hot, humid summer days.</li>
      <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been on a bit of a journey to find a replacement product, and this is one of two (from the same company) that I&#x27;ve been satisfied with.</li>
      <li>and so many retailers charge SO MUCH for anything with white tea in it (like Origins, and even Andalou)</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty sensitive so that&#x27;s yet another variable I have to consider when using an oil free moisturizer and in this case, so far,</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Taken together, I really like this product and will be buying again.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightweight.</li>
      <li>This does not clog my pores, it does not break me out, and my skin is really behaving well.</li>
      <li>It feels very nourishing yet not oily at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This line leaves my skin very smooth and my pores less visible.  </li>
      <li>I normally have a very oily T zone, and I&#x27;ve been using this with the kombucha cleanser</li>
      <li>then your skin feels really soft!!</li>
      <li>you visit the company&#x27;s website, the product description tells a little more, describing it as clarifying and mattifying.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for acne prone, oily, and/or sensitive skin types!</li>
      <li>I use mineral powder makeup when going out, so I wanted to see if I could find another oil free moisturizer that would give me a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; with a little more thickness to it.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My skin has become very sensitive</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, oily and breakout prone skin.</li>
      <li>and it is all natural.  </li>
      <li>The smell is light and fades very quickly, so is not a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just plain, nothing special.</li>
      <li>Gets better throughout the day, but I feel like my thin skin and fine lines appear worse...</li>

<li> Gets better throughout the day, but I feel like my thin skin and fine lines appear worse...</li>
<li> I can agree with the latter, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on the clarifying.</li>
<li> I have oily skin and have been trying out different natural moisturizers for a few years.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s maybe no enough moisturizing for very dry skin</li>
<li> I still have some oiliness after a long day but now like before using the clarifying line.  </li>
<li> and I had some dry areas on my face.  </li>
<li> It helped my acne dry out.</li>
<li> My skin feels taut and dry within seconds of putting it on.  </li>
<li> I also have dry flaky areas on my face which don&#x27;t cover well with makeup.</li>
<li> My pores are not congested and my skin actually seems a little tighter.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s just thick enough that I&#x27;m concerned about how it will continue to pump as it gets low, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It actually is making my skin less oily but less flaky as we&#x27;ll!</li>
<li> And other creams I have tried will cause my face to breakout.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin/dry skin oily at all (some other products did) and din&#x27;t break me out in any way.</li>
<li> However this one did not surprise me as other products used to.</li>
<li> so I am very careful with what I put on my skin.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ll just say that for me it&#x27;s just average.  </li>
<li> One of the few products that claims to even your blemishes that I believe.</li>
<li> This stuff actually dried out my skin and made any makeup I put on look patchy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m shocked give me white bumps, not exists but white bumps all over my face.</li>
<li> black tea ferment, fruit steam cells (malus domestica, solar vitis) and bioactive 8 berry complex</li>
<li> which is usually a sign that something is not working.  </li>
<li> I started putting in a few drops jojoba oil and realized it was ridiculous to be trying to make this stuff work.</li>
<li> The texture of the product leans toward the thick side rather than watery/</li>
<li> but the only downside is that it feels really bad on your skin when you apply, but usually it takes 15mins to settle in your skin</li>
<li> so finding products that work well has been difficult.  </li>
<li> Has a faint &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell, which I attribute to the Kombucha ingredient.  </li>

    <li> Great product for oily skin! It is very light, makes the skin soft and does not make it oily!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts so I am very careful with what I put on my skin.  Last winter, I was on a trip to Lake Tahoe and I had some dry areas on my face.  I bought this moisturizer in a health foods store and it works great!  It moisturizers without making my face greasy, it has not made me break out and it is all natural.  Also, 1 bottle has lasted me for more than 6 months and it is still not empty.  I was not sure where I would find this at home and was really happy to find it on Amazon.  Just ordered a new bottle for when my original one runs out.</li>
    <li> Pro: Super light &amp; non-greasy, yet still provides the moisturizing needed after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Has a faint &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell, which I attribute to the Kombucha ingredient.  The smell is light and fades very quickly, so is not a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken together, I really like this product and will be buying again.  It is quite good for mature acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It smells really nice, is super lightweight and non greasy. It also helps control oil, after wearing it all day I can see a noticeable reduction in oil-even on hot, humid summer days. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or inflammation. It does a great job of moisturizing too! Highly recommend this for acne prone, oily, and/or sensitive skin types!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews from the book don&#x27;t go to the cosmetic counter without me. it received 5 stars. I&#x27;m shocked give me white bumps, not exists but white bumps all over my face.</li>
    <li> This product is all-natural and highly effective. It is very lightweight. It also helps to mattify the t-zone area. I have tried countless moisturizers, and this is now my go to. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my face feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Loving this!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and have been trying out different natural moisturizers for a few years.  I do a lot of research to avoid chemicals, I am going to stick with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Andalou Clarifying line for about a month now and I am very pleased with it.  I am 51 and have fair skin with an oily T-zone.  My skin has become very sensitive so finding products that work well has been difficult.  This line leaves my skin very smooth and my pores less visible.  I still have some oiliness after a long day but now like before using the clarifying line.  My pores are not congested and my skin actually seems a little tighter.  The fragrance is clean smelling.  I am very pleased and will continue to use the products in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. I normally have a very oily T zone, and I&#x27;ve been using this with the kombucha cleanser and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.</li>
    <li> Made me oily so I returned</li>
    <li> Andalou Naturals Acai + White Tea Oil-Free Moisturizer is very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy or shiny, doesn&#x27;t cause acne and provides the perfect amount of moisture for my oily, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase it.    Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis juice*, vegetable glycerin, cyamopsis tetragonolobus (guar) gum*, octyl palmitate, saccharomyces xylinum (kombucha) black tea ferment, fruit steam cells (malus domestica, solar vitis) and bioactive 8 berry complex*, zea mays (corn) starch*, euterpe oleracea (acai) and salix alba (willow bark) extracts*, camellia sinensis (white tea) and hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts*, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), vitis vinifera (grape seed) polyphenols, olive squalane, lecithin, tocopherol (vitamin E), allantoin, panthenol, phenethyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, citrus tangerina (tangerine) and cymbopogon martini (palmarosa) oils*.    *Certified Organic  Fair Trade</li>
    <li> This product is so light and wonderful.  You don&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Immediately absorbs into you skin leaving it feeling and looking amazing.  Great products and wonderful light, natural fragrance as well</li>
    <li> Since the days of Proactiv oil-free moisture, I have been changed-- I can no longer handle any kind of oil in my moisturizer. It makes shine, it feels greasy and I just can&#x27;t handle it. For many years I used Biore oil free moisture, but they stopped making it. Since then I&#x27;ve been on a bit of a journey to find a replacement product, and this is one of two (from the same company) that I&#x27;ve been satisfied with. The texture of the product leans toward the thick side rather than watery/runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you visit the company&#x27;s website, the product description tells a little more, describing it as clarifying and mattifying. I can agree with the latter, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on the clarifying. My skin is pretty sensitive so that&#x27;s yet another variable I have to consider when using an oil free moisturizer and in this case, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been pleased with the value and product size, function and all aspects so far. I also like the size/shape of the container and the pump. It&#x27;s just thick enough that I&#x27;m concerned about how it will continue to pump as it gets low, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased, and no concerns recommending.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, oily and breakout prone skin. I also have dry flaky areas on my face which don&#x27;t cover well with makeup. This moisturizer is such a great find! I love the smell and it soaks right in without feeling oily. It actually is making my skin less oily but less flaky as we&#x27;ll! I have used it for 3 weeks with no reaction. And other creams I have tried will cause my face to breakout. I&#x27;m also no using the night recovery cream and it is also great .</li>
    <li> Well this product is just fabulous and so many retailers charge SO MUCH for anything with white tea in it (like Origins, and even Andalou) that I often won&#x27;t buy it....but this was on sale so I jumped on it. I love the smell, it&#x27;s so soothing and smoothing on your skin. One of the few products that claims to even your blemishes that I believe.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have oily and pimple prone face. This does not clog my pores, it does not break me out, and my skin is really behaving well. This product is so special for my skin.</li>
    <li> It helped my acne dry out.</li>
    <li> This product smells so good! Very fruity but nothing overwhelming, and the smell doesn&#x27;t last, but while you apply it it&#x27;s smells awesome! The feeling on the skin is really good too, it feels a little silky and I love that! It didn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin/dry skin oily at all (some other products did) and din&#x27;t break me out in any way. It&#x27;s maybe no enough moisturizing for very dry skin but I still love it!</li>
    <li> I was really happy with Andalou products and I bought this one after reading reviews on Amazon. However this one did not surprise me as other products used to. It&#x27;s just plain, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Really nice product! but the only downside is that it feels really bad on your skin when you apply, but usually it takes 15mins to settle in your skin then your skin feels really soft!!</li>
    <li> I want this to be great for me for many reasons; it completely cleared my skin (amazing), it completely mattified my skin (amazing), the texture of the cream is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for (gel cream), and the smell is quite pleasant.  It&#x27;s almost perfect...except that it&#x27;s almost too mattifying for me.  My skin feels taut and dry within seconds of putting it on.  Gets better throughout the day, but I feel like my thin skin and fine lines appear worse...which is usually a sign that something is not working.  Total bummer,</li>
    <li> I had a lot of hope for this moisturizer. I have very oily skin and was looking for something light, hydrating and not greasy to wear under makeup.  This stuff actually dried out my skin and made any makeup I put on look patchy. I started putting in a few drops jojoba oil and realized it was ridiculous to be trying to make this stuff work. I eventually tossed it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this oil free moisturizer and I&#x27;ll just say that for me it&#x27;s just average.  It has a funny smell, but if you*re looking to use a moisturizer that is just okay for oily skin, then this will do.  I use mineral powder makeup when going out, so I wanted to see if I could find another oil free moisturizer that would give me a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; with a little more thickness to it.  I don&#x27;t feel like the cost matches the quality, so I&#x27;ll probably just stick to the oil-free lotion I use by Baby Face.  At this time I&#x27;ll probably not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It feels very nourishing yet not oily at all. Plus it smells very good</li>
    <li> now that im over 40 i notice i have such oily skin.  i tried different lotions but everything clogged my pores.  this lotion is great for oily skin.</li>
</ol>
