### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Of course it&#x27;s best paired with the cologne and lotion.</li>
      <li>Not the best at moisturizing</li>
      <li>This is just the best scent ever, I have used this for years and everyone asks what it is.</li>
      <li>What happened instead was a metamorphosis of incredible proportion.</li>
      <li>Smells great as well.</li>
      <li>My fave, smells great, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and isn&#x27;t sold by the gallon, meets all my prerequisites.</li>
      <li>Excellent service, well satisfied</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves it, and he smells GREAT! :-)</li>
      <li>Something that should be pleasant but</li>
      <li>Good Product.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly in nice box.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the alcohol sting but there was a nice glycerine burn after the alcohol dissipated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Grey Flannel was another awesome fragrance that I loved.</li>
      <li>Its good and (most importantly)</li>
      <li>I just bought some Grey flannel and can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t impressed..</li>
      <li>I purchased this aftershave as a gift for my father, its a favorite of his</li>
      <li>It was my husband&#x27;s favorite and continues to be my son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this aftershave several times on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Really great product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Great scent, not too much alcohol burn.</li>
      <li>but it sure does the job.</li>
      <li>It does smell pretty good though</li>
      <li>and it is as good as when I first used this product</li>
      <li>always, body chemistry has a huge part in how the colognes fragrance reacts.</li>
      <li>Great product, have been using it for t he last fifteen years</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of smell you really want to cuddle up to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I could order Grey Flannel because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores in my town.</li>
      <li>Well packaged and quick response.</li>
      <li>Other than that the scent had changed remarkably and as I approached my GF</li>
      <li>at first.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Found this on AZ and had to have it, makes for a nice bracy feel after DE shaving, the scent is strong at first but fades into subtle land after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I am used to smelling something that is stronger in alcohol scent and the scent lessens or strengthens depending as the alcohol evaporates and throughout the day the scent mixes with your own chemistry to make a better or worse smell.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Grey Flannel.</li>
      <li>she couldn&#x27;t help but take the new smell in and immediately notice a difference from the normal aftershaves that I use (not an easy task as I normally partition my week between 3 aftershaves)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mellow and not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>Be forewarned tho, they&#x27;ll be pretty busy if they wear it.</li>
      <li>it has a slightly heavier aroma, more woody, cedarie?</li>
      <li>Gentlemen, should you ever try out this particular scent...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s decent.</li>
      <li>but light enough for everyday yet sophisticated enough to wear out for evenings on the town.</li>
      <li>and once i smelled the product and saw the smooth shave on him, i can understand why he prefers it over all other aftershaves</li>
      <li>Has the same strong woodsy smell as the Grey Flannel cologne</li>
      <li>but you can smell a slight sweetness to it that definitely makes this a better flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>get enough hugs after using this reasonably price product.</li>
      <li>Husband has used this after shave for years and will use no other.</li>
      <li>but as a man who has ordered a bottle of Johnny Walker blue but is not a scotch drinker... I knew I must grin and bare the new scent which was highly likely to never be used again.</li>

<li> The first review I did on the blast was [[ASIN:B000VOHQWU Jovan Musk By Jovan For Men, Cologne Spray, 3-Ounce Bottle]] which I used to use in the late 70&#x27;s, mid 80&#x27;s.</li>
<li> at least that are of a reasonable price and smell great.&lt;br</li>
<li> This is not what happened with Grey Flannel.</li>
<li> ladies in their 40&#x27;s from my experience do a lot of nuzzling if you wear Grey Flannel-they remember...if you&#x27;re a 50 something guy, and want some attention then go for it.</li>
<li> It is very hard to find a true aftershave, this is one of very few you can find...</li>
<li> give it a minute or at least splash it on before you make judgment.</li>
<li> It was insane how much the smell had changed in just a few minutes.</li>

    <li> The first review I did on the blast was [[ASIN:B000VOHQWU Jovan Musk By Jovan For Men, Cologne Spray, 3-Ounce Bottle]] which I used to use in the late 70&#x27;s, mid 80&#x27;s. Grey Flannel was another awesome fragrance that I loved. Found this on AZ and had to have it, makes for a nice bracy feel after DE shaving, the scent is strong at first but fades into subtle land after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies in their 40&#x27;s from my experience do a lot of nuzzling if you wear Grey Flannel-they remember...if you&#x27;re a 50 something guy, and want some attention then go for it. For younger guys same same if you tend to steer towards the retro classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, body chemistry has a huge part in how the colognes fragrance reacts. Try it out, if you don&#x27;t like it you can always pass it along to your friends. Be forewarned tho, they&#x27;ll be pretty busy if they wear it.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a true aftershave, this is one of very few you can find... at least that are of a reasonable price and smell great.&lt;br /&gt;to my senses it has a slightly heavier aroma, more woody, cedarie? but light enough for everyday yet sophisticated enough to wear out for evenings on the town.</li>
    <li> Great product, have been using it for t he last fifteen years and it is as good as when I first used this product</li>
    <li> This is a different scent. Its good and (most importantly) it does its job as an aftershave. Its soothes the skin and helps prevent razor burn.</li>
    <li> This is just the best scent ever, I have used this for years and everyone asks what it is.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on the 8th, got it on the 14th. No box, but the seal was still on the bottle. My boyfriend loves it, and he smells GREAT! :-) Would definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Has the same strong woodsy smell as the Grey Flannel cologne but you can smell a slight sweetness to it that definitely makes this a better flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aftershave it&#x27;s decent. Not the best at moisturizing but it sure does the job. I don&#x27;t like the alcohol sting but there was a nice glycerine burn after the alcohol dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great if you use the matching cologne but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, well satisfied</li>
    <li> Husband has used this after shave for years and will use no other. Smells great as well.</li>
    <li> My fave, smells great, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and isn&#x27;t sold by the gallon, meets all my prerequisites.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not too much alcohol burn. Arrived quickly in nice box. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they call this after shave lotion. It&#x27;s an alcohol and propylene glycol based splash. It does smell pretty good though</li>
    <li> I just bought some Grey flannel and can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t impressed.. at first. When i opened the bottle it had an almost Smoky smell about it. It was as if I were smelling the fur of a timber wolf. Something that should be pleasant but somehow it isn&#x27;t. It also seemed to me that the word lotion in advertising is almost always misused. Lets find a different word for something made almost entirely of alcohol shall we? Anyways, I smelled it and instantly regretted my decision to buy it... but as a man who has ordered a bottle of Johnny Walker blue but is not a scotch drinker... I knew I must grin and bare the new scent which was highly likely to never be used again. As I splashed it on... the smell changed. Now I am used to smelling something that is stronger in alcohol scent and the scent lessens or strengthens depending as the alcohol evaporates and throughout the day the scent mixes with your own chemistry to make a better or worse smell. This is not what happened with Grey Flannel. What happened instead was a metamorphosis of incredible proportion. If the same comparison had to be used and I idly sat watching a toaster, the toaster would have changed into a 57 Chevy before my eyes. The only similarity was the smell of sandalwood remained. Other than that the scent had changed remarkably and as I approached my GF she couldn&#x27;t help but take the new smell in and immediately notice a difference from the normal aftershaves that I use (not an easy task as I normally partition my week between 3 aftershaves) It was insane how much the smell had changed in just a few minutes. So to bring back what I was saying before. Gentlemen, should you ever try out this particular scent... give it a minute or at least splash it on before you make judgment. Have a manly day!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I could order Grey Flannel because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores in my town. It was my husband&#x27;s favorite and continues to be my son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I purchased this aftershave as a gift for my father, its a favorite of his and once i smelled the product and saw the smooth shave on him, i can understand why he prefers it over all other aftershaves</li>
    <li> My husband loves this aftershave and can only find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Yummy smell for the men in my life. It&#x27;s the kind of smell you really want to cuddle up to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this aftershave several times on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Really great product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and quick response. Good Product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell. It&#x27;s very mellow and not overpowering at all. Of course it&#x27;s best paired with the cologne and lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Grey Flannel. I have been using it since I started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get enough hugs after using this reasonably price product. I use it evry day after shave.</li>
