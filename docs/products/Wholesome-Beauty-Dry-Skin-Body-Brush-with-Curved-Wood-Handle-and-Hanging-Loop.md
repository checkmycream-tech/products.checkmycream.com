      <li>fantastic brush - fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>and I have a softer one I use for more sensitive parts.</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>This brush is high quality and is ergonomically designed for easy use.  </li>
      <li>But I keep forgetting to use it right before</li>
      <li>The dry skin body brush I received is really a nice quality brush</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and the whole process is enjoyable.</li>

      <li>so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare it to.  </li>
      <li>My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away, but the brush is attractive enough to leave on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long body brushes are also available, particularly if you want to get at spots on your back.  </li>
      <li>but I just tend to hold it at the main part by the bristles the majority of the time.</li>
      <li>Although the brush is contoured and most likely designed with the right-handed person in mind, I had no problem using and controlling it with my left.  </li>

<li> The length of the handles is long enough to reach may upper back.</li>
<li> \\&quot;how-tos\\&quot; of proper dry skin brushing.&lt;br</li>
<li> I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s contoured handle and firm natural bristles</li>
<li> The company sends extra information about the use and other neat info about the brush.</li>
<li> I like this brush for body dry brushing</li>
<li> I read about Dry Brushing in a magazine.  </li>
<li> The it really rough and scratchy.</li>
<li> It does feel a little more awkward in one hand than the other...</li>
<li> The bristles are 5/8\\&quot; long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  </li>
<li> The handle is wood and will likely fall apart eventually with exposure to water, but at least I&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
<li> The 1/2\\&quot; braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  </li>
<li> so I do prefer this one over my previous( another manufacturer) one.</li>
<li> I am using it now everyday.</li>
<li> but it is a little stiff.</li>
<li> I have noticed an easing in the bristles, that is, not as stiff as on beginning use.</li>
<li> The bristles are not too hard.</li>
<li> The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  </li>
<li> It was a bit matted down because of packaging...not too bad tho.</li>

    <li> It works great and the handle and shape make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this brush daily.It&#x27;s a great exfoliant. It made a real different on my skin. My skin is much smoother and softer. The long handle makes it much easier. I love it</li>
    <li> Very nice body brush. The length of the handles is long enough to reach may upper back. The bristles are not too hard. I am using it now everyday.</li>
    <li> I read about Dry Brushing in a magazine.  I have been trying to find ways to make my skin look better, so I decided to try it.  I have only been doing this for about 3 weeks, but I can say I have seen improvement in the way my legs and thighs look.  I found that you have a sensation all over my body.  I will continue using this brush to continue progress.</li>
    <li> This brush is high quality and is ergonomically designed for easy use.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This really helps my skin...I love the dry skin brush!</li>

    <li> fantastic brush - fast delivery.  would buy again</li>
    <li> Definitely gets your circulation going.  But I keep forgetting to use it right before I shower, so I have no results to report. I may start using it in the shower with gel (instead of the nylon &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; to scrub with).  The handle is wood and will likely fall apart eventually with exposure to water, but at least I&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
    <li> Both the company and the product are excellent. The company sends extra information about the use and other neat info about the brush. It comes in a nice bag and includes a hanging hook with a strong adhesive.</li>

Thank you for a great product and great customer care/service as well!</li>
    <li> This works well for dry brushing, it really helps my skin exfoliate sooner than normal. After my first use my skin felt with soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It is a big surprise of how much I enjoy the dry skin body brush.  It really makes a difference not only on your skin, but also giving energy to your body.  I guess somehow it improves your body circulation.  This brush has a good design and is easy to use.  Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really great skin brush; just the right size and just the right kind of bristles for me.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I like this brush for body dry brushing but it is a little stiff. My other brush was way too soft so I do prefer this one over my previous( another manufacturer) one.</li>
    <li> This brush works exactly as I thought it would. Very nice product. It was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great brush..just the right size.  The bristles are firm and yet not painful but you can &#x27;feel&#x27; it.  It comes with a nice storage bag and a little hook with an adhesive back that you can stick on the wall or inside the shower/tub area and hang it within easy reach.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This lovely hand-held contour brush to buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  The brush is . 10\\&quot; (L) x 3\\&quot; (W) x 1.5\\&quot; (H).  Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method, but although I&#x27;ve read about it, I can&#x27;t vouch for any of the claims  The claims range from stimulating the lymphatic system to reducing cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush, one thing this brush does have.  The bristles are 5/8\\&quot; long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.  This brush is quite easy to control and feels comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;br /&gt;►  Polished Wooden Frame&lt;br /&gt;►  Cotton loop for hanging&lt;br /&gt;►  Travel Pouch and Hook Included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is made of a nice polished wood as is the body brush itself.  There&#x27;s a loop on the end for hanging and a hook that can be attached to the wall.  The 1/2\\&quot; braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away, but the brush is attractive enough to leave on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long body brushes are also available, particularly if you want to get at spots on your back.  Although the brush is contoured and most likely designed with the right-handed person in mind, I had no problem using and controlling it with my left.  There are several tutorials on YouTube for those who are interested in the benefits and \\&quot;how-tos\\&quot; of proper dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Great brust.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The brush has been used on a daily basis and while I am initially satisfied with it, perhaps the bristles should be firmer...I have noticed an easing in the bristles, that is, not as stiff as on beginning use.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Exactly as described. Came with a adhesive hook for hanging in the shower and a bag. Very pleased with my purchase. Shipped quickly. Thank you.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Am enjoying my brush. Appreciated the e-mail from company with instruction before brush arrived.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft on skin and angled nicely for hard to reach areas. Pleased to see that it came with a storage bag and a self adhesive wall hook. Fast delivery as well.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this brush, though it is a bit stiffer than the back-style brushes I have used before. This one is great for my legs and I have a softer one I use for more sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> So far I love it., thankyou</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It&#x27;s contoured handle and firm natural bristles make it one of the best. No need to get a super long handle if you are somewhat flexible. Brushing daily makes a big difference with smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I love the body brush, it feels so good and easily reaches my back.  If you like the practice of dry brushing your skin, you&#x27;ll love this brush.</li>
    <li> So far this brush has met my expectations.  I am new to dry brushing so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare it to.  the only thing I may change is the angle of the handle.  It does feel a little more awkward in one hand than the other...but I just tend to hold it at the main part by the bristles the majority of the time.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It works great and it wakes up my skin.  Thanks</li>
