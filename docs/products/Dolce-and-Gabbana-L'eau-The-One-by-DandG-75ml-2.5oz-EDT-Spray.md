<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ORDERED Dolce &amp; Gabbana The One - Eau De Parfum Spray AND I GOT Eau De Toilette..  SMELLS GREAT FADES FAST.......</li>
    <li> Smells the same as the one I bought at sephora.  It had a yellow color? Maybe just old. Didn&#x27;t bother me for a 1/3 of the price and the same sent!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who absolutely loves it. It is a subtle yet powerful fragrance. It is well worth the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll take the blame for this one. I didn&#x27;t mean to order this particular perfume. I meant to order sinply The One. However, I opened it and now I&#x27;m stuck with it. It&#x27;s not a bad perfume to be stuck with, but It&#x27;s just not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law when opening this almost fainted!  Perfume good, beautiful and luxurious.   The best perfume to people of 60 years to top!</li>
    <li> I orginally purchased this scent for my mother as a Christmas gift. One break I went home and wore it out and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. It is a heavier scent but I find myslef wearing it even though it&#x27;s summer because it just smells that good. I get complements on the scent all day!</li>
    <li> this is probably one of my most FAVORITE perfumes. Definitely in the top 3.&lt;br /&gt;Smells sexy feminine clean..fierce.&lt;br /&gt;My go to scent when i want to feel &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;... the scent has major staying power.. you will smell it all day long and even the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this fragrance..&lt;br /&gt;the only downfall to this fragrance is that I&#x27;m pretty sure D&amp;G discontinued it :( so.. get it while you can!</li>
    <li> Have hig quality and its a grave shop, i want to buy many produce of this place es a Excelent store for amazon</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I think it has an elegant smell and is great for women of all ages. I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and I love it.   BUT - be careful! Amazon does not let you return perfumes. Even if you never opened it, never even looked at it! It you bought it and it was delivered to your house (from AMAZON) you must keep it!) so be sure!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother and she loved it, the smell is fresh but the appealing look, style is a lady, not recommended for young people.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. It was delivered on time. The list price for this was $ 135.00. Amazon&#x27;s price was $ 48.00. My wife loves the smell &amp; now she has enough for the whole year.</li>
    <li> This scent was made for me. Clearly, they should use me in their commercials because every single time I wear it someone compliments me. If they stop making this, I literally have no idea what I&#x27;d wear. This is the BEST ever scent for me and my genetic makeup!</li>
    <li> I love Dolce&amp;Gabbana L´eau the one, i always use it, i like the aroma,&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this perfume, thank you..</li>
    <li> For any occasion!  If you like me who loves light , and sophisticated fragrance then this one is right for you!&lt;br /&gt;I feel more sensual, elegant and feminine. :)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a light fragrance that smells a tad sweet and a tad citrus then this is your perfume. I was looking for a nice light feminine fragrance but found that most smelt like a grandma or cotton candy, this one is perfect. A lot of people have been saying that they need to keep reapplying but I have found that it lasts most of the day. I do live in a dry climate so maybe humidity has an effect on some people.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume... Came quickly and in perfect shape. Thank you.</li>
    <li> love it. best purchase. won&#x27;t let you down. met my standards completely. great seller. five stars. two thumbs up. recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have always like this fragrance.  It&#x27;s all about the body chemistry.  Make sure you choose the perfume and not the toilet spray.  One last longer than the other.</li>
    <li> I love it, love it, love it!!!!! Every time I wear this perfume I get many compliments, so needless for me to say that as soon as I notice not enough is remaining, I will order another bottle to keep on smelling beautiful, gorgeous, precious and pretty.</li>
