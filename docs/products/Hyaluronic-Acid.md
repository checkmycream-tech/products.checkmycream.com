<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic serums and I really love this one. It goes on nice and makes my face feel so soft. Will buy this one again.</li>
    <li> good quality product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great... it comes in a nice glass bottle and a dropper that is really high grade... I use this and u can almost instantly feel the tightening aspect... will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It feels as if I wear nothing, yet my skin looks and feels moist and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;(I have dry sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;Fine lines have vanished after only three days of use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the night after my toner (a simple organic lavender hydrosol, flower water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was super fast delivered.</li>
    <li> I wish I had before and after pictures.keep this in your bathroom ladies !!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. Feels so great on my skin. My best friend, I told her to get one, and she did and have not regreted it. I love the fact that I can keep it on all night and no worries. I wash it off in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go all day. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my own honest opinion</li>
    <li> I have never used Hyaluronic acid before. This product comes in a jar with a dropper and is a gel consistency like aloe. A pump might be more preferable. But it is clean and mostly free of smell. And goes in smoothly and absorbs well. Leaving really no hint or trace it was applied. I haven&#x27;t used it long so I will update as I use it more. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles really or loose skin. But I do have large pores. So I will see how it does on my skin for a little while and if it provides any other positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a few weeks I can&#x27;t say  I saw a huge improvement from this. But YMMV, depending on your skin and chemistry and needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and just as described! Smells lightly of roses. Wish I would have bought more!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother-in-law, who completely love it. She liked the fact that the liquid does not leave an unpleasant sticky feeling. So far she have no complain about this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face and neck for a few weeks now and I think it really helps to plump and moisturizer my aging skin. The tip provided by Eve Hansen Beauty to apply it to wet or damp skin was the key. Good product!</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second bottle.  This serum goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like it has a heavy film at all. The wrinkles around my eyes immediately disappeared and it left my skin feeling hydrated again.. I will continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s out...  Another plus about it is that it saves you money on expensive spa treatments.</li>
    <li> didnt see adiffernece..</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Total waste of money....</li>
    <li> This is my first time using hyaluronic acid. I have normal/combination mid 30s skin and used the serum morning and night right after my toner. It has a thick gel consistency akin to that of aloe. With that consistency, it is important to dot it on skin and then massage it. I mixed the serum with philosophy vitamin c powder in my hand and that turned it into water like consistency that was easily massaged and absorbed with ever so slight stickiness for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say my skin looked and felt cooled and plump in a smooth sort of way. It hasn&#x27;t irritated me some it didn&#x27;t have any scent.&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is its thickness which takes an effort to get into and out of the dropper. Also, i would want to know the herbal blend which is listed as the first ingredient in the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted price for my review but I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems like it is working and stands up to it&#x27;s claims. Just got it 4 days ago so to early to tell.</li>
    <li> My favorite for rehydration of dry skin!</li>
    <li> This arrived right on time, and was packaged protectively and in perfect shape. This seller is excellent about following up on orders to assure customer satisfaction, and to provide instructions for use. Eve Hansen products (this is the second of hers that I have tried, the other being the eye gel) are mostly organic, and work very well on my dry skin with no fear of harsh or toxic chemicals. This hyaluronic acid is also a great value, being of much larger size than is typical of other manufacturers who charge the same price or more for lesser volume.</li>
    <li> I was told by an anti-aging physician to buy this product. It works! My skin, including face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage, looked moisturizer and plump after several applications. Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Hyaluronic Acid ! It is just about the only serum that I can put around my eyes without any eye irritation.  The skin on my eyelids were saggy. the Hyaluronic Acid has changed the texture making it smooth and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;The skin on m entire face has changed but I have seen dramatic results in my 2 trouble areas, my eyes and my neck.&lt;br /&gt;My neck is firmer and well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> good price, hope they maintain it</li>
    <li> Retinol and Vitamin C is a winning combination. Before trying this product, I was having problem with hormonal acne around my chin area. Since trying this now for 2-3 weeks. I no longer have acne there. My skin loves this serum! I put on the Retinol and Vitamin C and Hyaluronic serum every night and in the morning I put on the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to be my beauty regimen from now on! Love this brand and product. Thanks for the reviews, I&#x27;m glad I tried this serum.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It is hard to rate a skin care product within days of receiving it.  Customer service has been great. I received and email from them and that was very thoughtful.  Have not had the news to contact them yet.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seems high quality.  The serum is clear and think with a pleasant smell.  My skin has not had an allergic reaction, which is great.  If I remember, and my skin wil probably help me do that, I will be updating my review.</li>
    <li> I really love this Hyaluronic acid.  Unlike others it is not at all sticky and absorbs quickly.  I love the fact that it also contains vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Large bottles, product came quickly!</li>
    <li> Thank you. Love product.</li>
    <li> I can not see any difference...wish I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> Those consistency of this serum is quite thick &amp; gel-like. Others I&#x27;ve used in the past like this cause an odd balling up &amp; rolling off skin, in addition to flaking after moisturiser is applied and/or later when makeup is applied. They also all take awhile to dry thoroughly. The first thing I noticed is that it dried quickly, so no wait time before applying moisturiser &amp; later the rest of my makeup. I tired it with several different moisturisers &amp; each reacted the same- fast absorption, no odd side effects. Tried with several foundations, concealers, again no problems. I&#x27;ve only used this product a few days (2x a day), so will try to post an update in a month or so to see if I can discern any difference between this &amp; my normal skincare. I&#x27;m so happy as I now have a lovely smooth canvas to start with! Have even been able to throw on some concealer, lipstick &amp; go (what kind of magic😉 is this since I&#x27;m 55 &amp; even got complimented?) I&#x27;m not very consistent with using the ultrasonic Infuser wand I was given for Mother&#x27;s Day which supposedly makes your products work 3x (I think?) better. The medical explanation (in simple terms, not a medical professional) is that the ultrasound waves help your skincare penetrate deeper past the outer layers of skin so skincare can work on a deeper level where it makes more of a difference than applying only topically. I try to use it at least every other day and have noticed a difference, (I took before pix- I&#x27;m a skeptic!) saw results after just a week &amp; hoping this serum will give even better results. A thoughtful, safe &amp; handy touch is that the serum comes with a dropper top (no germs from dirty hands to fester in the bottle) &amp; easy to dispense just a few drops at a time (I use 4 drops for my entire face, neck &amp; hands.) I paid a discounted price for this serum in return for my honest review, no compensation was received. I&#x27;m so happy with this serum that I&#x27;ll be looking at their other products, hoping to find things that would be solutions for my other skin concerns. I hope this review was helpful and informational &amp; if you have further questions I&#x27;ll try to answer them as best I can!utions for my other skin concerns. I hope this review was helpful and informational &amp; if you have further questions I&#x27;ll try to answer them as best I can!</li>
    <li> Great product !!!! Works like it should.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and the most debilitating place that I get break outs is on my face. This product is better than anything a doctor has ever prescribed me. I saw a difference overnight.</li>
    <li> I love this light serum. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night since I purchased it. It goes well with my other skincare and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is significantly more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Great quality and a super price, since this bottle is 2oz. I use this with the 2.5% retinol serum and the vitamin C serum. My skin is looking great, and I feel I&#x27;m getting very good value with this brand. I&#x27;ve used other brands of these 3 products and feel the quality and efficacy is about the same for all of them, but since I&#x27;m getting twice the amount with Eve Hansen brand, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND SO FAR, IT&#x27;S BEEN OKAY I&#x27;VE NOTICED SOME CHANGE BUT NOTHING TO DRASTIC, I WILL KEEP POSTING THREW OUT THE PROCESS AND SEE IF I GET A BETTER RESULT.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference with wrinkles but it keeps my skin very hydrated without making it oily</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I have plenty of difficulty finding a moisturizer. If I find something that doesn&#x27;t break me out/leave an oily slick cross my t zone and forehead, then I am almost guaranteed to be missing any real benefit to the product aside from uniform moisturization. This product has made my pores look smaller. I also have naturally always had lines under my eyes which have not improved with age- this serum has made a marked difference in the few deep lines I have in my face and absolutely diminished my fine lines. When used in proper order of product application, especially, I highly recommend this product for any skin type wanting to renew or maintain fresh, beautiful, youthful skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you. This seems to work well, not sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and Eve Hansen!  Will continue doing business with this seller.  I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week now. I love it!! My skin is moist and glowing. i will be trying other products from this line!!</li>
    <li> This product really feels amazing. Like a glass of water for your skin. Not at all greasy and very Effective .&lt;br /&gt;I would Definitely Buy it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. My skin is so smooth! And I have already noticed a difference in my problem areas and it&#x27;s only been a week! I&#x27;m very impressed, plus a few drops goes a long way,so this will last quite a while. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review of this product.</li>
    <li> tried this !! pleased with product, my skin feels silky smooth after only 3 days usage. I had quick mail service , absolutely no problems of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;WELL PLEASED</li>
    <li> Really helped with texture and appearance of skin. I experienced no irritation at all, and disappears completely into skin. Does not interfere with cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Results are seen immediately.  Definitely will purchase again. No need to use any other products but Eve Hansen. Priced right. Hope they are never discontinued.  I use the vitamin  C and Retinol as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Great product and fast shipper!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I noticed right away the difference in my skin...</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying seeing a positive transformation on the look and texture of my skin. I have only used this for two weeks but I am getting several compliments on how my skin seems to have a glow about it and I am 60.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and so worth the price.  I have used far more expensive hyaluronic serums without quarter of the results.  Others seem to have many additives that leave skin feeling tight, dry, flaky....not this one.  My skin looks bright and refreshed every time I use it.  The results are not lasting;  as your skin depletes throughout the day and night, you need to replenish.  For best results, use consistently morning and evening after washing, before moisture cream.  Allow to dry completely.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Been using different Hyaluronic Acids and I am very happy with this product.  Love the size and I even use it on my legs and arms.  I wait a couple of minutes and put on lotion and my legs and arms stay softer longer than using just lotion.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Absorbs quickly and holds in moisture.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me my skin was looking great and asked what I was using.  My mom thought I was wearing make up. I&#x27;m  really happy with the product and plan on purchasing a bottle for my daughter..</li>
    <li> awesome stuff. I already notice a positive difference! plus it is not sticky like vitamin c serums and not taut and uncmfortable. yest it works!! gonna buy it again! using it on my forarms and back of hands as well as face and neck!</li>
    <li> Turned dry, itchy, burning, red rash, peeling, alligator skin on my face and around my puffy eyes into soft moisturized silky skin. I used five drops,twice a day, and patted it around the problem areas. When completely  dry,  I applied a  sun screen moisturizer during the day and night moisturizer at bed time. Frown lines around my eyes are less deep.&lt;br /&gt;I bought Hyaluronic Acid out of desperation. I used so many over the counter creams and lotion, I could not name them all.  I also used prescription lotion and creams from my dermatologist. Not of that stuff worked. Most of the products I used burned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right. I would buy this product again and recommend it to anyone with symptoms similar  to mine.  I stopped  using it for a few days to see if it really  made a difference.  It did .Skin went back to feeling rough, bumpy, red and itchy. Not to mention the burning sensation returned..</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good, dropper doesn&#x27;t wok that well.</li>
    <li> Did not have a clue what this acid was used for, but bought it anyway and researched it after. I have been using it for 2 weeks and so pleased that its reducing my frown lines. They had a special and was ready to make my purchase today and so disappointed that I missed it. I wish I could be notified when next special comes around.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.. I had only for a week and I have already noticed a change in my skin.... my skin is super soft... I have never owned a face product that ever made my skin feel this way! I highly recommend it! luv it! will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, smooths my skin amazingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this before but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am really seeing results after a week.  That&#x27;s pretty great!</li>
    <li> I think it is helping.  Have been using various products for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Less is more, texture is soothing.I have scars from a facial surgery. It has made them almost invisible only after one month.will definitely purchase more. I&#x27;m also going to get a bottle for my 80 yr.old mother. She will love it. Thank you, Karen</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this! I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle but the serum was very thick but when I put on my face it turns to water. It has a chemical smell also that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Especially since it&#x27;s 72% organic. It broke me out very badly. I do have sensitive skin. I also have combo skin. So this definitely is not for me. It may have just been my sensitive skin but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product. I have seen an improvement in my skin. The process in offering this product was easy.</li>
    <li> Dont buy worsest products ever doesnt do nothing for your face....complete waste of money we need to accept who we are unless youd like to shell out money with plastic surgey just to fix the problems .but products like this wont help.</li>
    <li> one bottle, not three</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product.  Not greasy and a little bit goes a long way.  I love the seller they have sent me several emails on how to get the most out of the product - definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle of this wonderful &#x27;potion&#x27;.  I use it twice a day.  My skin in clearer and smoother.  My 84 years old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice daily for a month and can&#x27;t see a bit of difference.  I have been using good skincare since 2004.  I&#x27;m 53 and people say I look anywhere from 35-40, depending on the lighting, ha!  So perhaps I can&#x27;t tell a difference because I was already using serums, good day and night creams, eye creams, etc.  this won&#x27;t break you out; that&#x27;s the only outstanding thing about it.  It hydrates, but no better than other products I&#x27;ve used.  Maybe it&#x27;s doing something that needs time to really be visible.  If anyone can tell a difference after just a few uses, then I doubt they took good care of their skin before.</li>
    <li> I did not get any visible changes to my skin after using the 2 ounce bottle.  The first ingredient is aloe.  It felt like I was using plain aloe on my face for the past month.  I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve  started using hyaluronic acid, I&#x27;ve  decided it must be part of my daily skin care regimen. Yours is especially easy to use and gives me great results. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. I had dried out my skin doing a glycolic peel and had a wedding to go to at the end of the week. I received the hyaluronic acid on a Wednesday and immediately it started to soften my skin, plump my crow&#x27;s feet &amp; give me more of a glow. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves my skin soft and renewed. I have noticed an improvement on lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes. I also use it in my neck and now it seems firmer. A little bit goes a long way. I will buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this product particularly impressive.  It is not very hydrating and does nothing to improve skin tone.  I ordered it on a whim when I saw &amp;#34;organic and vegan&amp;#34;  but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  If I had to venture a guess, I&#x27;d say the glowing reviews on here were planted by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite serum remains G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;fique by Lancôme.  It is expensive, but visibly hydrates and improves elasticity and skin tone.  I will stick with that!</li>
    <li> I found that it was of no benefit whatsoever!!!  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other hyaluronic acid products, but like this the best. The serum is thicker, not very liquid which I like. It absorbs well and quickly. I apply it to a damp face and then add a moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me after it has dried. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Seems watery compared to other products. I don&#x27;t see a difference &amp; I have used this every night &amp; morning.</li>
    <li> A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> THi stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 31 year old female and I&#x27;d like to believe I take care of my skin. I gave this a try to see what the hype is all about,  and I was pleasantly surprised when I used it!  It made my skin plumper and smoother. It has an instantaneous effect. I&#x27;ll keep buying this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance when I use this product.  I play golf and garden in the Texas heat/sun, and the back of my neck was rather leathery looking.  I usually spray my toner on my face, then while it is barely damp, add the hyaluronic acid, just patting it on...including the back of my neck.  It&#x27;s made a very noticeable difference not only on my face, but also in reducing the leather-look on my neck and chest!  I even had a friend ask if I had had an eye lift!  That&#x27;s proof enough for me that this is making a difference!</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years. skin looks great.  only need one drop for face after i wash and dry.  I use squalene oil on top</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle, quick shipping.  Hard to rate before I get a chance to use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s effective without being caustic.  I use is with other skin care and it has reduced appearance of fine lines as well as many other products that are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Another must buy. Together they are indeed a facelift in a bottle. Haven&#x27;t had to wear makeup after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great price.</li>
