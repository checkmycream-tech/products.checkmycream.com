<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved the peppermint oil!! Would definitely purchase again at the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Young Living oils. It smells fantastic! It is good for fatigue, concentration, heartburn, hot flashes, memory, nausea, arthritis, depression....and the list goes on and on. This is one of those oils you don&#x27;t want to be without. I love to put a couple drops in my diffuser if I need a pick-me-up. Good for what ails ya!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Young Living essential oils are always the best therapeutic essential oils. They do come at a price and are worth it. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. It&#x27;s been a great product!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> yes, it was temporarily misplaced but found the next day.</li>
    <li> Definitely therapeutic grade! Just a couple of drops a day massaged into my upper back and neck has really improved arthritis pain. The first day I literally was burping peppermint and asked my doc about it who said sounds like it&#x27;s pretty strong stuff! :) thanks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use as much as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> What a great way to get a quick lift.  One whiff of the Peppermint oil makes you feel very alive and well.  I add to my temples, but with a light hand, as if you do too much, and/or too close to your eyes, you will really tear up.  Happened to three of us.</li>
    <li> This is crap. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> great for stuffy nose</li>
    <li> Still an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this oil and I love it..the aroma is so amazing..I mix a drop with my hand lotion in my palm and put it on my legs for sore muscles and did make a differr and will buy again and even try a few more..ence and so smooth it made my legs..am a believe</li>
    <li> great stuff. Shipping was great too.</li>
    <li> Loove our peppermint! I ordered this one for my sister who was having headache troubles. I haven&#x27;t checked in with her, but I know this is what helps my mom. I love it for making so many things. Lotions, chocolates, etc. Be sure not to use it if you are nursing, though! Peppermint will decrease your supply. It is good if you are trying to dry up, though.</li>
    <li> As noted. Got for my daughter who seems to get car sick on long rides.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product, I have a son age of 11 and likes to used the peppermint oil for  sometime headage or relaxation. I have it three stars because of the price for very little amount. Very good element.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, the bottle is very small but a drop goes a long way! I use a drop in a very large glass of water and sip on it all day. Very refreshing. Good quality. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> The Young Living Peppermint oil has really helped my stomach, i.e. heart burn and acid reflux! Since I started using the Peppermint oil I haven&#x27;t needed to take my heart burn pills.</li>
    <li> I really like this peppermint essential oil. I mixed a drops of it with a DIY shower gell and it really helped me getting rid of ALL of the pimples I had on my back in only 3 uses! it has an amazing smell. It can also be added to any oil or treatment to increase the benefits it works like a catalyst.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the oil.</li>
    <li> I love the quality and scent, I find it sweet and soothing! Highly recommend this product for anyone who does not like lavender as I do not.</li>
    <li> Very high quality oil... highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used this mixed with lavender in a lotion for my family, smells great and has helped treat symptoms and prevent the stomach flu that went through the area a few weeks ago.  Also the scent is great.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality essential oil! Food grade quality. I use it to make homemade toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The seller was very prompt in shipping, so I am appreciative of that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not happy with the product. I have used Young Living products for quite sometime and hoped to save a little money by ordering through Amazon.... unfortunately, the quality of the oil is not good. I don&#x27;t know if through shipping maybe the heat got to it and affected the oil itself, if its just a bad batch, or if the oil is old....  but it does not smell of peppermint. The smell actually makes me nauseous.</li>
    <li> Very tiny for its price, but I just found another company that makes Peppermint Oil for &amp;#34;internal&amp;#34; consumption for a much much better price!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fed up with buying the company&#x27;s name, when I can buy from its competitor with also great quality and more for the buck!!</li>
    <li> awesome product , use it for migrane headaches , Love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is a staple essential oil for me and Young Living&#x27;s is my top choice for quality and effectiveness. I have used other high quality oils with good results, but this oil still exceeds them. I have a small vial that travels with me everywhere (along with other oils I can&#x27;t live without) and I use it regularly. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint oil. It&#x27;s an amazing oil for many different ailments.</li>
    <li> I would have to write a book to say all of the good things about this oil. I have headaches quite a bit and a little of this mixed with coconut oil on my temples and it helps tremendously. My wife believes whole heartedly in these oils and they truly do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even have an essential oils kit for babies and kids! These are all natural and don&#x27;t contain god knows what are in medicine these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and check out this website for more info. You can&#x27;t beat these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youngliving.com/signup/?site&#x3D;US&amp;sponsorid&#x3D;1537002&amp;enrollerid&#x3D;1537002</li>
    <li> What can I say, YL is a great product and this Peppermint came exactly as advertised! Also great for baking!</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is a must have it is good for so many things.</li>
    <li> Rubbed on the temples, forehead and back of neck, it&#x27;s a migraine stopper.  And mixed with water and sprayed around windows, it&#x27;s a spider stopper.  How versatile!</li>
    <li> Love, love this! I smell daily and it has helped me with headaches. Try it!</li>
    <li> Smells like a generic version of YL peppermint.</li>
    <li> Love the essential oils and the peppermint from young living is terrific.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and received it right on schedule.</li>
    <li> Very minty for my homemade toothpaste! Will last a long time in a cool dry place- not bathroom or kitchen near appliances.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> nice scent and good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love Young Living essential oils, but my bottle came open and with some missing. Wtf. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Peppermint is refreshing, it is a driver for other oils that go on first.</li>
    <li> Great customer service but save your money. They advertise peppermint as an anti-inflammatory which it might well be. They make no claims about its effectiveness but sell you a book with every disease known and what and how to use. Again, they don&#x27;t make any claims, instead they say if you have so and so you use this and this. When people are sick they become desperate for a cure, therefore they are easy pickings for these companies. You purchase these products and when you don&#x27;t feel better the standard answer is, &amp;#34;You need to use it a little longer.&amp;#34; This is great for the company because they have you hooked with hope for a few months. When you get discouraged and leave there is always someone standing in line with the same hopes. There are testimonials contrary too what I&#x27;m saying, but I question the legitimacy of those. My question is, &amp;#34;Where are the legitimate studies showing you use xx to treat yy?&amp;#34; You wont find any because they don&#x27;t exist. I just threw out about $500 worth of cure all products. What could you do with $500-I wish I still had it.</li>
    <li> This oil smells sooo good!! I put some in my hands and rubbed them together and inhaled..omg, I felt like I had took a wiff of my grandma&#x27;s mint candy bowl..Beautiful memories :)</li>
    <li> Although it is more expensive , it works better then other brands because it is pure. It opens up my sinus. I only use this brand as they WORK!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Burns a little on skin but refreshing .</li>
    <li> A high quality oil, very soothing and calming.</li>
    <li> Love for upset tummy.  Just rub on and feel better!</li>
    <li> I love Young Living Peppermint Oil, and this is a nice size---it&#x27;s easy to carry in a purse.  In my opinion, no other brand of peppermint oil is as good as this.  Even though I live in a large city, Young Living products are very difficult to find in retail stores here.  Purchasing on-line was convenient and economic, and I received my order in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and my daughter loves using it for all kinds of things.  It was used on my grandson and kept  him from being stopped up.</li>
    <li> i do understand that essential oils are quite expensive due to their high demand but i would like to see if anyone can bargin with prices. at least within a $20 or under for a 10ml amount of oils.</li>
    <li> Sad to say, I will be throwing this out. It has a funny smell and comes nowhere close to the new yl peppermint I just received.</li>
    <li> LOVE it. Will be buying more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal for sinus headaches and allergy headaches</li>
    <li> Glade that I found it and able to buy it and that they will continue to carry this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to educate myself on the uses of essential oils since I discovered tea tree oil. I used this by rubbing it in to my sore muscles while I had the flu. There was immediate relief. I plan to keep learning.</li>
    <li> Great item, I use daily.</li>
    <li> Best essential oil in the market if you know about quality if you don&#x27;t you can buy cheaper oil and artificial. People see rose oil for $20 bucks, not real or is mix, real rose oil cost a lot same as well other exotic flowers. Young living are the real thing and even you can consume like this one, one drop in water will be enough.</li>
    <li> Young Living is a great brand of therapeudic  grade essential oils.  They are authentic and full strength.  Other brands sometimes dilute their products or adulterate them in the processing, Young Living gardens, extracts and bottles these God sent healers in a loving fashion no other brand can be as trusted to do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it when I have problems breathing but this clears me right up</li>
    <li> This product has my seal of approval.  I have been using just a little dab of this during cold and flu season.  It clears me right out.  It also helps me fall asleep.  Amazing product.  I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Peppermint is one of my favorites and I&#x27;m always running out thank you so very much, I&#x27;m sure I will order again</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth. The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil. You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
    <li> helps open up my sinus passages; love this</li>
    <li> Genuine Young Living oil, price was good, and it arrived on time. Very happy with the product, use it for pain and aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased.  Would not use Young Living Essential Oil.  I only use DoTERRA.  It says therapeutic grade, but I&#x27;m skeptical.</li>
    <li> This peppermint  oil was soothing. Use on pillow and in cool mist humidifier  at night when had surgery. A few drops last several hours.</li>
    <li> My wife is very satisfied with this pruchase.  She feels that it helps her healthwise.  She is a longtime user of this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love young living oils they are very pure and I know I&#x27;m getting good quality and the smell is wonderful it has helped with a number of things.</li>
    <li> This is crazy!  But I bought this to help my breathing at night time.  I&#x27;ve always needed nose drops, and I know that isn&#x27;t the best idea because the drugs in nose drops are not beneficial to the body when used all the time.  (I still use nose drops when I need to, but not very often.)  Someone told me to try peppermint, and I did, and now I don&#x27;t think I would be without it.  I just put a drop or two on the end of a Q-tip and rub around the inside of both nostrils just before bedtime.  It helps me to breathe better most nights.  And I can use this as often as I like since it is an Essential Oil with no drugs.</li>
    <li> Love peppermint after I eat. Take a drop and keeps the gas away.</li>
    <li> Young living oils are great</li>
    <li> We use this in our toothpaste. Seems to be a clean oil and flavors the paste well.</li>
    <li> This oil makes your home smell delicious, absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I use it for IBS and it has been a great help.</li>
    <li> I love young living essential oils.  I buy the oils for my diffuser. I am very happy with this product.</li>
