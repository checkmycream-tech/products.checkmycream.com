      <li>and the brush was HUGE.</li>

      <li>It was cheap</li>

      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s good for people with sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>Bare Naturale Mascara and loved it.  </li>
      <li>When it first came out it was pretty abundant, but I think it&#x27;s been removed to make way for the newer mascaras that keep coming out.  </li>
      <li>I would wear it on one of those days where you aren&#x27;t going to work or anywhere special..</li>
      <li>, i believe it stays true to what it says it does.</li>
      <li>This mascara goes on clean and gives just the right color and thickening to enhance what God gave you.</li>
      <li>It cleans easily with gentle eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>This is a great everyday mascara.</li>
      <li>It really enhanced my eyelashes and looked amazing and natural.</li>
      <li>which I guess is more natural.</li>
      <li>Still need something more for my sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I was looking for more of a clear mascara.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a natural looking mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, but just like many mascaras i have tried, it is clumpy and gooey.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sensitive to chemicals, so I was looking for something affordable and safe.</li>
      <li>Looks and smells great; not super strong so won&#x27;t make your lashes super thick but looks nice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most mascaras, something about the black ink that most of them use makes my eyes swell</li>
      <li>but I wanted to try some black mascara again and see if I could find a good one.</li>
      <li>It is water based so its very gentle in your eyes,and needs reapplication if you want a thicker look.</li>
      <li>Great combination, wish it was not so hard to find.</li>
      <li>So very hard to find a good mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to apply without getting it on my skin.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good for the price,The only thing I can say about it, is that it is quite liquidy along with the fact that you do need to be extremely careful while applying, to get that clump free effect .</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>I have used very expensiive mascaras and have not been worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have a tendency to get \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; from most mascaras, especially if I apply to my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>Great product, it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t cluster.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great mascara for everyday use, since it&#x27;s soft and natural-looking.  </li>
      <li>but I was very impressed with the total cost including shipping which arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
      <li>I love using this when I want my asian lashes to just look normal.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that this is all natural but it dries up too quickly.</li>
      <li>if the \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; claim is accurate, but so far my lashes do feel soft.</li>
      <li>so be careful when using it, but for the price it&#x27;s doable for sure.</li>
      <li>It really does make my lashes look longer than they&#x27;ve ever looked before, by coating so well that it reaches the lash ends that I didn&#x27;t even know were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good color, applies fairly thickly without the need for repeated applications.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was quick, but the package itself was pretty bent up and had an obvious spot where a price tag used to be.</li>
      <li>The first one I opened did not appear to be new.  </li>
      <li>Application was messy and my lashes clumped up very easily.</li>
      <li>The wand is too full and gets on upper and lower lids.</li>
      <li>The brush was large, and very soft.</li>
      <li>This is my new forever mascara!  </li>
      <li>If my mascara weren&#x27;t discontinued I would have given it a 5 star, but knowing its a goner makes it less lovable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most mascaras, something about the black ink that most of them use makes my eyes swell shut. I&#x27;m very happy to say that this one doesn&#x27;t contain anything I&#x27;m allergic to, but otherwise it&#x27;s underwhelming. The mascara itself is goopy and clumps easily and the brush is flimsy and not great.</li>
    <li> Just Buy Your Masacra In A Store. This One Seems Like An Old One That Sat Around For Years. Even Though It Was In It&#x27;s Package It Wasn&#x27;t The Same As A New One.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Bare Naturale Mascara and loved it.  My eyelashes were thick but natural looking, not clumpy, long and full, very natural but so much better than my natural!  I started looking for another tube and could not find it at a retail outlet so I looked on Amazon and was grateful to have found it here.  I purchased 3 tubes just in case they have discontinued it, but hope that is not the case.  Love this stuff.  So very hard to find a good mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and is easy to apply without getting it on my skin.  The formula is very good and the brush is too.  Great combination, wish it was not so hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara that separates my already long lashes without clumping or making them look scary. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this mascara at Dollar Tree for $1 and bought a few of them.  This is very nice mascara - especially for a dollar!  It goes on very lightly and smoothly and the wand is very easy to work with.  What I like is that you can choose to apply the mascara more heavily at the base of your lashes and create wispier ends to your lashes if you want. The mascara hardly clumps. It&#x27;s a great mascara for everyday use, since it&#x27;s soft and natural-looking.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for a dramatic, night-time or special occasion look, though you could probably use a few layers in a pinch. Supposedly 85% of the ingredients are from natural sources - whatever that means.</li>
    <li> Looks and smells great; not super strong so won&#x27;t make your lashes super thick but looks nice.  Wore this all day and no smudging or smearing occurred.</li>
    <li> This product, for some reason, is very hard to find around me (northeast).  When it first came out it was pretty abundant, but I think it&#x27;s been removed to make way for the newer mascaras that keep coming out.  So I&#x27;ve tried to find others that I can pick up easily, but none have compared.  It goes on easy and smooth, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes.  Also, gives a nice natural look (no spidey-legs) and comes off easily.  So, I have to order it online now to stop wasting my money on other, lesser products.  I hope they keep making it !</li>
    <li> This mascara is very clumpy and goes on way too thick. I&#x27;m sure it may be good for your lashes but it looks horrible.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it keeps your lashes soft, never looks clumpy and best of all, if you sleep in it there are no black smudges under your eyes in the morning!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Bare Naturale mascara is my favorite product that I have ever used, and was delighted to find it was still available.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good for the price,The only thing I can say about it, is that it is quite liquidy along with the fact that you do need to be extremely careful while applying, to get that clump free effect .</li>
    <li> One of the better mascaras I have tried.  I have reordered this mascara several times and plan to continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for people who have a sensitivity to mascara but it was just too dark for me. I was looking for more of a clear mascara.</li>
    <li> I have blonde eyelashes, so I hate to go without mascara. L&#x27;oreal Paris Bare Naturale Mascara helps me achieve a natural look without looking like I have spider legs on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very natural looking and leaves the lashes soft.  I will continue to use it in the future.  I am very satisfied with this product and it is inexpensive for such a good quality mascara.</li>
    <li> About my mascara needs and preferences: I have long-ish, fairly full, somewhat curly, light brown lashes. My eyes are sensitive and some mascaras irritate them (just by proximity, not actually getting mascara in my eyes). I have a tendency to get \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; from most mascaras, especially if I apply to my lower lashes. I hate clumpy mascara, which is why I hate MOST mascaras. I don&#x27;t use an eyelash-curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is the PERFECT mascara. I wanted something that would \\&quot;define,\\&quot; i.e., make my lashes darker and therefore more noticeable, without (a) clumping, (b) creating raccoon-eye under my lower lashes, or (c) irritating my eyes. (I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; mascara.) This stuff absolutely does the job I wanted it to do, and has the added benefit of \\&quot;lengthening\\&quot;--a mascara claim that I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of. It really does make my lashes look longer than they&#x27;ve ever looked before, by coating so well that it reaches the lash ends that I didn&#x27;t even know were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve only been wearing it for a few days so I don&#x27;t know yet if the \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; claim is accurate, but so far my lashes do feel soft. I also don&#x27;t know yet how it performs under crying or extreme sweating conditions. (Prefer to keep it that way...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless mascaras over the years and none even come close to comparing with this. My eyes now are never irritated like they were before. Plus it actually stays on my eyelashes; by the end of the day I don&#x27;t have all the residue under my eyes like I do with other mascaras. I love this product and will never go to anything else (if I can help it).</li>
    <li> The mascara works well.  Good color, applies fairly thickly without the need for repeated applications.  Like all mascara&#x27;s, I feel like the applicator does not make it easy to apply to the thin lower lashes.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this mascara is nice. It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy or flake. However, the wand is a tad on the large side, and since I have small eyes, that makes it a little bit difficult to use. This mascara is more natural looking than other kinds I have tried... eyelashes have less tendency to look like they&#x27;re actually coated in anything. This product does have a major shortcoming in my opinion though. My eyelashes naturally have absolutely zero curl. Even after I curl my eyelashes, this mascara does a pretty poor job at holding it and actually end up looking more like how my eyelashes normally are.. which I guess is more natural. Altogether.. it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used.. not the worst.. I would wear it on one of those days where you aren&#x27;t going to work or anywhere special.. and errand day mascara I guess. Decent product to have.</li>
    <li> It really is the perfect mascara... Too bad it&#x27;s being discontinued! I would never buy anything else! Never itches my eyes, doesn&#x27;t clump but offers the most lengthy yet thick coat to bring my lashes to the forefront.</li>
    <li> I switched all my makeup to natural products after I started having skin issues.  After researching and trusting reviews, everything I got is wonderful except for this product. I switched from CoverGirl Lash Blast Volume and bought the black-brown.  It goes on thin and clumpy, and putting on two layers just makes it sticky.  By the end of the day I find myself itching my eyes and it seems to be due to this mascara.  I wish I had as much luck as the other reviewers!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL mascara - the most natural ever yet makes lashes full</li>
    <li> If my mascara weren&#x27;t discontinued I would have given it a 5 star, but knowing its a goner makes it less lovable</li>
    <li> I only use a very little mascara, so this is adequate. I am pretty sensitive to chemicals, so I was looking for something affordable and safe. Of all of the lower priced mainstream mascaras, I felt the most comfortable about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about this seller, though. The shipping was quick, but the package itself was pretty bent up and had an obvious spot where a price tag used to be. I felt like I was probably receiving a very old reject from a store like Ross.</li>
    <li> I have eye allergies and so far this has eliminated some of the irritation i would get from other brands.  It hasn&#x27;t cured my eyes or anything but more comfortable since i am addicted to mascara.  it goes on differently than other types to, i believe it stays true to what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This is ok but not what I wanted for my thin short lashes. The wand is too full and gets on upper and lower lids. I ended up using a thinner wand from a different tube that I had cleaned and saved to separate lashes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone looking for a solution to thin lashes.</li>
    <li> The package arrived and looked like it&#x27;s been standing on a shelf for years (the back was turning yellow). Application was messy and my lashes clumped up very easily. It was cheap so I kept it and use it sometimes for every day application, hoping those minerals in there will do something for my lashes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but it&#x27;s just okay.  No better or worse than anything you buy at the drug store.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this mascara.  I like it a lot but does clump a little.  I have very thin blond short eyelashes and it definitely fills them in and lengthens them, but at a cost of a little clumping that can be dealt with.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this is all natural but it dries up too quickly. Otherwise it&#x27;s good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Really Nice Mascara for the Price.  I bought one for myself and one for my daughter.  We both like it.  I don&#x27;t use any products with Parabens, so I was surprised to find a L&#x27;Oreal product that didn&#x27;t have it in it.  The mascara goes on very easily, It does not clump at all and separates the lashes nicely.  The wand is kind of weak so be careful when using it, but for the price it&#x27;s doable for sure.</li>
    <li> I have to buy mascara that does not emanate vapors that irritate my eyes.I use contact lenses and I believe  one of the component here is some sort of natural beeswax..the problem is that sometimes my lenses get blurry and have to wait a little with the help of my natural tears to clean them.It is water based so its very gentle in your eyes,and needs reapplication if you want a thicker look.It cleans easily with gentle eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> looks great and lasts long</li>
    <li> I was hoping based off the reviews that this would work for me, but it is clumpy and and thick and does not lengthen my lashes at all.</li>
    <li> It clumps a little. The mascara still works good though.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on clean and gives just the right color and thickening to enhance what God gave you. Not a heavy &amp;#34;night on the town&amp;#34; product, but just right for work or a casual day out and about. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mascara that won&#x27;t collect under my eyes rather than staying on my lashes.  The reviews for this one led me to believe this may be the one for me.  I tried it today - nice brush, went on well without being too thick.  4 hours later there were black lines under my eyes from the mascara.  Usually I can get through most of the day before it happens.  I won&#x27;t be using it again and would caution anyone considering buying it that it may not stay on your lashes.</li>
    <li> This is my new forever mascara!  I used to use a different brand that didn&#x27;t smudge (until they stopped making it) which is difficult to find for me as I have oily skin but this stuff does the trick.  It makes my eyelashes look great and the brush separates and doesn&#x27;t clump.  I don&#x27;t need a heavy mascara because my eyelashes are fairly long but they do need mascara and this stuff works well for me...and no smudging!!!</li>
    <li> this mascara was waaaaay too clumpy for me. and the brush was HUGE. i just threw it out. maybe my tiny asian eyelashes are to blame.</li>
    <li> totally dried out--unusable</li>
    <li> Really a great lengthening mascara. I have short and sparse lashes that, after applying, looked naturally long and don&#x27;t droop, even after a few hours. This is a great everyday mascara. I liked that it looked natural, without any thick, clumpy mess. However, it does dry quickly, and if you apply another coat when your previous coats already dried, it won&#x27;t be pretty.</li>
    <li> Still need something more for my sensitive eyes. I wanted this to be the mascara that worked. Just not the one.</li>
    <li> The quality of the mascara matches about what I paid for it (~$4). The brush is awful and the actual mascara itself gets goopy. The brush is so bad I apply the mascara and then use my OLD brush with thick plastic bristles to even it out and make it look semi-decent. I gave it two, not one, star because it&#x27;s not as bad as some mascara you would find at the dollar stores. It&#x27;s still pretty terrible, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard they stopped manufacturing it, and that&#x27;s probably for the better.</li>
    <li> Not 100% natural, but close and not dry like the other &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
    <li> Just so cheap so I bought three. But it doesn&#x27;t give any volume, any long. Just clear lash, that&#x27;s all. I got to have small trick that I put it on first and let the lash dry a little bit and put it on again. Then, it&#x27;s gonna be more volume.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It made my eyelashes natural looking sorta made them longer. good for work. came off in shower easy. i like using it.</li>
    <li> This was awful.  Complete waste of money.  Seemed almost old and dried out and I bought TWO!  Not worth $0.10</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these from antoher vendor by accident thinking it was different, but no different, and it did not lengthen my lashes.  Lashes are still thin.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t cluster. I had gotten it as a gift and my mom borrowed it and loved it- she didn&#x27;t give it back! I would recommend this to a friend, however it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, thankfully Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> I already have naturally long dark lashes so I wear clear mascara usually but I wanted to try some black mascara again and see if I could find a good one. This was the second one I tried and it worked great. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t flake. It really enhanced my eyelashes and looked amazing and natural.</li>
    <li> is was very dry and bad black colour.... i wont order never this mascara( and it was very very old</li>
    <li> I ordered several mascaras.  The first one I opened did not appear to be new.  It had dried mascara outside of the tube. I had to trash it (wasted $$).  The second one I opened did appear to be in new condition.</li>
    <li> It is a good product for the price range.My Wife bought this and she loves this. Delivery and description of product is also perfect.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years. I am unable to find it in stores anymore. I was thrilled to find out that it is still available on line. I started ordering on line approx a year ago. I love it! This past time the mascara seemed old and clumpy. I hope in the future it doesn&#x27;t come like this.</li>
    <li> The formula is somewhat \\&quot;gel/ liquid like\\&quot; and I love it! Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not runny in any way! The mascara never clumps when I apply it to my lashes and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flash throughout the entire day! I LOVE IT! My new dark and lushes lashes. YUM YUM :)</li>
    <li> I been using it for years and always people had to say something nice about my eyelashes when I wore it, too bad is not out in the market anymore, Loreal should bring it back</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find product in the store any more so I was glad to get it on here. Goes on great, not clumpy or flaky.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best ever. It doesnt make your eyelashes look clumpy.  They just look long. I love it</li>
    <li> it has a slight clump but it does extend the lashes and it glides on very smoothly,it also moisturizers the lashes and it comes off easily too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start out with the bad. This product smells weird. And really strong. But since your eyelashes are relatively far away from your nose, this isn&#x27;t a biggie. However, the box it came in was. The package was torn, bent, and crumpled, and the actual mascara package was crumpled too, and a bit open. My mascara wasn&#x27;t used or dried out, so that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s the product that counts. Right?&lt;br /&gt;  The mascara itself was really nice. The brush was large, and very soft. The tip did collect the mascara, but that&#x27;s easy to forget about. The color I ordered, black, was a bit lighter than expected. Oh, wait... This was supposed to be the good. The mascara tube is really cute. can&#x27;t tell what it is.... But i like it! The mascara is build-able, but only slightly. This mascara does not clump, and is easy to use. Overall, three stars.</li>
    <li> If you want dramatic, this isn&#x27;t for you.  It is a thin formula and goes on feathery.  You can layer it to be more dramatic if you want to but it takes a lot of work.</li>
    <li> If you want just thicker looking lashed without the tarantula effect or like you&#x27;re not wearing mascara this is the mascara to buy. I love using this when I want my asian lashes to just look normal. Shipping was fast! Arrived in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a natural looking mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, but just like many mascaras i have tried, it is clumpy and gooey.</li>
    <li> Not sure what made me think it was waterprof but it is not other than that it is mascara it looks dark brown but it says it is black but really who cares!</li>
    <li> .Very happy with product. Verysmooth not flakey or chunky. I have used very expensiive mascaras and have not been worth the money. I would recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately New Zealand no longer stocks this mascara and I was over joyed when I found it here. I thought I would stock up and buy 10! A bit over board but I was very impressed with the total cost including shipping which arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
