      <li>They are super soft and they pick up just the right amount and then blend it beautifully.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent blush brush.  I would purchase again. Not too firm and not too soft.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and I am not a makeup artist by any means, but it does a great job like I was!</li>
    <li> I got it withing 4 days I like it. Its not as big as I thought but well see how it works. I havent tried it. But I have seen some good reviews.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for applying blush! The angle is perfect for the cheek bone area and it&#x27;s good at blending as well!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Such great quality at a bargain price. I ended up buying a bunch; for blush, bronzer, highlighting etc. so soft and they blend well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty solid for the price. I use it all the time. Works great.</li>
    <li> The hairs keep coming out and are all over the place. Not thrilled.</li>
    <li> Anyone who puts under 5 stars, doesn&#x27;t know how properly apply makeup.. I love makeup and I&#x27;m really good at it a go all out and contour with out being obvious and this brush is amazing. I have so many mac blush brushes and I honestly like this one more.</li>
    <li> Brush is soft enough, and yet firm enough to contour as expected. I use this every day. Love it. Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth what I paid but is very soft and bristles shed quite a bit. But for $3 I think it&#x27;s pretty decent</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. good quality</li>
    <li> Very soft and perfect for blush or bronze. Great price and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product for the price! Really does the job and is just as comparable to the more expensive brushes! Really wish they sold this at Target!</li>
    <li> medium quality brush. Gets the job done. There was alot of packaging to protect the product which i appreciate thx!</li>
    <li> I never received my elf studio angled blush brush. Thankfully it was cheap. I am very disappointed with amazon for this reason though. Having just had a new baby, I just really didn&#x27;t feel the need to sit on hold to speak with customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a nice size, more for contouring than for use with blush, I think. Though soft and full, I feel it should be a bit larger/softer to use as a main blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;That said, a contouring brush was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> This brush is soft on your skin and holds blush well. It is my favorite blush brush now</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles, deposits just the right amount of blush on my cheeks. No shedding so far.</li>
    <li> This brush is surprisingly high quality. For the money spent it is a real deal! I use this for contouring and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for the price. I recommend many elf products...I have t he larger brush a well which is great too.</li>
    <li> For what you pay for, it&#x27;s such good deal!!! And the hair are very soft....I bought all different brushes from this brand. Totally love it!!!*~*</li>
    <li> I only ever used the brushes that came with whatever makeup I was getting before, so this is entirely uneducated. I use it to apply my NYX powder blush, and it applies it evenly and feels very smooth and luxurious (by my standards) on my skin. I like that this product is from a cruelty free company.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, good handle.  Overall functional product</li>
    <li> The brush is nice quality and size for the price. It&#x27;s also very soft.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish it was a bit firmer.</li>
    <li> Decent blush i have had no problem shedding or falling apart</li>
    <li> Amazing I love it the quality is great for being so cheap in price! My blush looks amazing now when I use it</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for what it&#x27;s utilized for &amp; the price point. Will buy again when I need new brushes. ...</li>
    <li> I use this brush basically everyday for contouring. It does what it is suppose to do and it blends very well.</li>
    <li> I use this brush a lot</li>
    <li> Since the time of liking to have a feeling which it is sticky and is solid from the brush of other slant by a slanting cutline, and to put in perfectly, and the blend of this brush were also completed, it was good.</li>
    <li> I bought it believing it was an angled blush brush but received an angled eyeshadow brush. It the end I ended selling it to a friend better than returning. It would be important to include real size pictures or the measure of these items. Is a good brush but not the one I was waiting for.</li>
    <li> Love it! The bristles are soft and the black color helps me see how much product I&#x27;ve picked up. I use as a bronzer brush rather than a blush one because the angle is really helpful.</li>
    <li> So so soft, but stiff enough to efficiently add some color. Also, it fits perfectly on the apples of my cheeks.</li>
    <li> Even though I only gave it a four star rating, I love this brush! It would be better if it were thicker, but it&#x27;s amazing for the price. They say you get what you pay for; in this case, I got more than I paid for. I only use this brush for light blush colors so I don&#x27;t need to do much blending. I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Its small and compact, it does a great job contouring cheeks, its softer than I expected.  No complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Great for applying blush.  Sweep down from your cheek bones.  Works wonders.  I use it with the MAC blush line.</li>
    <li> I needed a new blush brush.  I love the angled edge.  It&#x27;s nice and fluffy.  Easy to use. No shedding hairs.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this brush, i use it for contouring my face and the angle is perfect! there isn&#x27;t any strands that fall onto my face and the brush was cheap too! I&#x27;m loving this elf line more and more! the brush also has a nice grip too so you can really control what your doing! i diffidently recommend this to all makeup lovers!</li>
    <li> The brush came off its post. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> for the price this brush is great. No fall out so far and really soft. I love elf. But honestly you can get this and all their Studio collection on elf.com for $3. So kinda mad I paid more than the website itself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an average contour brush. It&#x27;s a little too flimsy for my liking. I like denser brushes but they of course cost more.</li>
    <li> This brush has a great angle and is very well put together, but the bristles do not hold powder very well. I would recommend using a different brush if you&#x27;re looking to apply bronzer, foundation, or anything else powder. It makes for a good blender though - because it doesn&#x27;t holder the powder.</li>
    <li> It broke when I first opened it the quality is horrible</li>
    <li> I have two of these and I use them for applying blush and for contouring and they are perfect for that! They are super soft and they pick up just the right amount and then blend it beautifully. My only complaint is that one of my brushes came poorly glued - you could literally take the wooden handle out, but I could quickly fix that flaw with a bit of glue. (In an emergency situation, even a bit of nail polish will do). They wash very well. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good, cheap brush. I use expensive make up, but hate spending 30-50 bucks on brushes! I bought this on a whim and am super happy with how good it is!!!</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> Love it good quality price brush to have it in your brush collection! This is my fist e.i.f brush for sure I will get more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive brush. I use it to apply bronzer and it works great. I love how it leave a nice smooth contour on my cheek.</li>
    <li> Super soft, works great for blush!</li>
    <li> Right out of the package the brush head separated from the handle.  Hey, it was only 3 bucks but seriously.......Since I can&#x27;t return the item, per Amazon Policy, guess I&#x27;ll find a way to get the thing to hold together.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blush brush, I like the angle. I normally just get a non angle brush, but I do like the angle and to help me contour too. Haven&#x27;t had any issue with any shedding. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> It is almost too soft. It is just ok and I have used better from Revlon that I have for 15 years.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE elf brushes!! For such a low end price-the quality of these brushes are like high end!! I use this one all the time! Very dense and nice and gives a nice even glow for blush and bronzer! A Must have!!</li>
    <li> Dense, soft bristles. Works much better than more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I definetly love this brush i first bought the 11 brushe&#x27;s packet which does not include this one neither the studio small stipple brush , it is soft enough and usefull it worth d prece lol</li>
    <li> This brush works perfectly for me. I have acne on my cheeks so when I used to apply blush with a typical blush brush I would have issues with it disturbing coverage from foundation/BB. No such issues with this brush - I just gently pat the color right onto my cheekbones and the coverage stays intact. And it&#x27;s such a steal!</li>
    <li> When I received the brush it was broke! I was mad all I did was glue it back together. But honestly shouldn&#x27;t it be brand new and not broken?&lt;br /&gt;Overall the angle brush works well on highlighting my cheeck bones</li>
    <li> LOVE this contour brush.  In just a couple of strokes I can quickly and easily contour my cheekbones.  I like the feel of the bristles, and they deposit color evenly.  Great price for this brush.  Quick shipping, as well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an angled brush for contouring and blush application.  Ordered 2 of these.  I received the brushes and am pretty satisfied with them.  They are very soft and work perfectly for their intended use.  My only complaint is that on one of the brushes the handle came un-glued already from the actual brush head and also a few hairs have already fallen out.</li>
    <li> I have ordered multiple items and have been very pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price. Thick quality brush does a great job. This will last me for years. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use to apply a powder highlighter on my cheek and brow bones. I used to use a blush brush, but I&#x27;d pinch it to make it flatter so I could control the area it covered. I thought it was time to buy a brush that was better suited to the task, and this one was exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s about a half inch thick and 2 inches wide, soft and fluffy bristles, and the slightly rounded angle of the brush gives good control. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either. Most brands I found with similar brushes were charging $17-30, but this one was under $6.</li>
    <li> soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, hypo, and anti bacterial properties</li>
    <li> Usually such  quality brush (above all angled brush) is very expencive. But I was very amazed by this angled brush&#x60; price.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will be able to make the level of my make up tecnique up by this angled brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is so nice product!! I want to buy this e.l.f. brushes by series.</li>
    <li> Bristles are firm yet flexible and very soft. This brush is perfect for applying blush to my cheekbones, and it arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> It is a good brush overall. It has enough bristles to give enough of density as an angled brush and to pick up enough powder to work with. The downside is that the bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like them to be. They are not harsh, but they are not too soft either. I use it everyday. It does the job.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive brush, this is really great. The bristles are very soft and I have yet to see any shedding. I clean them with baby shampoo every other week and hang upside down to dry. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Soft. Fair Price. Good for contouring. Go fluffy or go home if you need something for blush or bronzer though. No hair fallout so far.</li>
    <li> Nice soft angled brush; i use it for the application of blush, bronzer, and highlighter i got in a little tripod set from Sephora. I was sort of a noob to this, and the girl tried to sell me on a $30 brush too, saying it was a special brush and was really the only thing that would work best for the application, but luckily i decided to ditch it before i got to the register and try to find something cheaper online. I found this brush and have been very happy with it; it was inexpensive and after several months has held up perfectly and works great.</li>
    <li> I like the brush so far. No shedding and seems to be quality. It is very useful for highlighting and contouring.</li>
    <li> Fell apart immediately. Worse product I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> This angled brush is so soft and performs very well and I love that it comes with a little protective sleeve. I use this brush for contouring my face and I love it! Great price too</li>
    <li> The bristles of the brush are nice. I have not had any shedding at all. It applies product evenly and the bristles are firm enough for my taste as I don&#x27;t like a loose brush head. My only complaint is that after a few months, the metal part that connects to the wooden handle is coming loose. Nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t fix, but the brush could stand to be sturdier.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. I loveee it</li>
    <li> Perfect for its stated use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cheek blush application. I thought it would be cheap quality because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;e.l.f&amp;#34; but quite frankly it&#x27;s just as nice as my expensive make up brush!</li>
    <li> I have just learned to contour &amp; highlight my face. I bought cheap Walmart brushes and they made my face look dirty! I came across this elf brush with very little reviews. I went ahead and bought it anyways. WONDERFUL brush! It came in very fast and it&#x27;s nice and smooth! It contours my cheek bones wonderfully! I will definitely recommend to anybody!! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Not the same brush! I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the brush was cut! The handle is scratched! Dont buy it!!!</li>
