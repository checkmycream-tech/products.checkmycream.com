      <li>I get many compliments from my students about this coconut lotion.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t strong, it is welcomed by those with allergies to perfumes, and those who just like freshness.  </li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean smell and non sticky.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not just full on coconut.</li>
      <li>This is fresh, it does what it says and softens the skin, but the coconut aroma turns heads, or should I say lifts noses.  </li>
      <li>i thought it would smell like delicious coconut lotion, but it smelled really weird.</li>
      <li>Thanks so  much for having it!  </li>
      <li>Some ladies use heavy perfumes, some light perfumes.</li>
      <li>Personally, I find the smell to be a little strong, but my sister loves it.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find Aruba coconut lotion! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Sent to my daughter and worked great for her</li>
    <li> I do not use it, this was a gift. Some ladies use heavy perfumes, some light perfumes. This is fresh, it does what it says and softens the skin, but the coconut aroma turns heads, or should I say lifts noses.  It lasts long after she has departed an area, every person, male or female comments on the freshness and difference. It isn&#x27;t strong, it is welcomed by those with allergies to perfumes, and those who just like freshness.  Try it ladies, You can convince Bath &amp; Body to make this a staple, not seasonal, your friends, and the man in your life will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This smells like tropical coconuts with suntan oil. Every time I use it I&#x27;m asked what that smell is and I tell them my lotion and they say it smells like the beach.</li>
    <li> I get many compliments from my students about this coconut lotion. Some girls even beg to use it occasionally. The coconut smell stays with you throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Ordered fragrance shown, received another</li>

    <li> Aruba Coconut smells awesome! I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t going to have the coconut smell to it but it did and it also has like another fruity smell to it so it&#x27;s not just full on coconut. I absolutely love it and am very happy with my purchase. ^_^</li>
