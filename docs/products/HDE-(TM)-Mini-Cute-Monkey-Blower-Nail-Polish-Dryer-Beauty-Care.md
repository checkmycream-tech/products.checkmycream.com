      <li>Our teenager loves to do nails and &amp;#34;squeeled&amp;#34; with joy when she figured out what this thing actually did!</li>
      <li>but the batteries dont last to long but for the price its still awesome to own</li>
      <li>This is a super cute lil guy and fun to use.</li>
      <li>So worth the money!</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked because the batteries wouldn&#x27;t fit but after struggling for quite some time to get them in, it worked just fine.</li>

      <li>If you want something powerful</li>

      <li>I bought it thinking I was ordering a nail polish dryer, the item is very cute but it doesn&#x27;t dry the nail polish at all.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t work right out of the package.</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>The blower works pretty good, it&#x27;s what I expected with it running of batteries.  </li>
      <li>Very cute, but not much drying power.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be good enough for a 7yr old.</li>
      <li>But to be honest I purchased it as a novelty item not to to actually dry my nails which I am glad because it would not dry nails.</li>
      <li>The air quality on it is good for little nail&#x27;s....</li>
      <li>Its cute and it works but its pretty pointless because the air can dry your nails just as quick as the cute lil monkey.but nontheless still a cute dealie and convo starter</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ok so Im a 10 year old looking for a cheap nail dryer. I love doing nail art ,but i hate it when I smear my design ( I also just dont like waiting for my coats of polish to dry ). Although this has really helped a lot! I didnt expect much from this, I usually just wait for my nails to be half dry to apply the next coat, so i didnt expect this to completely dry my nails. I use this for drying each coat and then half drying the last layer ( by the time Im done with both hands its dry ). One bad thing though is that it comes in a cheap packaging  it just comes in the box, so mine came with the button broken but I was able to fix it. Another thing is you need to use 100% fresh ( 2 AAA ) batteries for the fan to work well and dry you nails, but this is still very cute when Im doing someones nails.</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly! So sick of waiting for my nails to dry &amp; when you think they are; BAM! A botched nail 😫</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely adorable. The price is great right now. I do wish it was quieter. Also, it does get annoying to always have to press down the banana button to get air. I think It should just be for decor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 11 yr old daughter who loves doing her nails. I was slightly disappointed at just how small it was and how cheaply it is made. Yes the price was cheap but this is more or less a dollar store item. I will keep it as a stocking stuffer and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like it until it breaks which hopefully won&#x27;t be too soon. It also came very poorly packaged in a manilla envelope and a busted box. Overall the monkey is cute enough, but like I said it shouldn&#x27;t be priced over $5.00</li>
    <li> this very cute and works great</li>
    <li> is very simple! no air! Press the button and you have a lot to let out air. simply useless!this product is useless</li>
    <li> Very cute, but not much drying power.  Would help of mouth was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the nail dryer for my girly girl nine year old for Chritmas.  It was quite the hit!  (This with some glitter nail polish and bright colors of course)  The dryer I think is for little fingers that dont require to much air.  Overall it was worth what I paid and my daughter LOVES it.</li>
    <li> This was adorable...  But it only worked for like 3 seconds...</li>
    <li> I bought it for my niece for her 12th birthday. She loves monkeys so absolutely loved it. It is so cute!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 6 year old daughter for christmas, since she loves to do her own nails,and loves monkeys. well it is way smaller than I thought(fit in her stocking) and does not blow enough air to really dry anything. Also its pretty loud while using it. Overall I didnt spend too much on it, and it is way cute. If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> Works about the same as blowing on your nail polish.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is so adorable. It is easy to put in your nail travel kit and only requires 2 AAA batteries. You can dry up to two nails at a time and you activate it by pressing the banana button. I use it to dry designs as I decorate each nail. So worth the money!</li>
    <li> i thought this looked SO cute and bought it despite the low reviews.  there aren&#x27;t many nail dryers out there that are reasonably priced. I thought it would be good enough for a 7yr old. the reviews are LOW for very good reasons. It&#x27;s JUNK!!! she tried it once and it is VERY hard to push the button down to activate the fan...an adult would have much difficulty!!! it ended up getting thrown out. Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!</li>
    <li> i got this hoping it would help but i guess it is really just about the cuteness</li>
    <li> I purchased for a christmas present, shipping took longer than what was stated and didn&#x27;t arrive until after the new year. The child loved the gift. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> this product is okay it takes a lot of pressure for the pressing pad to go down. Itas not like going to the nail salon</li>
    <li> My 8 year old really likes to use this cute little monkey to dry her manicure. She feels like she is at a salon.</li>
    <li> Got it for my gf to use at her salon on her younger nail clients and they all think its adorable</li>
    <li> This little guy is very cute, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t generate enough air to dry anything and would just become something cute to sit around but is never used. I sent it back and was very promptly refunded my money. Very pleasant company to deal with and like I said, a very cute monkey - but not an effective nail dryer in the least for a young girl or anyone for that matter.</li>
    <li> It was deceiving from the picture. It appeared to be bigger than that and it doesn&#x27;t dry your nails nor is it barely big enough to do so and the air that blow out is so light that you can&#x27;t feel it and its to much of an hassle to try and send it back.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t read anywhere its battery operated. But my daughter is in love with monkeys so I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Though the package was crushed on arrival, the gift is for a monkey lover, so it&#x27;s bound to be a hit! I thought that the blower would be larger than the photo, but, it&#x27;ll serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> OMG this monkey dryer is the cutest thing i every saw it was a must have for me. And kid&#x27;s love it i have little sister&#x27;s, and they always want the monkey to dry there nail&#x27;s. Great packing it didn&#x27;t come with battery&#x27;s(AAA) but, that was fine. The air quality on it is good for little nail&#x27;s.... Love It</li>
    <li> This product does not work, its really cute and all but there is ZERO air flow to even attempt to dry your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. A bit noisy. Works and efficient</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife hoping it will dry her nails and it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to blow out a candle but can&#x27;t complain for the price I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work lol</li>
    <li> super fun for my 8 year old at the time.</li>
    <li> The back never stays on and before you use it you have to always adjust the batteries, you have to have really small fingers for it to work</li>
    <li> This product is just ok. The monkey&#x27;s mouth is where the air blows out to dry your fingernails. The power of the air is kind of wimpy. Fun for a little girl though! Also, please be aware that this item ships from overseas so the shipping time is extremely long. I think it took 4 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my best friend and she loved it! Package was beat up but no damage to product inside :)</li>
    <li> Its cute and it works but its pretty pointless because the air can dry your nails just as quick as the cute lil monkey.but nontheless still a cute dealie and convo starter (:</li>
    <li> This monkey dryer was really cute to look at, but the drying part was pretty bad. The batteries went out even though I didn&#x27;t use it. The air doesn&#x27;t shoot right above the nail, which it&#x27;s supposed to be in order to actually dry the nails, so it was very hard to dry my nails and eventually ruin them because I had to do something to make it  blow on my nails. It&#x27;s really cute but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> thought it would be cute for my 8 year old. what a junky peice of plastic. it barely creates a breeze. wave your hand back and forth for better drying.</li>
    <li> The fact that it is not provided with batteries is unfortunate but the product itself is not as nice as on the picture. It is quite big surprisingly and the finishing touches are just pretty bad (painting, etc.); It&#x27;s just a funny gift idea but not very useful or cute I suppose... That&#x27;s my personal opinion of course.</li>
    <li> This was a b-day present for my daughter who is constantly doing her own nails. I thought it would be a good idea so it would dry her nails faster and also, she likes monkeys. The blower takes 2 aaa batteries and it blows a decent amount of air for its size. The little fan is kinda noisy after several uses but overall it is a good little product and works great.</li>
    <li> You have to kind of hold it while it dryies the nails. It&#x27;s not as quick in drying as I expected it to be. But still functional and works ok.</li>
    <li> It is the little fun things that really go over well.  Our teenager loves to do nails and &amp;#34;squeeled&amp;#34; with joy when she figured out what this thing actually did!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great! So cute. Functional. It&#x27;s all that I expected. It&#x27;s more like a toy than a tool, perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s pretty small. It works great though and it has a lot of drying power!</li>
    <li> Tried multiple brands of brand new batteries, Didn&#x27;t work at all.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Well received this for my daughter because we like to paint each others nails and its not worth the money i spent at all. The best batteries still did not make this blow air enough to dry one fingernail. Waste of time.</li>
    <li> Arrives out of box broken. The motor does not work. Also arrived late. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> My wife adores this product. I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t give a fair opinion on if it works or not. I just my love likes it and that&#x27;s all the proof that ill need to give this a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> The product was purchased as a silly gift and brought smiles to the recipient.  It requires batteries to run and does produce blowing air.  It&#x27;s super cute too.  However, you could only dry one nail at a time and you have to press pretty hard in just the right spot to activate the blower.  It was a great silly gift.  Not so sure it would work as an actual nail dryer.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be much bigger, only has room for 2 of my daughter&#x27;s fingers at a time.&lt;br /&gt;She also states it is hard to push after awhile to get the air to blow out.  Might as well just air dry.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using this to help dry her nails.  It is cute and does the job just as explained.</li>
    <li> Truthfully its just more to show off then anything its cute and my wife says it works pretty good but the batteries dont last to long but for the price its still awesome to own</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking I was ordering a nail polish dryer, the item is very cute but it doesn&#x27;t dry the nail polish at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, maybe a little cheap.  But I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot for it.  It works for my daughter.</li>
    <li> While the product is very cute; it has no use whatsoever. The button is ridiculously hard to press while drying fingernails. Also, the drying power is pretty nonexistent and very loud. This would be a nice Secret Santa gift or for a child, otherwise this is not worth your money.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, well packaged, true to photo merchandise. works great and my daughter was able to install batteries and get it to work on her own.</li>
    <li> the button is hard to push to make the air blow out of the monkey&#x27;s mouth.  Very frustrating for my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> was broke when I got it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a nice gift for my neice but it didn&#x27;t work right out of the package.</li>
    <li> i dodnt got it on mail !!! your stealing money! please sent it to me ! give the money back or the monkey</li>
    <li> very cute, my sisters love it.</li>
    <li> Worse purchase ever! It barely blows and it requires too many batteries! Its really stupid! DUMB! and overpriced! I hate it.</li>
    <li> Item came way before I expected it to.  I purchased it because I love to do my nails and also love monkeys so it was perfect...I knew that it probably wouldn&#x27;t work well and I was right. You have to press fairly hard (much more pressure than is comfortable) down on the bananas in order to get the monkey to blow any air.  But to be honest I purchased it as a novelty item not to to actually dry my nails which I am glad because it would not dry nails.</li>
    <li> its super cute and i love it.  i works wonderfully.  too bad it only does one to two fingers at a time</li>
    <li> Have to press really hard for air to come out, other then that it&#x27;s an ok dryer.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s small and very cute. i wish it came with battery. you have to get your own AAA batteries.</li>
    <li> the product does not work. I talked to the owner, but they did not help me fix the problem. The product is really suck</li>
    <li> the article is nice, very cute and can work.... if wasn&#x27;t broken! my dryer came broken in 2 pieces, they should be more carefull and pack them inside a hard carton box, not only an bubble bag wrapping...</li>
    <li> My little sister is 8 and she is ALWAYS painting her nails, sometimes multiple times a day. So, when i got this for her birthday she was so happy she didnt have to sit at the table all bored waiting for her nails to dry. Plus, she loves monkeys which made this a bonus, arrived sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Received the item quite quickly and it is very cute!  The blower works pretty good, it&#x27;s what I expected with it running of batteries.  I think the girls are gonna like it</li>
    <li> love this thing my friends loved it whichi was very happy the package was alittle beaten but i can understand it came from a far place but it worked perfectly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really cute monkey but difficult to work with. You really have to press down hard on the drying plate which causes the monkey to move and you can only dry one nail at a time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute nail dryer but not terribly powerful. It was a bit smaller than I thought it was but the person that received the gift loves it.</li>
    <li> got it for its purpose but now its just for display. button is hard to push down and it does not blow much air. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked because the batteries wouldn&#x27;t fit but after struggling for quite some time to get them in, it worked just fine. It&#x27;s not as big as I&#x27;d hoped; I can only fit two to three nails on it and it has an annoying hum but it isn&#x27;t the worst thing. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> this nail dryer is so cute and portable and very Powerful for a little nail accesorie i just Recieved it today and i Love this Nail Dryer</li>
    <li> It works,Love it&lt;br /&gt;And the grandkids love it and it helps them&lt;br /&gt;keep their nails pretty.I will check back we you again&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again,again,again</li>
    <li> i like it its just that the wind is not as powerful than i thought its not very strong and a little hard to push down i paid about $8.00 i think and i think it should be like $3.00 or $4.00 so ya thats it see ya</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that this wasn&#x27;t very powerful, but all the other blowers got the same complaint except for the really expensive ones.  This one is for a little girl who likes to paint her nails and she loves it.  If you want something powerful this is not the one for you, but if your 10 year old just discovered nail art this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a super cute lil guy and fun to use. I had no trouble pushing down the button so dont listen to those weak fingered peoples comments.</li>
    <li> This came in looking like it was used. It had scratches and hand marks all over. I was expecting it to be brand new but i guess not. However, the shipping was very fast and that was greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> This is super cute so I purchased it for my daughter. But the cuteness is about where the good for this ends. The little pad is hard for her to push down and the air comes out of that little hole as the monkey&#x27;s mouth. There isn&#x27;t hardly enough air coming out to make any impact in actually drying nails. The back cover for the batteries doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well either. I should have just bought a regular, full-sized nail dryer to begin with instead of going cute.</li>
    <li> It is cute.  Little girls may enjoy but doubt will use much.  Kept only because it was too much hassle to return.</li>
    <li> Its really cute, I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet. My only issue was that i assumed it was going to be alot bigger then it really is.</li>
    <li> Sooooo cute love it. Definetly great if you will be doing a little ones nails!!! Will order another one for sure. Lol</li>
    <li> This is the perfect way to keep those little fingers still while the polish is drying cause it amuses them.</li>
    <li> This is more about just show. You have to push down really hard for this to work.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the product I was expecting just this little machine where I could dry my nails easier with it, but then I got this thing and it does dry my nails faster but its really loud and I can only do one nail at a time.</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> She thought it was cute! Works good! Battery operated but only blows air when you have nail in front of it!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a Christmas gift and the box arrived crushed.  The product was much, much smaller than I expected.  The base could only fit one finger at a time to dry, that&#x27;s how small it is.  Two AA batteries and it still was not strong enough to dry one child&#x27;s finger.  My grandaughter liked it because it was cute, but it was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not worth the couple dollars spent. It&#x27;s tiny and barely blows air.</li>
    <li> The air flow is a little weak, it&#x27;s cute. I feel like you have to press really hard for a little air to come out but it&#x27;s fine for drying your nails while you watch TV.</li>
    <li> Arrived and did not work. I total piece of crap- I&#x27;m vry grateful for a fast and easy refund. Based on the size of it I wouldn&#x27;t see it drying 1 nail in less than 30 mins! Save urself the trouble!</li>
