      <li>I am most pleased with this product.</li>

      <li>Loving this brush and how smooth it is making my hair feel.</li>
      <li>Excellent product overall.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These brushes are perfect for people with long hair.</li>
      <li>This is the first boar bristle brush that I&#x27;ve bought, and from what I can tell it is definitely good quality.</li>
      <li>The %100 boar bristles feel great, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was good.</li>
      <li>But for now, this will work just fine.</li>
      <li>, I have fine shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>The brush is light weight and it goes through my long, fine hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, if you are comfortable with just a flattening, then this is the brush for you.</li>
      <li>handle is made of wood and fits my hand comfortably.  </li>
      <li>This brush is super lightweight and easy to handle .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So when I was offered this Natural Boar Bristle Hair Styling Brush from Roccasano Products for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one to try.</li>
      <li>I just wanted a nice brush with genuine soft boar and no nylon that I can afford and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
      <li>After 3 days of brushing I began to clean the brush by picking the hair out and along with my hair came a dozen or so bristles.</li>
      <li>Hair looks better already after 4 days; the errant grays are not boinging out as much.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure</li>
      <li>This is actually true.</li>
      <li>love my new brush!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily my body make up has make me one of those who don’t have to wash my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how different my hair feels after brushing with this!</li>
      <li>I have back injuries and my Dr has requested I not shampoo my own hair as often.</li>
      <li>but it seems to have some sort wood-look &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; on it to enhance the grain with a clear coat on top of that.</li>
      <li>She actually likes brushing her own hair now.</li>
      <li>it is because they are soft or because there are so many on the brush.</li>
      <li>love this and exactly as advertised - cuts thru my thick wavy hair beautifully and i am very tenderheaded and no need to be with this!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quality rich wood grain appearance but without the weight of real wood.</li>
      <li>Right now if you are considering buying this brush, pat yourself on the head,</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>Made hair shiney right away.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever returned something to amazon after being a member since 2009 and buying stuff</li>
      <li>This is not my first boar bristle brush, but my first brush from this company.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to brush my little girls long hair much more easily without all the whining.  </li>
      <li>the brush is nice to look at, but I&#x27;m not positive this is real wood...</li>
      <li>:) Overall decent quality brush.</li>
      <li>The bristles do not go through my fine hair to actually &amp;#34;brush it.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>so it fit nicely in my key mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out</li>
      <li>I have the money to buy the things I really need.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>thought maybe I just had too much hair,</li>
      <li>I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check.</li>
      <li>Responsible packaging.</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush based on the glowing Amazon reviews for my fine, long hair.</li>
      <li>Was soft and gentle on my hair and my 5 year olds!</li>
      <li>High quality material.  </li>
      <li>and I feel like the boar hair is much more gentle than my usual paddle</li>
      <li>I live the boat bristles and how it just glides they my hair while brushing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think Bass brand brushes are better quality made and in the same price range.</li>
      <li>I wear my hair naturally and the bristles are soft on my scalp without pulling out my hair!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and curly and I prefer soft boar over stiff.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The bristle were soft grade like I had hoped.</li>
      <li>so I was surprised at the ease of passing the bristles over my hair</li>
      <li>I have sensitive follicles as well-</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a high quality hair care product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality boar bristle brush. A friend of mine recommended this brush so I ordered it. It arrived quickly, the packaging looked great and even more the brush is amazing! No other brush has ever given me such volume. My boyfriend is even stealing it for his hair! Excellent product overall.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I only used it for 2 nights. And my hair got a lot healthier</li>
    <li> The brush is of great quality; so for that I would give it five stars. Unfortunately, the brush does not actually brush my hair. The bristles do not go through my fine hair to actually &amp;#34;brush it.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t know I it is because they are soft or because there are so many on the brush. Nevertheless, if you are comfortable with just a flattening, then this is the brush for you. It is of great quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush based on the glowing Amazon reviews for my fine, long hair. After 3 days of brushing I began to clean the brush by picking the hair out and along with my hair came a dozen or so bristles. The brush looks nice and I am liking the effect of boar bristles but I don&#x27;t know how long this brush will last.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations. I had never used a boar brush. I feel I have been missing out. Was soft and gentle on my hair and my 5 year olds! She actually likes brushing her own hair now. Made hair shiney right away. So impressed. The quality and construction is sturdy. Thank you for a great product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Great quality hair brush!  I&#x27;m able to brush my little girls long hair much more easily without all the whining.  Tough tangles I need to brush over tangled area multiple times to get hair smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t tear through the hair which is a plus.  I was very impressed with how well the brush distributes the oil from scalp to the ends of the hair for healthier hair.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush. Has a bit of a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;smell to it. Not a big deal though. Great customer communication!</li>
    <li> brush has a slight smell to it some of bristle are falling out</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a good Boar Bristle Brush. I have back injuries and my Dr has requested I not shampoo my own hair as often. Luckily my body make up has make me one of those who don’t have to wash my hair. My  daughter is the opposite. Her hair gets oily in just a couple days. I&#x27;ve been trying to teach her to brush the natural oils down to the tips so the excessive shampooing doesn’t ruin her tips while trying to keep oil at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are perfect for people with long hair. Natural oil builds up as the base of the hair stands while not getting enough at the ends. I used to think my mother was silly when she would say you should brush your hair 100 strokes every night. This is actually true. But with a boar hair brush. The plastic brushes aren&#x27;t made for brushing for hair health. They are great for in shower conditioning or if your blow drying, but if you&#x27;re trying to keep your hair healthy and silky looking this is the type your supposed to buy.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER :  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it. What I will try to do is tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens and what my opinion is as well as I can. In order to try to make easier for you to decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have the money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller or this company who makes this product and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I haven&#x27;t been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review. I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check. But I will do my best to describe this item and my thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> The hairbrush arrived a day earlier than anticipated which is always a plus . The packaging was minimal so it fit nicely in my key mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out I must say, this hairbrush is unlike any other I&#x27;ve used. I have very long hair and brushing my hair is always a chore so I was surprised at the ease of passing the bristles over my hair( it almost feels as if it&#x27;s only penetrating the surface - not too worry though, it&#x27;s working!) I have sensitive follicles as well- it always hurts to brush my hair and this brush is so gentle on my poor scalp . No tugging sensation at the roots AT ALL as I brush through the length!! My hair is in a fragile state right now as I&#x27;ve recently had a baby and I feel like the boar hair is much more gentle than my usual paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice too. Quality rich wood grain appearance but without the weight of real wood. This brush is super lightweight and easy to handle .&lt;br /&gt;I love my new brush!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. Works well and my hair is starting to show improvement from damage of previous perms and coloring.</li>
    <li> great nice looking brush</li>
    <li> Good brush for fine hair ! My hair look much better !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
    <li> This is the first boar bristle brush that I&#x27;ve bought, and from what I can tell it is definitely good quality. The handle feels sturdy and the brush didn&#x27;t smell like anything out of the box. It&#x27;s amazing how different my hair feels after brushing with this! It immediately smoothes my hair out. For me, I wish the bristles were longer (or maybe I should&#x27;ve bought a mixed bristle brush) because my hair is incredibly thick and it does not always go down to my roots. For people with thinner hair, this will be great. But for now, this will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Just got the brush about 5 days ago and it&#x27;s a high-quality product. Very sturdy construction, and it helps tame my wavy hair really well.  The %100 boar bristles feel great, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  Will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this product before now. I wear my hair naturally and the bristles are soft on my scalp without pulling out my hair! I am most pleased with this product. Not only is it high quality but I am now interested in other products in your line!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice brush! My hair is shinier and softer after a couple of days of use. My husband loves it as well</li>
    <li> love this and exactly as advertised - cuts thru my thick wavy hair beautifully and i am very tenderheaded and no need to be with this!&lt;br /&gt;thanks so very much - i love it!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies - run and run quick to order this - you will not be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> I have some pretty thick hair and my kids do as well. So when I was offered this Natural Boar Bristle Hair Styling Brush from Roccasano Products for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one to try. It didn&#x27;t work to well on my daughters super thick, long, curly hair. It did however work alright on my hair, which is thick but I have a brazillian blowout so it&#x27;s smoothed out. I also tried it on the boys hair and it worked great. I definitely recommend this hair brush for anyone with no more than medium thick hair, not crazy super thick hair...lol.  I also like the feel of the boar bristles on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I should have known after realizing that all these &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; were paid for by giving away free brushes or offering discounts that maybe this brush might not be all that awesome, but I still had some hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT ANYMORE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second I got it in the mail I took it out and tried to use it. Full disclosure, I have fine shoulder length hair. And these bristles weren&#x27;t getting anywhere near my scalp or even past the first layer of my hair. Basically it felt like someone was rubbing my hair with their palm. There is no way this would help me in any way. Even forcing it at the bottom of my hair to work as an actual brush failed to even untangle or even attempt one tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I just had too much hair, even though other (paid) reviews with crazy long hair said it worked &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; so I went over to my husband who has maybe an inch and a half long hair? Maybe two? Guy hair. First thing he said to me is, &amp;#34;I think my hair is too thick for this brush&amp;#34;. He does not have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only person this brush worked for is my cat and even then it&#x27;s just because he likes that it feels like someone patting him. Honestly my fingers work better than this brush. This is the first time I have ever returned something to amazon after being a member since 2009 and buying stuff constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Right now if you are considering buying this brush, pat yourself on the head, do you need more in your brush? If the answer to that is yes, then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY / DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH / DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HAVING TO RETURN IT</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Just as advertised.  Haven&#x27;t noticed if it has done anything special for my hair yet, but it does feel like it&#x27;s going to cause less breakage than my old brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush several days testing it out.  I live the boat bristles and how it just glides they my hair while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is made of wood and fits my hand comfortably.  I was scared I would get static in my hair but so far this has not happened.  Very impressed this brush.  High quality material.  I received a discount to write my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I had given up on natural bristle brushes after using Mason Pearson brushes for show dogs. The MP natural bristle brushes are outrageously expensive! Frankly, I was skeptical of this brush that cost about 5% of what an MP brush costs. I was pleasantly surprised. The brush is light weight and it goes through my long, fine hair beautifully. I love that it doesn&#x27;t cause static electricity. I don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up because I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, but even the $200+ MP natural bristle brushes don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> very nice quality, arrived quickly.  I have very long hair of average thickness, so with this brush it takes more time to complete brushing, I have to put my hair in sections to brush.  That being said, there appears to be less breakage from my plastic brush.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. As promised. Nice wood handle. All boar bristles, no nylon. Works on my thick, long, very wavy, brown and gray hair. Hair looks better already after 4 days; the errant grays are not boinging out as much. Great price! Responsible packaging. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this brush a couple days ago in good condition. This is not my first boar bristle brush, but my first brush from this company. The bristle were soft grade like I had hoped. My hair is fine and curly and I prefer soft boar over stiff. The brush is lightweight but not balanced (meaning the bristle end is heavier and would tire your wrists after long hours in a salon. So, not salon quality which I wasn&#x27;t expecting anyway.) the brush is nice to look at, but I&#x27;m not positive this is real wood...I think it&#x27;s wood but it seems to have some sort wood-look &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; on it to enhance the grain with a clear coat on top of that. The size is perfect. Not huge paddle type, but not pocket size. Just right. The logo on the handle is smaller than pictured and may wear off after some use because it&#x27;s not indented in the wood. All these things are minor, and I didn&#x27;t expect Mason Pearson status. I just wanted a nice brush with genuine soft boar and no nylon that I can afford and that&#x27;s what I got. :) Overall decent quality brush. I think Bass brand brushes are better quality made and in the same price range.</li>
    <li> Loving this brush and how smooth it is making my hair feel. The brush has great construction from the handle to the bristles - very comfortable to use.  Shipping was fast and packaging was good. Definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a high quality hair care product!</li>
