      <li>so I am always excited when it show up.</li>

      <li>Spend the extra money and get the real deal!</li>
      <li>my old Maxiumum Hold.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years - when it was no longer available locally, I searched and found it on Amazon for much less than I had previously paid for it.  </li>

<li> Does not work, makes hair weighted down, even tiny amount.</li>

<li> The product is a runny mess.</li>
<li> they all give flakes and makes your hair feels like you got some messy grease on.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for past 10 yrs</li>
<li> A small amount of this product works well to add volume to your hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to beat them for efficiency and speed of delivery.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed when the GW Vivid Color Maxiumum Hold was discontinued.</li>
<li> This is a fake</li>
<li> A difficult line to find</li>
<li> Product seems fake or a knock-off.  </li>

    <li> Not the same as original.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is just right for my needs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this product in stores and shopping the internet is the only way to go.  I&#x27;ve used Amazon.com for lots of products, including the laptop I&#x27;m now using.  It&#x27;s hard to beat them for efficiency and speed of delivery.  Plus, they follow-up.  I found the Graham Webb hair gel in my youngest daughter&#x27;s drawer and used it when I ran out of the stuff I was using.  I loved it!  Decided to buy it, found a site on Amazon, ordered two tubes, and received them within 10 days.  The price was right, the service was great, and I&#x27;ll do it again.</li>

    <li> Quality item. Fair price</li>
    <li> Love this gel.  Have used it for 8+ years.  Not heavy or sticky, just right.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel in my hair for years!  Not sticky or stiff, but provides a soft hold.  As I have wavy, fine hair it tends to get a bit on the frizzy side - this gel keeps the frizzies at bay while leaving my hair soft.</li>
    <li> While the Graham Webb Brit Style Exothermic Medium Hold Gel is a wonderful product, the price turned out to be &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34;. The price from this seller was considerably less so I took a chance. This &amp;#34;reduced price&amp;#34; product was quite clearly a knock-off and of significantly inferior quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a tube we had purchased before and next to the one we received here, the labeling is similar but not the same. The product is a runny mess. Spend the extra money and get the real deal!</li>
    <li> A small amount of this product works well to add volume to your hair.  I have fine hair and find this gives me body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for past 10 yrs and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I&#x27;ve tried Joico, Paul Mitchel... they all give flakes and makes your hair feels like you got some messy grease on.</li>
    <li> Not even close to the real product. This is a fake</li>
    <li> Did not pack the product very well.  The top of the container was split open so I was only able to use one.  I wish I could have used both product containers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bummed that Graham Webb was bought out by a company who then discontinued all my favorite lines.  I switched to Brit Style after Making Waves was discontinued.  Now the entire line is, including the Silk Protein leave in conditioner.  I love this stuff so much for my coarse curly hair that I snapped up all I could find online. I&#x27;m down to my last couple of bottles and am dreading buying bottle after bottle of junk trying to find what works.</li>
    <li> It is the best product for my hair.  Being somewhat thin, it gives me light body .&lt;br /&gt;I used to shampoo daily, I do great by shampooing every two to three days.&lt;br /&gt;I have  recommended your product to many friends.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery of an excellent product.  Totally satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when the GW Vivid Color Maxiumum Hold was discontinued. I was expecting to be disappointed by the Medium Hold Brit Syle GW product. But luckily it worked just as well as my old Maxiumum Hold. I use it to keep my hair style in good shape after sleeping on it for 2-3 nights. So I would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> what can I say?  I didn&#x27;t use it but ordered for a friend. It was just what he wanted at the right price so all okay.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years - when it was no longer available locally, I searched and found it on Amazon for much less than I had previously paid for it.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Miss my &amp;#34;Making Waves&amp;#34; - why take it off the market???</li>
    <li> It works well, even though it is not the same as the disconinued product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it as well, but I do.</li>
    <li> Received product the color of the bottle was a lighter blue than the one I purchased at my local salon.  The printing on the bottle was very faded and almost illegible.  It looks like a counterfeit/knock-off/etc.  The gel itself is not as good as my salon product with the same name.  Won&#x27;t order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. A difficult line to find so I am always excited when it show up. Have been using Graham Webb products for years and will continue...as long as Amazon has it listed. Ordered several Gels and all arrived ahead of time.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I USE IT ALL OF THE TIME.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> My hair respones to this product.  I am glad that I was able to find it. It is a great product.</li>
