    <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more of these metallic tattoos to rock over the summer!</li>
    <li> Best on the market, by far!!! Tribe Tats last days longer than any other brand. I get, literally, hundreds of compliments when I wear them. Everyone always wants to know where I got them! :) Look so amazing against tanned skin.</li>
    <li> Great tattoo jewelry so easy to put on and comes off easily with rubbing alcohol! I brought these out to Cali for a bachelorette party and everyone wanted to wear them! We had so much fun with the temporary tat jewelry!</li>
    <li> I love the tribe tats. Not only do they look cute, but they also last a long time. The second I tried it all my coworkers and friends want to try them also. I recommend and will continue to recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love all the collections!</li>
    <li> Going on vacation with my teenage nieces and bought these for the girls - can&#x27;t wait to give it to them.  I bought two sets because their Mom and I hope they will let us have a couple, super cute idea.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Love how beautiful they look. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Best Metallic Tats out there.  I love layering them up with jewelry or quick accessorizing an outfit with one before heading out.  They really pop off your skin and look beautiful with a tan.  They are great conversation starters!  I&#x27;ve gotten stopped by tons of people so far admiring them and asking where they can purchase.  Stoked to sport them at my upcoming Kenny Chesney Tailgate/Concert!  Great product!</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me by my clothing stylist... little did I know they would become my (and my daughter&#x27;s) favorite accessory of the summer!  Our absolute favorites are the rings, bracelets, and anklets.... the fact that these come in rose gold.... that they are all perforated (no tearing without scissors around!)... and that they stay on twice as long (or longer) than any we&#x27;ve found before.  I know a few places have come out with knock-offs of these but get these.... they are the original/BEST and you will not regret it!  Thank you TribeTats!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite collections by TribeTats. These designs are so chic for day to day casual wear and fun events. I bought them from my daughter and I cant help myself to steal them from her and wear them myself !! They&#x27;re easy to put on, long-lasting and easy to take off when you&#x27;re ready ! Absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> These tribetats are so amazing! They look great on every skin tone and body! All of my friends wanted these tats when I was wearing them:) these styles are so unique and you can&#x27;t get them from anywhere else!</li>
    <li> I love this collection... a bunch of bracelets, some &amp;#34;anywheres&amp;#34;, and some necklaces and rings. Good variety!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality, goes on easy, stays on well! I also like the fact that the sheets are perforated and easy to detach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much fun to play around with!</li>
    <li> Tribe Tats are awesome!! The collection is versatile, fun and an awesome addition to my jewelry wearing. I love how bright they appear on my skin and last for a few days. Package also arrived on time and in great condition. My favorite one was the feathers...looked great with a spring flowery maxi dress for date night :-)</li>
    <li> I have ordered these and absolutely fell in love. I wear them with almost everything and no matter where I am, even in church, people stop me to look at them and ask me questions. I love bragging on you guys!</li>
    <li> Best Metallic tats out there definitely worth a shot!</li>
    <li> Received my pack of TribeTats and immediately fell in love. The Belize collection has a lot of great designs and I couldn&#x27;t ask for an easier to apply product. Love that the sheets are perforated so I can easily select which design(s) I want to use...no cutting necessary! I also really like the variety of colors in each pack. Wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the rose gold (copper) designs but they&#x27;re actually my favorite! As for longevity, they do mostly stay on for the full 4-6 days. Some wear off a little quicker depending on location of application (anything on my hands/fingers lasted maybe 2 days at best, but the ones on my feet, ankles, midsection, back and arms all lasted about 5-6 days). Definitely recommend these to anyone on the fence about getting metallic temporary tattoos. Much better than some of the other options on the market today! Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other collections.</li>
    <li> So much fun to wear at any event!! Great for a bachelorette party!</li>
    <li> Overall very happy with my Catalina Collection. They looked great and were easy to use. I used them at a festival so the perforated sheets made it all the easier with no scissors around. Most of the tattoos stayed on through the weekend but a few partially rubbed off. This could be due to the sun, sweat and sunscreen that goes along with the festivities. I also bought some cheap metallic tattoos from Walmart and used those for the weekend and those ones were much lower quality and rubbed off pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> these tattoos are amazing, they are high quality, and they look fantastic on anyone. I recommend them to everyone. they&#x27;re not expensive which is a big win for everyone who buys them. also , they last a while which is amazing !!</li>
    <li> The tattoos are all very beautiful and versatile. My one issue is that, at least on me, they wore off in only three days.</li>
    <li> Love these! they&#x27;re great on skin and look so pretty in the summer, great for accesorizing or if you just want to try something new. They come in lots of variety and options so you can wear them however you want!</li>
    <li> Wore them for my spring break trip to florida and they stayed on for days! I loved them so much! Would definitely buy them again!!</li>
    <li> TribeTats are definitely the best! The designs are awesome and they last way longer than other jewelry tattoos.</li>
    <li> I love this collection!  I used them all weekend long at a music festival and the perforated edges were so easy  to apply while on the go.  The rose gold is perfect on my skin tone.  I wear them on a regular basis for day time casual and to dress up my evening outfits. They are the greatest and most fun accessory!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loooovvveee these tattoos !! When I got them I tried one on right away (on my hand) and it stayed on nicely for over five days! Can&#x27;t wait for my upcoming summer festival to put them on ;)</li>
    <li> I love love love these tattoos! Great and awesome designs, they stay on for a long time. They are also so easy to take apart for individual use. I definitely will be ordering more and more of these soon!</li>
    <li> Great metallic temporary tattoos! Perfect for casual night out and easy to remove. Lots of options as well!</li>
    <li> These are the best. So easy to tear apart and put on in seconds. Love them!!!!</li>
    <li> I honestly love this collection. Bracelats, necklaces and all! I always get compliments on them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great for everyday use in a hot weather like dominican republic,  also i do henna art and i mix them to make it look more chic and fashion.  This tatto are amazing for arms, hands, legs and every where.  Love it</li>
    <li> Best flash tattoos out there! The tattoos didnt smudge or come off too easy and looked stunning. Everyone kept complementing my flash tattoos and had asked where i got them. Plus i got 30% off! These are my favorite and ill continue to always order them.</li>
    <li> They are very durable and the pack comes with a variety of tattoos. Very easy to put on! Very fashionable love them!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite collection! All of their tattoos are great, but this one is so versatile! The feathers especially are so delicate and beautiful. I&#x27;m consistently surprised with how long they last too! I wear them for all types of occasions and recommend them to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality of TribeTats!  They look beautiful on.  They go on easy, and stay on for over a week.  Prompt shipping!  Beautiful packaging!</li>
    <li> Love these tribetats! It&#x27;s a fun way to spice up an outfit and the glitter/shine stays bright for a few days. They apply really easily and stay on the skin for 2-3 days. The perforated marks on the sheets makes it really easily to separate the tattoo you want from the rest of the sheet.</li>
    <li> This collection is my favorite of all. They last so much longer than other tattoo jewelry I have tried and are always the hit of the party! They look amazing on all skin tones and are so fun to wear during the day at the beach, or for a fun night out! I will certainly be buying these again for summer time festivities</li>
