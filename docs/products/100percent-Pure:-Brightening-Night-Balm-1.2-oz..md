### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but once it is on your skin it sort of melts on it, which feels great.</li>
      <li>great products and this doesnt miss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good as a hand moisturizer, moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>This balm is nicely moisturizing without causing any breakouts, and it reduces the intensity of acne scars on the face.  </li>
      <li>and it does give you a nice glow.</li>
      <li>Overall, a very good product!</li>
      <li>plus i love love how it smells.</li>
      <li>so refreshing, sort of citrus</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I was using this product for about a month and even though most of the reviews said it was greasy, I thought it would melt</li>
      <li>Fix is to mix serum to make it more spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This means that it doesn&#x27;t smooth on as well as I would have hoped, but other than that I am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>It does some brightening effects (Have a rosesea but fading overall).&lt;br /&gt;- SLS/Paraben etc free</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and this cream was really good about evening out my complexion and getting rid of a few freckles, as well as delivering on it&#x27;s promise to brighten.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i love 100% pure.</li>
      <li>The company does a pretty good job making products as natural as they can be.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all good as a facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love going to bed with soft, silky smooth skin.</li>
      <li>The lemon fragrance is pleasant, not too intense, although it&#x27;s definitely fruity, not like the department store skin cream fragrances I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>and my face felt so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>BUT, despite that, the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying from amazon because buying it off of the product&#x27;s original website will cost you about ten dollars more.</li>
      <li>never buy organic\natural skincare unless you want to use it right away.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin with very large pores that are easily clogged.  </li>
      <li>Yay for 100% Pure brand!  </li>
      <li>My pores becomes clogged with large blackheads in 24 hours!  </li>
      <li>which is a huge thing for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>this goes on a bit &amp;#34;gritty feeling&amp;#34; at first</li>
      <li>After using it for more than 3 days, I started to have white heads on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>I also saw good results when I put it on my decolletage after a little too much sun, and also on the backs of my hands and my elbows every once in a while.  </li>
      <li>You have a new loyal customer.</li>
      <li>It really revives dull skin and makes me feel super healthy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, one of the reasonable brightening balm without any harmful chemicals on the market.</li>
      <li>This night balm does work really well.</li>
      <li>It feels very GRAINY when you try to rub it on our skin, but the grainy powders disappear after you rub them on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Texture is greasy/waxy side, takes really some time to absorb, therefore use it at night as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference - been using it for a month</li>
      <li>* you really have to massage over to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really care for this product</li>
      <li>I love this company, but it&#x27;s a little greasy for my skin type.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m only 20 and don&#x27;t have really uneven skin, I did want brighter more radiant skin, and I think that this will do that over time--naturally!</li>
      <li>When first opening, it looked dried out with a major crack through the product within the jar (not the jar itself), however it was moist and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Texture:  This balm looks like a candle wax when you first open the jar.  </li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for a week, but I really like it!</li>
      <li>This product made my skin a little bit brighter and smooth but even after I almost finished the jar it did not make my post-acne marks disappear.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s natural ingredients, over the time of use, it gets crumbled up a bit.</li>
      <li>I always love 100% pure products, but this one is a HUGE disappointment for me!  </li>
      <li>My skin is dry and looks \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; (for lack of a better word), and has a rough texture due to the eczema.  </li>
      <li>my skin is soft in the morning and there is a definite glow to it.</li>
      <li>I use it every night and often in the mornings as well, and I will probably use up the jar in a few weeks, making it about three months worth.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this, I was surprised at the texture of the balm - it had sort of a thick, paste-like consistency.  </li>
      <li>Whether it brightens my complexion, diminishes dark spots and evens out my skin remains to be seen, but I have high hopes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve developed very dry skin this winter, especially on my cheeks and jaw line.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This balm is nicely moisturizing without causing any breakouts, and it reduces the intensity of acne scars on the face.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it daily.</li>
    <li> surprisingly thick. did not think i can spread it out on my face. but once it is on your skin it sort of melts on it, which feels great. plus i love love how it smells. so refreshing, sort of citrus like so you have to be a fan of the smell i guess. i have applied it less than a week so will update about brightening effects later but it is definitely moisturizing. my skin is soft in the morning and there is a definite glow to it. the only con i can think of is that it sits on the skin for a while so try and apply it like  30 mins before bed or you will rub it all over your pillow before it gets the chance to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;i love 100% pure. great products and this doesnt miss.</li>
    <li> It caused breakouts for me. Not good for oily/combination skin. Its&#x27;s too greasy.  It&#x27;s good as a hand moisturizer, moisturizes well. It&#x27;s not at all good as a facial moisturizer. It worked well for my friend who had  dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin a little bit brighter and smooth but even after I almost finished the jar it did not make my post-acne marks disappear.</li>
    <li> this goes on a bit &amp;#34;gritty feeling&amp;#34; at first and I thought i might not like it. That is until I woke up in the morning and my face felt so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I was using this product for about a month and even though most of the reviews said it was greasy, I thought it would melt in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin but rather coat, thus IDK how this would actually brighten the skin. In my case, I saw no brightening or skin improvements. Mediocre.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> The company does a pretty good job making products as natural as they can be.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does some brightening effects (Have a rosesea but fading overall).&lt;br /&gt;- SLS/Paraben etc free&lt;br /&gt;- It does soften skin with some effort required ** you really have to massage over to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Since it&#x27;s natural ingredients, over the time of use, it gets crumbled up a bit. Since it&#x27;s night time use, I don&#x27;t mind to stir and spreading over my face by massaging.  Fix is to mix serum to make it more spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;- The reason above, cumbersome for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture is greasy/waxy side, takes really some time to absorb, therefore use it at night as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, truly it serves the purpose of \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect although takes some time. I checked before and after pics between 4 weeks period, saw some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect \\&quot;brown spot\\&quot; to disappear. For that you&#x27;d need a spot treatment to target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, one of the reasonable brightening balm without any harmful chemicals on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I use very little in the summertime - product is heavy on oil - at least for me. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference - been using it for a month but I will continue using it to see if I notice any changes once I finish the container.</li>
    <li> This night balm does work really well. I wake up each time with glowing skin and no imperfections (redness, pores, etc). However, my 1 complaint is it&#x27;s really greasy feeling on the skin. I love going to bed with soft, silky smooth skin. This makes my skin feel oily, which in turn makes me afraid to get it on my pillow. BUT, despite that, the results are worth it. It really revives dull skin and makes me feel super healthy!</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I was surprised at the texture of the balm - it had sort of a thick, paste-like consistency.  This means that it doesn&#x27;t smooth on as well as I would have hoped, but other than that I am very happy with it.  I use it every night and often in the mornings as well, and I will probably use up the jar in a few weeks, making it about three months worth.  I have fair skin and this cream was really good about evening out my complexion and getting rid of a few freckles, as well as delivering on it&#x27;s promise to brighten.  I also saw good results when I put it on my decolletage after a little too much sun, and also on the backs of my hands and my elbows every once in a while.  The lemon fragrance is pleasant, not too intense, although it&#x27;s definitely fruity, not like the department store skin cream fragrances I&#x27;m used to.  Overall, a very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve developed very dry skin this winter, especially on my cheeks and jaw line.  I&#x27;ve been using this balm nightly and have found it to work wonderfully as a deep moisturizer.  When first opening, it looked dried out with a major crack through the product within the jar (not the jar itself), however it was moist and easy to apply.  A little head&#x27;s up: a little goes a long way (take a bit with the tip of your finger, put it on your palm and rub palms together to warm it up, apply with little pats around your face until evenly distributed and rub in a bit).  My face does look a bit shiny when going to bed, but there&#x27;s no tightness when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the brightening aspect for I don&#x27;t personally notice a difference, but I have received several compliments lately about the clarity of my skin.</li>
    <li> This worked for me in softening my skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin and sometimes breakout in terrible bouts of eczema.  I took allergy tests and found out that I am allergic to chemical preservatives often found in \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; products.  My skin is dry and looks \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; (for lack of a better word), and has a rough texture due to the eczema.  I have tried so many products, organic, medicated, expensive etc etc, and this made a noticeable difference in one day. It did not irritate my skin at all... NO STING WHATSOEVER... which is a huge thing for someone with sensitive skin. Whether it brightens my complexion, diminishes dark spots and evens out my skin remains to be seen, but I have high hopes.  Yay for 100% Pure brand!  You have a new loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I can not really judge the cream performance, because when I opened it, it was solid.&lt;br /&gt;Very upset, given the fact that I bought it a while ago(august 2012) and shelved, since I was going throught my other skincare. Now I can&#x27;t replace or return it (too late by amazon policies).&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned - never buy organic\natural skincare unless you want to use it right away.&lt;br /&gt;What a bummer...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I was seeking for a night cream that did a little bit lightening, but all I got from this product is a greasy face. As it sounds, this is a balm not a cream or lotion. The texture looks like a thick sugar scrub. When applied on face, it feels like you have a butter on your skin so I didn&#x27;t really care for this product</li>
    <li> I love this company, but it&#x27;s a little greasy for my skin type. I still recommend these products, just watch out for your skin type.</li>
    <li> I agree with previous reviewers about the oily and greasiness of this balm. I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin with very large pores that are easily clogged.  I have some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  I was hoping this balm would help lighten up the pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture:  This balm looks like a candle wax when you first open the jar.  It&#x27;s very hard to scoop out the content with your fingers.  It feels very GRAINY when you try to rub it on our skin, but the grainy powders disappear after you rub them on your skin.  I suspect these grainy powders might be kojic acid or extracts that have been added to the greasy butter, and they don&#x27;t dissolve in the greasy butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin reaction: I didn&#x27;t experience any bad burning or itching sensation with this balm.  However, this balm is extremely greasy!  It feels like you are rubbing solid butter on your face.  My pores becomes clogged with large blackheads in 24 hours!  After using it for more than 3 days, I started to have white heads on my cheeks.  This balm is definitely NOT for Acne prone skin!  I stopped using this balm due to the breakouts I have from this balm.  I cannot comment on the skin brightening effect since I did not use it long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this balm as a body moisturizer.  I always love 100% pure products, but this one is a HUGE disappointment for me!  I&#x27;m only giving it 1 star and will not repurchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I really like it! It moisturizes well and it does give you a nice glow. Although I&#x27;m only 20 and don&#x27;t have really uneven skin, I did want brighter more radiant skin, and I think that this will do that over time--naturally! I recommend buying from amazon because buying it off of the product&#x27;s original website will cost you about ten dollars more.</li>
