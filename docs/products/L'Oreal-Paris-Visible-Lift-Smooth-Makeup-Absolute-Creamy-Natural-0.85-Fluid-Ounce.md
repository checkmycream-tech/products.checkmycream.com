      <li>Great Makeup!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>This makeup is awesome, easy to apply and nature looking.</li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly and in perfect condition at a price as qood or better than from a pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>It feels lightweight on but provides amazing coverage.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say this foundation gives great medium to full coverage and blurs out my imperfections.</li>
      <li>just love the brush on the makeup bottle.</li>
      <li>I love the make up, but the applicator has a lot to be desired.  </li>
      <li>It was everything I ordered and more.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
      <li>but any more than that</li>
      <li>click too many</li>
      <li>Creamy Natural was a perfect match for my light to medium olive skin.</li>
      <li>I love it :)</li>
      <li>I love the brush on this for applying, not</li>
      <li>i love that the brush always feels moist</li>
      <li>Great price and super fast delivery!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved this foundation at first.  </li>
      <li>The foundation seems to sit on top of my skin and never soaks in so that it would come off easily onto clothing etc.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
      <li>It is great coverage and really goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly and when it does come out, it is usually more than I need.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply &amp; goes on evenly.</li>
      <li>uses is so easy</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I always think I look nice, but this is the first time in ages that anyone has commented on my skin.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and as advertised!</li>
      <li>I love the make up texture, its light, I use it sparingly for a quick make up look.  </li>
      <li>The make up is very good, can be used minimally, gives a dewey look.</li>
      <li>They all do this except maybe the ivories but those are WAY too light for me (I tried and looked like a Geisha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I hope they make this is a regular bottled foundation because it is great coverage</li>
      <li>I definitely got a great deal at this price and</li>
      <li>The image looks light.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly, nicely packaged, at a very affordable price.  </li>
      <li>THat might be the makeup itself or be might be the fault of the packaging which really is a cool idea but doesn&#x27;t work out so well in practice.  </li>
      <li>I saw the brush and thought it was cool.</li>
      <li>This particular formula is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, not drying, great coverage - hides little spider veins but no pancake look.</li>
      <li>The brush is somewhat handy but not necessary for application.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in the meantime I have gone back to Covergirl Advanced Radiance which I don&#x27;t absolutely love (matte finish not dewy or glowing)</li>
      <li>but I set it with loose powder and it gives that nice luminous, dewy finish.</li>
      <li>It has an amazing dewy finish and instantly makes your skin look vibrant and youthful.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>but it is lightweight and has a no makeup feel and, as an added bonus, when I look at myself in natural light I am not horrified.  </li>
      <li>Creamy Natural sounds like a light color.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>no mess no washing hands when used and looks fantastic</li>
      <li>the brush it comes with one the top is really soft and smooth, just be careful when you have to twist the part below the brush to make the cover up come out.</li>
      <li>The coverage was wonderful---camouflaged my wrinkles and large pores.</li>
      <li>but I have large pores and acne scars</li>
      <li>way too  much comes out.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smoothness of the application.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; with this product, but it is very creamy.</li>
      <li>I really recommended ...</li>
      <li>But, while it covers, it doesn&#x27;t do much else for my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the swivel brush with make up dispenser doesn&#x27;t work well, too much product comes out and it leaves brush marks</li>
      <li>like so much this product and was delivery faster</li>
      <li>The makeup is okay as far as color and coverage, but the brush is not really that useful.  </li>
      <li>This was too much coverage for my 47 year-old combination skin.  </li>
      <li>How much does it cost?</li>
      <li>click so much makeup squirts out.  </li>
      <li>The attached brush is very soft on my face and the color is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>many other liquid make ups have that.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you get the right color, because it&#x27;s thick stuff.  </li>
      <li>this product is never dry or &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; it was exactly what i ordered and arrived quickly with standard shippng</li>
      <li>The brush is nice but it is very hard to control how much product comes out of the tube&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately I did a test-run before I actually went out into public with this gunk on.</li>
      <li>As usual Loreal always discontinues the makeup I love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like to seeped into every little fine line and crevice on my face.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t need much and don&#x27;t think the brush alone will do all the blending for you--use a regular makeup sponge.  </li>
      <li>I am 36 years old and it gave me a glow I never had before.  </li>
      <li>When I looked at myself in natural sunlight</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore which is a sad thing because this is the only foundation that works best on my skin aside from any other makeup foundations that I have tried.</li>
      <li>I do like to use a large brush to dust overall with dry natural color powder</li>
      <li>I was lucky to find these last few bottles.</li>
      <li>The concept is cool but the actual foundation sucks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the make up, but the applicator has a lot to be desired.  It doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly and when it does come out, it is usually more than I need.  It could just be the person behind the screw...lol. But the make up is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. It is so easy to apply &amp; goes on evenly. Unfortunately I can no longer find it in stores so I think it has been discontinued in this style with the brush built in.  The stores only seem to carry the pump which I do not prefer.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for a damaged bottle.  This was the shade I was having problems finding locally.  It arrived very quickly, nicely packaged, at a very affordable price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I understand that L&#x27;Oreal is discontinuing this item, which is a shame. The coverage was wonderful---camouflaged my wrinkles and large pores. Loved not having to use my fingers to apply it, and the brush did a great job filling in the pores.</li>
    <li> I really like the smoothness of the application.  The attached brush is very soft on my face and the color is exactly what I wanted.  I definitely got a great deal at this price and I am going to order again within the next few days.</li>
    <li> The makeup is okay as far as color and coverage, but the brush is not really that useful.  I still have to use a sponge or my fingers to blend it well.  I&#x27;m not sure how much waste of the product there will be with the twist up dispensing either.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; with this product, but it is very creamy.</li>
    <li> Great Makeup!&lt;br /&gt;I just love the brush on the makeup bottle. Easy to use. Great price and super fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore which is a sad thing because this is the only foundation that works best on my skin aside from any other makeup foundations that I have tried. I am only 23 but I have large pores and acne scars and I have to say this foundation gives great medium to full coverage and blurs out my imperfections. It is a bit oily but I set it with loose powder and it gives that nice luminous, dewy finish. Thank goodness it&#x27;s only 6 dollars here on amazon. Great price!</li>
    <li> was so happy to find this used for quite some time can not get here in my area uses is so easy no mess no washing hands when used and looks fantastic</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this foundation at first.  There is a lot to like about it. It has an amazing dewy finish and instantly makes your skin look vibrant and youthful.  I am 36 years old and it gave me a glow I never had before.  It feels lightweight on but provides amazing coverage.  Creamy Natural was a perfect match for my light to medium olive skin. I also tried one shade up Natural Buff 166 and it was way to dark and orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The color seems to oxidize and look orangey.  They all do this except maybe the ivories but those are WAY too light for me (I tried and looked like a Geisha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The foundation seems to sit on top of my skin and never soaks in so that it would come off easily onto clothing etc.  This problem lasted for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  When I looked at myself in natural sunlight my makeup was extremely noticeable.  THat might be the makeup itself or be might be the fault of the packaging which really is a cool idea but doesn&#x27;t work out so well in practice.  The brush is nice but it is very hard to control how much product comes out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the meantime I have gone back to Covergirl Advanced Radiance which I don&#x27;t absolutely love (matte finish not dewy or glowing) but it is lightweight and has a no makeup feel and, as an added bonus, when I look at myself in natural light I am not horrified.  But, while it covers, it doesn&#x27;t do much else for my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on the search for the perfect foundation for me and will let you all know if I ever find it ;)</li>
    <li> Perfect shade! I love it :) the brush it comes with one the top is really soft and smooth, just be careful when you have to twist the part below the brush to make the cover up come out. It only takes 2 to 3 twists to get it to come out but any more than that and you&#x27;ll have it squirting all over your hands. Would definitely buy again&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This product was indicate for me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I like so much this product and was delivery faster&lt;br /&gt;For sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
    <li> I got this when I purchased the Visible Lift Concealer. I saw the brush and thought it was cool. The concept is cool but the actual foundation sucks. Although it did match perfectly with my skin tone (which is a bonus) it made my forehead look all wrinkly (note without the foundation this has never been a problem). It&#x27;s like to seeped into every little fine line and crevice on my face. Fortunately I did a test-run before I actually went out into public with this gunk on.</li>
    <li> This makeup is awesome, easy to apply and nature looking. Makes you feel and look younger. I really recommended ...</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly and in perfect condition at a price as qood or better than from a pharmacy.  It was everything I ordered and more.</li>
    <li> Make sure you get the right color, because it&#x27;s thick stuff.  You won&#x27;t need much and don&#x27;t think the brush alone will do all the blending for you--use a regular makeup sponge.  This was too much coverage for my 47 year-old combination skin.  It emphasized my pores and lines.</li>
    <li> i love that the brush always feels moist this product is never dry or &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; it was exactly what i ordered and arrived quickly with standard shippng</li>
    <li> great coverage but the swivel brush with make up dispenser doesn&#x27;t work well, too much product comes out and it leaves brush marks, I hope they make this is a regular bottled foundation because it is great coverage and my skin looks great with it on</li>
    <li> Great product from L&#x27;oreal</li>
    <li> Discontinued makeup. I was lucky to find these last few bottles. Great makeup. As usual Loreal always discontinues the makeup I love.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Not greasy, not drying, great coverage - hides little spider veins but no pancake look. Wears well throughout the day and does not clog pores or give you blemishes. I do like to use a large brush to dust overall with dry natural color powder, I do not like any shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  This particular formula is my favorite.  It is creamy, has great coverage, makes my skin look hydrated and firmer.  It also comes in great shades.  Some of the other formulas are too sheer for mature skin and don&#x27;t cover those pesky age spots as well. The brush is somewhat handy but not necessary for application.  I hope L&#x27;Oreal comes up with a comparable substitute or maybe not discontinue it at all!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here. This foundation is age defying, and creamy without being too shiny.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this for applying, not many other liquid make ups have that.  However, I do notice, that it says about 10 clicks.. well I count and on the 10th ish click so much makeup squirts out.  I&#x27;ve tried slowly clicking until I see the tip of the makeup so that it&#x27;s not one click too many, doesn&#x27;t work.. I never see it come up until, on that final click.. wala.. way too  much comes out.  It&#x27;s just a bit of a waste.</li>
    <li> Creamy Natural sounds like a light color. The image looks light. But the actual color was darker. I wanted to return it and buy a lighter shade but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me because it contains a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; or some such nonsense. Boo!</li>
    <li> I love the make up texture, its light, I use it sparingly for a quick make up look.  The brush appliction I dont like, I just find it makes things a bit messy so I use my fingers anyway.  The make up is very good, can be used minimally, gives a dewey look.</li>
    <li> Well, to start with I&#x27;m over 50. My skin is fairly good for my age, but I am very fair and without makeup I look blotchy, so I wear foundation every day. I always think I look nice, but this is the first time in ages that anyone has commented on my skin. Since using visible lift, I&#x27;ve had lots of comments, curiosity (i.e. \\&quot;what have you done, your skin looks so flawless - where did you get it? How much does it cost? Exactly what shade are you using, etc.\\&quot;)The improvement is so dramatic that it&#x27;s almost embarrassing. Want to be suddenly beautiful? Then this might be for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great coverage and really goes on smooth. It covers your wrinkles, dark spots and dark circles. Great product! Best make-up I have tried in a while.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and as advertised! Thanks!</li>
