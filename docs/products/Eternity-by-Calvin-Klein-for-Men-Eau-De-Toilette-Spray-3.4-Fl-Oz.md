<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this cologne. I get positive comments from other people who like the smell of the cologne</li>
    <li> This is the cologne I use.  I couldn&#x27;t beat this price especially without the sales tax.  I got what I purchased and it came quickly and I would purchase it from Amazon.com and this dealer again.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the scent and I enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical ordering online, but the scent is exactly the same as the ones I purchased full retail from the malls.  Lasts just as long too.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> smells great but i think that this might be watered down.</li>
    <li> This Calvin Klein is good smelling but it&#x27;s like Axe body spray. It wears off in an hour.</li>
    <li> Service excelent!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, you may not want to buy this product. I spray it on my wrists and the scent is gone within 1 hour. It doesn&#x27;t last very long because it is light and meant to mix with your oily skin. My skin is dry and it doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note (pun intended), it does smell great.</li>
    <li> I was never a cologne wearer and the thought of wearing cologne had never crossed my mind until I started traveling to Europe for business. In the past I was turned off by the overpowering scent of a lot of colognes but ETERNITY by Calvin Klein is very subtle, clean, and pleasant smelling. I wear it everyday now and it does improve my usual odor come 4 o&#x27;clock on a workday.</li>
    <li> less than 50% of normal retail you cant be that for quality cologne</li>
    <li> My husband likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and the scent is long-lasting.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I swear, I think I could smell this cologne from across a crowded room.  Not because it is too strong, but because it is by FAR the best &#x27;man&#x27; scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  And, after shopping for hours for the perfect cologne for my ex, I feel like I KNOW that this is the best cologne out there (although Kenneth Cole&#x27;s line is also very good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a chick.  I&#x27;m obsessed with Eternity.  This is a scent that will transcend other trendy colognes, because it smells completely classic, classy, and screams \\&quot;I&#x27;m sexy!\\&quot; Need I say more?</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my husband will wear. He uses one spray at his throat and then gets dressed and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I like to think that it&#x27;s a treat just for me to smell it when I get close. Sometimes I get headaches from perfumed products, but never from the Eternity. The scent is masculine and very pleasing.</li>
    <li> Greta smell and even better price, very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I at first thought it smelled a bit like lysol,  but if you don&#x27;t think about it that way it&#x27;s not to bad.  It comes in a big enough bottle so I don&#x27;t have much of a choice but like it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this calogne! It&#x27;s musky and actually is perfect for almost any age. I will definitly buy again once Im out. Stick with the oldies; this has been around since the 80s.</li>
    <li> Products was exactly what I ordered. It was shipped promptly and I received it quickly</li>
    <li> I ordered the items and used only standard shipping but despite that the order arrived superfast and in prime, new condition!</li>
    <li> Eternity is a very male, very unobtrusive cologne. It always fits, never overpowers, and lasts fairly long. Even the residual fragrance after a long day is still very nice. I like it, but like with any fragrance, it is highly subjective.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband... N he loved it</li>
    <li> My father was extremely excited to receive such a classy gift, he lives in New York and has seen the prices of Eternity for men and never bought it. I would never have been able to afford this item except through ASG Perfumes thank you i am pleased.</li>
    <li> nice classic scent for a young man</li>
    <li> It is a fake product. The odor doesn&#x27;t last for long. The cheapness of the product tells the low quality. The real one cost from $40. I hate fake stuffs.</li>
    <li> Classy smell, masculine. It just doesn&#x27;t last long. This is my weakest cologne. I have Versace, Dolce &amp; G, Code Black, etc. and the others I can still smell after 3 or 4 days of the shirt sitting in my laundry basket. This one fades by mid-day. Good thing is that it&#x27;s cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness! I bought this for my dad as part of his Christmas present. The price is a steal, since if you go to the mall; you will spend at least $50 some bucks for this size</li>
    <li> I ordered this coz I had this in the past and obviously like the perfume very much. But the damn doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s gotten stuck and I dunno what to do now!!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  However, the scent is gone before I get out the door!  Well, anyway it does a good job while I&#x27;m in the house.....</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this classic scent on my hubby!  This scent never goes out of style. Delicious! Love it!</li>
    <li> Well, I received the product about 2 weeks ago. At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure that I liked the scent, coming from the Hollister So Cal cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though that it grew on me and so far, I LOVE IT! It smells so clean and citrus like, and just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seventeen. I like nice smelling colognes. Even though this smells nice, the Hollister cologne still smells better. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Eternity is a rather weak perfume. It&#x27;s barely perceptible after application and its effects wear out in a few hours. It is not suitable for a full day use - especially if you have long working hours and a high-stress work enviroment. I am going back to Chrome Azzaro</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents for the hubby!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this selection.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipment</li>
    <li> I bought this by mistake for myself and a friend&#x27;s husband.  When I received it, I decided to keep it instead of returning it because it smelled so great.  It has a very clean smell to it, and the smell lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this EDT since 3 years. I love to wear this EDT when I&#x27;m going out for Malls or to my friend&#x27;s home. I think, this EDT will not be suitable for Parties because of its mild fragrance. I recommend this to every man.</li>
    <li> Great product and would buy again if needed.This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
    <li> As the title states, this was a bad purchase. To clarify again, this review is NOT about the CK Eternity for Men cologne in general, but this purchase in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the cologne at the store before I decided to buy it on Amazon. I liked it a lot, it has a fresh and invigorating aroma, and stayed for a long time after I tried it *at the store*. Indeed, I should say that CK Eternity for men is still among my top choices for a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular purchase from Amazon, however, disappointed massively. Although the aroma is still fresh and invigorating, it doesn&#x27;t even last more than an hour! I suspect that&#x27;s because this particular item has been in Amazon&#x27;s stock for several years.</li>
    <li> With the price of cologne and perfume as high as it is, this by far is the best value.  This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and he uses it everyday.  There is no other place to shop for this cologne than here.</li>
    <li> Again,. no need for a Macy&#x27;s purchase and a much better price too.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery!!  Will always order from here!!  Congrats!  Will also order MY Eternity from you all.  All I wear.  And now my son wears the men&#x27;s as well.  So, thanks!</li>
    <li> original, the best perfume</li>
    <li> well I bought this because I saw good rating, but its not as good as the rating says.&lt;br /&gt;The scent could be more elegant.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Eternity for Men. Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real one.  Please don&#x27;t buy this product.  It&#x27;s a waste of your money.</li>
    <li> My son was thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne merely after reading a few reviews on amazon... may be i should have tried it on personally before i bought it. The cologne actually smell nice. Its got a nice fresh smell to it. The only thing is since it was made in the 80&#x27;s all the older people have used it and kind of smells old. If you are in your 20&#x27;s i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, may be if in you late 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The smell remains for 4-6 hrs depends on various factor, fades away nice smelling too</li>
    <li> I was hooked on to this after receiving Eternity as a gift from my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;Best perfume you will ever buy</li>
    <li> This cologne last quite a while depite some other reviews. Not too powerful. I like the smell. Recomended.</li>
    <li> Calvin Klein Eternity is absolutely the best for men. Easily the sexiest fragrance for the ladies. Consider it a warning guys.</li>
    <li> Great winter cologne.  I alternate it with Obsession.  I always recommend using the same deodorant as the cologne you are wearing so nothing clashes.  Usually the gift sets are the best way to purchase these products.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband as a Christmas present, made him happy (it&#x27;s one of his favorite) and didn&#x27;t hurt the family budget! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Great Price for something I purchase for my husband every year for the holidays! The gold box deals can be really great.</li>
    <li> I JUST RECEIVED THIS COLOGNE TODAY AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT SMELLS AWSOME!!! DON&#x27;T HESITATE TO BUY IT!!! YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> im personally not impressed by the fragrence, however its possible it just doesnt suit me so ill just deduct a star.. ill deduct another star for how quickly the fragrance vanishes, doesnt seem to hold for more than 2 hours..&lt;br /&gt;compare that to my acqua di gio which holds for much longer..&lt;br /&gt;overall an average product.. not good..</li>
    <li> First, the good .. the smell lasts, its not too strong as to assault your nose, and it sort of blossoms with time. Definitely value for money. However, given that the brand is CK , I probably expected better. Its not as amazing. My personal pick for the summer would be Kenneth Cole - Reaction.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I LOVE this perfume; truly amazing. Delivery was great and item is excellent. Will definitely purchase again and again from amazon. Great price too!!!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of Eternity for men. I also love the fact that I can purchase it online through Amazon for a must lower price than any where else.</li>
    <li> Great price! Delivered fast. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about buying cologne online, but couldn&#x27;t make myself fork over $50 for a smaller sized bottle. This has been, surprisingly, pretty great! I will admit it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as if I bought it in the store, but that could be for tons of other reasons so I&#x27;m not ready to blame it on the product just yet. The color, smell and bottle were the same as if it was bought from the store.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the money that I saved. I&#x27;ve paid over twice as much for the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, the product didn&#x27;t taste at all.</li>
    <li> I like this kind of smell. it is simple and sweet-scented which is very suitable for gentleman. haha, it is really a good choice to take it on your date</li>
    <li> love eternity....goes well with my body chemistry</li>
    <li> I relied on the previous reviewers when i bought this product. But i wasn&#x27;t that happy with the smell. I guess we all have different taste.I would definitely try it in store before buying....my 2 cents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good smells great the price is not bad at all I totally recommend it they will love it</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time for my husband he smells so good when he uses it.  I bought this for Christmas for him.</li>
    <li> This pure fragrance will never go out of style. It&#x27;s clean, crisp scent will stay with your man all day long.&lt;br /&gt;A must for his collection.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my all time favorite colonges. Has a clean, fresh, non-overpowering scent. Great for everyday use. Lady&#x27;s seem to love it&#x27;s understated, yet definetly manly fragrance</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Got what was advertised!&lt;br /&gt;I love this cologne!&lt;br /&gt;Nice price,nicer smell!</li>
    <li> i love it but when i use it  not same orginal in my country&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will buy another from another site or from my country</li>
    <li> I think Eternity no is original, no long mor that half hour that reason is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;No good.Sorry&lt;br /&gt;Esteban Orellana</li>
    <li> Guys This is the goos Stuff , no fake or water down here .Man this stuff is GOLD !!</li>
    <li> Eternity will always be the #1 CK frag in my opinion... the longevity goes is great, lasts an &amp;#34;eternity&amp;#34; and will always leave you smelling fresh like you just got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> We bought this cologne as a gift. My boyfriend loves this cologne. It&#x27;s the only kind that he uses. Everytime we go to his mom&#x27;s house, she always smells it and says she loves it, so we got her some. Now this is her favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> im so happy with this product i bought it for my boyfriend for valentines day and it arrived very early, i love this smell which works out great because it happens to be his favorite colonge. 5 stars hands down</li>
    <li> eternity is a great fragrance, many years ago did not use it, knew that his scent was delicious but did not remember much. the most important thing is that it is a perfume of good fixation and endures</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, he uses this and only this.  I love the scent too, so whenever he runs low I would purchase him another cologne.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume ordered from Amazon and it was delivered quite well in time at my place in New York.&lt;br /&gt;However,as I was true to be worried, the product was watered down.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this perfume before (bought from a store) and the fragrance stays for close to 5 hours. But this one, from Amazon, does&#x27;nt stay for more than 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;Strange but true.&lt;br /&gt;The Product is FAKE or WATERED DOWN.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful.</li>
    <li> The sent is good. It presents itself sweet aroma with a small bite. Not as rugged as Polo, neither is it as long lasting. If you have an occasion that calls for a couple of hours it works good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne so I bought it for my boyfriend and we both win :) You can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere!</li>
    <li> This scent is my husbands favorite. It&#x27;s not over powering and strong like some colognes are. It is right in between and lasts all day. I had seen a smaller bottle on no more rack and went to amazon to price compare. Amazon had it for much cheaper and a bigger bottle. This is a secret christmas gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I bought it from amazon as it was cheaper compared to any other place and thought it must be original. But when I receive it, it looks original but when you spray, smell vanishes in few minut</li>
    <li> This stuff is a favorite standby of mine. Girls like it and it mixes well with your own body scent. It is a great cologne for a change of pace, because it has an old school style to it - yet still luxurious and mysterious. You can do a light spray for daily wear or a heavier spray for a date. Girls will recognize the scent, but never guess what it is because it mixes so well with your own body scent. It&#x27;s a great game I always play with Eternity. It only gets 4 stars because the scent is not seductive. You smell great, but ladies aren&#x27;t instantly turned on by the scent alone.</li>
    <li> Its what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I tried this fragrance because of the positive reviews and low price.  It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s gotten more use as a car and house deodorizer when compared to others.  For this reason, it&#x27;s been relegated to the back of my cologne shelf.  The sprayer is cheap and a bit akward to use because of it&#x27;s square design.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for a friend on his birthday from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;timely delivery. product as expected :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful and very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband Loves the Smell and so do I as it is our favorite Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all</li>
    <li> Great Price fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this in the past and loved it,&lt;br /&gt;Just couldn&#x27;t pass up the price.&lt;br /&gt;Then got it in 2 days with free shipping, what a deal.</li>
    <li> I found that I enjoyed the scent of Eternity. The scent is very strong in the first few hours, though. I was wearing Eternity in school and the student I sat next to began to cough, even though I used only one spray. I also found the longevity of the scent to be brief.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne on me. It smells good and I get compliments all the time with it. Only cologne I have bought for the last 10 years.</li>
    <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re like me and just looking for a good cologne, Eternity is great. It works for teenagers a whole lot ages 13-19. I&#x27;ve been using it, and I&#x27;m not single anymore. It&#x27;s a great smell for teenagers and has its advantages as well as being pretty cheap. If you don&#x27;t like this, then try Chrome by Azzari, which is another one for the same aged teens that will have the ladies smelling you like there is no tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I always use this fragrance is very pleasant in the morning. Best of all is that women love the smell.</li>
    <li> Calvin Klein Eternity is masculine but not overpowering. Basically this fragrance is great for everyday use and my wife likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
    <li> My husband has always liked this scent and with the price I paid here I couldn&#x27;t pass it up .  A lot of reviews said it was fake . It&#x27;s the real thing .</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product. it has a very fresh scent, for me it feels more formal than just casual day to day or date use. It&#x27;s great for going to work. For 3.4 ounces, this product has very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Eternity by Calvin Klein since the 90s.  It is not overpowering.  Old girlfriends and wife always love this cologne.  Amazon&#x27;s price is even lower than the Outlet.</li>
    <li> Love it...been using for years...was just getting replacement for the one I finished...I would recommend. I do get a lot of complements..</li>
    <li> This was the best price I found for the 3.4 oz bottle on the internet.  It was a present for my brother and he has used this for the last 6 years.  $35 for 3.4 oz is a very good price.  Recommend you get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years! It smells awesome!! Plus, this is a great buy for the price! When compared to the cost in most retail stores this is quite a bargain. Also, it came nicely packaged to avoid breakage.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> the cologne arrived even earlier than i was original told. It smells just as good as i always remembered it and at a great price. I will be buying it again as soon as i run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it smells wonderful..this is by far my favorite cologne that he wears!!!!!  I&#x27;ll for sure buy it again...</li>
    <li> It a very great perfume for men loved the way it smells and my husband gets alot of comments on this product</li>
    <li> The scent is wonerful stay for hours i get this for my father in law is perfect gift get this perfeum</li>
    <li> This perfume smells good, but its effect lasts only for 3-4 hours even after having 14 sprays all over the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those guys who want to finish the bottle in 10-15 uses ;)</li>
    <li> I really did not like it, it is nice Smille for an older men but not for me I am 35 years old and this smells like an older 50+ men</li>
    <li> I was nervous about purchasing cologne from Amazon, but I was pleased with the transaction.  The price was great and my father enjoyed his gift.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have had this cologne and when someone says &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34; that works for me!</li>
    <li> I rarely use this (wife likes the scent), I have a bottle that is many years old that I was able to compare and see if these bigger bottles are diluted.  I was glad to find out they are not at least anymore than my original bottle from years ago.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Excellent smell. Good price. The ladies seem to love it too, which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> It would seem that there are certain people who are really attracted to this smell, on me at least.  I&#x27;ve gotten pretty strong comments about how intoxicating it is, from women.  I really like the smell too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, and what I received was exacrtly what I expected from it. The scent is always the same.</li>
    <li> This product was well packaged,  prompt delivery.  price is excellent when the same product can be  found in the shops for much more...  one to definitely recommen. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to those who like light fragrances. It doesn&#x27;t last longer though but good one to try. .</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell for very long like the one purchased at Macy&#x27;s at 3 times the price but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I have worn this a few times. It smells very good. The price was very good. this is a timeless classic.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product after reading all the reviews, I think this is the real product (not a knock off), scent stays all day, even if it were a knock off a great price, half the price of Macys. Hint: don&#x27;t apply to clothing apply to skin. Amazon shipping is great was shipped in 3 hours (Unbelievable).</li>
    <li> I have used Eternity for men for more than two decades and have purchased it many times over the years.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy here because some of the reviews claimed that the amazon.com version was watered down or doctored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I went ahead and purchased here and all turned out fine.  It&#x27;s the same great product from Calvin Klein and it smells exactly as it should.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat for this large size of the eau de toilette spray.  So I recommend that you ignore the critics.</li>
    <li> MENS ETERNITY DONT MISS OUT ON A GREAT DEAL IF YOU HAVE EVER USED THIS YOU WIIL NOT BE SORRY</li>
    <li> Smells as great at Eternity for women.  I use Eternity for women and i love the scent and this one compliments it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice fragrance for men.  I bought this for my husband.  I use to gag on some mens cologne he put on but this one is really nice and smooth.  Not too strong but very pleasant.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and the product was better than expected. Will do business again soon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a clean, fresh, sexy scent. When my husband doesn&#x27;t wear it, I do. It&#x27;s scrumptious.</li>
    <li> For the price quoted in amazon, Eternity by Calvin Klein is real value for money.  Infact the price was a lot lesser than \\&quot;perfumania\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was also delivered a day before the promised date.</li>
    <li> the sprayer popped out after 3 sprays.  which id completely BS, must be why they sold it cheaper.  I think it was a absolute knowing rip off......  Kate</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years. This is the real thing and smells great all day. Nothing Beats Eternity For Men. Still a Classic Favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase for the price. Nothin&#x27; too fancy, but it definitely gets the job done. Would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My husband love it. It&#x27;s excellent for a gift! Gentleman will be very pleased with this product! Super!</li>
    <li> The scent is a little more &#x27;perfumey&#x27; than the musky deep manly scents I usually like my husband to wear.  I buy it because he likes it, but I prefer something more earthy like Drakkar.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money. It smells excellent, I&#x27;ve been complimented on it many times, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My budget has gotten tighter, so I&#x27;ve gone back to using my standard cologne; but Eternity smells incredible. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Mmmm...you smell good.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s what the old lady said when I sprayed this here toilet water. I just bought a big ol&#x27; stick to fight em&#x27; off. I can&#x27;t...control...the...fingernails...from...scratching...my...back...This is awesome cologne. Good price, showed up quickly, not a knock off or smells expired/old.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne. It has a very nice, high class smell. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great Perfume. I usually wear Pollo but this time I decided to change. This stays on nicely for the whole day. Delivery and price was super. I would do it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only cologne he wears.  This was a good price and it came in a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Its not too strong and gives the right amount of scent of Masculinity. Pure Classic Scent. I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> My friend like the scent of this because its scents is good and mild.it last for a long time when use.</li>
    <li> i ordered two perfumes but both are fake . just a water not perfume waste of money ,,I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for a long time.  A bunch of reviews on here claim this product is fake.  I completely disagree.  It smells exactly the same as the one you purchase from Macy&#x27;s or any other ridiculously overpriced store.  It smells good, chicks dig it and it&#x27;s relatively cheap from this supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A+</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my brother.  However, it doesn&#x27;t smell authentic according to him.  You can get this in tjmax and the price is cheaper there sometime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a better cologne for awhile now and somebody suggested Eternity for Men.  Well I can safely say I&#x27;m very pleased that they did because this is not overpowering and it gives a clean \\&quot;manly floral\\&quot; kind of smell instead of making you smell like a logger or an over-trained cook.</li>
    <li> This is my second Favorite scent only to Versace Pour Homme.  I enjoy multiple scents for different days of the week.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling spays I have ever used. When you initially spray it, it smells a bit like gin, which I love. After a few seconds the gin smell goes away and it becomes more of a darker smell with hints of citrus. At the end of the day, it smells a bit like the sprays you would buy for a night out. I&#x27;m no connoisseur, and those of you who are are probably cringing at my descriptions, but I love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for somewhere to purchase this but it always seemed way too expensive. This was the best deal I found. Its legit!! Should last me a while!!</li>
    <li> As other negative reviews, do not buy it</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loved it. It has a great smell, not too strong, and I received the order in a really short time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I collect fragrances and I&#x27;m going back to this amazon order. This was the first cologne I purchased and having smelled a lot more I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. This smells just like any other cologne that&#x27;s under $40-$50 smells like. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the chicks dig it. I wear it all the time but it seems to wear of after a couple of hours. Marketing ploy?</li>
    <li> Makes my husband smell heavenly.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Smell goes away after 5 minutes, seems a little sketchy... I assume there is something wrong with it... Probably a reason it was such a good price...</li>
    <li> At first it smelled too strong. But I grew to love it. Too many good memories with this product to not like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Men&#x27;s cologne ever. I always get compliments when Im wearing this cologne. Definitely gets the ladies&#x27; attention. I would categorize this as an old school sophisticated scent. It&#x27;s definitely not a cheesy cheap scent and not like that garbage Axe smell. It&#x27;s pretty strong and long lasting as well, and for the price, it cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I have had this cologne given to me as a gift a few times and it always starts out smelling very nice, but the scent does not last very long. That is the only negative I can think about for this product.</li>
    <li> Obviously, if this is real, it isn&#x27;t 2014 or 13 because I know what those smell like and its a bit different. Also it doesn&#x27;t even last 2 hours! Which is awful! And it isn&#x27;t even that strong to begin with! But, I have gotten complement s while wearing it. (I&#x27;m 17) its not my favorite but its alright. Others seem to like it and it isn&#x27;t that bad for the price.</li>
    <li> good buy, satisfied with the purchase, smooth scent that stays long :)</li>
    <li> Eternity to me is the best smelling classic men&#x27;s Cologne have that crisp flower smell not to strong just right very light nobody want to choke.Very refreshing shower smell enlightened your smell sense I recommended everybody to purchase</li>
    <li> Very good clean refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Hey - you&#x27;ve probably done it before, thought you were getting something good for a low price..I know I have and found out later it was a fake!  Not Here!!!  The real deal with an excellent low price.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awful, smells odd compared to the Eternity cologne that I&#x27;ve purchased from department stores and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all seems more like a cheap body spray. Highly disappointed can&#x27;t return this cologne for refund,, spent $27 on a product that is useless.</li>
    <li> Ive had many, many, many colognes in the past, this one is alright... not the best, I won&#x27;t buy again though. There are better smelling colognes out there that are cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for many years. It&#x27;s not the Aqua Digio type, but I&#x27;d definitely use it on an ordinary work day.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to stores (at least when I bought it). It smells great in the bottle, as well as on the men I bought this for. Its not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make you want to run in the other direction when you smell it like some perfumes and colognes do. Sometimes perfumes/colognes can make me feel dizzy and sick...not this one. This one is classic and tasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to men, or to women looking for a nice cologne for her man. It&#x27;s a good present for your significant other, brother, father, or friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brianna Lee Book Reviews</li>
    <li> The dolce and Gabbana  smell like some cheap cologne..</li>
    <li> Great price! Best I&#x27;ve ever seen! My daddy is gonna love it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I bought it from amazon as it was cheaper compared to any other place and thought it must be original. But when I receive it, it looks original but when you spray, smell vanishes in few minutes. I tried to reach the seller to take back, but they will not take it back. I love this perfume, but dont buy it from here. No wonder why it was cheap.</li>
    <li> On-time and intact. Of course I love the scent, it&#x27;s strong without being tooloud and overpowering-like most Men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
    <li> Tried something new when I bought this based upon lots of really good reviews.  The price was excellent, I just don&#x27;t really like the fragrance (oh well - live and learn).</li>
    <li> A gift for my roommate.  A man loves his cologne, which he only wears to church on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;AL</li>
    <li> Wow !!! I love it. I am using eternity last 3 years. Everyone around me like the smell.  Its awesome  !!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while, my wife likes this a lot. The price for then amount of perfume you get is a real good value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for about a decade and will probably be wearing it for another one.</li>
    <li> Good cologne but poor quality. Don&#x27;t last on me for more than 30 mins. kind of disappointed. Second time am bying it with the hope it was going to get better, but still no change. not really happy with it.</li>
    <li> i just love the scent &amp; get lots of compliments on it even though i don&#x27;t smell it after initially spraying it on. people are always asking what am i wearing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the really deal.  I love Eternity for Men by Calvin Klein.  They got the item to my door very fast.</li>
    <li> It is a product of excellent quality and price was axacto what you buy good expectation the aroma of the product is ideal for my</li>
    <li> Excellent eau de toilette, came with original packing and original fragrance, quick shipment and good packing I will recommend 100 %</li>
    <li> excelent 100% bueno. las mejores marcas del mercado lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados desde caracas venezuela&lt;br /&gt; recomiendo a toda la comunidad del mundo</li>
    <li> i love its smell and i got good deal here on amazon by the way it took little long to deliver but its ok.. i m goin to purchase more in near future and i hope next time they will not be late to deliver it...</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this colone, and I bought it for him for Christmas.  The is a decent buy, and he likes it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and it was a small bottle, because you only need a little amount on you, if you use too much, it is overpowering. I rate it four stars. Never got any compliments for wearing it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, I Recomended... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..  . . . .  .  . . . .  . . . . . .. . . . . . .  ..  .</li>
    <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite, it arrived on time.Thanks.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this kind of perfume for a long time and this one smells cheap and awful! It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I had used this spray many years ago and forgot why I had quit using it.  Smells like a cheap woman&#x27;s perfume and is disgustingly potent and vile.  I might have received a &amp;#34;rotten&amp;#34; supply, but I certainly don&#x27;t intend to use it and wish I had sampled it first.  I buy my next cologne at a store where I can sample the product.  So Bad!</li>
    <li> At about 1/3 of the regular price, I almost felt like I a thief! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfum and its in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my man.</li>
    <li> I like it. I get lots of compliments when wearing it. In my opinion this is Calvins best fragrance. But they are all good.</li>
    <li> Very mild smell,  although good</li>
    <li> My husband loves Eternity and likes to keep one in his car at all times. I got him a larger bottle this time around so he doesn&#x27;t have to replace it as quickly.</li>
    <li> There is a reason it is so cheap... it last for about an hour then its gone...i have worn Eternity for years and it lasts for quite a while.... not this stuff...i did a test on my right and left wrist of my old bottle and the new i just received... the old bottle lasted all day...new bottle faded within the hour...dont buy this product... it is watered down...</li>
    <li> Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CK</li>
    <li> Counterfeit. The color looks like a bit watered down from original. The one at store smells different and lasted long.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this on my friend.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a colleague to try this brand and I absolutely love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Can last throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> very happy with service fast and easy</li>
    <li> Great stuff this spray.  The ladies love it.  I have more confidence when I smell good and that is why I like CK&#x27;s Eternity.</li>
    <li> Smells like a fabrication. Doesn&#x27;t last very long. I wonder if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> I can not say for certain whether the product i received was a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; or not, but I can confirm that the scent lasts throughout a typical day. Spritzed myself (medium to slightly heavy) at 10am and by dinner time there was still a slight tinge of sweetness radiating from my skin. Next step is to attract a cougar.... Grrrrrrrrooooooooowwwwwwwlllllllll</li>
    <li> I was what I expected... Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> It has a nice, subtle scent; not strong or overpowering. It smells clean and stays with you for a good part of a day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fake!!! The scent fades within an hour and I was so disappointed with the poor quality.</li>
    <li> The smell was gone in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Exclente article, fulfilled all specifications, recommended !!! ...</li>
    <li> This is original fragrance, in sealed packaging.  Smells identical to bottle I previously purchased at a national department store chain for $20 more.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve used Eternity for Men for 15+ years.  Very pleasant, and not overpowering.  And the best part....SHE loves it!</li>
    <li> My husband is a big fan of this and he preers to gowith smells he is used to instead of trying something new. The same thing was almsot double the cost at the mall or even walmart- I am so glad we got this, and also got a bottle of cool water.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I love, rich fragrance, would return to buy another one with closed eyes, I think I compare other. excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size for this Price, and I love how my husband smell</li>
    <li> Large bottle for an AMAZING price</li>
    <li> Eternity is one of my favorites&lt;br /&gt;The effect stays throughout the day - a very masculine aroma too&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for days in the office and nights in the bar&lt;br /&gt;Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for Christmas and I am happy to say that it arrived in plenty of time for the holiday.</li>
    <li> una excelente compra y la experiencia fue muy buena, recomiendo la compra mediante la pagina&lt;br /&gt;satisfecho con la adquisici&amp;oacute;n realizada</li>
    <li> Smell don&#x27;t last. Purchased from iPickBeauty.</li>
    <li> Still one of the best cologne on the market</li>
    <li> its fake. No smell and waste of money</li>
    <li> TRUE CLASSIC !!!! FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
    <li> I hate men who douse themselves in cologne, it&#x27;s almost worse than rank body odor, and why I like this cologne. Two or three spritzes after I shave is more than enough to last all day. It&#x27;s strong at first, but after it dries it is pretty subdued. The only people that notice are the ones who get fairly close (like my wife or kids) and they like it. Nice thing about this size and delivery method (spray) is it will easily last me a year or more before I need another one, so that makes it a great value too. I would classify this as a fresh, almost &#x27;citrusy&#x27; scent.</li>
    <li> I tested 50 different scents, and this one is in my top 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is similar to colognes Acqua Di Gio or Armani Code, but unlike them, it is not perfumy or soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is refreshing, but at the same time not too feminine.  It is masculine, but not overly masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not weak, but it is not overpowering either.  Subtlety is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great play-it-safe, please-everybody cologne.  It is the kind of scent that many people would like and there&#x27;s very few people will strongly dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a store and try it.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and packaging was secure.  The product speaks for itself.  The price was fair, shipping easy, and it was cheaper to buy here than to travel out to the store.</li>
    <li> smells good and was shipped really fast than what i expected which is great because its on time for a gift.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant about ordering this from Amazon after reading some reviews that the smell did not last.&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased making sure it was sent from Amazon LLC itself. The new bottle looks exactly the same as my old bottle, and smells exactly the same. Its sometimes hard to smell a sent on yourself after awhile because your nose gets used to it, so I did a smell test. I sprayed one spray onto a piece of paper towel, left it in a room, and the smell remained for at least 24 hours. I also called Amazon before I purchased, and they told me they purchase direct from CK.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> excellent perfume eternity is the best</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Comes in original packing. I bought it as a gift for someone else. Love the smell so much, I am seriously considering to buy one for myself as well. And you can not go wrong with the price here on Amazon. I have compared, it is the best price here and most importantly, you are sure it is original as Amazon does the fulfilment. And if you have prime, don&#x27;t think twice. Highly recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Good.  My girlfriend loves this!</li>
    <li> turns out the big-o ETERNITY does NOT exist eternal, and actually it got a pretty short half-life time span, but price is reasonable anyway</li>
    <li> For some reason it seems like it is not as strong as the other one I bought at Macy&#x27;s - but it gets the job done and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love how it smells on my husband.</li>
    <li> This a classic and a great smell.  It is the best men&#x27;s cologne after Contradiction and Amazon has it at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. This item was so expensive in the department store- I would have never purchased it. I was very happy to find this option.</li>
    <li> For many years I use and used this product. The price was the motivator in this case. Will use this again.</li>
    <li> I gifted this perfume to my brother and he loved it smell.&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice perfume in good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I would recommend it to other buyers.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, one of my top three. The abosolute best in the cooler months or in a eighty degree or less environment.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne, and is a classic for a reason. It&#x27;s got a fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, but lasts a long time. It is also a nice masculine scent, not flowery.</li>
    <li> Eternity is one of my favorite classic colognes combine that with an unbeatable price and you have yourself a winner!</li>
    <li> My wife is happy I have finally bought and use something she likes. I highly recommend this product for any guy.</li>
    <li> The best by Calvin Klein. its really a very good price for what you get. And its not available on stores anymore</li>
    <li> Love this cologne so much I just bought my teenage son this as his first cologne. Told him he will be a hit with the ladies!!</li>
    <li> Smells great when you spray it on but fades away really quickly. I like when I use a cologne for a while that my jacket starts to smell like it a bit at all times and that simply never happened :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Good price&lt;br /&gt;*Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Scent doesnt last</li>
    <li> I was a gift for my son, he supposedly loves it! I know nothing about it, apparantely it is his favorite.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I needed.  Excellent</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I thought the eternity 3.4 ounce bottle was a great price and not fake. I got my bottle about ten minutes ago and tried it on. The smell was terrible and only stayed on my arm for about 5 minutes before leaving. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. TAKE THE EASY WAY GO TO A MACYS OR AN ULTA AND BUY IT THERE. Yes it will be a little more costly, but at least its the real thing.</li>
    <li> It smells ok, but no attraction factor. It does not last long, the smell is gone within an hour. For the price there are much better perfumes.</li>
    <li> Very much like the scent of the product. Feels good after a shave or moisturizing. The smell is not over-bearing</li>
    <li> As presented- Thanks!</li>
    <li> i could tell this item was counterfeit before even opening it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> like the smell, good always</li>
    <li> It is just a waste of money I usually don&#x27;t spend my money on cheap stuff because I&#x27;m not rich but this time I was also trapped... It&#x27;s fake and absolutely not recommended... One star because it looks absolutely the same package :)</li>
    <li> hola todo bien dfgdf ddf dfyerty dfhdget dfdfd dfy jyjtd dfg thh ghff drghh hghg rgfgf hff rrgrtf trt rf fg fg  fgfrrg rtfd</li>
    <li> Eternity always  a winner!  Love the fragrance, fresh, clean smelling, for every day use, not over powering scent. Packaging was a little damaged but overall ok</li>
    <li> is perfect for a Christmas present. its smell is spectacular. my husband loved and of course me, too. i love it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like store brand</li>
    <li> Ir combine perfectly with my personality</li>
    <li> Did not seem as fragrant as what I&#x27;ve bought before</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and my dad liked it.</li>
    <li> It has a very &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; scent to it. Almost like the soap I use in the shower. Not that it is a bad thing! As I don&#x27;t use generic bar soap. So this compliments my smell after showering instead of clashing with it! It also goes well with my deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;The smell does seem to fade fairly quickly (Within an hour or two), but I only use 2 or 3 little sprays. (I bought this in a local store not on Amazon, so this is definitely NOT counterfeit)&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the spicy clean smell it has. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad considering I was meaning to by &amp;#34;Encounter&amp;#34; and ended up buying &amp;#34;Eternity&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t read the box, I just grabbed the blueish gray one. Same color as Encounter. But I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
    <li> An original product from a reliable seller!</li>
    <li> BEWARE! Totally fake. Looks like Calvin Klein Box &amp; Bottle but has no actual cologne fragrance.  Also purchased Calvin Klein Aqua &amp; Summer from Amazon.  These are also fake. All three have the same non-cologne weak smell. BEWARE!  This is a 0 Star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately got a refund on all 3 bottles with no hassle from Amazon. That, I am thankful for.</li>
    <li> My favor, cologne good price</li>
    <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
    <li> I have been using Calvin Klein&#x27;s Eternity for Men since it appeared back in 1989.  I had previously used Calvin and Obsession for Men from CK, but I found a certain distinctive appeal to the clean, fresh scent of Eternity that is never overpowering or intrusive.  What I especially like about it is its staying power...many colognes or EDTs lose their \\&quot;charm\\&quot; later in the day after application.  Of course, the aroma of Eternity weakens in strength on the body from its initial spray, but even its mellowed state is recognizable.  Fragrance \\&quot;layering\\&quot; using Eternity&#x27;s Body Moisturizer and Body Powder adds to the experience.  There&#x27;s something to be said about finding a fragrance that works with one&#x27;s body chemistry, and I know that Eternity is the one for me.  The \\&quot;greens, crisp jasmine, sage, and basil\\&quot; notes do make a difference, and that is why it continues to be a top CK seller even now in the highly competitive and crowded fragrance market.</li>
    <li> Original cologne, not an imitation, excellent price saved at least $10.00&lt;br /&gt;off retail price! Delivered on time. My Dad loved the gift for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. I love it. The price is very good an the shipping for free. Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it only takes a little. I have been told I smell good by strangers several times.</li>
    <li> I love eternity and always have (that&#x27;s a little joke).  I was so disappointed when I opened the package and sprayed.  I almost choked on the weird alcohol smell.  Everything about the package seemed normal, but the color of the liquid was far more yellow, and the smell was atrocious.  On the plus side, the smell didn&#x27;t last long.  Even better, Amazon made the refund easy.</li>
    <li> Like the title says, I really don&#x27;t understand why this product has such a high rating. I also see it on websites all the time raving about its popularity. I thought &amp;#34;what the heck i&#x27;ll trust the internet&amp;#34;. Now I&#x27;m not going to lie, it smells very pleasant. It has a unique citrus smell without much fake chemical smell. The problem is you can hardly smell it without your nose being right on the skin of the person and that lasts for an hour at best. What is the point of having a cologne without even being able to smell it? I am more than disappointed. I would rather have a slightly worse/cheaper cologne that you can actually smell. Please don&#x27;t throw away your money and go with something more potent. Oh and you might think &amp;#34;well i&#x27;ll just spray a little extra on&amp;#34;... that just doesn&#x27;t work. I sprayed a little extra on and it basically ruined the smell and didn&#x27;t make it any more potent.</li>
    <li> Great experience purchasing from amazon , and great product that I&#x27;m always complemented on.</li>
    <li> I love it, this is the third time i ordered it from Amazon....</li>
    <li> I like the smell and everything of the perfume but the only thing it doesnt last long . . .</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Eternity for years and this was by far the best price I could find. I would highly recommend buying here!</li>
    <li> Every guy should have a bottle of this as part of his perfume collection...it is a great masculine scent that has the right tones, a little fresh, spicy, and a hint of sweet....those blend in real nice and you get a great perfume...its not too strong or too weak, just right, and lasts good.. it works well for day at work or a night out... it is good to have to alternate with your other perfumes... but i wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying this could be your signature scent, it is just a good perfume but not THE ONE...</li>
    <li> It smelled pretty good.</li>
    <li> I wear it all the time. I can&#x27;t go to my job without Eternity. Eternity has been part of my life.....seemingly forever.😀</li>
    <li> Great Fragance with a great small, reviews are not wrong!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my husband as a gift , he always loves getting this one !! I love the smell and it lasts forever lol !! This perfume is his signature perfume above all of the others in the market.</li>
    <li> Makes you feel good with such nostalgic cologne for men with unbelievable low price</li>
    <li> Smells like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deal; but does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne you buy at Macy&#x27;s is a better product...although more money.&lt;br /&gt;For this item moving forward; I&#x27;ll buy at a reputable brick and mortar store</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; fast shipping.  Eternity is my favorite!  I purchase this for my husband and he was happily surprised with this gift.  Best price around, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a little to strong for my taste and too musky....My BF actually enjoys wearing it but he only wears it to work where I won&#x27;t smell it because this fragrance is so strong that it makes my head hurt and makes me feel sick to my stomach.... If you like musky scents, then this would be for you.....</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> A classic! Simply a classic! Need I say more?</li>
    <li> My son is at the age were he wants to start smelling good for the girls...haha so I bought him the classic eternity by CK. It came in a nice big bottle at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I bought this for a good friend he sent me a nice thank you note, he like it very much.</li>
    <li> Fake! Fake! Fake! Do not buy this... no fragrance whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. It was in good condition. The box was good for this product. The smell is what is expected from Calvin Klein, most of the time.</li>
    <li> After reading ALL the reviews for this product i was very cynical that it would be fake. After reading the good reviews i decided to buy it. When i first sprayed it it smelled very good and i thought it was the real one. But in less than an hour the smell faded and i couldn&#x27;t even tell i sprayed cologne. I do NOT RECOMMEND this replica</li>
    <li> just what we wanted for the cheapest price anywhere!!!&lt;br /&gt;this original mans colon is what my husbant wanted and all the stores/internet sold it for much more for no good reason.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product from amazon 2 days ago and it arrived at my doorstep in a timely fashion. however when i opened the product it was a completely different yellowish color and it smells like dollar store bodyspray. Now i cant figure out how to return this terrible piece. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Eternity by Calvin Klein. Very nice and unique pef with a blend of class and style, long lasting and surpasses other high end pefs. I have been getting compliments from my friends.</li>
    <li> for some reason the perfume purchased from amazon does not smell or last the same way the same product purchased at the store does. I heard this once before an thought it was hogwash but I will tell you that the fragrance dissipates soon after you put it on.</li>
    <li> thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone, its very good and you can buy.</li>
    <li> Eternity by Calvin Klein for Men at a great price! My old standby. Product just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I had never bought cologne online, so I gave it a shot..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, and has a very pleasant smell. I highly recommend this :)</li>
    <li> Great value. I have chased this around for the best price. I have found this one to be best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> It smells great, my boyfriend has great taste!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good.... So buy it now</li>
    <li> Great fragrance!  I got it for my husband and was worried it might be a cheap knock off..other reviews said it smelled like a knock off. I&#x27;m please to say it was the real thing.</li>
    <li> Was very nice and bigger than expected!! Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancee and he loves it, but more importantly, I love it. We also got me Eternity for women so we smell even better together.</li>
    <li> perfect, good size (3.4) thought about the bigger one (6.8) but now that i have this size i realize the bigger one would have been like a display item as opposed to a cologne bottle, like those enormous bottles of liquor u see at the bars, but when they pour u a drink they typically use the 750ml bottle. so 3.4 is a great size, still small enough to fit in my overnight bag</li>
    <li> I love the lacoste ones, so this one was a bit downside for me. It smells good though. I love strong ones.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my hubby for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  Now he smells so seductive that I can&#x27;t let him go out in public without me.</li>
    <li> Got it for my bf and he loves it. thank you. great product. very nice scent! I would definitely recommend it to everyone! good luck</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and I Love, Love, Love it. I have had many compliments from both Women and Men. I will always buy it as long as it is for sale.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this.  Furthermore, every woman who smells it on me likes it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be very light scent</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for our adult son.  He was very happy with it and would highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> It was perfect  It was as expected!!</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband, he didn&#x27;t like this product. But he likes other products under Calvin Klein</li>
    <li> Love getting top products at a reduced price!</li>
    <li> DID buy Again. Just as good as the last time I ordered it!</li>
    <li> Exelent thank you !!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very picky about colognes, and I try to stay away from the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; fragrances that everyone and their brother seems to wear. I received Eternity as a Christmas gift and can say that it is good stuff. Smells really clean and sophisticated. Doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and lasts a long time on my (dry) skin, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the greatest cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but it certainly is pleasing. Give it and try and see what you think.</li>
    <li> This product was obviously diluted because this scent usually last for hours and stays on your clothes until washed. From this seller the product didn&#x27;t meet expectations</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE WAY THIS COLOGNE SMELLED, MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES IT ON ME A LOT AND OTHER WOMEN IN STREETS ALWAYS GIVE GOOD COMPLIMENTS, THANKS A LOT! :)</li>
    <li> My uncle love it o much! Smell so great &amp; good too! I hope y&#x27;all will like it for reall so good luck!</li>
    <li> I have worn Eternity for over 12 years. When I received this item, the packaging gave me suspicion especially with a cracked lid. To add more, the scent was clearly fake to my smell sense. When I compared it back-to-back with the original one that I had, I had a definite proof. I sent it back immediately. If I were you, I would look for the same item but with Amazon as the seller. The price was almost the same.</li>
    <li> The Smell does not last even few hours, I apply about 5 puffs. This is the first time I am using it so am not sure if it was supposed be like this or I received a bottle from older stock.  All my other spray I own, I just use 2-3 puffs and they last through the day.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Eternity for Men by Calvin Klein for years, have had many compliments on it, and have enjoyed wearing it.  It has been getting more and more expensive through the years as I have bought it at the department store near me.  This year I saw the price the department store was even more expensive.  I decided to try Amazon and found their price for the same 3.4 ounce spray bottle of Eternity for Men to less than half the price and no shipping charge!  I will continue to buy all of my colognes at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is NOT REAL. I cannot return it either because it&#x27;s listed as a hazardous product (so right!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so mad. How can these people survive this long on Amazon?</li>
    <li> Love the kind of smell! Perfect!</li>
    <li> As a lot of people has complained, this scent does fade very quickly. But the price is low anyway.</li>
    <li> Smells good but not lasting, within an hour its gone...i use Eternity before, this one is fake, Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great Classic Cologne That Remain Highly Relevant Today.</li>
    <li> Just as described, arrived on time, great product</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.Stinks Pretty!</li>
    <li> Great price and shipping fast, smells great !!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know much about the perfume because it was bought as a gift for my brother-in-law that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I would like to recommend if you are not ready to go very high end.. nice odor.. stays for almost a day (sorry i should say office hours!!)&lt;br /&gt;Not the best product but not bed compare to other products... (especially if you are looking for price range!!)</li>
    <li> I have used many perfumes and this is one of the best. Longevity is good and it smells wonderful.  For the price, its definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> got it in time. my son and I loved the sent. good packaging. very reasonably priced for the size. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I found this spray is long lasting than cologne and is perfect for daily use. Best product for the money.</li>
    <li> I loved it a lot. I sent it to my baby and he told me that&#x27;s the best gift ever.</li>
    <li> Wore this when is was 16, 17 years old and picked it back up at 38 and women still love it. That&#x27;s what I call timeless.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very fast, but i want to know why the barcode at the bottom is cut off. it makes me unsure if it genuine?.</li>
    <li> It is easy on smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;A few drops can make the night a memorable one for all involved.</li>
    <li> Its gentle and still let&#x27;s her know your a man. Careful not to use too much, a little goes a long way. With this you want her to smell you when you are near... not to tell the world your coming.</li>
    <li> The lovely aroma of the perfume will make any woman drow upto you like a magnet drows iron filling. The perfume is wonder.</li>
    <li> Im not exactly sure how to review a EDT because everyone has different tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it came quickly to my house, smells as it should, lasts hours longer than cheaper EDT&#x27;s and is a good scent that is a little different than the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I recommend buying it from here if you already know it is the scent you want.</li>
    <li> I just have to say, this smell is so good that men will have to fight off the ladies if they wear this.  I first smelled it on this really unattractive stranger.  I loved the smell so much that I was oddly attracted to him and had to ask him what he was wearing.  He said he was wearing Eternity by Calvin Klein.  So that night I went online and bought it for my boyfriend (who was not the irresistible, unattractive guy).  My boyfriend likes it and wears it now. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off him.  P.S.  Don&#x27;t tell my bf about the other guy I smelled...</li>
    <li> Great timing, great packing and it actually is been done according to what they say in the ad, great job guys! WIll recommended with my eyes shut!</li>
    <li> Have worn this for years and still love it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get but I&#x27;m pretty certain it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
    <li> For the size/amount, scent and price, this colonge will always be my number one favorite. Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying Eternity.</li>
    <li> I know other people have posted on here that this stuff is fake, they are wrong. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> It def doesn&#x27;t last like eternity.... It looks like a legit bottle... It came on time, was pkg fine...wish it was the real deal...&lt;br /&gt;Some deals aren&#x27;t....all they&#x27;re cracked up to be. :(</li>
    <li> The product came on time, however, when i started using it, it had no fragrance at all.  I tried using it the next day and still the same result.  I feel like I have been duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 1-star rating because it came on time, but very poor in quality.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and I&#x27;ll tell you what this is heavenly. Every time he wears it I melt with  just one smell of it. He is a man&#x27;s man but has gotten a thousand comments on how good it smells from guys and woman.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> My brother loved this.</li>
    <li> is this is an original or a fake?</li>
    <li> in line with expectations and offered , arrived at the date indicated , and in excellent condition , very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Not the real thing.</li>
    <li> Received the item in time for a gift. when opened, the sprayer was inopertable which rendered the item useless.</li>
    <li> Good product,great price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> As I said in my review for Obsession, Eternity by Calvin Klein is a classic for a reason, so there&#x27;s really no need for me to explain why it&#x27;s such a great cologne. My husband smells sexy and delicious in this, so I love getting such a great deal on Amazon. As long as you order directly from Amazon and not from a third party vendor - I&#x27;ve never had a problem. As long as Eternity continues to smell amazing on my boo, we&#x27;ll always have a bottle on hand!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice but its not for young adults as I was told by almost all the workers who sell perfume/those who know their perfume</li>
    <li> The eternity that i received for the price was very good. It was delivered very fast too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t stay more than few hours.</li>
    <li> My son, loves this, so how could I go wrong?  I just bought what he liked.  (smart mom!)  Arrived in record time.</li>
    <li> I would suggest all men to try this. Its really awesome and arrived very quickly. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and the smell does not stay even one hour, not original, and I bought in stores and not the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;do not buyed  this seller, it&#x27;s a scam!</li>
    <li> I am fan of Calvin Klein products, specially Eternity, the classic one. I will die using this perfurme because I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for several years, everyone, especially women, love this smell on me and it&#x27;s so very much cheaper than buying it in the store!</li>
