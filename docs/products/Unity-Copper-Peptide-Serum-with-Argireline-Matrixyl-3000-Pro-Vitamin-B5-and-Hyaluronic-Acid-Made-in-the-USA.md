### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In my opinion, that is the best product out there.</li>
      <li>So happy to not have my arms look</li>
      <li>Makes skin feel great.  </li>
      <li>I love this serum!</li>
      <li>You can spend more money but the results aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>I like Osmotics Copper Peptide better.  </li>
      <li>I did love it and it made a difference to my skin</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product!</li>
      <li>Love this product does everything it says it does.</li>
      <li>so I find it better to use at</li>
      <li>I wish you would be able to repackage this to a softer type of pump the packaging that you have now</li>
      <li>BUT when I opened the packet, I found the box has already been opened from the top, and the container (the tube) itself was not sealed.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it goes on and feels on my face.</li>
      <li>I keep trying different Peptide serums and this one is a very good one.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>Been using this for about 4 months, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines or pores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it up on my hands now mixed with lanolin as it reversed the progress that I experienced with Cellbone Technology&#x27;s Hyperpeptide Serum.</li>
      <li>The product goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive the product.  </li>
      <li>So far with me this has been the best product to help reduce my deep wrinkles and lines.</li>
      <li>This is the second time that I have purchased this product, which is a good indicator</li>
      <li>The bottle is covered in paper to make it appear as a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m requesting for a replacement or full refund with return mailing label.  </li>
      <li>does exactly as advertised!</li>
      <li>When I apply it in the morning  after cleansing my skin feel tight and looks great.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, but what do I expect I am old and could use a face lift :))</li>
      <li>whenever you pump you have no control of how much comes also most the time it releases so much which of course not you wasting</li>
      <li>So far I am pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is not greasy and absorbs into the skin right away leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have ever reviewed.</li>
      <li>Good product but too much waste</li>
      <li>firmer and fine lines are becoming less noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Very good product, subtle firming action</li>
      <li>Purchased this because of the purportedly high levels of matrixyl 3000 which I sincerely doubt is present in any quantifiable amount.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use with no funny smell or greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>that I really like it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not seeing much of a change with wrinkles</li>
      <li>But I really think I should pass this on.</li>
      <li>Really I have not seen any results as yet and it does not do very well under make up.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I did not feel the product absorbed properly.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to use this product  every night because it is very heavy and sticky on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I am starting to see positive results.  </li>
      <li>It contains copper peptides which apparently helps build collagen tissue.  </li>
      <li>My skin is mature and on the dry side.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Not seeing much of a change with wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have ever reviewed.But I really think I should pass this on.I noticed an improvement the very next day !!So far with me this has been the best product to help reduce my deep wrinkles and lines.</li>
    <li> received this and have been using it since the end of Oct. Not sure it is making that much of a difference yet. I love the way it goes on and feels on my face. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product</li>
    <li> I keep trying different Peptide serums and this one is a very good one.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Seems to improve my skin.  I like the fact that it is not greasy and absorbs into the skin right away leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product! This is the second time that I have purchased this product, which is a good indicator that I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly as advertised! It was money well spent!</li>
    <li> Purchased this because of the purportedly high levels of matrixyl 3000 which I sincerely doubt is present in any quantifiable amount. I&#x27;m using it up on my hands now mixed with lanolin as it reversed the progress that I experienced with Cellbone Technology&#x27;s Hyperpeptide Serum. In my opinion, that is the best product out there. You can spend more money but the results aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mid-50s, sun damaged skin, medium skin tone.  Been using this for about 4 months, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines or pores.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Good product but too much waste I wish you would be able to repackage this to a softer type of pump the packaging that you have now whenever you pump you have no control of how much comes also most the time it releases so much which of course not you wasting</li>
    <li> This product is unsatisfactory.  The packaging is deceptive - it is as pictured in the ad but there is only about an inch of product - the rest is air.  The bottle is covered in paper to make it appear as a full bottle.  The product itself is unsatisfactory as well - slimy.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product very long, but I can see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It does not do well when used under makeup so I find it better to use at&lt;br /&gt;bedtime</li>
    <li> Love this product does everything it says it does. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel great.  Lots of moisture..  It made my skin look smoother.  I would definitely purchase this product again</li>
    <li> Really I have not seen any results as yet and it does not do very well under make up. So I use it at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Very good product, subtle firming action, I use it every morning.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me, along with emu oil, to prevent the red bruises I was getting on my arms due to thin skin.&lt;br /&gt;It works!!!! So happy to not have my arms look all banged up.</li>
    <li> I did love it and it made a difference to my skin but sadly I had to stop because it aggravated my roseaca.</li>
    <li> I could see a dramatic difference after using it 2 days.  I would highly recommend this product.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I like Osmotics Copper Peptide better.  This had a tendency to flake off my face.  I did not feel the product absorbed properly.  Went back to Osmotics Blue Copper 5.</li>
    <li> I got this product with the recommendation of a dermatologist on the Dr Oz show.  It contains copper peptides which apparently helps build collagen tissue.  When I apply it in the morning  after cleansing my skin feel tight and looks great.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the product.  BUT when I opened the packet, I found the box has already been opened from the top, and the container (the tube) itself was not sealed.  I would think for \\&quot;sanitary\\&quot; concern, either the box or the container should have been sealed.  I found it unacceptable and refuse to  use the product (that I&#x27;m going to put on my face) under such  condition.  I&#x27;m requesting for a replacement or full refund with return mailing label.  I hope this issue will be resolved.  Otherwise, I will never order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for about two weeks now and I am starting to see positive results.  My skin is looking firmer and fine lines are becoming less noticeable.  So far I am pleased with my purchase and I hope with continued usage, the serum will continue to have a lasting impact on my skin.  Very easy to use with no funny smell or greasy feeling.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I use it everyday! I bought it for microneedling treatments. The product goes on smooth. Does not fry out your skin. Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use this product  every night because it is very heavy and sticky on my skin. I can not use it during the day because it just sits on my skin, being sticky. At night  I stick to my pillow. I don&#x27;t know if it improves the look of my skin or not because I dislike how it feels, so I don&#x27;t use it. I can&#x27;t believe this product would sink into anyone&#x27;s skin. My skin is mature and on the dry side. I would not recommend this product. I wasted my money on this. It was the most expensive skin product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, but what do I expect I am old and could use a face lift :))</li>
