      <li>I received a free sample of the &amp;#34;Yu-Be&amp;#34; product and loved it.</li>
      <li>and I was delighted to find out that it was available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>We just moved to the US from Japan and while packing, I made sure we brought our yuskin with us</li>
      <li>am glad that I give this product a try.</li>
      <li>I also heard it was safe for your lips</li>
      <li>I tried many many name brand hand cream.</li>
      <li>, I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love this cream, I use it every night on hands and feet.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>Better than Yu-Be.</li>
      <li>Sure it takes a couple of weeks, but it&#x27;s not like you are going to die if you don&#x27;t get this in 2 days.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff that works so well, but I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now</li>

      <li>Perfect for my dry skin</li>
      <li>friend strongly recommends this product to me.</li>
      <li>Which is fine, but I do like the way it smells.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re all fine.</li>
      <li>The packaging was fine, box with lotion in it was thoughtfully wrapped in bubble</li>
      <li>It is not too oily and there is a light scent of camphor</li>
      <li>But so far - good result.  </li>
      <li>Not a huge fan of the smell, but not an issue because of the wonderful healing properties within.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much and I will order for more and will give some to my father too who is in the Philippines.</li>
      <li>This is just like the very popular brand Yu-Be, but you get a lot more for a lot less cost.</li>
      <li>Also, they have a product specially for the lips, see pics attached.</li>
      <li>I have been using product for a good two months now to moisturize my entire body basically.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy, is absorbed into the skin quickly and helps heal and smooth your skin.</li>
      <li>I use this right before bedtime and my hands become smooth again overnight.</li>
      <li>This cream seems to have some supernatural ability to heal many dry-skin maladies.</li>
      <li>far as the lotion itself, if you&#x27;ve never heard of the magical healing powers of Yu-Be (or Yuskin-a), then you are in for a treat.</li>
      <li>Worth the wait from Japan.  </li>
      <li>She was right</li>
      <li>Much better and faster acting than their USA version YuBe.</li>
      <li>Though if there is a way to maximize the impact of the cream, I would have been interested in reading about it.  </li>
      <li>For me it seems to help with my hot flashes, they are not as often when i use this.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>After using many different hand creams I discovered Yuskin A.  </li>
      <li>In the end, extremely pleased with this product and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>My face is very sensitive to most moisturizers and after trying Yu-Be (American version of this product), I figured I would order this and try it out.</li>
      <li>and we think the Yuskin is responsible for that.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product as a whole.</li>
      <li>I tried goldbond, eczema relief, renew, and dr teals oil, and this time yuskinA - i will stick to this product, really works on my skin</li>
      <li>shipper sent the product asap, and it arrives as fast as you can expect when it&#x27;s being shipped from Japan.</li>
      <li>Now I associate the smell with relief and healing as well as a smooth creamy feel that leaves my hands feeling silky--I actually look forward to using it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, exact same cream as the more expensive USA brand Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream, you just have to be patient for it to arrive from Japan.</li>
      <li>My hands dry too easily</li>
      <li>I am a Filipino, 35 years old and married.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I live in Missouri and the estimated delivery window was June 16 - July 8.</li>
      <li>I hear the Japanese generally have thinner, more sensitive skin than the rest of us, so their general product may well be used on people like me who has to search for sensitive line at home.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>After some research I discovered that this is the same product, just the Japanese marketed version, and that this was significantly cheaper.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>This product was introduced to us by a friend from Japan who thought it would be useful for my chronically dry hands.</li>
      <li>The treatment on hubby&#x27;s head was very severe, and much burning and itching was to be expected.  </li>
      <li>Corrected cracked skin on very sore fingertips on my husband within 3 days of multiple applications.  </li>
      <li>It stopped when I was 15 years old</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really comment as of yet as it&#x27;s just a couple of days since - I am a thorough reviewer and will update this review soon if necessary.  </li>
      <li>I do have to say though it works ok on my lips and gets a lot of dead skin off but by the end of the day my lips are extremely dry again.    </li>
      <li>It has a very sticky and strange feeling to it</li>
      <li>/&gt;So bought 2 extra bottles from the same seller (Japan Stream) which is much cheaper than the one selling under Amazon Prime.  </li>
      <li>the only clear part is my face.</li>
      <li>I had used the other brand that has this same color design, and although I really liked it I thought it was pretty expensive for the amount of product.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it I noticed the slightly medicinal smell.  </li>
      <li>The aroma is slightly medicinal and was off-putting at first.</li>
      <li>I also use this to make frizzy hair behave because my face eczema flares up with most hair styling products, thick application as a mask for sleeping, light application as base for all hypoallergenic perfume free makeup.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face as a deep moisturizing overnight mask, and I wake up with such soft skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my third purchase of this product it is wonderful.  It makes your skin feel and look good. It is not too oily and there is a light scent of camphor but it goes away in seconds. For me it seems to help with my hot flashes, they are not as often when i use this. I will buy again</li>
    <li> WOW! WOW! WOW!  This cream is incredible.  I have used a lot of expensive and moderate priced moisturizing lotions (Eurecin, Kiehls, Cetaphil, Body Shop, Aveda etc.) and never been this pleased.  I have been using the lotion regularly for the past 5 days.  My skin feels great. The first time I used it I noticed the slightly medicinal smell.  Like other reviews it totally fades after some time.  (It reminds me a little of Dettol.)  The scent does not linger.  Which is fine, but I do like the way it smells.  The cream goes on with a delightful richness not a greasy feel. My teenage daughter loves it too and has been helping herself to the tub of cream.  I can&#x27;t read anything on the packing materials b/c it was all in Japanese.  This was not a factor for me.  Though if there is a way to maximize the impact of the cream, I would have been interested in reading about it.  In the end, extremely pleased with this product and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It heals cracked and bleeding hands and tackles chapped lips and dry heels; it&#x27;s a little miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I ordered this last January 2,2015 and I received it last January 20,2015. It took like 18 days total of waiting because it came all the way from Japan. I am a Filipino, 35 years old and married. I have eczema since childhood, I think I got this from my father but the rest of my sisters and brothers they never have skin problem like mine. They&#x27;re all fine. It stopped when I was 15 years old I thought it won&#x27;t come back anymore but during my pregnancy it started again when my baby was six months in my womb, and after pregnancy it got worst I had an infection. After pregnancy, I took a lot of medications prednisone taper, antibiotics, maintain three different dermatologists, went several times at the emergency room. I was struggling on my skin, really bad. Left,scars in every part of my body the only clear part is my face. The rest you could see scars from my eczema. I tried goldbond, eczema relief, renew, and dr teals oil, and this time yuskinA - i will stick to this product, really works on my skin, I feel the difference, it heal faster, I have red blisters, it&#x27;s winter time, it&#x27;s eczema moment, I rub on it and in the next day I see the difference. All these I tried and it help on my skin and looking forward for more progress in weeks, months or year. Thank you very much and I will order for more and will give some to my father too who is in the Philippines.</li>
    <li> I am an artist who works in a variety of mediums, some quite toxic.  After using many different hand creams I discovered Yuskin A.  Without a doubt it is the best cream I have ever used.  It is not greasy, is absorbed into the skin quickly and helps heal and smooth your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My hands and cuticles get very dry in the winter months, and this keeps them supple without the heavy greasiness some other products have.  When Spring comes around, my hands always take a beating from gardening, but this cream has been one of the best I&#x27;ve used to combat that issue.  Some may not like the scent, as it&#x27;s camphor-like, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I had used the other brand that has this same color design, and although I really liked it I thought it was pretty expensive for the amount of product.  This product is less expensive, and is a larger jar, and seems to be exactly like the other.  I think I&#x27;ll stay with this one!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Perfect for my dry skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is a winter life saver. I use it on my face, hands, elbows, lips, feet everywhere. Much better and faster acting than their USA version YuBe.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the &amp;#34;Yu-Be&amp;#34; product and loved it. After some research I discovered that this is the same product, just the Japanese marketed version, and that this was significantly cheaper. I ordered the product on May 14 and it arrived May 26. I live in Missouri and the estimated delivery window was June 16 - July 8. I am VERY happy with this skin cream. I have seen a dramatic improvement in my eczema patches using this cream.</li>
    <li> I work at a grocery store where my hands take a beating stocking wine. Also, I constantly wash them with harsh industrial hand soap throughout the day. Before using Yuskin A, my hands would get so dry that they would crack and bleed no matter the time of year. The dry cracked skin at the tips of my fingers near my nails was especially painful. I use Yuskin A on my hands, legs and elbows every night before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now and I don&#x27;t have painful cracks anymore. The aroma is slightly medicinal and was off-putting at first. Now I associate the smell with relief and healing as well as a smooth creamy feel that leaves my hands feeling silky--I actually look forward to using it. Before this I used O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands cream, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as Yuskin A does.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, exact same cream as the more expensive USA brand Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream, you just have to be patient for it to arrive from Japan.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to us by a friend from Japan who thought it would be useful for my chronically dry hands. She was right and I was delighted to find out that it was available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is the only lotion that works on my severely dry hands. I work in the food industry and am constantly washing my hands and by the end of the day my hands are like sandpaper. I put yuskina on before bed and in the morning my hands are replenished. The product is costly but it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive to most moisturizers and after trying Yu-Be (American version of this product), I figured I would order this and try it out. I&#x27;m so happy I made the purchase because this stuff is AWESOME. Better than Yu-Be. I swear by it. A little goes a long way. It soaks into your skin nicely and I put it on in the morning and night. I can apply my makeup over it after it dries. YuskinA has helped with my acne and calms the redness on my face. It&#x27;s great for all over the body as well.</li>
    <li> We just moved to the US from Japan and while packing, I made sure we brought our yuskin with us and I am just so happy they are on amazon US too!!! Just more expensive here tho :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a mom I work around the kitchen and wash my hands a lot. My hands dry too easily and I get really bad frostbites during winter. I use this right before bedtime and my hands become smooth again overnight. I actually discovered this thru my ex-bf (now my husband) who uses yuskin for his dry cracked feet. My boys use it too whenever their feet gets dry and cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviews here saying they use it on their lips. I read Japanese and the package said do not use it on the lips or the mouth. I googled if its ok and some Japanese have tried it on their lips and nothing bad happened. Also, they have a product specially for the lips, see pics attached. So yeah, you decide, but the package said DON&#x27;T.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t survive cold winters without it! I use it all over my atopic skin plagued body including eyelids and lips and it helps millions! In fact when I use it throughout the year people only take notice of the staining of skin from chronic scratching but no patches/bleeding lesions. I also use this to make frizzy hair behave because my face eczema flares up with most hair styling products, thick application as a mask for sleeping, light application as base for all hypoallergenic perfume free makeup. I hear the Japanese generally have thinner, more sensitive skin than the rest of us, so their general product may well be used on people like me who has to search for sensitive line at home.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy this as she mentioned she saw a lot of good reviews online for this product and she wanted to try it as she has a problem with the dryness of her skin around her face.  After a few weeks, she noticed some difference so she wanted to buy another jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a sufferer of dry flaky skin at times, so I tried it.  Can&#x27;t really comment as of yet as it&#x27;s just a couple of days since - I am a thorough reviewer and will update this review soon if necessary.  But so far - good result.  Curing that &amp;#34;flakiness&amp;#34; is yet to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bought 2 extra bottles from the same seller (Japan Stream) which is much cheaper than the one selling under Amazon Prime.  Sure it takes a couple of weeks, but it&#x27;s not like you are going to die if you don&#x27;t get this in 2 days.  Plus the price difference is around $4 as of this writing (dependent on the US/JPY conversion as this comes from Japan) and that&#x27;s a lot if you want to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viscosity: It&#x27;s firmer that vicks vaporub - I hate creams in general as it gives me that icky feeling.  This is no exception.  But that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The smell is similar again to vicks vaporub but a bit milder - not deducting a star because it is just really a personal preference and it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product as a whole.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Been using this for years. It is so soothing on the skin along with being a healing cream</li>
    <li> Thank you! I love this cream, I use it every night on hands and feet. Silky texture, I love the way it feels on my skin. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  My husband and I are in our sixties.  Sometime we get spots or some blemish that does not heal.  However, if we put this on the area, the area heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been treated  by a dermo for actinic/keratosis on his scalp.  I am not saying that Yuskin A cured the A.K.  but I am saying that the Yuskin greatly aided the healing process.  My husband no longer had any flaking/ dandruff that was connected with the A.K. and we think the Yuskin is responsible for that.  The treatment on hubby&#x27;s head was very severe, and much burning and itching was to be expected.  But with Yuskin added to the equation (put on at night), my husband did not suffer from these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good for helping people with areas of the skin which do not heal well (as we age).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, so we do not use it all over our bodies, but only in problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you add a bit of water to it, it rubs on more easily, and it not as thick as in its &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; looking in any way, but it works like a charm.  Really!</li>
    <li> Good product! Used it for two weeks already. It is helpful to my dy and cracking hands . I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I tried many many name brand hand cream. None of them can save my hand in winter.&lt;br /&gt;It is suffering of having lots of cuts on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;My friend strongly recommends this product to me. She said...you must try it!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I give this product a try. Now, no cut on my hands. I am happy with my hands now.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> The most amazing and healing lotion you can find.  Worth the wait from Japan.  Corrected cracked skin on very sore fingertips on my husband within 3 days of multiple applications.  Highly recommend this product.  Not a huge fan of the smell, but not an issue because of the wonderful healing properties within.</li>
    <li> This is just like the very popular brand Yu-Be, but you get a lot more for a lot less cost. I think the product themselves may even be identical - I own both and can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper sent the product asap, and it arrives as fast as you can expect when it&#x27;s being shipped from Japan. The packaging was fine, box with lotion in it was thoughtfully wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lotion itself, if you&#x27;ve never heard of the magical healing powers of Yu-Be (or Yuskin-a), then you are in for a treat. This cream seems to have some supernatural ability to heal many dry-skin maladies. I used it on my hands to fix my cracking cuticles - they were almost perfect in just two weeks. I use it on my face as a deep moisturizing overnight mask, and I wake up with such soft skin. I used it to ameliorate my rough elbows, and this cream had them baby soft in days. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff that works so well, but I love it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go without it for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Japan!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best cream ever.  Works with just a few applications!</li>
    <li> This product was a very bad investment. DO NOT BUY! I have been using product for a good two months now to moisturize my entire body basically. When I bought this I was very excited because I had heard very good things about it. I also heard it was safe for your lips so I have been using it there too. It has a very sticky and strange feeling to it and it is very hard to work into your skin. All it did was make me feel like I was a magnet for dirt all day long. I do have to say though it works ok on my lips and gets a lot of dead skin off but by the end of the day my lips are extremely dry again.    OVERALL: This product does not have an lasting affects and is not worth the money</li>
