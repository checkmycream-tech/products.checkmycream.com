      <li>but well worth it!</li>
      <li>This fit my large round head perfectly.  </li>
      <li>too loose around my neck, so it can&#x27;t help to tighten my neck at all, but it is good to uplift your face.</li>

      <li>so can&#x27;t really say how well it works.</li>
      <li>but it really works</li>
      <li>I gave it a good fair try but didn&#x27;t see any difference other than slowly being choked to death!!!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this thinking I could use it to relax my jaw, but the Velcro is not adjustable, the neoprene is not very elastic/adjustable for proper fit</li>
      <li>I feel as if its not really working, but i do enjoy the thought of</li>

<li> wow</li>
<li> I think it can work its fixed.</li>
<li> If you have sensitive skin this product may not be for you.</li>
<li> , I do not recommend to people with sensitive skin.</li>
<li> All in Korean though, no other language instructions.</li>
<li> it work, it is kind of uncomfortable</li>
<li> However, if this simple and cheap method will help me to reshape my face wihout any surgery, I am willing to put up with bad hair every day.</li>
<li> I think you would have to wear it over a long period of time before you actually started seeing results.</li>
<li> my face is naturally slim, but I have a little bit of a double chin</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a warm sensation after 40 minutes, I have a translated instruction guide, and I just basically disagree with every bad comment.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it stretched out</li>
<li> Give 3 stars since haven&#x27;t has long to decide how this will work.</li>
<li> /&gt;size: it was snug on me when I first tried on but it is little loose on me after few weeks.</li>
<li> I hope it won&#x27;t get too loose over the period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The major issue, like some have commented, is this product is SO small (or my head is gigantic).</li>
<li> I wish I could have gotten a little larger</li>
<li> I only used it a few times.  </li>
<li> I have always left it from 15 to 20 minutes almost everyday.</li>
<li> Its not pretty, and it does smell like neoprene</li>
<li> Not sure how long to wear it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve let it air out for a while, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to keep this on my skin for so long</li>
<li> There is an odd smell.</li>
<li> I did get slightly irritated and sweaty but what can I say...</li>
<li> it makes you sweat around your jaw/neckline, an area where I&#x27;ve never sweat much previously.</li>
<li> You will have to be a little bit patient and have to put up with the slight discomfort.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s tight and it irritates your skin</li>
<li> It fits, it&#x27;s tight but to where it must be to help - not a &amp;#34;dying&amp;#34; experience.</li>
<li> Did not work, too tight to get around my head and even my friends head.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The product is not that tight, well it has to be tight</li>
<li> The neck area is so tight that it&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
<li> A bit tight though,</li>
<li> My nose could be broken but there&#x27;s not a strong scent; if any, there&#x27;s barely a haze.</li>
<li> not comfortable too tight</li>
<li> 50 cents worth of material and the stiching was bad.</li>
<li> and that is because I put it on almost everyday.</li>
<li> It is just waste of money.</li>
<li> Well I have it on and need to give it a few weeks and see what happens</li>
<li> Not seeing any result after a few months of wearing.</li>
<li> If you want a firmer face after a few weeks then this will help.</li>
<li> and i did not see any difference, waste of money</li>
<li> I was not sure about ordering this, I read lots of comment saying that it is too tight &amp;</li>
<li> You have to have discipline though because this product like almost everything else is not a magic stick that can change your face after a few uses.</li>
<li> BECAUSE IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY HEAD.</li>
<li> Once I put it on for a period of time( usually for 30 mins or so), I don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
<li> Very small and tight.  </li>
<li> it can be annoying when you first use it</li>
<li> , it has been a concern of mine during these days, if the pressure this product applies around the chin and neck affects negatively the lymphatic system and the brain.</li>
<li> A sucker is born eveyy minute, this time it was me.</li>
<li> This has helped my face a a lot especially in between my chin and neck area but it is very uncomfortable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its been more that three weeks of using and i did not see any difference, waste of money</li>
    <li> my face is naturally slim, but I have a little bit of a double chin so that&#x27;s why I bought it — I do see more definition in my face after using this mask twice a day for 40 minutes, for a week. however, I would say that it requires a level of tolerance for its tightness and also the &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has been a concern of mine during these days, if the pressure this product applies around the chin and neck affects negatively the lymphatic system and the brain. They do have a disclaimer to not use the product for longer periods of times than recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in conclusion, I think it does something, but whether it is what you need or expect the product to do, that&#x27;s another thing.</li>
    <li> A bit tight though, but it really works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight and simple and it works, seen results within a week , love love love!!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any change but it&#x27;sokay</li>
    <li> Good product, good services.</li>
    <li> Very basic neoprene face wrap. The major issue, like some have commented, is this product is SO small (or my head is gigantic). I originally purchased this thinking I could use it to relax my jaw, but the Velcro is not adjustable, the neoprene is not very elastic/adjustable for proper fit and there is zero room for my fat noggin.  The neck area is so tight that it&#x27;s unwearable. It was literally suffocating me. I would not recommend this product and it looks like these are a final sale.</li>
    <li> it gave me a double chin i wanted to stop this from happening but it did  a reverse wow</li>
    <li> Give 3 stars since haven&#x27;t has long to decide how this will work. ALSO, it took longer than said it would. It jumped all over the place on arrival dates, while I tracked it. Stated a Friday, 7-10 days after ordered; then went to the Monday &amp; eventually came on the Tuesday. It&#x27;s okay for the price, from my usage thus far. Yet, I wouldn&#x27;t see how it will work like seller claims, AND, how picture shows. I do NOT believe all I read or see; nor did I expect to see results as the beautiful model on the package, but, I would have liked to have seen an easier &amp; more comfortable product to arrive :)  thanks</li>
    <li> Itchy, itchy, itchy.  That Is all.</li>
    <li> There were no instructions in English.  Not sure how long to wear it.  Leaves a visible imprint on your chin and neckline where its sewn together at the chin cup.</li>
    <li> not comfortable too tight</li>
    <li> This is a very poor quality item..  50 cents worth of material and the stiching was bad. Too top it off the velcro was not done correctly....</li>
    <li> I think you would have to wear it over a long period of time before you actually started seeing results.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this mask for about 30 min. 3 times a week for a month now and I see a lift around my jaw and neck area. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. It cannot be worn for more than a minute. Need some adjusting. I think it can work its fixed.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH THE PRICE CHEAPLY MADE - SENT IT BACK BECAUSE IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY HEAD.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about ordering this, I read lots of comment saying that it is too tight &amp; It is just waste of money. I just gave it a try &amp; I don&#x27;t regret it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not that tight, well it has to be tight so it can do the job !! it can be annoying when you first use it, I am telling you it is not a product to put on and move around the place, just put it and relax watch tv or even nap for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my face is not chubby, but my face structure shows a bit of a double-chin, which i really hate! I always hated to take pictures because of that !! I started using this, and i do see some results, wear it every day before bed for 15- 20 minutes, and if can reach up to 30 -40 mins that would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more confident about how I look now !</li>
    <li> Its not pretty, and it does smell like neoprene but I feel its doing its job. I wear this 30-40 mins daily (as per product instructions) during my daily workout. Similar to belly slimmers etc it makes you sweat around your jaw/neckline, an area where I&#x27;ve never sweat much previously. I will continue to use daily and reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect this product to have such a very strong toxic smell to it. I&#x27;ve let it air out for a while, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to keep this on my skin for so long so can&#x27;t really say how well it works. I found something else that I prefer instead.</li>
    <li> A sucker is born eveyy minute, this time it was me. Hype but no result . Save your money for plastic surgery, this does not work</li>
    <li> I still have a baby face, thus meaning my face can be fatter than it must at this point in age. I so badly wanted a slimmer face which lead to me buying this product. I was incredibly excited and didn&#x27;t see what others had a problem with. It fits, it&#x27;s tight but to where it must be to help - not a &amp;#34;dying&amp;#34; experience. My nose could be broken but there&#x27;s not a strong scent; if any, there&#x27;s barely a haze. There&#x27;s a warm sensation after 40 minutes, I have a translated instruction guide, and I just basically disagree with every bad comment. I&#x27;m excited to continue with this product. c:</li>
    <li> Very small and tight.  Could never sleep with this on all night and smells absolutely horrible.  I would keep looking for another product.</li>
    <li> That was very fast, ordered it yesterday and there it was in the mail today.  All in Korean though, no other language instructions.; good thing you can read instructions here on Amazon or on the product itself.  Well I have it on and need to give it a few weeks and see what happens, Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality and bad smell come from the material! I throw it.</li>
    <li> SEEING RESULTS ALREADY</li>
    <li> This fit my large round head perfectly.  I love the tightness because that means it is being effective. Mine had no smell and it was comfortable.  Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> only problem.....too hot</li>
    <li> as for now - i am satisfied .yes my jaw feels stacked to my brain .. yes i dont know if it is working ( by the way what are we working on? gravity?) but i finally get used to these pinching devise - I did cut wholes for the ears ..now with the ears outside and hair rollers on my head i sit in front of netflix, scaring my cockatiels .. thinking that beauty requires sacrifice ..feeling actualy good about myself ..if i m sure that i m  home alone</li>
    <li> There weren&#x27;t any instructions on how to use this product and when I finally began using it,  I only used it a few times.  I really didn&#x27;t care for the feeling and the fact that there was nothing in the packaging. I ordered another product and I&#x27;m beginning to use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Save save save money insted buying !!</li>
    <li> too loose around my neck, so it can&#x27;t help to tighten my neck at all, but it is good to uplift your face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any remarkable effect of using this tool. So, don&#x27;t bother yourself purchasing it. Instead do your face a favor facial yoga exercises and you&#x27;d notice the difference in 1 week.</li>
    <li> Seems to work so far, but I haven&#x27;t seen a drastic change.  If, I do I will change my review.  It came on schedule and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> While I realize Asians are smaller people than Americans are, this type &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; was actually uunbearable to wear!!! I gave it a good fair try but didn&#x27;t see any difference other than slowly being choked to death!!! Good concept but way too tight!! Returned in 2 or 3 days as per a call to Amazon to report this.  Very kind and understanding...Amazon said to return asap. thank you!</li>
    <li> Did not work, too tight to get around my head and even my friends head.  I wish I could have gotten a little larger</li>
    <li> I have been wearing it over two weeks and it does help.&lt;br /&gt;Odor: yes, there is odor that will fade but wouldn&#x27;t go away but it is bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;size: it was snug on me when I first tried on but it is little loose on me after few weeks. I don&#x27;t think it stretched out but my face is being lifted up.Horray! I hope it won&#x27;t get too loose over the period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irritation: I have very sensitive skin but I haven&#x27;t had any issue so far so it&#x27;s fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how it works: I wasn&#x27;t a believer until I tried it. Once I put it on for a period of time( usually for 30 mins or so), I don&#x27;t feel a thing. However, once I take it off, I realized here is sweat in my face on the area I put the mask on with defining chin line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I really like this product and it works for me. I would recommend it to people if you can fit into your head. If not, don&#x27;t bother. As for me, I lost over 20 lbs and I was worrying about my sagging cheeks and face However, if this simple and cheap method will help me to reshape my face wihout any surgery, I am willing to put up with bad hair every day. I hope this review will help.</li>
    <li> Fit is good, made well. It&#x27;s comfortable and it stops snoring as well. Gives you serious bed head though. Oh well it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This item has an unpleasant smell even after rinsing it out. I try using it it does seem to tighten the face ..</li>
    <li> Hot but well worth it!</li>
    <li> This has helped my face a a lot especially in between my chin and neck area but it is very uncomfortable. I have never left this more than 40 mins. I have always left it from 15 to 20 minutes almost everyday. I did get slightly irritated and sweaty but what can I say...It has helped. You will have to be a little bit patient and have to put up with the slight discomfort. If you have sensitive skin this product may not be for you. If you can&#x27;t stand discomfort then this product may not be right for you. If you want a firmer face after a few weeks then this will help. You have to have discipline though because this product like almost everything else is not a magic stick that can change your face after a few uses. This takes time. I have had this product for months and I started seeing change after 3 weeks or so and that is because I put it on almost everyday.</li>
    <li> It is a okay quality face mask... Not seeing any result after a few months of wearing. I will need to hunt for a better one...</li>
    <li> Still using it to see results.</li>
    <li> I feel as if its not really working, but i do enjoy the thought of it work, it is kind of uncomfortable but once you get used to it, it is easier to deal with.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap it&#x27;s tight and it irritates your skin</li>
    <li> My question is coming with instructions</li>
    <li> There is an odd smell. Even after hand washing. Also I developed a rash on my face, I do not recommend to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I sleep with this on and the fabric does not create dents or lines at cheek bone. Have only used it 3 times so I cannot comment on the results. would recommend this to anyone looking to prevent facial sagging.</li>
    <li> when i have the time to wear it. I really like it. it does tighten my skin</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all these fake reviews don&#x27;t buy it. If I could I would rate this a -1 star.</li>
</ol>
