    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it. This is a very heavy belt buckle. Looks just like it does in the picture.</li>

    <li> I got this belt buckle for Christmas 2013 and now its April 2014 and its great. i wear it all the time but it broke today. On the back side of the buckle (the triangle that you put the extra belt through) the little metal piece that holds that snapped off. It still works but now Im not sure how long the other ones will last. But I do recommend this as a good belt buckle.</li>
