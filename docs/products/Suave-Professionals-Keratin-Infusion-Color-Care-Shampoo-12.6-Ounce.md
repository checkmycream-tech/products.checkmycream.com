      <li>love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>I must say that I LOVE this</li>

      <li>My hair is so much smoother and more manageable.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this shampoo (Also have the [[ASIN:B005SPETHW Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Color Care Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]])</li>

      <li>Lucky for me, this stuff is very affordable.</li>

      <li>Now, on one hand, that is ok with me because I love the way they work and that my hair is so much smoother and less frizzy, but what is going to protect my hair color from fading?</li>

      <li>I thought it would be like many shampoos and not quite work as well after the first few washes, but it just keeps working.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but I def.</li>

<li> I have no idea how this would work for other people but</li>
<li> In addition, I dye my hair dark brown approx every 6 weeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this product will work over time because I&#x27;ve only used it (along with the conditioner) a few times.</li>
<li> for me -- dark, course, hair -- it did not work well.  </li>
<li> I see all my color being washed down the drain with this</li>
<li> It has also cut down on the time it takes me to style my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this product will work over time because I&#x27;ve only used it (along with the conditioner) a few times. I am going to stop using it though because it stinks horribly! You know that chemical smell with most hair dyes? This is worse times ten. What a waste...</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the reviews were glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be so-so.  As one person said, this is NOT COLOR SAFE.  I see all my color being washed down the drain with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good for the money, but my hair is not spectacular after using it.</li>
    <li> The Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Color Care Shampoo does a fine job of getting my hair clean and I think it has helped tame the frizz a bit in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it. I won&#x27;t purchase it again because of the strong musky smell (5/22/2012).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/5/2012 UPDATE: I&#x27;m still using the shampoo and I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s making a difference in the texture. Also, my color hasn&#x27;t faded and is less brassy than it has been. I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t smell the shampoo on my hair after it&#x27;s been dry for a couple of hours. I&#x27;m thinking about trying the conditioner now. Changing my review from 3 stars to 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo. it adds just the perfect amount of zing to the colored hair and in combination with the color care conditioner it&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> For the price, this shampoo and conditioner is amazing.  I used it for the first time this morning and my hair is super smooth and beyond manageable.  It looks and feels like I just got it cut and styled professionally.  I&#x27;ve been telling all my girlfriends about it all day long.</li>
    <li> I am always on a quest to find the perfect hair care products.  I have spent a fortune and I am not afraid to keep looking for the right fit.  I have long, thin to medium weight hair that is really curly up underneath to loose waves on top.  My hair is color-treated (every 10-ish weeks) and I use a leave-in treatment (It&#x27;s a 10) daily.  I also wash my hair daily as I have for years and years and years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said...I really like this stuff at first.  The first few times I used it I really loved how soft my hair was and it seemed to be living up to the hype.  I even think my hair was noticeably smoother.  I am not about 1/2 way into the bottle and have been using it for just over 2 weeks (along with the matching conditioner) and I am singing a different tune entirely.  My hair seems to be getting dryer by the day and more frizzy.  I am also losing a LOT of hair.  Losing hair isn&#x27;t that uncommon for me...but losing this much is ridiculous and does NOT make me a happy camper.  My hair is getting thinner by the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tossing this stuff out tonight and will not use it again.  Honestly, given the problems with the Keratin treatment I wonder if this stuff doesn&#x27;t have something in it that is equally damaging?  All I know if that I will never touch it again.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is SO SOFT! I love it. I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos including natural ones and salon ones, etc. On a whim, I tried this and loved it. I thought it would be like many shampoos and not quite work as well after the first few washes, but it just keeps working. I use the conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> Cheap and works like a charm. I am stocking up! My hair is very coarse and fly-away.  This makes it smooth and manageable, but not greasy. (I was my hair every other day.) love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this would work for other people but for me -- dark, course, hair -- it did not work well.  I found it to make my hair kind of an oily course mess but I expect it is just not for my hair.  It may work perfectly fine for someone else.  With shampoo and conditioners you have to go through a trial and error process to find the one that will work for you because everybody is different and it is impossible for a company to make a product that will work for everyone out there.</li>
    <li> Suave has always been a good brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but I def. feel like this product needs one!&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed cosmetologist, and I have strayed away from drug store brand hair products for 6 years now. I have curly, thick, and frizzy hair. I have tried just about every professional product under the sun to help tame it. Then on a whim I decided to try this because really, for $5 it was worth a try for the shampoo and conditioner. I am absolutely in LOVE. I have not found anything that has ever made my hair feel so soft, and made it so shiny. I will not stop using this shampoo and conditioner until they one day stop making it. I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that it leaves people that have \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; hair slightly greasy, so I would recommend this to people with frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Suave Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner since I started using the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing kit. I love both the shampoo and condition, so when I decided to color my hair, I wanted to get the ones for color treated hair. I boight them both and both work just as well as the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; ones for frizzy hair. Thne I decided to check the ingredients to see what was in it to protect my color from fading. I live in Florida and the sun does quite a number on my natural red hair and even more when I darker it. Well, I compared side by side both shampoo and conditioner and I have to say there is NOTHING different abot them. Now, on one hand, that is ok with me because I love the way they work and that my hair is so much smoother and less frizzy, but what is going to protect my hair color from fading? No UV protectant what so ever. Very interesting. Now, I think this is not goo because it is marketing saying your color will be protected, but it has nothing in it to back it up. So if the regular had something to protect my hair form UV rays, then why not just market THAT and say it is safe for color treated hair or something to that effect? To me, this is just a marketing ploy to get people to buy another product. I will continue to use it, but now I am not so worried about buying this one over the regular Keratin infusion shamppo and conditioner. PLus, I may have to find another brand when I color my hair that DOES in fact have something in it to protect my color from fading faster.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo (Also have the [[ASIN:B005SPETHW Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Color Care Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]) but it just didn&#x27;t really live up to my expectations. I have semi-wavy hair that I tend to straighten because it happens to frizz out a lot when left natural, so I was hoping that I would see SOME improvement with this shampoo but I didn&#x27;t really. I saw absolutely no change in the amount of frizz I had or whether or not my hair was more moisturized or anything else. That being said, it smells great and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair/scalp like some products do, nor make it overly greasy. I&#x27;m not sure its something I would purchase again, but I&#x27;m not rushing to replace it with something else.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a test. My hair gets really dry from all of the products I use. Once I started using this, my hair started looking and feeling so much better!</li>
    <li> This infusion Suave has some weird oil in it that completely made me break out.  I would recommend staying away from this kind if there is a possibility that your skin won&#x27;t take to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as an occasional protein treatment for my hair. I do not use the conditioner. It works fine. I am not sure if there are any miraculous results from this alone though. Any shampoo with SLS is going to be drying to hair in the long run and adding too much protein to hair can cause it to be brittle. If this make your hair too dry then you don&#x27;t need that much protein. Using it (or another protein treatment) once a month may be all you need. My hair is dyed atomic pink and the usual amount of dye came out in the shower as with other shampoos. Using cool water to rinse is best it keeps hair shiny and helps it fades less.</li>
    <li> Based on previous reviews I bought this shampoo along with the keratin conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using both products for a couple of weeks but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the smoothness of my hair. It still frizzes and I have fly aways.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased the shampoo and conditioner from Suave Keratin Infusion color care.  My hair became smoother with the first use and continues to get better each day.  Most shampoos and conditioners called smoothing usually leave a horrible residue on my hair and it looks dirty quickly, not so with this product!  Finally I can have the shiny hair I am use to without weighing it down with heavy conditioners.  I believe the color protection is working as well.  I use henna on my hair instead of commercial boxed color. Henna tends to have a period of color bleed until it settles in.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it is no longer staining the towel I use to dry my hair.  This is the first color care shampoo to succeed at keeping the henna in!.  Overall I am greatly pleased with this product and do not have one negative thing to say.</li>
    <li> I have this around more expensive hair products, and it is killing them for frizz control and damage repair.  I was using it daily before and was getting build up.  If I alternate this with other products, it is great.  It makes a really great hair day if it is used in rotation with other products.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo...it really helps to tame my wild hair without the HUGE cost of a salon product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick and wirey and it totally helps to tame it and makes it easier for me to flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the price and have recommended it to several of my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate and &#x27;irritant&#x27; free hair products that have been kind to my scalp but weigh down my fine, thin hair. I was just roaming in the grocery store and saw this product line.  At these prices I thought, what could it hurt?  Turns out, I&#x27;m very impressed. My hair looks thicker, bouncy and shiny. I wash my hair with this, then apply the serum to damp hair and let it air dry. My hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair from hormonal issues (PCOS), and was a little wary of using this product because of some bad reviews. I really wanted less frizzy hair. So far I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for 2 consecutive days with the conditioner as well, and my hair looks great. It&#x27;s also very soft and smooth. I will continue to use this product maybe 1-2x per week just to be safe, and will edit this review if anything bad happens! I bought these products from Walgreens, not on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy  hair and when it gets dry, it frizzes. In addition, I dye my hair dark brown approx every 6 weeks. I must say that I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: It cleans well without stripping my color and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It has also cut down on the time it takes me to style my hair. After shampooing and conditioning (I use the [[ASIN:B005SPETHW Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Color Care Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] also), I add a little bit of [[ASIN:B0097VXTPQ Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce (Value Pack of 3) [Item #81502]]] to my hands, rub them together to warm the oil, apply evenly throughout my hair, and then blow dry. No more straightening with an iron! I just curl the ends and my hair looks fabulous. I am so happy to find a product that works for my hair and it doesn&#x27;t cost a mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the leave-in and serum next. Will post reviews when I do.</li>
    <li> It relaxes my hair, and makes my hair free of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the conditioner,  they are my best buy !</li>
    <li> I have thick, bushy, very frizzy and unmanageable hair...that also happens to be going prematurely gray/white, so I color it. I have always hated my hair. I saw this and the matching conditioner in a store a few weeks ago and figured I would give it a try. I didn&#x27;t even expect much, but it is great! My hair is so much smoother and more manageable. One of my co-workers actually asked me what I used on my hair a couple days after I used it, and some of my students asked if I flat ironed my hair:-) (It looks a lot like it does when flat ironed, with a little more body.)I am starting to actually like my hair! Lucky for me, this stuff is very affordable. I also like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the conditioner &amp; leave in conditioner for my frizzy dry hair.  It took about a week but the results are great.  My hair almost looks saloon amazing.  I would recommend this for any woman with undesirable hair.</li>
