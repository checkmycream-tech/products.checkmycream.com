<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This soap looks great on paper, and there are many glowing reviews, but after only a few days of use, I found it to be not only drying, but irritating . &amp;#34;Different soaps for different folks&amp;#34;--apparently.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT fragrance free as advertised. It contains natural fragrance which is not the same as fragrance free. If you need fragrance free, definitely buy a different product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes you feel very clean!</li>
    <li> Gave some bars to friends.  We love it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Clean and silky skin after I use it.  Rinses out of the bath tub.  Happy, Happy, Happy.</li>
    <li> This is my bath soap.  Lots of suds.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on all the wonderful things you can do with this soap and am very disappointed. I have tried melting it down into liquid hand soap and it has the texture of snot. I tried a recipe to make my own liquid castile soap out of these and it stays chunky. I have made several attempts and even tried several different recipes before determining this product is just not good. It is also very drying so not valuable as a bar soap.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, and just want to be squeaky clean. this is the best soap! Love it</li>
    <li> Excellent! I will buy this soap again. I like that is is fragrance free. and cheap.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin.  I still use as a gardening hand soap</li>
    <li> I can never find the fragrance free Kirk&#x27;s Castile in the stores, in fact, I did not know it existed! The original scented was a bit harsh for me, this is great.</li>
    <li> We have become hooked on Kirks Castile soap both kinds the scented and unscented. The scented one is very subtle (think a light version of Ivory soap). It lathers well and does melt faster than soaps with chemicals but I love the idea of putting something that has very few ingredients that cleans my skin, lathers well and  plus with the added benefit of the coconut oil in it makes me feel like its pulling toxins from my skin. The fragrance free version is totally scentless. I love it!!  We will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Good soap I have sensitive skin and it has help better than the ordinary soaps you buy at the grocery store</li>
    <li> Was looking for an ewg.org friendly soap and I find it (only fragrance free rates high).  Cleans well and is good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I shred these and use them in my homemade laundry detergent.  Excellent product.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very good, natural soap.  I don&#x27;t use soap on my face, but it is a good bath soap--so much better than most commercial varieties!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap in about 10 years but was given a bar as sort of a gag in my Christmas stocking. Now I use it daily again. Simple, makes me feel clean, only a little light clean scent, perfect. And, if you work up a lather it&#x27;s a surprisingly effective shaving soap - much better than any effort you&#x27;ve had to make with another type of soap when you find yourself without shaving gel or cream.</li>
    <li> wonderful soap, will buy again</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have used it to make laundry soap and other items.  I would but it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only bar soap that we buy now.  We all have sensitive skin and find that this works wonderfully for us!</li>
    <li> Price was too high. Finally found it in a local store for much less.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Great lather and great smell.  Does not irritate my skin....so far. I like smelling fresh and clean and this soap definitely does that.</li>
    <li> We are using this for hand washing dishes and we liked it. The only downside is that it melts if it is wet. Putting it in a dry soap drain after use helps with the melting problem.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, I called up the company and they told me it&#x27;s not truly fragrance free - there&#x27;s a natural scent to coconut oil.  I have fragrance and food allergies but decided to try it and see how scented fragrance free soap could be.  Well, it&#x27;s very scented or at least to me it is!  I got a headache smelling and using it.  Once the soap touched my skin, I had an allergic reaction and found out I&#x27;m allergic to coconut oil.  Burning, hotness, itching, annoyed feeling.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product and lasts a long time, but please note a) it does have a scent and b) make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to coconut!  Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money.</li>
    <li> I like this soap very much. It can be used for face, or bath or even to wash hair. It is very mild.</li>
    <li> Love it! Pure soap. I make face and body wash as well as hand wash  with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap since I was a kid.  It is the only soap that works with hard water</li>
    <li> I just used it for the first time today.  We were at Cracker Barrell restaurant last night and did some shopping after dinner.  I spotted this soap and just had to buy a bar since I have always wanted to try it.  We paid $1.49 for a 4 oz bar, in the gift shop.  This morning when I used it, I was amazed at how much of a lather I got, unlike Dove or Ivory bars.  No scent, did not irritate my skin at all.  I am very impressed.  I have very sensitive skin and have Guttate Psoriasis.  Because of my psoriasis, I try to keep to soaps that don&#x27;t have much scent.  A good lather is really important too, to me.  I am amazed with the price that Amazon wants for this stuff.  $2.48 is crazy compared to the $1.49 we paid at Cracker Barrel.</li>
    <li> This soap is great--it is gentle and can be used by a member of our household with skin allergies/contact dermatitis with no problems.</li>
    <li> After using &amp;#34;Kirk&#x27;s Castile: Coco Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free 4 oz (5 pack)&amp;#34; I am convinced, and have proven, that the soap caused severe welts, swelling, and itching to most of my body. The lower portion of my face had significant swelling over a period of days. I experienced swelling on my neck and lower part of my scalp. The itching was insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the doctor because I did not understand what was happening. The doctor did not know the origin of the problem. After a week of eliminating various products I use, and carefully watching what I swallowed and what touched my body, clearly the culprit was &amp;#34;Kirk&#x27;s Castile: Coco Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free 4 oz (5 pack).&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap not only should be, but MUST BE REMOVED FROM AMAZON! This soap is chemically poisonous, and a health hazzard, I threw the soap in the trash, and strongly feel that my money should be reimbursed, (Including what I paid for the doctor&#x27;s visit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean13</li>
    <li> Nowhere NEAR as good as the scented version. The scented version is one of the best values out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost sent these back. Giving these away to my kids instead. :)</li>
    <li> Since I haven&#x27;t yet used this product I just want to address the fragrance that many reviewers have talked about. Yesterday I grated my soap and  became quite familiar with the scent. If you get this exact product, in the light blue wrapper it does have a natural smell. The soap is made from the fats of coconut and the scent is light &amp; clean and no more than what I&#x27;d expect. There are NO ADDED fragrances though. For instance I recently purchased an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; shower gel at a local store. At the bottom of list it said &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34; and by now I know that means it may or may not actually be natural. Sure enough I get it home and it smells like how I would dream coconuts should smell which tells me it&#x27;s a manufactured scent. That&#x27;s not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve actually used the soap!</li>
    <li> This soap dried my skin completely out after about two weeks of using it. I switched back to the other brand I was using.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you want to make your own dish- and laundry soap and scent it with your OWN essential oils . . . even though the original Kirk&#x27;s scent was very mild, I&#x27;m pleased to have an unscented version.</li>
    <li> Love this. Used to use Dove. This is the vegan and cruelty free equivalent.</li>
    <li> Many good reviews for this basic soap. I was trying to get away from so many chemicals. However, I was very sensitive to something in it and my hands got a rash, then peeled. Thank goodness, a bar never made it to the shower!</li>
    <li> I ordered these bars on February 26th and the order wasn&#x27;t sent out until March 3rd. Why it takes almost a week to send out a package is beyond me. As for the soap I can&#x27;t comment on that yet, but they seem quite a bit smaller than Dr. Bonners. Initially I thought this was a good deal, but after shipping costs the price went up (for 5 bars) from $7.02 to $13.10. Still not a bad deal, but if I&#x27;m going to pay almost the cost of the product for shipping I&#x27;m expecting the product to be sent out for delivery the same day, or at the very least the next day.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free, for years and like it a lot for three reasons.  First, in my hard water area, Kirk&#x27;s lathers up quickly and abundantly.  Second, it rinses off even more quickly.  And third, I also use it as a shampoo and, as such, it&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my scalp.  In sum, it&#x27;s a successful product that I&#x27;ve come to depend on.</li>
    <li> Great price, still using them to make my own liquid castile soap, and grating this for my laundry mix.</li>
    <li> 5 out of 5:&lt;br /&gt;Love the soap, been using it off and on for 30 years but it&#x27;s getting hard to find lately. People not familiar with this product due to low advertising causing this. Computer scanning of low sales volume are causing the item to be eliminated from merchant stock items.\\&quot;Shipping was as advertised but the price is way out of bounds...noticed 2 lower price changes since my order at $13.13 for the five bars I received. That&#x27;s $2.62 cents for each bar. Just yesterday saw a package of 3 bars at Walmart of the same soap, kirks Castile for $3.26. That&#x27;s just a price of about $1.09 per bar vs $2.62 your price??? Too rich for my part...no more orders here..Thank you.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel dry while using and caused my genital area to itch. It did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a alternative for shampoo, as I have done this in the past without a problem and my hair was fine, not over-drying, no breakage or anything. Well, I ended up moving, and went back to the typical routine of using shampoo to wash my hair. Although there is nothing wrong with that, I end up going through shampoo like crazy since my hair is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet for bar soap that can also be used successfully as shampoo, and came across Kirk&#x27;s Castile Coco Bar Soap. I was a bit skeptical about the lathering people claimed it does, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised. It lathered very quickly and was a soft lather that left no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell already that this soap will be my new bar soap shampoo since it is soft, lathers quickly, and there is no fragrance to it, which I love! For shampoo, all I had to do is rub the bar on my scalp only 2 to 3 times before I got a MASSIVE amount of lather. Its wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have compared prices and amounts, and I can say that these people who sell it here, have a great price. I also like the fact that they have multiple choices on how many you receive. My first order was the 5 pack, and was I glad I went out on a limb and bought this. These five bars cost a few dollars more than my choice shampoo, but they last soooo much longer. I like this alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend as a bath soap or hair shampoo, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> lathers  up well..very good soap...did not like the fragrance..but this one is fine..I wish my local store would carry the fragrance free  but they only have  the fragrant one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
    <li> I am so excited to make my own liquid soap with this and my doTERRA essential oils!</li>
    <li> i love this soap, it does melt fast though. i am quite surprised that  3 pack is doubled the price i pay for them at walmart. i hate that store, but i am on a budget. its $3.47 for a 3 pack there. cant beat that!</li>
    <li> We use this as soap, in our homemade laundry detergent, and cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell but it cleans and that&#x27;s all we care about. It&#x27;s very gentle on skin which is good for me because I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything.</li>
    <li> Very cleansing, I use this aoap with a lufa sponge for cleaning my face.. But... don&#x27;t leave the soap on your more sensitive skin areas very long. There will be a burning sensation.. I still highly recommend this soap...Follow my precaution.</li>
    <li> Love smell and feel of this soap. Leaves my skin feeling wonderfully clean and fresh. I was using a brand that was nothing special when I happened on this soap. After the first use, I bought a pack and have since used only this soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap thinking that it would be gentle - I have strangely delicate skin - and, well, it isn&#x27;t. While showering, if I don&#x27;t rinse immediately, the soap starts to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my skin. It&#x27;s also very drying - usually not a bad thing as I have oily skin but, in this case, it led to peeling and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a marvelous lather and the bars last fairly well in the shower, so long as they dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirk&#x27;s is an old and reputable company and this is a terrific product - just not for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use before backpacking into the National Forests. It cleans well, but leaves a strong soap smell (stronger than the other brand I finally settled on), but not a big deal. The biggest problem is that it leaves an oily residue that is hard to get off, this is a major problem to me, but might not bother others.</li>
    <li> Finally a soap that lathers well in our hard water, that doesn&#x27;t have fragrance added, and that is also affordable.  We&#x27;ll be buying a case of this soap soon!</li>
    <li> Ideal stuff for making hypo-allergenic laundry soap. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered and have been perfectly satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for the past four or five years and it is the only soap I use. I highly recommend it for those who want lots of soapy suds in their shower or bath. Leaves the skin soft, too.</li>
    <li> I used this soap growing up, my Mom said it would clear up Exema, it sure helped a lot, I don&#x27;t have the problem today. I was thrilled to find it again cuz it lathers up in Florida&#x27;s 14 grain/gallon HARD water.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. The soap was NOT fragrance free, but was scented. I am chemically sensitive and allergic and must avoid all fragrances. I had to throw it away as I did not have time to return it.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent!</li>
    <li> Burns your skin! Aside from that, one bar last less than a week, because it melts very very fast.  Switched to Bronners Baby Soap.</li>
    <li> I use these for bathing, making washing powder and cleaning supplies. Best price I have been able to find and I love the product. Even my husband has started using these bars for bathing and just loves the way his skin feels and looks.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Get extra because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soap but is great.</li>
    <li> I found this soap at a discount store and began using it.  It changed the entire way I look at soaps.  I have sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t use soaps with a lot of perfumes.  The less the better.  This soap has just a little fragance. The lather is sends you to heaven. After a few showers, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to use as much lotion to moisturize my skin.  I returned this soap because it was much cheaper at the discount stores.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THAT THIS SOAP IS MORE NATURAL IN INGREDIENTS. NO CHEMICALS IN INGREDIENTS AND PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE. WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THIS SOAP OR KISS MY FACE BRAND SOAPS.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s natural with no harmful chemicals and it makes my skin soft. I buy fragrance free to avoid any possible harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> The good is that the (white wrapper) bar is large, and it make lots of lather easily. The bad is that there is a strong smell of lime juice, and worse, it irritates my genitals. If you want purity and mildness, then get something else.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free, vegan, and without aloe. It&#x27;s a hard combo to find and this soap fills it and works nicely too.</li>
    <li> Tried a couple  bars from Whole Foods  (cheapest and pure clean) because I was on a fast. The wife loved the stuff and promptly bought a surplus! Helps me with candida since it&#x27;s made from coconut oil. Clean, good soap. Skin never felt better.</li>
    <li> My son suffers from eczema and has been using this soap since he was younger.  It works great for him and bought in the 5 pack was a great price considering what it sells for in the store near by.</li>
    <li> This has always been a favorite of mine, the soap foams up great, smells nice without being overpowering, and is inexpensive.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> love this soap. love the light scent (almost none, but just a hint). wish a bar lasted longer, but it&#x27;s otherwise fantastic.</li>
    <li> GREAT price for these!! Much more expensive at the grocery store</li>
    <li> I bought this use in a formula for a garden spray...it seems to do the job! I just think the cost could be cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have to be fragrance free. I&#x27;ve tried multiple soaps, spent lots of money on unscented products and this one is the best for the money and lasts the longest in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap on and off my entire life!  It&#x27;s a great product and the quality is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This gentle soap reduces skin irritations and psoriasis.</li>
    <li> For those of you who have sensitive skin and find this soap irritating it&#x27;s probably the fragrance. I noticed that even natural fragrance in body care products can irritate if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents like me. The ingredients of this soap are actually very simple and gentle but there are two versions of it: &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; (which does contain a strong scent) and the &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s why I always make sure to buy the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; version (I&#x27;ve found that buying directly from the Kirks Castile manufacturers website is the best price if that helps anyone else.)</li>
    <li> Pleased to find soap with no &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; - when you see the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; , think &amp;#34;pthalates&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cancer&amp;#34; - manufacturers escape the truth in labeling law by hiding bad things in the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; thanks to  perfume/fragrance manufacturer&#x27;s claim they can&#x27;t disclose what&#x27;s in it because it is &amp;#34;proprietary&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;trade secret.  So I buy things that are fragrance-free.  The only fragrances that are okay with me are Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> It is soap that worked for what I was using it for.&lt;br /&gt;I grated it down and made household cleaners and hand soap refills.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap.  My skin feels soft and even better, it contains natural ingredients and is animal cruelty free.  I have been using this soap for about 4yrs now.  When I saw it on Amazon, I could not help myslef to purchase the pack of 4. :)</li>
    <li> Was 100% not fragrance free. I even ordered twice and contacted and said make sure to send fragrance free and both times I received the one with fragrance. I am not very happy at all about this. I am making laundry detergent for an infant.</li>
    <li> We use this as our soap in the shower and we all love it in our family.  Wish it was available everywhere!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing - simple ingredients, an EWG rating of 0 (meaning it&#x27;s totally nontoxic, which is incredibly hard to find these days), and incomparable cleaning power.  I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t use this - they should.</li>
    <li> Quite like this soap. Leaves skin clear and soft. Excellent value, I almost always purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> cleanest soap....best natural stuff.  Recommended for acne related allergies.&lt;br /&gt;really works.</li>
    <li> Full bath means it can be used as a hair shampoo and body soap, it does it all.  I have used this soap for a long time.  It is different than most soaps and i don&#x27;t know what you can compare it to.  It is in a class of it&#x27;s own, has an almost translucent quality.  It is very &#x27;free rinsing&#x27; which is another thing i like about it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this soap for being fragrance and additive free. Nice frothy bubbles and does the job. Good price considering it&#x27;s 3 to 5 dollars apiece in the health food store. It&#x27;s even Less expensive than Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I love this soap in the scented version, but I am sensitive to fragrance and wanted to try the unscented (I didn&#x27;t see it an any of the stores that carry Kirk&#x27;s).  The unscented is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This soap is great, I love it.  I am allergic to corn, which is in nearly everything.  This fragrance-free version is perfect.  I am through a few bars now and will continue to buy it instead of any other hand or bath soap.</li>
    <li> I love this sudsy soap! It gets high rankings from the Environmental Working Group, is totally non-irritating (even on my most delicate tissues) and is non-drying. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a very soft soap so it doesn&#x27;t last long. If it lasted as long as Tom&#x27;s Sensitive Skin or Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap, this would be my hands-down favorite. But because each bar lasts only half as long as those other brands, I&#x27;d have to say that Tom&#x27;s gets my vote (so far) as best environmentally sound bar soap.</li>
    <li> I just adore this soap.  I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates.  I&#x27;ve been through the normal store bought soaps, they all dry out my hands.  Kirk&#x27;s castile takes a tiny amount to foam up, then rinses off very cleanly.  It does not dry out my hands at all, the ph balance is very nice.</li>
    <li> This soap works up a nice lather and has pretty much no smell. It seems to clean without drying out your skin as much as regular soaps and body washes.</li>
    <li> We are using this to make our own laundry detergent.  Thanks for the great service and great product. Will use again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap after reading all the great reviews. After a few uses my skin started to burn. It wasn&#x27;t just me, my husband and son also had the same reaction. I first used it on my face and after 3 washes, not only did my face burn, it looked like I had really bad sunburn. I didn&#x27;t think it could have been this soap, then I used it on my body in the shower and it burned my skin and privates. I really don&#x27;t understand how this could happen because it&#x27;s fragrant free and the ingredience are good. Whatever the case, be very careful.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap!</li>
    <li> Been searching for a while for a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; old-fashioned soap.  By &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, I mean a soap that doesn&#x27;t have a list of ingredients that goes on and on.  I am now on my 2nd 5-pack order.  This soap lathers up nicely, rinses clean, and has a nice clean smell.  It&#x27;s fragrance-free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have a smell--it smells like SOAP!  Showering daily, I find one bar lasts about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance but definitely has a nice (very very very faint) smell of it&#x27;s own. Nice lather. It&#x27;s a little on the soft side, though. It seems like we went through it so quickly. I like Kirk&#x27;s but I just prefer a harder bar of soap.</li>
    <li> BEST SOAP LIKE DR BONNERS.  GREAT FOR WASHING ANTHING. GETS YOU CLEAN AND RINSES WITH LITTLE WATER, YOU CAN BRUSH YOUR TEETHE WITH THESE SOAPS THAT ARE BIO DEGRADABLE AND DO NOT HARM THE ENVIORNMENT , AND HAVE A GREAT SMELL TO THEM. ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A GREAT NON ALLERGIC SOAP THAT CLEANS SUPER WELL, EVEN FOR HAND WASHING SOME CLOTHES THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED.</li>
    <li> Very drying. Even with moustirizing excessively after a shower....tlmy akin dried out. Not useful for normal or even slightly oily skin. I have since switched to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille Soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for making ritual soaps and they work beautifully.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Best soap for my hard water. Really lathers and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve used it for 20 years and never had septic issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, not special except minimalist ingredients and cost effective.</li>
    <li> love this soap, no fragrance, no additives, just  plain old soap.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE LATHER FROM THIS SOAP. I HAVE HARD WATER AND FEW SOAPS WILL GIVE A GOOD LATHER IN HARD WATER. I DID NOT BY THESE FOR THAT PURPOSE. I BOUGHT THEM TO USE AS THE BASE FOR HOMEMADE LIQUID HAND SOAP AND HOMEMADE LAUNDRY DETERGENT. CANT FIND THIS SOAP IN MY AREA. I REMEMBER THE LATHER FROM WHEN I WAS A KID AND WAS HAPPY TO FIND A PLACE WHERE I COULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much.  I&#x27;ve very concerned with chemicals and fragrance in most soaps.  My skin is VERY sensitive, and I break out in rashes to anything with unnatural ingredients.  Kirks is great and best of all it takes off mascara!  I used to use grape seed oil to take makeup off, and the coconut oil in Kirks does the same.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Product works too well with hard water as it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the regular Coco Castile Bar Soap, original. It dissolves rather quickly and reminds me of the &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; factor of glycerin soap albeit not as fast. For the money buy the regular and not the Fragrance free as it lasts less than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I use this soap all the time.  I like it and especially since amazon carries it. It is a very good soap for my face. It takes away all the dirt and it leaves my face so smooth.  I can use it over and over again with out no irritation like all the other soaps leave.  I have no red spots or rashes from this soap. I make it a priority to get this soap. Just one draw back, it goes so fast. Plus it is great for your body also.  So if you are looking for a mild soap, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this one.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> It turns out this is not actually fragrance-free. I know, right? But not only is it very strong-smelling, the list of ingredients on the package include &amp;#34;natural fragrances.&amp;#34; It would be fine if they advertised &amp;#34;no artificial fragrances,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re saying; they&#x27;re saying the soap has no fragrance(s) at all. Lies! :(</li>
    <li> Great for making homemade laundry soap.</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap.  Helped with my dry skin.  I&#x27;m still on the first bar.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Compared to what you make in your kitchen... this is alright. Make your own and be way happier buts not worth paing for the shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel and it has no scent.  My whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
    <li> coconut oil is for skin, cooking and even injesting (solid form) for dementia prevention ( I heard from net)---so soap here is what one should use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this natural product dries my skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does lather well...</li>
    <li> Major fan!  This is soap.  Just soap.  No additives, chemicals or scents.  It&#x27;s plain old fashioned clean and pure soap.  What a refreshing product.  Lathers extremely well.  Nice feel to it.  No softeners in it so rinse it off well.  It&#x27;s just soap, that&#x27;s all.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great soap!! Only need to use a little to get a rich lather and leaves my skin soft. I find that it reduces armpit odor as well (probably becuase of the coconut oil?) so can get away without deodorant on most days ;)</li>
    <li> Love this soap - haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for years - glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> Just simple ingredients without the harsh chemicals (sulfates, parabens, artificial fragrances) most soap have.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, packed well and intacted.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it was the original scented one. My mistake. It is awesome soap, though, with lots of thick lather and is made with coconut oil. Kirk&#x27;s brand is my new favorite in soaps, I&#x27;ll be buying it again</li>
    <li> I paid extra &amp; expected to get &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; soap but received the regular fragranced soap. I will be returning this soap.</li>
    <li> Works without causing allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised.  Soap is great. Does the job and even lathers better than my husband anticipated with our untreated water. Needed unscented for a group meeting and this product works fantastic. If you need Fragrance Free soap, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Our water is very hard. I was looking for a bath soap that would foam without leaving us feeling slick. This soap is perfect.  It is inexpensive, fairly long lasting and fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I use this soap instead of other toxic body/shampoo washes. Only thing to be cautious of is it does tend to dry you out depending, but it could also have to do with what is in our water unless you have a filter. Will continue to use until I make my own body wash/shampoo. Recommended product.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Love even more that I&#x27;m not putting surfactants and other chemicals on my family.</li>
    <li> For a sensitive skin soap, it&#x27;s a little harsh.</li>
    <li> Whenever you can, buy in bulk. That&#x27;s what I always say. This makes good sense at around $1 a bar and the 5-pack will last a year or more.</li>
    <li> I switched to this soap from Zest. It makes lots of rich lather, rinses well and has absolutely NO odor. I use it head to toe and feel cleaner than I ever have before. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> love this soap gets you clean and leaves no residue</li>
    <li> As always 5 stars. Love this soap as a base for my liquid shampoo recipe.</li>
    <li> love it been using it for years</li>
    <li> It looks like Kirk&#x27;s does actually make a &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34; bar, like what is shown in this picture.... However, what I, and apparently several other customers received, was NOT FRAGRANCE FREE. It is a completely different bar than what is shown and listed here. It is the Kirk&#x27;s original, which has listed a &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34; of unknown origin, and is Extremely strong smelling, like a detergent. For people who are very sensitive to fragrances, I certainly do Not suggest this. I went ahead and tried it since I was stuck with it, and it burned my skin and the burn plus Extremely dry feeling lasted 24 hrs. So then I decided to just wash my hair with it, and it does OK, but even the lather running down still burned the rest of my skin, but not scalp. I don&#x27;t think this is due to the Fragrance, even though that is Very strong, because another customer had the same problem and she apparently Did receive the Fragrance Free kind. But I would not suggest it for any body cleansing, with or without fragrance, because of this caustic element.  I&#x27;m going to try using it to wash clothes and hope it doesn&#x27;t cause problems since it washes off well and is all natural.</li>
    <li> Simple plant based, natural, short ingredient list. No chemical ingredients. Non toxic. No fragrance. I love it. Not as pricy as other natural soaps. Stock up on this, it is my everyday soap go to. It washes away clean. It looks and behaves like any other soap, but is healthier for you and your skin. It is white. It is a good size-- not to small or too big and heavy. It is just right. I love it.</li>
    <li> Update 9/26&lt;br /&gt;Downgrading my rating from 4 to 2 stars because this soap started really drying my skin out.  Especially my hands. I rotate between a few bar soaps, and inevitably, when I would use this soap, after a couple days my hands would start to feel super dry a few minutes out of the shower.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent natural soap.  No freaky chemicals, just simple ingredients.  I will list them since it doesnt appear in the Amazon description: Coconut soap, water, vegetable glycerin, coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers nicely, rinses clean (I have moderately hard water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it melts really fast.  1 bar lasts me about a week.  And I don&#x27;t linger in the shower.  Although, perhaps that&#x27;s why the soap rinses so clean from my body...  Just something to be aware of when you&#x27;re purchasing this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - the best price is at Vitacost. 4 oz bar is $1. But it&#x27;s only a deal if you buy enough for free shipping ($49 min purchase). Maybe buy 49 bars of this soap since it melts so fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it melts quick though, I recommend it and would purchase again.</li>
