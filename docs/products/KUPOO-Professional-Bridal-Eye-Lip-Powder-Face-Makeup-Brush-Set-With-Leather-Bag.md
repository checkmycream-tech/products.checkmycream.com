      <li>I love them so happy to have every brush I need and they match :)</li>
      <li>I wanted a nice beginning brush set but did not want to spend a arm and a leg for one</li>
      <li>I washed them in warm water and antibacterial soap.</li>
      <li>I honestly have no complaints.</li>
      <li>However, brushes looked of good quality and it had many options with pouch.</li>

      <li>I would have liked an angled eyeliner brush (with an angled ferrule and pointed brush), but its not a reason to give the set a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Applied makeup nicely.</li>
      <li>Perfectly priced and decent quality.</li>
      <li>but when I received the product it had a very strong chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m relatively pleased with this kit (except for the spade-shaped sponge applicator like the kind you might get in a palette which are garbage and didn&#x27;t need to be included in this kit).</li>
      <li>And they aren&#x27;t cheap, they are good quality.</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly though!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ordered these for my niece, who was looking for some new brushes. She said the large brushes are soft and hold their shape. She said the smaller ones are firmer but still soft enough that its not painful to use. I&#x27;m glad I bought her these and not the super expensive ones that can run $20 a brush. Super happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love it! They work amazing!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> Really cute and complete set of brushes. Before buying them I read the reviews in detail and since basically everyone like them I went ahead and bought them first because of the great price, because it includes 24 brushes, third it is pink so its cute and lastly since I am a beginner and i do not wear makeup constantly it sounded like a good deal for me. When you open them the brushes do have like an acrylic smell so i guess either air them for a while or wash them should be a good idea. I have not tried them yet, but when I do I will probably update and let you know if they do their job.</li>
    <li> I honestly bought these just to put on my new vanity. They are so pretty!</li>
    <li> I instantly fell in love with these. Good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> I loooooooove them!!! I recieved them as a gift from my boyfriend and just got them today, it probably took them 3 weeks to arrive but soooo worth it! The brushes bristles are hot pink and they are sooo soft to touch on my face. I&#x27;ve seen brushes with about the same or less quality than these and they are $10 or $9 dlls each at wal-mart... I always wanted a nice set of brushes like these before but they were pricey. These are soft , perfect, cute, everything but for a lot less. I would buy them again. They do smell a bit like glue but I do not even care! They are amazing!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes fell apart but I use about a quarter of them every day. To be expected for the price.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had asked for these for Christmas.  When she opened the package, she was thrilled.  She loves the huge variety of brushes.</li>
    <li> This product was okay, but it seems like a brush was missing in the carrier. I counted them and their were all there. However, when I used the foundation brush, it gotten really dirty while using it. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the stain of my foundation off the brush whenever I decided to clean it. Oh! And another thing I notice about the brushes is that you have to be extremely careful when you washing decide them cuz the paint will chip off. Overall, you give what you pay for!</li>
    <li> That brushes are cute bout it does not grave the make up very good I have to keep on blending so it can hold on makeup.</li>
    <li> This SUMERSHA 24pcs Roll up Case Cosmetic Brushes are so cute and are in pink! I got excited when I received them but a few of them shed, I was blending my eyeshadow and suddenly, there were a lot of small hair in my face, so I do not use the ones that shed anymore. These are perfect if you love collecting brushes and just want them for display, but if you really want good brushes, these aren&#x27;t the them sadly. Though, I washed them with mild shampoo/soap, they(the ones that do not shed) were still in GOOD condition and the smell was good! So, I would still recommend them, but if the person is picky, it is wayyy better to just buy expensive brushes since they are in much better quality and will be useful for a long time. I got them for about $14-15 at the time.</li>
    <li> My lil sister loved it.Color is the same as the picture and the quality is good,</li>
    <li> Love this. Great quality and soft  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes.... Myself and grand daughters having more fun now putting all our make-up on.</li>
    <li> All the brushes came and work really well. It&#x27;s my first brush set and I love it.</li>
    <li> They are way to long ....  and not as puffy  as they seem.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong the brushes are beautiful, but I had so many problems with this order! Do not wish to purchase this again ever! The problems were taken care of later on but this was a headache!</li>
    <li> Mice my first brushed</li>
    <li> Cheaply made!! Don&#x27;t buy them!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes and fast shipping!  I would have gave it five stars but when I received the product it had a very strong chemical smell.  Other than that, I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> I bought this for  my 19 years  old daughter,&lt;br /&gt;She seems to  used it a lot, I loves it.</li>
    <li> Not as fluffy as they look in the picture. Feel a little cheap and the hairs shine like barbie hair.</li>
    <li> Teen daughter, who is so into makeup, LOVES these brushes!</li>
    <li> I love it brushes work very good..</li>
    <li> Not a bad starter set however one of my brushes came right off the handle as I brushed it against my brow.. 1st day of use..I hate sending things back especially when I need them right away, so I&#x27;ll keep these.</li>
    <li> I wanted a nice beginning brush set but did not want to spend a arm and a leg for one so I decided on these after reading the other reviews. It came with everything as shown. They are so soft and so cute with being pink. Comes in a nice case to hold them all. I did notice a little smell like paint but it&#x27;s no big deal to me. I&#x27;m sure in time it will go away. I love this set! I just need to find out what each brush does now. :)</li>
    <li> I like this set of brushes. Really soft and nice to use . The color is a plus as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely perfection. So many different brushes for such an affordable price, can&#x27;t go wrong. And i absolutely love the color! They&#x27;re so pretty. The metallic pink case it came with is also great! Ive used them twice already and they work beautifully. I did have a hard time washing off my foundation off the white bristles on the foundation brush :\ i used baby shampoo with 7 washes and it still looks a tad bit dirty.Only downfall of having such nice white brushes is that they will stain a bit. Overall really great brushes. Super soft and apply makeup like a brush should.</li>
    <li> The brushes are a little more softer than I expected, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them.  I will add more once I do.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so phenomenal! I use these everyday and I am impressed everyday all over again. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this brush set.  It has every brush I could possibly need for my own personal makeup application.  One brush head had fallen off upon arrival (hence the 4 stars-not 5) but a little glue fixed that. No problems with brush &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; coming off during use.  Also travels well.</li>
    <li> Thankfully I mostly needed eye brushes. Good set for the price.The large face brushes don&#x27;t really look like the picture. There kind of a cheap looking peach color that barely pick up any product. Plus the smell was bad. After I washed them, most of them were okay but a couple eyeshadow brushes smelled Soooo bad I threw it out. Shipped very quickly though!</li>
    <li> Greatttt set they&#x27;re so cute</li>
    <li> I ordered these makeup brushes , and they came in super fast took only three days  (: I love them !! Very high quality !</li>
    <li> Incredible value and all you will need to do a great job.  Very happy I purchased these. My job just got easier.  Yay.</li>
    <li> i absolutly love this set soo beautiful and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;i did a unboxing review on my youtube channel&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FiP1E0nhoas&amp;list&#x3D;UU4GRw3gdpE49v7IOEfLTWUg&amp;index&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> This bristle brushes loose while you wear them</li>
    <li> Softest brushes ever! Other than needing a short fat kabuki brush, this is a complete set of all you need to MAKE it UP!!! ;-)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s 22 not 24 but still love the brushes.</li>
    <li> Its a really great deal on this price. Plus excellent color.there us too many even some I don&#x27;t know how to use .this thing helpful to the costumers if it comes with instructions .love it though</li>
    <li> The item came a day early which was great. I love the brushes they are soft and so pretty pink. The only thing is they have a slight smell... like nail polish but once you air them out (a few hours) and wash them they are great.</li>
    <li> Just like the pic.. Super soft too.. I love them .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting along for years now with a limited set of high-quality brushes, but realized I needed a few more to expand my collection. Not willing to spend over twenty dollars per brush (seriously, an angled eyeliner brush even), I looked carefully at many sets before selecting this one. Despite its very few reviews, they were all positive, and the set offered 24 brushes for a low price, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, because I wasn&#x27;t risking much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set contains 5 face brushes (foundation, liquid foundation, 2 blush/bronzer, a small fan brush, and highlighter), 3 soft brown-bristled eye brushes (they are all listed as synthetic brushes, but these three feel more like natural), a small, brown-bristled stippling brush, 1 spooley, 1 eye lash/brow comb/brow brush, 1 pointed eyeliner brush, 2 angle brushes that can be used for liner or eyebrow powder, 1 double-sided sponge brush, 1 small, hard black sponge liner smudger, and various firm-bristled white and pink brushes that are a little ambiguous as to their exact use (most are for eyeshadow, but one is for lips and one is for concealer). None of the brushes are labeled, which makes it difficult to figure out the exact purpose of some brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t pick up loads and loads of product, which can be a little frustrating, but if you&#x27;re just starting out with make up, its probably better that way so you don&#x27;t overdo it. The pink and white eye brushes have a little difficulty picking up firm powder products and seem to have as much trouble depositing it on the skin (NB: this was not the case when an eye primer was used, and since i am an avid user or primer, I only noticed this on a bare skin swatch.) They do, however, work fine with wet application, such as dipping the brush in water and using it on a baked shadow, and worked wonderfully with a loose pigment. The liner brushes picked up product well, although the pointed liner brush arrived fluffed out a little instead of smooth (rolling it in the gel liner instead of just swiping it over kept the point together well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brushes look great and work well enough. The hot pink brushes are all made with wavy fibers, which although synthetic is what you usually find in high end brands that use goat hair. After washing every single brush before use, I think maybe 5 or 6 bristles TOTAL came out, and being synthetic they dried very fast. I would have liked an angled eyeliner brush (with an angled ferrule and pointed brush), but its not a reason to give the set a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case did smell like acrylic when I first opened it, but I let it air out and its fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get this kit for any vegan make up enthusiast, your teenager whom you may not want to invest hundreds of dollars in for make up brushes she may not ever use nor know how to use, anyone who travels a lot and wants a concise, well-rounded kit instead of a random handful of brushes, or any beauty school student or someone who&#x27;s just learning the ropes. I&#x27;ve been doing my own and others make up for over ten years now and I&#x27;m relatively pleased with this kit (except for the spade-shaped sponge applicator like the kind you might get in a palette which are garbage and didn&#x27;t need to be included in this kit). I did notice about two loose ferrules, but nothing serious.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my sister. It arrived quickly. Pros: The brushes are a great quality. The larger brushes are super soft yet strong enough to hold its shape. The smaller brushes are firmer but still has a great softness at the tip. Cons: I wish all the brushes were either pink or pink and white to keep it more uniform (but this is mostly likely due to the role of the brush, what it&#x27;s used for), the case arrived really wrinkled, if you have the time before giving it as a gift let them air out. All in all I am very pleased with this product and would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. ...great variety and good quality for the price</li>
    <li> I was super excited when these brushes arrived(about 4 days after ordering). I used them on my off day so I could really take my time and play with most, if not, all of them. Some of the consumer were correct with about the slight odor but after I got passed that with baby shampoo and lukewarm water, I absolutely loved my end results.</li>
    <li> In love..although they did have a sharpie marker oder to them..I washed them and that went away..also super fast shipping! A+++</li>
    <li> I love these and  had a hard time giving them to my daughter for Christmas. ; ) Brushes are very soft and come neatly packaged.</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes today! They are so soft! Like I want them on my face. When you actually open them up they seem a little frightening (unless your a beauty guru) (I&#x27;m not) but you can just picture the beautiful masterpiece you can make with these! I really would suggest buying them!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and she loved them</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, their so cute and soft!</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loved these brushes!</li>
    <li> I love them so happy to have every brush I need and they match :)&lt;br /&gt;Package came quick what I see in the picture is exactly what I saw wen I opened them. Good buy I would recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Brushes are cheaply made and one of the brushes are already coming loose from the handle.  I just got them yesterday.</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY EXTREMELY disappointed with these brushes. Cheaply made! All pink brushes are hard and the only soft ones are the brown. But they pick up the product so poorly! I know you get what you pay for but after reading so many great reviews i thought I&#x27;d take the risk and hope i was getting a bargain. HUGE MISTAKE! Pls trust me and dont buy this product. Complete waste of time and money! This is something I&#x27;d give a 5 year old to play around with!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my brushes they are so soft and pretty I went through each one one at a time and everything was perfect I am 100% satisfied thank you</li>
    <li> I got the brushes and they are amazing I got them in 5 days shipping is amazing and they are beautiful and so soft</li>
    <li> Was a present for my sister and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift so cannot rate on performance. However, brushes looked of good quality and it had many options with pouch. My niece seemed super excited with it.</li>
    <li> The brushes were ordered about 4 months ago and to this day they are in perfect condition. I wash them once a week and use them every single day. I recommend all females to use this product, some hairs have came out, just like all brushes, but that if you pull really hard on them, which is what I did to test them when I first received them. I love these brushes and will definitely re-order them as a birthday present for my close friend.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my preteen to practice and play with. Perfectly priced and decent quality. The eyebrow brush broke but in my experience- they always break- that particular tool.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes sheds ALOT but other than that really good brushes</li>
    <li> Suppppper good brushes just the pink paint they use feels a little rubberish on your hands but over all the color is good and the brushes do not shed at all I LOVE these brushes</li>
    <li> Pretty pink brushes very soft And came as expected picture as expected.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Didn&#x27;t lose any of the brush when cleaned. Easy application. Pretty color. Great quality for the price, very soft. Applied makeup nicely.</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality</li>
    <li> Purchase it for someone and they love this product. Great deal for the price in my opinion and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just got my package in the mail. &amp; I have to say I love the color and all the brushes are just so soft. And the package that the brushes are held in I really like the pink I like that you can tie it. the only issue I have is that on my case there were two very noticeable black scuff marks the first one was on the front of where it says make up for you and the second scuff was actually on the inside on the main front of where all the brushes are. But I mean that&#x27;s the only two little discrepancies that I have with my order. But everything else is perfect I mean I would not say I would not buy this again just because of too little stuff I mean let&#x27;s face it it is for make-up. So I&#x27;m really really happy this shipment they were so fast I was told I was going to have it delivered on the 10th and I actually got it a day earlier. So just very very happy with it and I just cannot wait to use them and then probably give a better review on just the brushes themselves and how they apply the makeup.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They are so soft and work well with my skin. Just be sure to wash them before using and wash them often and they stay in great shape. I would definitely buy these again!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! The color is so pretty and the bristles are soft. They look 100 times better in person I was really impressed when I opened the case. Even the case is not that bad! It just smells a little like paint nothing serious. I aired them out and washed the brushes with hair conditioner and let them air dry. This was a great purchase and great price for this set. Don&#x27;t hesitate on getting them they are really worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for my wife as soon as we unpacked them she was amaze of the quality and color. But a few days later the big pink brush came off the stick. So she was disappointed</li>
    <li> SUPER SOFT. I love the vibrant color of the brushes and the bag. Slight smell, but wears off after a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Good shipping.  Brushes are not professional but are a good resource if you are wanting pretty brushes.</li>
    <li> some brushes fall apart immediately.</li>
    <li> Set is super cute. The color is great and the fluffier brushes are soft. The problem I have is the brown brushes shed a lot and a few of the eye brushes do not pick up product well. Will likely use only 1/3 of the set.</li>
    <li> Every brush you could ever need! And they aren&#x27;t cheap, they are good quality. Plus, they come in this awesome pink bag that stores them all!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. Their so cute and great quality for the price. I honestly have no complaints. Between the very fast shipping and low cost this was an amazing order.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for its price. I use it everyday</li>
    <li> Amazing, soft brushes for really cheap. I totaly recommend buying.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them. She says they&#x27;re very soft. She washed them first and well when she washed them the pink showed in the water. By the next wash it had stopped. They apply makeup very well.</li>
    <li> they are really soft and work awsome</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice and soft. Haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of shedding.</li>
    <li> Got these brushes a couple of weeks ago. Wanted to try them before writing a review. Love the pink for starters but hate they are not labeled. A lot of the brushes arrived with folded bristles. The bigger all pink bristles seem to be a waste, but overall the brushes clean ok leaving behind a little makeup. If you&#x27;re looking for a set of brushes to get the job done and are cute, here is a cheap set that will do the job.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for that price! Totally recommend them!</li>
    <li> So soft and pretty. They work really good.</li>
    <li> They are great! Super soft and amazing</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes today and I&#x27;m a little surprised they&#x27;re pink because the picture I saw was beige. The color doesn&#x27;t matter to me cuz my Beauty Blenders and all of my dupes are pink so they&#x27;ll match💖 All of the brushes are soft and in good condition. The big fan brush was a little messed up, but it is still usable. I might buy another fan brush separately. I received all of the brushes and none were missing, which is great. I also received them very fast. I just wish it came with a little guide paper saying what the brushes are for cuz some of these I have no idea what they&#x27;re for lol. Good brush kit for a good price💄💋 Thank you for the product</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes fell apart and bristles fall out alot but the other ones work well and for the price i cant complain alot</li>
    <li> Great size, neat, and lovely color .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these.  The face brushes are so long and fluffy they don&#x27;t work with my IQ Mineral makeup at all. The eye brushes are nice.</li>
    <li> Exelente las recomiendo.</li>
    <li> Simple. Just what I wanted. THANK YOU! :)</li>
    <li> I just got my order today October 16 and I was supposed to get them till late November which is pretty freakin awesome. I decide to go ahead and wash them because that&#x27;d be pretty gross if I didn&#x27;t and I noticed the ones with the brown hairs shed a bit but the other ones didn&#x27;t. I will go ahead and use them and see how they work and update how it goes with them.</li>
    <li> They do their job.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it is, if you drop them the handle of the brushes will crack, like I have a few on both.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, the purchase is absolutly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a reccomend if you want a &amp;#34;It&#x27;ll do.&amp;#34; no name brand make-up brush, I&#x27;m not picky, but if you are don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Arrived first day of estimated delivery date. Very soft brushes and came as described. I am very pleased with this order. This is a very nice set for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my gf and she loves em.  She has another smaller set as well and says they hold up well and work great.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I didnt want to spend alot and this was priced just right. Everyone talks about the smell but I didnt smell anything unusual nor did my daughter. I washed them in warm water and antibacterial soap. None of the hairs came out. As far as picking up product, I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 days now with eyeshadow and loose setting powder and I have no problem at all with them. Before my powder, I spray a little setting spray on the brush. If you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive brushes these are the one!</li>
    <li> Wow what a great set they did have the smell but it went away like 5 mins after it hit fresh air great brushes and super soft and such a pretty hot pink I love them</li>
