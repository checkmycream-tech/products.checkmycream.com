      <li>I have bought many of these over the last few years and keep them on most of my sinks.  </li>
      <li>i assumed it was s.a. free because it wasn&#x27;t written on the front like the other cleaners, but it&#x27;s listed under the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It was red and hot to the touch.</li>
      <li>It says it will improve dull complexion, get rid of dirt and makeup and most of all, it is for normal to oily skin</li>

      <li>I wash my face 2-3 times a day with this product even though I am 56 years old &amp; have an oily complexion.  </li>

<li> If you have skin that can take anything use it, but if your skin can get irritated and dried out moderately easily you may want to find a less harsh product.</li>
<li> My skin was less oily and more soft and tight!!!!!!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
<li> I even use it as handwash b/c it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
<li> The smell is a little different</li>
<li> I never really thought to try this before</li>
<li> Also it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it feel tight like some washes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

<li> However, after only a week and a half using the product I saw the effects- not good.</li>
<li> Then, it removes dead surface skin that can dry, roughen and dull your complexion.</li>
<li> That nice lather that should happen in a product like this never manifested without insane amounts of water.</li>
<li> unfortunately, the same thing happened again.</li>
<li> It is very harsh on the face especially during cold weather.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 10 years now.   </li>
<li> Slowly, I see an improvement in my complexion.</li>
<li> It burns so bad still from using it the last 2 or 3 nights.  </li>
<li> I have used EVERY acne product out there, including the expensive ones.</li>
<li> It hurt so bad.  </li>
<li> Even my moisturizer was painful to put</li>
<li> This product is dangerous!</li>
<li> I really hate the product because it made my face pain and ugly.</li>
<li> but it was awful at removing my makeup, i might as well have been just using water alone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good cleanser for normal/oily skin that doesnt need any extra help. I have problematic skin (acne marks/rosacea) and it didnt aggravate my skin, but it didnt help anything either.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these over the last few years and keep them on most of my sinks.  I use it very frequently and each time it makes my face feel especially clean and oil free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 12 years, ever since it first came out. It changed my life b/c I have Seb Dermititus and occasional acne and this product did an excellent job with my skin. I even use it as handwash b/c it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. You cannot beat the bundle price on Amazon. It beats any price locally and w/o tax and free 2-day shipping for Prime members. What a bargain for a fantastic product.</li>

    <li> I have had mild acne for quite some time and I have VERY oily skin. I have used EVERY acne product out there, including the expensive ones. I never really thought to try this before but I heard it was good for oily skin. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. It lathers well and rinses off clean. The smell is a little different but once you wash it off, the smell is gone. My face feels really clean after washing. Slowly, I see an improvement in my complexion. Typically it takes 4-12 weeks to see true results when you start using a product. Hopefully it will continue to get better. So far I am happy with it and will stick with it. I recemmend this to anyone who has oily skin.</li>
    <li> I wash my face 2-3 times a day with this product even though I am 56 years old &amp; have an oily complexion.  I also drink 8 glasses of water a day &amp; take coconut oil &amp; Biotin so my skin is clear &amp; nice looking.  I buy this product in bulk &amp; am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I love neutrogena products, both the facial cleansers plus foundations, but don&#x27;t use this one.  It hurt so bad.  I woke during the night to what felt like a chapped face.  It burns so bad still from using it the last 2 or 3 nights.  Maybe using it once a week during the summer months would be ok, but no way in the winter months with the dry heat.  I am a 47 yr old woman and this is just to rough for me.  I need rehydration fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than any other neutrogena facewash that I tried before. Sustained and regular use may yield positive results depending on your skin.</li>
    <li> Thank U. On time. Great product</li>
    <li> Rinses off completely so makes your face feel really clean.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Great product.  pat@WeSnoreNoMore.com</li>
    <li> I have had the product for 2 days already and my face is already clearing up from acne. Its just amazing best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I bought this product in target because I love nuetrogena products, but this dries and make my face strong and uneven. It is very harsh on the face especially during cold weather. I  wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless you really have the super oily face because it really dries the face and it doesn&#x27;t give you the soft skin, but a chapped strong face . I really hate the product because it made my face pain and ugly.</li>
    <li> clean my skin twice a day get good results in just a week the best skin cleaner on the market hands down</li>
    <li> This product is dangerous! It has irritated and burnt my skin after two days of use! My eyes and my face got swollen!! I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always trusted Neutrogena&#x27;s products. So when I was having more than average acne and I wanted to try something different than my Aveeno cleanser (which I really recommend) I turned to the brand. However, after only a week and a half using the product I saw the effects- not good. My skin along my laugh lines, around my nose and chin was peeling off and leaving my skin unevenly toned. I stopped using it a week ago and the effects are still visible. I have only moderately sensitive skin and products very rarely manifest any real reactions other than dryness in my skin. Furthermore, in terms of product quality I found it to be also sorely  lacking. That nice lather that should happen in a product like this never manifested without insane amounts of water. It left my skin very dry and required me to really slather on the mosturizer. If you have skin that can take anything use it, but if your skin can get irritated and dried out moderately easily you may want to find a less harsh product.</li>
    <li> I used it three-four times and I had cystic pimples all over my cheeks. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple for 15 yrs and I had this reaction all over my face. I know it works for some people but for me and my wife didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Hooked on this for over a decade.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after I use NETROGENA FACIAL CLEANSER!!!!!! My skin was less oily and more soft and tight!!!!!! It smells great and its affordable and worth it!!!!! BUY SOME TODAY YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not for everyone. I&#x27;m glad it worked for some of you guys but as for me, i had an allergic reaction to it. When i bought the product, i was excited to try it because of what it claims to do. It says it will improve dull complexion, get rid of dirt and makeup and most of all, it is for normal to oily skin and my skin is really oily. When i first pump it om my hands, it did have a nice clean scent. I then proceed to wash my face with the cleanser. Right after i rinse it off, my face was very itchy. I couldn&#x27;t help but scratch the itch. I use it again the next day just to be certain that it was the cleanser i was allergic to and unfortunately, the same thing happened again. This leads me to conclude there is an ingredient in the cleaner that i am reacting to.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a new cleanser ever since i became pregnant.  my doctor said i should try to avoid anything with salicylic acid - i was using the [[ASIN:B001E96OU6 Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash]] but discontinued it after her suggestion.  i tried the [[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser]] but it was awful at removing my makeup, i might as well have been just using water alone.  based on the good reviews i gave this wash a try and i am so glad i did.  it removes my stubborn eye makeup very effectively and it doesn&#x27;t leave that residue feeling you get with a bar of soap.  i highly recommend this cleanser to anyone, pregnant or not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  this does have salicylic acid.  i assumed it was s.a. free because it wasn&#x27;t written on the front like the other cleaners, but it&#x27;s listed under the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good choice for skin health care also for face/skin problems it helps to keeps the bacteria to the minimum, good smell , good presentation, and couldn´t resist the bundle</li>
    <li> This item always comes well packaged and ready to use. Have never had any issues with leakage or damage.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for two days, I am experiencing what looks and feels like a chemical burn. My eyes have large bags under them; and my skin is dry, flaky, and so inflamed it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, my eyes gathered their luggage. I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t gotten enough sleep the night prior. I washed my face using this cleanser and went to bed early to combat my large bags. The following morning I woke up to my face in searing pain. It was red and hot to the touch. Even my moisturizer was painful to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not be using this product again, but wanted to warn people with sensitive skin to not try this product.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;Deep Clean Facial Cleanser works two ways to improve the look and feel of skin. First, this dermatologist-tested formula cleanses deep down into pores--dissolving dirt, oil and makeup. Then, it removes dead surface skin that can dry, roughen and dull your complexion. It rinses clean, without leaving any pore-clogging residue. Skin looks fresher and healthier, feels smoother and softer.</li>
