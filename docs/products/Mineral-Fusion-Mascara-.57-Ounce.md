      <li>Very awesome natural mascara.</li>

      <li>This mineral fusion mascara is my new favorite mascara - goes on well, good definition, good length, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>I got better at using it and now let&#x27;s just say,</li>
      <li>Love the way this glides on.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>It is an awesome mascara, aaaaannnnd its ingredients are actually beneficial!</li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara now.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t love it and</li>
      <li>I bought this because it is a bit cheaper than the tarte ones that I love.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this mascara.</li>
      <li>Can you ask for more?</li>
      <li>All in all, I love it and keep buying it...</li>
      <li>Not even to a level that would make it ok to use.</li>
      <li>This product is so much better than Zuzu&#x27;s mascara which doesn&#x27;t add any volume or lift to your eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I love love love Estee Lauder mascara, but I am trying to stay away from some of their ingredients.</li>
      <li>There are better options out there.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Pur Minerals is also pretty good.</li>
      <li>But, pretty good.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.  </li>
      <li>applies easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I feel good knowing the product is more natural.</li>
      <li>Never irritates my eyes and washes off easily.</li>
      <li>It also comes off easily so don&#x27;t wear it if you have watery eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine......</li>
      <li>The best natural mascara I have tried thus far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used almost every brand available.  </li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s important for me to buy cosmetics which are not animal tested, this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and stays on.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try Mineral Fusion because it is gluten free (and because Almay would not say if their mascara had gluten in it).</li>
      <li>Although my make-up does not  have to be gluten free</li>
      <li>It goes on with a smooth silky glide.  </li>
      <li>I had Celiac Disease and had to change to a gluten free diet.</li>
      <li>honest, clean products rarely work as well as the super chemically stuff.</li>
      <li>That is good enough for me for sure ....</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty clean product and your lashes look pretty good.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com, in stock, less cost, free shipping to my front door!  </li>
      <li>My first tube didn&#x27;t clump at all, so I ordered two more.  </li>
      <li>At first it was more like smearing mascara all over my eye areas and my eyelashes just happen to be in the way.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara it goes on smoothly and washes right off with just hot water and a washcloth!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay with me since the ingredients are more natural in this brand</li>
      <li>But, I want clean.</li>
      <li>It is not the cheapest natural mascara out there, but it has a nice rich formula, so I know it is not damaging my eyelashes by drying them out.</li>
      <li>nothing special.</li>
      <li>Price is right!  </li>
      <li>I REALLY wanted to love it</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, BUT, I can&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product for everyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Then to make it even better, it comes off easily - most of it coming off with just a regular face washing.  </li>
      <li>Bare Minerals mascara is amazing.</li>
      <li>i own 10+ other skin/ hair products from Mineral Fusion and love them all except for this one.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I tried this mascara and realized that it actually made my eyelashes look thick and beautiful, while not causing my eyes to itch at all!  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara but will continue to buy it locally at New Seasons.</li>
      <li>Gabriel brand is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>A good thick full tube of mascara!!</li>
      <li>thanks!!</li>
      <li>The mascara covers great and lengthens with just a few brush strokes.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a go.</li>
      <li>This is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Comes off completely and easily with just soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Horrible mascara doesn&#x27;t do anything hardly shows on lashes at all. Would give it s minus rating if optional.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it goes on smoothly and washes right off with just hot water and a washcloth!</li>
    <li> This brand is supposed to be natural and while the mascara seemed to work okay, it did fail to pick up on my lashes well. I am pretty blessed in the lashes department, so I was surprised that the mascara had issues enhancing them. The brush is just standard. When the mascara dried, it made my lashes feel crunchy and then it flaked off on my face and eyes which made them itch. Not a fan. I returned this product. There are better options out there. Bare Minerals mascara is amazing. Pur Minerals is also pretty good. I love love love Estee Lauder mascara, but I am trying to stay away from some of their ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this mascara. Not too clumpy and I like the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> A good thick full tube of mascara!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascara that is dark enough and lengthens your lashes at the same time. This is my favorite mascara now.</li>
    <li> This mineral fusion mascara is my new favorite mascara - goes on well, good definition, good length, doesn&#x27;t clump. The color is good. Stays on well, no flaking. I feel good knowing the product is more natural. I typically buy more expensive and/or natural-type brands, and this is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and my eyes don&#x27;t hate it</li>
    <li> Flakes by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I tried this mascara and realized that it actually made my eyelashes look thick and beautiful, while not causing my eyes to itch at all!  I have allergies to most other brands of mascara, even the so-called &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; brands. (Clinique, Almay)  I have used ZuZu, EcoBella, and Reviva lash and this works better than all of them from both a beauty standpoint and an allergy-friendly standpoint!</li>
    <li> For many months i heard my wife complain about not being able to wear mascara due to her extreme gluten allergy. I purchased this after a little research, and put it in her stocking for Christmas. At first I thought the price was a little high, but after my research I found the cost to be in line with quality non-gluten free products. Gluten will, without fail, trigger migraine headaches for my wife within fifteen minutes. It has past our test...no headaches after use!</li>
    <li> This goes on easily and adds a little definition, but not much. The reason that I&#x27;m giving it one star is because after less than four hours of wear, it leaves massive amounts of teeny tiny dark flakes under my eyes, giving me that dark, bags-under-the-eyes raccoon look that&#x27;s never in. A friend of mine had the same thing happen to her with this product.</li>
    <li> Dark, long lashes that do not clump. Washes off without raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Came the next day. I always buy two!</li>
    <li> Very awesome natural mascara. Comes off completely and easily with just soap. Does not irritate the eyes like conventional mascara. Definitely worth a go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not super lengthening, but for less toxic mascara, I give it a good rating. Also really like their concealer.</li>
    <li> The only mascara that I&#x27;m not allergic too.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s all the bad things about this mascara:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is way too big. No matter how careful I am, it gets mascara on my eyelids and everywhere. At first it was more like smearing mascara all over my eye areas and my eyelashes just happen to be in the way. I got better at using it and now let&#x27;s just say, I pretend that it&#x27;s mascara and eyeliner in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scented. No makeup should have added scent, especially for use near the eyes. It&#x27;s irritating. and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too wet to be useful. It just gets everywhere. It takes forever to dry. You can&#x27;t really add more layers if you want it thicker until it&#x27;s a little drier, because it&#x27;s more like rearranging mud than adding anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wash off with soap and water. One reason I usually gravitate to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras (though i have no idea how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this actually is) is because they are easy to wash off without subjecting my face and sensitive eyes to even more weird chemicals. I&#x27;ve stained a few towels and pillowcases thinking I washed it off and there was yet more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, tears seem to be this mascara&#x27;s kryptonite. Face it, crying happens sometimes. And it&#x27;s the one time this mascara melts away effortlessly. Haven&#x27;t tested swimming yet. Sweat does not smear it if it has had time to dry all the way first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I try to buy &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras is so that it doesn&#x27;t dry into those stiff, hard, brittle chunks that break my eyelashes off. This mascara does dry like that though, it doesn&#x27;t care. It hates you and your eyelashes and wants to do you no favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything by way of thickening or lengthening my eyelashes. There was no visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I guess I can say are positive aspects of this mascara:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands are TOO much a part of a natural look, aka, you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;ve even put mascara on. Thismascara is at least visible. So I guess it does perform the one basic function expected of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of my mascaras seem to get too dry to use quicker than I think they should (I think it&#x27;s the arid climate I live in.) Since this mascara is unmanageably wet, it kind of has a head start and doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying out at all. Not even to a level that would make it ok to use.</li>
    <li> I mean, let&#x27;s be honest, clean products rarely work as well as the super chemically stuff. But, I want clean. So, it&#x27;s not as impressive as Dior Show- I&#x27;d love to always have big luscious lashes- but it&#x27;s a pretty clean product and your lashes look pretty good.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s important for me to buy cosmetics which are not animal tested, this isn&#x27;t for me. Too dry. Might work for some</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It does seem to clump in the bottle faster than other brands but that&#x27;s okay with me since the ingredients are more natural in this brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble finding a good brush, since these days everyone has those plastic ones with not a lot of &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;.  This brush is perfect!  The mascara covers great and lengthens with just a few brush strokes.  My only compaint is that it gets a bit flaky, but not so bad that it is bothersome.  It washes off with just regular soap (sometimes even just water if I went light that day), so I definitely would not wear this if there is any change of getting wet.  Sometimes even when it&#x27;s windy and my eyes tear up, it&#x27;s enough to come off a bit.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara.  My first tube didn&#x27;t clump at all, so I ordered two more.  These aren&#x27;t as clump-free, but still better than other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Mineral fusion mascara really works.  My lashes are vey short, and I was able to see them look longer, without any clumping.  They look natural.</li>
    <li> This mascara (and most everything that I&#x27;ve tried from this brand ) is AWFUL. The top of the bottle isn&#x27;t  tight enough to get off the excess as you take the wand out so you have to dab the end on a paper towel every time. Not only that, but once i had it on it started flaking off in my eyes as i blinked! Terrible Terrible stuff. Do yourself a favor and get Mary Kay ultimate mascara. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I like that this mascara is not harmful to my eyes and lashes, and I really like it that it does not give me dark smudges under my eyes!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m starting to notice small clumps on the brush and on my lashes.  So far, it is not a big deal, but I certainly hope the clumps do not get bigger as the mascara gets older.</li>
    <li> Re: Health: 4.0  Health This product contains ingredients that raise a medium level of health concern.&lt;br /&gt;Re: Environment: 4.0 Environment This company&#x27;s environmental policies, practices and performance place it among the worst 50% of companies rated by GoodGuide.&lt;br /&gt;Re: Society 3.7 Society This company&#x27;s social policies, practices and performance place it among the worst 50% of companies rated by GoodGuide.&lt;br /&gt;I was just about to stock on several different Mineral Fusion items.  Not now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine......nothing special. I have bought a LOT of mascara in my day, and this is just like any other......</li>
    <li> Give my lashes s great look, but after a month, it is now thick and clumpy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 years now, ever since my then 2 year old put a tube in my cart at the health food store without me noticing until I&#x27;d paid for it and gotten home! I have bought nothing since! Doesn&#x27;t make my eyes puffy, or itchy, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with flaking. I do find that it tends to dry out faster than others, which I remedy by adding a few drops of sterile eye drops to the mascara tube. The applicator could be improved, but once I learned how to make it work, I love how it covers my lashes! Even though it&#x27;s not labeled as water-proof, I have found that it doesn&#x27;t run like a lot of regular mascaras, but at the same time comes off easily when you wash your face (especially if you&#x27;re using the oil cleaning method). All in all, I love it and keep buying it...</li>
    <li> I always wear mascara and purchased this product because I liked the more natrual ingredients that are used in all of the mineral fusion products. I did not expect my lashes to grow longer but after about 6 months I noticed I had longer lashes, that was a great added bonus!</li>
    <li> She loved it and if she is happy, MY WHOLE FAMILY IS HAPPY.  That is good enough for me for sure ....</li>
    <li> There was a lot of flaking!</li>
    <li> I am used to waterproof mascara and found this flaky. It also comes off easily so don&#x27;t wear it if you have watery eyes.</li>
    <li> Seemed not to last to long and had to apply several times</li>
    <li> This mascara is a great product.  It goes on smooth and stays on.  It&#x27;s non clumping and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I love that this mascara thickens and lengthens my lashes without ever feeling heavy!  Also, the fact that it&#x27;s a gluten free mascara makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! Every mascara I have ever tried has irritated my eyes. This doesn&#x27;t and I love how long my lashes look with this mascara!</li>
    <li> In this time of chemically altered everything and warnings abound about product safety...I found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients, no formaldehyde smell, no fake fragrance at all.  In fact it does what a mascara was designed to do...lengthen and darken my short, blonde lashes, stay on all day, come off easily at night without burning my eyes!  I originally purchased the mascara at Whole Foods, but we live 30 miles from the closest WF Store and alot of times the graphite color was sold out...I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com, in stock, less cost, free shipping to my front door!  YEAH!  I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Horrible mascara. Not lengthening or volumizing. Messy and makes lashes clumpy.</li>
    <li> okay. Ingredients are not harmful.  applies easily.  doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> Same mascara that I buy at Whole Foods....the same price and delivered to my door!  Rock on!  (By the one this is a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; mascara that is amazing!)</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand for some time now and I like that it is all natural and it stays on very well without smearing.</li>
    <li> I have tried the natural mascaras and they all caused my eyelashes to fall out. This product is so much better than Zuzu&#x27;s mascara which doesn&#x27;t add any volume or lift to your eyelashes. This product gives volume and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. The best natural mascara I have tried thus far. This will definitely be my new holy grail mascara. The price is great too. By the way go to Skin Deep and find out if it&#x27;s score is good enough for you. Some ppl are way too hardcore with their &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ways. For me this product is great!</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  It comes off in flecks a bit.  Not perfect by any means.  But, pretty good.</li>
    <li> This was my first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascara. I ventured out and tried a couple other brands but I prefer this one. It lengthens my lashes and adds volume. Occasionally I get a couple clumps when I apply the second coat, but I can easily get them out with an eyelash comb. I have no problems with flaking. The wand is a good size, not too big or small. Never irritates my eyes and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> I always buy mascara from this company. I&#x27;m not sure if this bottle was just really old, or what might have happened to it. It is really clumpy and makes my eyes itch and sting. I am so disappointed that I need to find a different brand.</li>
    <li> So I am becoming allergic to traditional mascara. The chemical smell I can&#x27;t stand and it eventually starts itching my eyes.  So I saw this at Whole Foods and thought why not try it.  The sample didn&#x27;t smell like a bunch of chemicals so I figured that was a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the applicator sucks and it is slow to dry.  It doesn&#x27;t separate your lashes.  Within a couple hours I looked like a had pink eye.  Seriously I didn&#x27;t think it was irritating my eyes but I guess it was.  Tried to get it off and I thought I did.  Woke up the next morning eyes glued shut with goop.  My eyes were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving my eyes a break.  I know alot of it has to do with me I am getting very sensitive to things but I have never had my eyes look this red before.  It freaked me out at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the great thing is Whole Foods has a GREAT! return policy so I returned it no problems.  I guess this sometimes happens when you try new products, it&#x27;s hit or miss.  Def a miss for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this in my search for a good gluten free mascara. First time I tried it, it went on smoothly, wore great, loved it! Every single time after that, it has gone on goopy and thick and hard to put on. It still wears well, no crumbling, washes off easy, but it is so difficult to put on without having spider legs for lashes! Gabriel brand is my new favorite. I used a whole tube of it, it is great!</li>
    <li> No more eye allergies. Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn with this item. I like it because initially it works really well, and it is natural. Then it dries out and gets clumpy and doesnt last as long as other kinds. I still buy it because it is natural and that is my number one priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  When you add a few drops of saline solution (for contact lenses) to the mascara after it starts to dry out, it makes it last much longer! yah!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup, but I have very fair features so I have been a mascara user for a loooooong time.  I&#x27;ve used almost every brand available.  I have sensitive eyes and mascara can often burn or irritate my eyes.  I also have fairly oily skin and sweat alot so mascara tends to run, bleed and melt.  I love this mascara. I bought one at Ellwood Thompson&#x27;s last week to try it.  The price was great, the color is perfect black and there are no runs, bleeds or melting.  I&#x27;ve worn it to ballet class and it didn&#x27;t even run with all the sweat.  I&#x27;m impressed.  As a great side there is no eye irritation whatsoever.  It goes on with a smooth silky glide.  I definitely recommend trying this one.  It is an awesome mascara, aaaaannnnd its ingredients are actually beneficial! Can you ask for more?</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but will continue to buy it locally at New Seasons. This tube arrived at my house dried out.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is a bit cheaper than the tarte ones that I love.  I want something that is mostly natural without all the harsh chemicals.  I do like it but I really don&#x27;t love it and here is why.  It looks great when you first put it on.  Makes my lashes full and long and looks pretty similar to my favorite tarte one.  About half way through the day though it gets really really dry and starts to flake all over.  By the end of the day I can touch my lashes and they are crunchy which is never good.  I have used it for about a month and I want to give it more time because I generally like mascaras more as they dry out in the tube.  If my opinion changes I will update.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, BUT, I can&#x27;t. i own 10+ other skin/ hair products from Mineral Fusion and love them all except for this one. This mascara looks Whore-rrific on me. It is hard to apply and goes very on thick and clumpy.  I have added a tiny bit of saline to it and that has seemed to help thin it out some and is providing a smoother application.</li>
    <li> Best ever mascara.  Does not bleed when wet yet comes off easily when washed with Neova soothing Milk Cleanser.  Price is right!  No Harmful additives.  My lashes look great!</li>
    <li> Desperate for a non-clumping mascara, which many reviews said this was. Only slightly better than drug-store brands, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> After trying countless different brands of mascara, this is now the only mascara I will ever buy!  I have puffy areas under my eyes which pick up smudges from mascara.  I was having to clean this off several times a day.  I couldn&#x27;t find any mascara that stayed on my lashes and didn&#x27;t end up under my eyes, until this Mineral Fusion mascara.  This stuff goes on great and stays on all day - no smudges!  Then to make it even better, it comes off easily - most of it coming off with just a regular face washing.  The only thing is that you really do have to replace it every 3 months.  It seems that about the 3 month mark, it starts drying out and getting clumpy.  Since, I had always read that you were supposed to replace your mascara every 3 months (but never really had), this is not a problem.</li>
    <li> A. Steiner&#x27;s posting on 3/30/14 basically says it all, my feelings exactly. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red and watery - this one definitely is not it. Product goes on very wet, smears at the slightest waver of the hand and takes ages to dry. And later in the day the stuff starts flaking off into my eyes, stinging and making them water. I don&#x27; t know how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; a product is that causes allergic reactions to the eyes, and after reading other reviews about animal testing I&#x27;m off this mascara permanently.</li>
    <li> I used to use Almay Mascara for over 20 years and my left eye always watered, then I found out I had Celiac Disease and had to change to a gluten free diet. Although my make-up does not  have to be gluten free I decided to try Mineral Fusion because it is gluten free (and because Almay would not say if their mascara had gluten in it). Ever Since I switched to Mineral Fusion over 2 years ago my eye no longer waters! And its a good mascara!</li>
    <li> Loved the mascara but the container was horrible. Mascara leaked all over the outside and after a weak the tube actually broke in two. I REALLY wanted to love it but good packaging is huge for mascara and this was not a good container.</li>
    <li> Worst ever. Thick and &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34;, and absolutely does not lengthen. It&#x27;s actually one of the worst mascaras I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The mascara darkening and lengthening effects are nice, but it leaves lots of mascara clumps under my eyes. Will look for another brand. I did not get any reaction to it, though.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara.. stays on well.  It&#x27;s hard to find not too expensive anti cruelty makeup.  This is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this product...my eyes no longer itch or water like they did with cover girl mascara.</li>
    <li> I live in australia so its hard for me to get most things. western au, that is. found this company as i am particular about make up and i am grateful because they have a good price &amp; quick service. thanks!!</li>
    <li> Great brand and a great product.  Made with natural ingredients.  Our Family has used this brand for years are always happy.  This Mascara does not clump or flake and does last all day.  My wife and teenage daughter swear by this mascara and you can&#x27;t get them to switch.</li>
    <li> This is the clumpiest mascara I have every used.  I will never buy again and do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a healthy alternative to unhealthy name brand mascara. My first impression was positive; the mascara was thick, dark and made my lashes pop. However, by the end of the day, it became extremely dry and flaky. If you wear contacts, beware of flakes everywhere and eyes that become itchy and irritated. I won&#x27;t buy this again, but I will search for an alternative.</li>
    <li> I am working on my second tube of this company&#x27;s mascara, and I have to say that I love their formulation. It&#x27;s difficult to say that all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara&#x27;s could be as good at volume production, color application, staying power, no flaking, no clumping, etc. but this mascara DOES this all and it&#x27;s *fairly* natural to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the brush was a little bit bigger for volume building, because the brush has a lot to do with application. The mascara WILL build up volume, but with multiple applications, 3 for me. (I have sparse-over 50+ lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the black and the brown, (which is more like a brown-black than a true brown, blondes and light-skinned folks take notice.) It comes off fairly easily, and I don&#x27;t have any problem with eye irritation, and I have had Lasik, so I am VERY picky about what I choose for my mascaras, and what goes near my eyes. It is not the cheapest natural mascara out there, but it has a nice rich formula, so I know it is not damaging my eyelashes by drying them out. You get what you pay for, folks. Highly recommended for those who like natural formulations!</li>
    <li> Love the way this glides on.  This is a nice product for everyone with sensitive eyes. The other favorable reviews were right on.</li>
