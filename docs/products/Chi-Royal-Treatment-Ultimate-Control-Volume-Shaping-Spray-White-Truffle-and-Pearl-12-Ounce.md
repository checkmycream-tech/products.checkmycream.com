      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>Anytime I use this hairspray people ask why kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>

      <li>Glad I tried it though.  </li>
      <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this hair spray.</li>

      <li>Received item quick!</li>

      <li>just right</li>

      <li>I really like this hairspray, it does what it says, holds and shapes, doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy or flakey.</li>
      <li>Its gentle on your hair</li>
      <li>I switched back to  my old hair spray, Aguage finishing spray, but this one is soooo much better</li>
      <li>&amp; I want just enough hold...not stiff but also does not let hair fall or fly</li>
      <li>Highly recommend but smell may bother you if you don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t wear perfume.</li>
      <li>I normally purchase from hairdresser but cheaper from amazon.  </li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d gotten a whiff of the product before spraying it into my hair the first (and only) time.</li>
      <li>a lot for 2 uses and then lose such a large hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This spray will hold your hair all day and leaves behind a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>I normally go through a can of hair spray once every 2 weeks between my daughter and I, but this can has lasted 4 weeks and still isn&#x27;t empty!  </li>
      <li>A little pricey but holds hair very well without looking like hairspray.will buy this product again  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this hair spray. Its gentle on your hair and you can work with it without pulling your hair out.  It has a lovely smell to it and it lasts all day and night. I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift from my hair stylist. I wish I&#x27;d gotten a whiff of the product before spraying it into my hair the first (and only) time. It has an extremely strong fragrance in the amber or oriental family. Why do manufacturers find it necessary to put a strong fragrance into hair sprays? It either competes with one&#x27;s chosen fragrance or negates the choice to be fragrance-free. This one&#x27;s going into the trash bin.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product takes care of my fly aways and also keeps my hair in place without being too sticky. The smell is also amazing!!</li>
    <li> Best smelling hairspray that works just as good as it smells. Anytime I use this hairspray people ask why kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Also it keeps my curls all day long.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used not to mention it has great hold and adds shine.  I will never switch to anything else.</li>

IT smells heavenly and everyone always compliments me and tels me my hair smells great . This is my 4th bottle..PLUS it holds your hair great when you do curls and it isnt stiff or too limp. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am an African American with this hair type. This product had a nice hold for my curls( my hair is relaxed ) and it had no flaking or &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34;. I would recommend the chi imperial serum as well . Both products are hydrating but none greasy</li>
    <li> I just got to use this a couple of times the spray got stuck and could not get it to stop spraying :(  so the balance of the hair spray went in a bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;Paid a lot for 2 uses and then lose such a large hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I did not contact the seller and I should have. :(  but ha</li>
    <li> Great shaping spray and volume control spray. Great price. I have purchased for several years and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray! Doesn&#x27;t flake when you brush thru, helps fight humidity.  I normally go through a can of hair spray once every 2 weeks between my daughter and I, but this can has lasted 4 weeks and still isn&#x27;t empty!  Great product!  I switched back to  my old hair spray, Aguage finishing spray, but this one is soooo much better so i switched back!  Love the smell too!  Hold is great without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Hairspray I have ever used.  It does not wear your hair down and it does not feel sticky. Has a great scent. I have tried many,  many different sprays, but this is by far the best one yet!  Thanks Chi!!!</li>

    <li> This hairspray is the bomb! I purchase it here on Amazon every couple months. The hold is great and the scents is to die for!</li>
    <li> I probably won&#x27;t try it again.  It was ok but not as user friendly as others that I have used.  Glad I tried it though.  Thanks.</li>
