<li> This brush is better than an expensive name brand blending brush!</li>
<li> she&#x27;s a little after some use, but nothing too extreme.</li>
<li> However, after many washes, I could not get rid of the horrible smel (let&#x27;s say it smells like the toilet bowl...</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s very stiff and when it arrived it already came very loose.</li>
<li> It gets in behind the setting on a larger ring-</li>
<li> My brush arrived bent and the brush is shedding like crazy.</li>
<li> and I was very disappointed and angry.</li>
<li> very dangerous</li>

    <li> This brush is okay, it&#x27;s very stiff and when it arrived it already came very loose. It sheds a lot also even after washing but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Meh, kinda corse. Didn&#x27;t really do a good job blending, was kind of streaky.</li>
    <li> Although this brush isn&#x27;t Mac it is very comparable. In fact it actually does say 217 on it but it&#x27;s obviously a dupe. No shedding and no harsh smell.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see what the quality would be...and I was very disappointed and angry. The brush itself was fine looking at it. However, after many washes, I could not get rid of the horrible smel (let&#x27;s say it smells like the toilet bowl...mhmm yup exactly.) I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good decent brush, especially for the price I paid. Would definitely purchase again. Thanks.</li>

    <li> The brush is wonderful, and I think it did a beautiful job considering it was only for a dollar. I would recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great service, quick and what I wanted</li>
    <li> this brush fell apart the first time i used it and the bristles fell onto my eyes!!! very dangerous i do not recommend i know its cheap but its not safe</li>
    <li> I was honestly just curious to see if this brush was comparable to the MAC 217. I thought for $2, why not try? I ordered it and knew it would take a while to get to me, seeing as I have an APO address but to my surprise it didn&#x27;t! It took close to 2 weeks to receive and I was thoroughly impressed with the brush. It is a wonderful dupe for the MAC 217. It&#x27;s sturdy, soft bristles and it even has the number 217 at the bottom of the brush. I have used it several times and it blends beautifully. :)</li>
    <li> Great blending brush! I brought 6, three for me and three for my freelance kit. LOVE EM!</li>
    <li> This brush has long bristles, which makes it easy to use for  pplying eyeshadow.  I have also been using it to clean jewelry.  It gets in behind the setting on a larger ring- better then small brushes.  Makes the stones shine.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love the results i get with this brush!!!! thank you so much!!!</li>
