      <li>Will be wonderful in the summer with my hands in the gardens on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance which is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>I went to the owner site and bought the huge 27 oz jar.  </li>
      <li>With good ingredients that make the skin silky smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>So of all what is available in the US</li>
      <li>Filled with healing ingredients and not too greasy if you smooth it into your skin, this cream is very soothing.</li>
      <li>I also use it for mild burns and insect bites.  </li>
      <li>So it wasn&#x27;t worth it for my skin type.</li>
      <li>This is the best calendula cream I started using it after finding it at my local health center, then they did not have it in stock</li>
      <li>However it is greasy and does not get absorbed by my skin.</li>
      <li>I love that it is natural</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>WILL B BUYING MORE IN FUTURE..</li>
      <li>order more when my supply is getting low.</li>
      <li>Good choice for healing keel areas when a Grey may injure and open theirs.</li>
      <li>It is very medicinal in an herbal way.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Fabulous is the only word to describe this product.  </li>
      <li>My son is pretty sensitive to creams and lotions.  </li>
      <li>Because it is so low priced, I use it generously on my hands and arms, which seem to soak it up quickly.</li>
      <li>Better than any high-priced emolliate and safer than other creams that combine a lot of ingredients  whose names I cannot pronounce, Recommend highly for daily use but suggest that manufacturer put a protective cover over cream itself because jar top was loose when it arrived.</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT ABSORBS FAST AND LEAVES HANDS SOFT.  </li>
      <li>It is better than the expensive products available.</li>
      <li>I love the people that make it, in small batches, off the coast of one of the San Juan islands.  </li>
      <li>It  has reduced deep wrinkles in the cheek area better than even the most expensive products.</li>
      <li>I purchased it because I need the Calendula for GI issues, but the product surprised me with how well it helped with wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It absorbs in the skin immediately leaving a soft silky feeling.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
      <li>His skin remains moist and soft for a longer time.</li>
      <li>All natural, so no harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>If it does not get absorbed, it can not deliver the active ingredient into the tissue where I want the calendula to act.</li>
      <li>No other brand delivers like this cream, and it is so affordable.</li>
      <li>It is a little grity when first applied but melts nicley into the skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> bought it try to treat my sons eczema and its help a little but I&#x27;ve found that aveeno baby eczema cream works better</li>
    <li> This is the best calendula cream I started using it after finding it at my local health center, then they did not have it in stock so I looked on-line. I use it nightly and for any rashes or healing needs. Made by a small company on an island in Washington state...so yes you can buy local and small businesses thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped with my scarring due to surgery. It has a nice fragrance which is light and fresh. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about is the greasiness. I recommend this product for darkness skin spot due to acne as work. It works well!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. It is better than the expensive products available. Will buy it again. And here I am again adding to my comments.  I have sensitive skin that requires a non irritating cream. Arbordoun is everything I have been looking for and then some. It absorbs in the skin immediately leaving a soft silky feeling. Thank you for making such a wonderful product. there are not enough words to express my gratitude. No other brand delivers like this cream, and it is so affordable. I went to the owner site and bought the huge 27 oz jar.  I use the cream all over my body, including face. You have to try it.</li>
    <li> Started with the smaller size and graduated. Filled with healing ingredients and not too greasy if you smooth it into your skin, this cream is very soothing. I had a bruise on my leg complete with black and blue mark and used it soften the surrounding skin. Better than any high-priced emolliate and safer than other creams that combine a lot of ingredients  whose names I cannot pronounce, Recommend highly for daily use but suggest that manufacturer put a protective cover over cream itself because jar top was loose when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I am using this for ex emma. Although it has not eliminated it, it has greatly reduced it. I only use a very small amount each time</li>
    <li> I work in a factory so my hands are extremely dry with nicks and scrapes.  I have spent $$$$$ on creams and lotions.  I put this on at night with cotton gloves and my hands are healing well.  I also use on my dog&#x27;s dry skin.  This cream/ointment will melt into your skin so use sparingly during the day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product. I purchased it because I need the Calendula for GI issues, but the product surprised me with how well it helped with wrinkles. It  has reduced deep wrinkles in the cheek area better than even the most expensive products. Because it is so low priced, I use it generously on my hands and arms, which seem to soak it up quickly. I use it sparingly at night on my face to avoid the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about the properties of calendula, and I could not buy what she was talking about as that was from Europe. So of all what is available in the US I thought this would be a great product. It looks nice, and smells nice. However it is greasy and does not get absorbed by my skin. If it does not get absorbed, it can not deliver the active ingredient into the tissue where I want the calendula to act. So it wasn&#x27;t worth it for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I like to use it everyday. I have sensitive skin and this cream calms my face. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Fabulous is the only word to describe this product.  Works on difficult dry skin and edema-harmed areas when others cannot.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My son is pretty sensitive to creams and lotions.  He did not mind this product. His skin remains moist and soft for a longer time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 17 years and my husband for closer to 25.  A little goes a long way so if you think this is pricey, realize that you don&#x27;t need much.  I love that it is natural and you can use it from face to body.</li>
    <li> Expedites healing especially for heat rashes and provides comfort. Good choice for healing keel areas when a Grey may injure and open theirs.</li>
    <li> I have one word to say about this  cream. Ultimate!!!! I&#x27;ve looked all over for a cream this good. This is it. The problem is that it&#x27;s so good I had to buy a 16 oz. bottle of Dr. Adorable Inc. JoJoBa oil to mix with it. The reason is that the Abundantly Herbal Calendula Cream is so wonderful that you&#x27;ll use it up too fast. So I got the jojoba oil from Amazon to extend the use of the cream. This cream is so wonderful for the price I am so happy. After searching for 40 years for a cream that was priced right I finally found it. You will not be able to find a better cream than this for the money. I&#x27;ve searched all of my life &amp; this is it for the money! Believe me. Just check out the ingredients and the people who make it. It&#x27;s all about quality.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT ABSORBS FAST AND LEAVES HANDS SOFT.  ITS THE BEST CREAM I HAVE EVER USED, AND NO CHEMICALS. WILL B BUYING MORE IN FUTURE..</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I will definitely be buying it again! It is very medicinal in an herbal way.</li>
    <li> too greasy to use during the day, but when i use at bedtime it does make my skin feel better</li>
    <li> Calendula cream is wonderful.  Dry skin gone in days.  All natural, so no harsh chemicals.  Can be used on face,&lt;br /&gt;body, anywhere your skin needs some moisture.  It&#x27;s still winter here so my hands were very dry, now with daily&lt;br /&gt;use they are no longer cracking.  Will be wonderful in the summer with my hands in the gardens on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;Will order more when my supply is getting low.</li>
    <li> Very nice prodcut and smells nice too.  It is a little grity when first applied but melts nicley into the skin.  I have already order my second jar.</li>
    <li> A wonderful, effective natural product. Recommended by Doctor to help heal and soothe burns. Happy to find the real deal on Amazon!   Koalabug</li>
    <li> I have been using Arbordoum Calendula Cream for many years and they deliver an excellent product.  And it works! Try it...</li>
    <li> This is the one and only product I have used on my face for the last 20 years.  And my skin is great!  I also use it for mild burns and insect bites.  I love the people that make it, in small batches, off the coast of one of the San Juan islands.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> With good ingredients that make the skin silky smooth and soft.  We try to use it ever day for dry skin and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> The best pure calendula cream, for your skin, I love it.</li>
