<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used these to mix up some essential oil blends for a face cleanser and they worked great. Sturdy, hard plastic and tight lids with push top spouts.</li>
    <li> works very well for my skin oil mixture</li>
    <li> Hard for homemade lotions to get out, but works for what I need, for now</li>
    <li> WTF!  I am supposed to write a review for small plastic bottles;  I punt.</li>
    <li> Not to hard if you drop it, won&#x27;t crack as easy! Not soft enough to squeeze the bottle! The lids on bottle are hard and flips open! Clean it out using peroxide, just shake it a few times and dump it out and refill with water and dump out and air dry!</li>
    <li> Great bottles! I purchased these bottles to mix-up some homemade body soaps and shampoos containing essential oils and they work great! The caps fit on the bottle properly and they click open easily with one hand. I will purchase more of these bottles as my supplies run low.</li>
    <li> Using these to house my own personal products - like homemade shampoo and body washes. Love the shape, size and quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted these so that I could transfer shower gel from a huge, hard plastic bottle into something more manageable, as I have small hands and a touch of arthritis that made the large bottle difficult to use. These are working well for their intended purpose. I would rather have a color that goes better in my bath and isn&#x27;t quite to pharmaceutical in nature, like green or blue, but that&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
    <li> These work nicely for shampoo or lotion. I was worried they might crease or break from squeezing, bu so they&#x27;ve held up nicely.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for keeping shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Good price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Not so good for my oil mixture because the oil spurts out the cap when opened sometimes probably from the previous use. However, there is nothing wrong with the bottles and I use them to dilute Dr. Bronners soap and give to friends.</li>
    <li> Good for what I used them for.</li>
    <li> These work great for my homemade shampoo.  I&#x27;m not sure if they can be washed in the dishwasher without warping, but even so, it&#x27;s the perfect size for my needs.</li>
    <li> I like these, but they are a little bit on the thin side so when squeezing the bottle actually shows stress lines and even leaves &amp;#34;folds&amp;#34; or indents where squeezed.</li>
    <li> Work for EXACTLY what I needed them for. Bought waterproof labels and used them for travel!! They are perfect. I didn&#x27;t want them for carry-on, and they&#x27;re too big for that, but if you don&#x27;t want to lug around your big jugs of home products these work PERFECTLY!!</li>
    <li> The bottles arrived on time and the bottles aren&#x27;t to thick, but have a nice give to them when you squeeze them. I haven&#x27;t filled them with anything yet, but the plastic doesn&#x27;t crack or warp which is what I was wanting!</li>
    <li> I love these 8oz amber bottles. They are perfect for DYI shower body washes. I have them in different sizes. I am definitely buying more. They also make great gifts....</li>
    <li> These bottles have worked great for my homemade body and face washes.  They recommend using glass jars when using essential oils but I have found I don&#x27;t like glass jars in my shower.  Besides, we go through the washes quick enough that the oils eroding the bottles has not been an issue.</li>
    <li> Great bottles, nice thick bottles</li>
    <li> Very nice bottles. Bought to store my homemade coconut oil &amp; essential oil moisturizers .</li>
    <li> The disk lids have a &amp;#34;double click&amp;#34; to fully open. Otherwise a satisfactory product.</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is good.  Light weight plastic.  The cap however leaks during use.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for an all natural homemade liquid soap.</li>
    <li> just what a needed! these are super sturdy bottles and will be great for my lotions. the shipping was FAST love them thank you!</li>
    <li> These are great! They&#x27;re super cheap and durable, plus the look nice too. I use these to dispense my auto detailing stuff.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles for my homemade no-poo shampoo&#x27;s and body washes. Well made plastic. Not to thin, not to thick. Will probably be buying more for when I get ready to make gifts for the holidays.</li>
    <li> I love the color, but they were a little bit expensive. Very quick shipping, though. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice bottles. Bought to hold colloidal silver. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Love these bottles for making my dry shampoo as well as for gifting homemade beauty products.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and quality.  Shipping was super-fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect for in the shower.  I didn&#x27;t really want to put glass in the shower so this is a nice substitute.  Also a good size for shower use.</li>
    <li> Very strong plastic. Push-up tops held well and did not leak. Used as car-camping shave kit bottle and dropped a few times with no damage. would by again.</li>
    <li> They worked great.  I used them all the time</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
