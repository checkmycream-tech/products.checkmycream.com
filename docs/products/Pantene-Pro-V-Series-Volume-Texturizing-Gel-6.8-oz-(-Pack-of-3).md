      <li>I was glad to get it on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>Husband and kids love it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a while and was no longer able to find it in retail outlets</li>
      <li>So glad to find it online.  </li>

      <li>I am so glad that Amazon sells this gel.  </li>

      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this works beautifully to help control it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for strong gels and after reading reviews I decided to give this one a try...</li>
      <li>strong hair gel</li>
      <li>Great gel That does not dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair this is the hair gel for you.  </li>
      <li>feels like they put cheap gel in the bottles.</li>
      <li>and it left their hair smelling great.</li>
      <li>It was cheap</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this should be labeled as Light Hold\\&quot; because after using it it domes not seem to be that you have anything in your hair</li>
      <li>I purchased because it was really cheap</li>
      <li>It is light and not at all sticky.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to put on and holds well with a full day of work at the office.</li>
      <li>I love the quality that Pantene Pro-V provides for leaving my hair soft, smooth and more manageable.</li>
      <li>-I was so excited to find it-</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it does anything special for my hair.</li>
      <li>So far loving the product.</li>
      <li>Pantene has redone all their products over the last year or so and are no longer good for me to use.  </li>
      <li>The only one that works fairly well is Panteen Stylers Pro-V Gel Maximum Hold #4.  </li>
      <li>It really did not do much for my very fine hair, to hold the curl from rollers.  </li>
      <li>This works very well on my baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair and this product</li>
      <li>and for the 3 pack its worth it cheaper than the store prices</li>
      <li>So far, I have not fallen in love with this product.  </li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>dry it the best I can, apply some of this gel, scrunch and air dry.</li>
      <li>It is curious, though, why it isn&#x27;t in the stores, but  very glad it is here.  </li>
      <li>Best gel hands down, never makes my hair feel overly sticky and keeps my style all day long.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Have not been able to find locally in my stores.  </li>
      <li>but I have to admit I like the mouse stylers better such as Aussie.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find this product in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>Perfect light gel for fine or thin hair that just needs a little volume and texture.  </li>
      <li>First of all it works really</li>
      <li>I takes care of frizz and gives me nice definition without weighing my hair down.</li>
      <li>I got this because it stated that this was very \\&quot;Extra Strong</li>
      <li>plus it holds strong for entire day.</li>
      <li>It really does add volume to my short, fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>Pantene&#x27;s products have been working very well for me, including this one.</li>
      <li>and I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>This product can give your hair as much body as you want without the stickiness and weight.</li>
      <li>I really like this gel.  </li>
      <li>works very well for my hair</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t give my lifeless hair much volume.</li>
      <li>It really works for me😎😎😎😎😎😎</li>
      <li>Great for thin hair.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight gel that holds well.</li>
      <li>The Pantene works ok, but it didn&#x27;t hold my thick straight Asian hair in place for more than a couple hours...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works well for my hair it holds it in place with out making it stiff</li>
    <li> I got this at an incredible price when amazon had some kind of clearance of this item and so happy I did. It smells amazing and it holds well without stickiness that I hate. I like my hair to stay in place and also be soft; so this is great for me!</li>
    <li> This works very well on my baby fine hair. Hair looks thicker and is easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Texture of gel is a bit different than the other Pantene hair gels I bought in stores before.  Don&#x27;t know if that is how it is supposed to be or if it was something from heat during transit.</li>
    <li> I like this product very attractive . Bye.</li>
    <li> feels like they put cheap gel in the bottles. not worth it. does not hold well</li>
    <li> Oh I can&#x27;t live without this on bad bad BAD hair days!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this gel. I tried it by chance but it&#x27;s a miracle worker in my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, which is what I really needed for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love any type of gel this one holds your hair amazing!! and for the 3 pack its worth it cheaper than the store prices</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this product in my local stores.  I was glad to get it on Amazon.com.  It does what it claims to do and my hair always looks nice.</li>
    <li> I have fine and thin hair and always looking for a product that does not weight my hair down or make it look greasy and dirty this is it it is the best.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair have more volume and control I love it I was given a discount for my honest review</li>
    <li> I will not buy this type of hair product again. I purchased because it was really cheap and I thought because it was a Pantene product it would perform well. My experience was crunchy hair, I tried multiple times thinking I put to much in but even when I used a small dollop it made my hair hard. The worst part is if the product isn&#x27;t completely absorbed or evenly distributed your hair will have spots of hard clumped together pieces.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product by Pantene for years.  They no longer have it on store shelves.  So glad to find it online.  I tried a Pantene mousse which just dried out my hair.  Pantene has redone all their products over the last year or so and are no longer good for me to use.  Same old story.  I no longer use a Pantene shampoo for the same reason.  My hair is fine and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Must avoid conditioners for this reason, too.</li>
    <li> It works well for my husband&#x27;s short hair.</li>
    <li> This gel works well on my fine hair and does not leave a stick feel when it is dry. Holds hair the way styled for hours</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair in place all day while not matting it down. It has plenty of hold, but at the same time it keeps the hair volume.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give my lifeless hair much volume.</li>
    <li> I purchased several tubes of this on an Amazon special deal and have used it.  It&#x27;s weak and watery. Maybe this is why it was on-sale?  I&#x27;m not picky about hair gels, but you have to use so much for just a little hair control you have a really wet head.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This was on a great deal $4 for pack of 3 and the best hair product i have used so far. I hated the left over particle from other hair products. However this not only have no left over, it also feels as if i haven&#x27;t put any gel and that feeling especially when you wake up after a crazy night is priceless.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I can not buy the volume gel in Port Huron any more for some reason Wal Mart quit caring this about a year ago when pantene redid there product. I not have to buy it when I visit my parents. they live 2 Hours away from me and I do not visit but 4 times a year I try to remeber to buy at K-Mart which I am not fond of that store.  Is there any store in Port Huron that sell it?  email address is dcrawford0131@greatlakes.net&lt;br /&gt;When I check on line and go to the store that says they sell it They do not have it.</li>
    <li> Great gel That does not dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Pantene&#x27;s products have been working very well for me, including this one. I use it to give my hair some volume, and it works great. It&#x27;s not sticky or crunchy (unless you use it when your hair is completely dry and you don&#x27;t brush it through...blehhh). I have very straight, long, fine hair, and after showering, I towel dry my hair, squeeze a glob of this in my hand, and apply to my moist hair (at the roots). Then I blow dry my hair and brush it out, and voom!! I&#x27;ve got graet volume for the day! It smells good, and doesn&#x27;t flake at all (even if I sleep with the product in my hair). My hair feels as if I didn&#x27;t have any product in it, and it maintains its style.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel.  It provides enough control for styling without feeling heavy.  It really does add volume to my short, fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I like this but I have to admit I like the mouse stylers better such as Aussie. They seem to have more control without being stick yWorks well for flyaways.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorite products! It really works for me😎😎😎😎😎😎</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while and was no longer able to find it in retail outlets so I turned to online shopping for it.  I feel it gives volume to my hair without making it sticky or heavy.  I hope it will remain on the market for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I got this because it stated that this was very \\&quot;Extra Strong Hold\\&quot; and seemed to have allot of good reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this should be labeled as Light Hold\\&quot; because after using it it domes not seem to be that you have anything in your hair and it provides little to no ability to hold your hair the way you styled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going back and reading the reviews, I find it fishy that 10 of the reviews giving it 5 stars basically only stated that they could not find it in stores anymore and where happy it&#x27;s on Amazon. Kind of burying the reviews stating that this product does not hold hair for diddly.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and this product did nothing to HOLD the hairstyle. It is weightless yes, but also useless unfortunately. :(</li>
    <li> So far, I have not fallen in love with this product.  It may take a while for me to learn the tricks of using it.</li>
    <li> i used this product for years and all of a sudden the stores around me have discontinued this particular one-I was so excited to find it-Yeah!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does nothing to add to hair&#x27;s  volume or body.  I have a very fine hair and have tried all kinds of products. The only one that works fairly well is Panteen Stylers Pro-V Gel Maximum Hold #4.  I thought this one might be better because it was  emphasizing volume and hold  in the name of the product . It does neither!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and love it but lately have not been able to find it in the stores.  I thought maybe they discontinued it.  Then I thought of Amazon and, lo and behold, they had it!!!  Good ol&#x27; Amazon always comes through to the rescue!  I am happy and my hair is happy.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of subscribe and save. I love the quality that Pantene Pro-V provides for leaving my hair soft, smooth and more manageable. This gel truly stood up to hours of hold without being weighted down and still left my hair with volume. It smells amazing, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not work like I expected Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The product is not too thick and holds well. My only gripe is that it is a bit on the liquid side, so slapping it on my hair results in it getting all over the place. It is easy to put on and holds well with a full day of work at the office.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before so I know I like it.  Good price with Amazon.</li>
    <li> It really did not do much for my very fine hair, to hold the curl from rollers.  It also required a fair amount of hair spray to even give a hint of hold.</li>
    <li> works very well for my hair</li>
    <li> Good buy for great hair gel</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Have used for a long time and reordering again today.  Nice formula that I use in a cocktail with Pantene Curl gel.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and seems really good. But I bought this for 3 bucks. I got another item ( aussie spray which is awesome ) with it totaling up to 6.50 at Rite Aid. That was a good deal.</li>
    <li> It was cheap but I can&#x27;t say that it does anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product - I just can&#x27;t find it in stores!</li>
    <li> This was just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I use a quarter size amount and it gives my hair volume without any stickiness. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this gel on those days when I don&#x27;t want to spend the time blow-drying my hair. I have naturally curly/wavy hair, and I just towel dry it the best I can, apply some of this gel, scrunch and air dry. I takes care of frizz and gives me nice definition without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, and it continues to be all it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> great product for 2.00</li>
    <li> great product, fast ship</li>
    <li> Very lightweight gel that holds well.</li>
    <li> Best gel hands down, never makes my hair feel overly sticky and keeps my style all day long.</li>
    <li> It supposed to be Extra strong, but it&#x27;s far from being strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for strong gels and after reading reviews I decided to give this one a try... My hair is around 1 inch long and it cannot hold it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who needs a real strong hair gel should stay away from this! This is the worst supposedly (extra?!!!) strong hair gel I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> My daily gel since I don&#x27;t like strong gel as my daily hair look! good for styling and better that you will find no residue or powder like particles after dryness!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a while.  Great for thin hair. The only thing is that if you don&#x27;t completely close the cap before you stand it up, it will leak</li>
    <li> I got it at a low price and this stuff is just wonderful what else can anyone ask for ..</li>
    <li> The Pantene works ok, but it didn&#x27;t hold my thick straight Asian hair in place for more than a couple hours... so, I&#x27;ve switched recently to Tea Tree Styling Gel: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPMGNE/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1, and it holds my hair in place all day. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than the Pantene, but one bottle lasts twice as long, and it works better on thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Nice , not sticky and great hold</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.This product can give your hair as much body as you want without the stickiness and weight.Use a little for a little body or a lot for a lot of body.I love it!</li>
    <li> After trying so many different gels I think i found the right at least for me. Problem with other hair gels is after drying up you look like an old man with all those white flakes. I had issue with Guess hair gel as well. With Pantene Pro hair no white things plus it holds strong for entire day. So far loving the product.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much and this is my second order. Have not been able to find locally in my stores.  It works the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> my husband like this product</li>
    <li> I used this product this morning.  It gave my hair quite a bit of volume that lasted all day.  It wasn&#x27;t as &#x27;gelly&#x27; as I expected, I was afraid the product would slip off my palms before I got them to my head.  Still, nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 days before going for a hair cut, the salon guys told my hair is full of wax and other white precipitates. I think for a short term it may work, but in long term may pose serious issues to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Perfect light gel for fine or thin hair that just needs a little volume and texture.  I have used it for years and will continue to.</li>
    <li> Husband and kids love it. They said it wasn&#x27;t to hard when applied and it left their hair smelling great. No residue whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This gel is one of my go-to hair products.  I can no longer find it in stores, so I was happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon sells this gel.  I have been using it for a few years and all of a sudden I cannot find it in any store anymore.  If you have fine hair this is the hair gel for you.  It is light and not at all sticky.  It also doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair like mousses can.  I use just a little bit (about the size of a nickle) and that is enough.  I ordered the pack of three so that I will have it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to have found this product here as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be in the stores any longer and I really like the product.  Without using this product in my hair it really falls flat.  It is curious, though, why it isn&#x27;t in the stores, but  very glad it is here.  I did stock up.  Don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this works beautifully to help control it.</li>
    <li> First of all it works really good.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it has a certain smoothness to it that I never experienced with any other simulr product.&lt;br /&gt;And the fact that it&#x27;s not sticky and heavy ish is simply awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
