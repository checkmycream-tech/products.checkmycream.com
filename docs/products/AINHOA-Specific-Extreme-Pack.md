### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;*I&#x27;m impressed with the ingredients: ginseng, vitamins, plant extracts, algae extracts, marine DNA, antioxidant Vitamin E.</li>
      <li>I opened the package and was impressed with the case and the two pen like applicators.  </li>
      <li>presentation is awesome.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the product casing though too.</li>
      <li>think both products are very good, considering the ingredients, absorbency and how my skin feels after.</li>
      <li>So for the traveling people this is ideal.</li>
      <li>First...this comes in a BEAUTIFUL box.</li>
      <li>The  products are packaged beautifully, so you will feel you&#x27;re pampering yourself.  </li>
      <li>welcome comments with the correct procedure for use.  </li>
      <li>This is a great skincare product to take traveling.  </li>
      <li>That being said - they do a great job at moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they work great.</li>
      <li>I win every time.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Although they are attractive, the metal tube and brush of the Eclat fell apart.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is presented very nicely, the two, shiny chrome cylinders in an oyster-colored, zippered, faux-leather bag.  </li>
      <li>They came in this very nice zipper case box.</li>
      <li>I love the brush applicator the best</li>
      <li>/&gt;Frankly, I was more impressed with the applicators than I was with the product.</li>
      <li>As with all skin care products, your own experience may vary greatly.</li>
      <li>The two silver applicators come with their own zipper case, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like the brush applicator the best, as it easily smooth the product over your face and neck.  </li>
      <li>We found the application of the evening product worked good at diminished crease lines while the day product worked good under foundation makeup.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product for a moisturizer</li>
      <li>It feels good on my face, not greasy or creamy.</li>
      <li>Maybe good products, time and consistency of use are the things that make a difference, but it is something we won&#x27;t know for years.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my face, not greasy or creamy.</li>
      <li>I also know that a good skin product can provide it with</li>
      <li>feel that, at best, Ainhoa is a fair moisturizing product in a very pretty package.  </li>
      <li>The two products come in a nice leather case that would make them ideal for travelling, and also both feature interesting application processes.  </li>
      <li>I love the case that comes with these click pens, great for storing them together and even has a mirror.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think better instructions would make a great deal of difference.  </li>
      <li>are very innovative.</li>
      <li>The case is nice, good construction with a zipper and built in mirror.</li>
      <li>The roller and brush are pleasant to use and makes for very accurate, non-messy application.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice.</li>
      <li>I guess depending on how many wrinkles you have on your face how good of a product this will be.</li>
      <li>They both seem fairly effective, which is the bottom line.</li>
      <li>products come in nice silver toned bottles with applicators built in, and with the push of a button at the bottom of the units, product comes out of either a brush applicator or roll style applicator.  </li>
      <li>and they come with a nice case which includes a mirror.</li>
      <li>the packaging/storage case is nice, three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product, which is suppose to help your skin look younger, is beautifully packaged and feels very good going on.</li>
      <li>After about two weeks of use, I found the Eclat somewhat more effective than the Plus Repiar.</li>
      <li>I am interested in almost anything that relates to maintaining beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>A TEENAGER type application, more preventative...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth formula that glides on nicely.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the application process as well.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure from reading them how to use the applicators and figured it out - you press the button on the bottom of the applicator and the lotions come out.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any overwelming fragrance, but I did find that my skin felt better (softer and hydrated) after use.  </li>
      <li>Interesting dispensing technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did like the Ainhoa much more than the Garnier for dryness.</li>
      <li>The brush applicator is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love AINHOA, their mascara is one of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>I could not be of more help.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is OK, but given how easily it makes me break out</li>
      <li>The product comes in a very nice case, it is faux white leather with a nice zip closure.  </li>
      <li>The first thing you will notice about this product is the innovative and deluxe packaging.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The product would be enhanced if they gave a more detailed instruction sheet.  </li>
      <li>I assumed the repair lotion was to be used before bed and the instant lotion in the morning since it said that was ideal before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, my makeup went on more smoothly, but that was about it.  </li>
      <li>It is incredibly hydrating and my skin actually feels tighter.  </li>
      <li>Having just begun my last year of my 50&#x27;s, in spite of inheriting my mother&#x27;s wonderful genes, I have observed more noticeable \\&quot;smile</li>
      <li>The products are not irritating and feel good, not sticky or greasy.  </li>
      <li>The pen was easy to apply, the serum that came out was gel</li>
      <li>The roller ball didn&#x27;t dispense as easily</li>
      <li>The serum comes in a neat box with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator makes it so easy to apply and brush to distributes</li>
      <li>Application instructions are easy to understand and are supplied on each product.</li>
      <li>I think the Extreme Eclat works best and would seek out the product on its own for purchase because I really like the feel of it under make-up</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it diminished the appearance of fine lines, however, I&#x27;ll keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It comes with a nice case and small mirror making it ideal for travel.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not harsh like others I have used in the pass.</li>
      <li>while the packaging is very pretty and the application methods are interesting; this product was a disaster for me.  </li>
      <li>while the packaging is very pretty and the application methods are interesting; this product was a disaster for me.  </li>
      <li>I took it with me on a weekend getaway and it was awesome to have this little carrying case.  </li>
      <li>silver containers and click-pen applicators are easy to use and unique.</li>
      <li>One product has a brush and applies the product smoothly.  </li>
      <li>They smell nice, they tighten and relax as needed, and I really like them both.</li>
      <li>but when I did, it went on smoothly over the product.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this product under make-up and at night.</li>
      <li>You push a button on the bottom and it feeds the lotion into the brush and applicator, then you smooth it on your face.</li>
      <li>Packaged in an attractive zippered white faux leather case, this skin care duo is encased in metal tubes.</li>
      <li>I have a few around the eyes and this will be the best product for that.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap, but they do what they say they&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The liquid that the brush distributes from the tube goes on smoothly in places and lumpy in others</li>
      <li>so you need to either smooth it in or brush it across your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I experienced no bad reactions as some others apparently did.  </li>
      <li>However I cannot say that the results thus far are superior to even the drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was a good comparison though because one is more for puffiness, and the other is more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>At first, i thought it was just me, but I&#x27;ve received so many unsolicited compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this line.  </li>
      <li>I like this moisturizer and it feels great on my winter dry skin.  </li>
      <li>the unclear instructions, I have been using these products on clean skin every morning.  </li>
      <li>The applicators are genius, easy and fun.</li>
      <li>The applicators are genius, easy and fun.</li>
      <li>Clean the brush applicator with a tissue after use.\\</li>
      <li>Both items are serums, which are always used on clean skin, under the moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I have paid close attention to applying the product to my laugh lines, undereye wrinkles and some fine lines around my mouth.</li>
      <li>Either way, the product did a great job of moisturizing during this very dry (for us) winter.  </li>
      <li>Under my chin is very improved as this was the most damaged skin I have.  </li>
      <li>The brush had a nice, soft feel.</li>
      <li>and while was a good moisturizer, after several weeks of diligent use the wrinkles were not visibly reduced</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviewers don&#x27;t see the instructions, it says for both products to apply them on the face, especially over the express lines, also around and lip lines, leave it to absorb. Both items are serums, which are always used on clean skin, under the moisturizer/sunscreen. They do not specify am or pm use, so you can use anytime.&lt;br /&gt;In addition Extreme Eclat Instant can be use under make up, so application over sunscreen is ok (as a make up primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both products are very good, considering the ingredients, absorbency and how my skin feels after. There is no greasy residue, and I like the pen with the roller (cooling effect and there are no silicones).&lt;br /&gt;The second wand with the brush seems weird to me, you applying everyday so obviously bacterias will grow there, unless you wipe it with brush cleaner that contains alcohol. I think regular dispenser would be better. The product can be used as a make up primer and it contains several silicones, but also does not clog the pores and it is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no miracles or wow factor, but I can say that skin is hydrated, temporary plumped and smooth. Considering the price I feel that it was spend more on the packaging and carrying case though, especially when the Extreme Eclat is only 20 ml (0.67oz). I like to pay for the item itself not the packaging. IMO the base price is a bit to high for the results I got.</li>
    <li> I have used so many skincare products promising hydration and younger looking skin, including Sisley, Shiseido, Cle de Peau, Lancome, Chanel and La Mer.  Although the name is difficult to remember, it is the best skincare product i have ever used and actually lived up to it&#x27;s promise.  It is incredibly hydrating and my skin actually feels tighter.  At first, i thought it was just me, but I&#x27;ve received so many unsolicited compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this line.  I highly recommend Ainhoa &#x27;Specific Extreme&#x27;!</li>
    <li> This product, which is suppose to help your skin look younger, is beautifully packaged and feels very good going on. That is about all I can say about it in the positive mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the instructions. They are very poor. Very basic. I wasn&#x27;t sure from reading them how to use the applicators and figured it out - you press the button on the bottom of the applicator and the lotions come out. One is for day use and the other for night use. I found that they both irritate my eyes and have to keep it pretty much keep the product away from my lower lids which then negates the purpose of it. And I did try and search for the website for the product, but my virus detector came up with all sorts of alerts saying there were infected items on the website and would not let me click on it (not that I would after their warnings).  So that was not good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did feel smoother, but no where in the instructions does it address whether or not you can put a moisturizer on after the product dries and sinks into your skin. I believe the product is made in Spain, but I live in Chicago and it is cold and dry in the winter and moisturizing is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, I&#x27;m not sure this product does much. It seems to tighten your skin while it is being used, but other than that--the instructions are poor and it is hard to know if you are using it most effectively. For instance the instructions on the box for the extremem eclat state \\&quot;Apply to the face, neck and neckline with the help of the brush applicator. Leave to absorb. Avoid direct contact with the eyes. Clean the brush applicator with a tissue after use.\\&quot; Doesn&#x27;t really address how much to put on or how deeply to massage it into your skin. The liquid that the brush distributes from the tube goes on smoothly in places and lumpy in others so you need to either smooth it in or brush it across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution in the \\&quot;Extreme Eclat Instant\\&quot; tube contains Ginseng, fruit acids, Vitamins, plant extracts, , algae extracts. The solution in the Extreme Plus Repair tube is composed of Algae extracts, bioplasma, Marine Plant DNA, and Hyaluronic Acid according to the instructions inside the box. However, if you read the box there is a long list of ingredients including water and other strange words that would take me way too long to type but with a lot of them ending in common additive endings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However on a really positive note, I really like the case the two tubes came in--kind of white leather with a mirror inside. It will make a nice make up case for my bag when I&#x27;ve exhausted the solutions.plant extracts, , algae extracts.

    <li> This product was reviewed by a 62 year old woman. The pen was easy to apply, the serum that came out was gel like and while was a good moisturizer, after several weeks of diligent use the wrinkles were not visibly reduced and I think that is the biggest claim this product makes and the whole point of the product. It&#x27;s awful expensive for just a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it,  you can&#x27;t  expect  dramatic  results  from skin care products-- if you could, folks would be lining up down the block to buy them and there wouldn&#x27;t be new ones  coming out every day.  So  we have to keep expectations in check. I  found  these AINHOA  products  made my face feel a little bit smoother, like many moisturizers costing a fraction of the price.  No magic.  No gasps  from my friends. I experienced no bad reactions as some others apparently did.  The  products are packaged beautifully, so you will feel you&#x27;re pampering yourself.  Many have pointed out that the instructions are vague. I agree.  Especially for this price one has a right to expect instructions that leave no reasonable question unanswered.  However, I don&#x27;t think better instructions would make a great deal of difference.  Apply the products  to the places that need attention.  See if you notice a difference. What more do you really need to know?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total beauty junkie and love trying new products and brands. I&#x27;m 32 with fair skin and an alarming dose of freckles(which I just like to call sun damage)though I do wear sunscreen now daily. I have a few fine lines and wouldn&#x27;t mind those going away but on the whole try and take care of my skin to deter aging as much as possible. I love the case that comes with these click pens, great for storing them together and even has a mirror. Having a case like this makes it easy if you travel a lot, since you can just toss it in your suitcase and know it&#x27;s not going to leak or get misplaced in one of a zillion pockets. I really enjoyed the application process as well. I always detest the idea of dipping my fingers in anything, since then you&#x27;re just spreading your germs into the product. With these tubes you can just press the little button on the bottom of the click pen and apply with the rollerball or brush, depending on if you&#x27;re using the day or night tube. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the rollerball as much, as it&#x27;s kind of hard going over your forehead or anywhere there&#x27;s bone right under the surface of your skin. The brush on the other hand feels soft and luxurious. I&#x27;ve used these for about 2 months steadily, and while I like the idea, I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference. Both the Extreme Eclat Instant and Extreme Plus Repair sink in fast and the eclat works nicely under makeup. Would I buy these? Probably not. For me it was just the novelty of the application and only when I see good results do I continue to purchase a product.</li>
    <li> I am interested in almost anything that relates to maintaining beautiful skin. When I saw this Ainhoa product and saw that it was for the face I admit that I reacted too hasty. I have not as of yet begun to suffer the effects of aging in my face.  Meaning that when I go to the Carnival I win every time.  So getting an age defining? Wrinkle reducing? Skin toning? I have no idea what this products exact purpose is.  I should have investigated a little more before I selected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I will admit that I used the daytime product. I have no clue if I used it properly or not because the instructions with in the box are extremely vague. As for what to look out for as an end result, well I still do not know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there was no difference in my skin appearance or tone.  My skin did not feel any more firm than before. So I just shrugged and said oh well I will wait and see if anything happens over a weeks period of time.  Well after a week of instructed use. There still is no difference in anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 3 stars?  I am thankful that it did not work in reverse for one.  I did not breakout or have a bad reaction to the product for two and the packaging/storage case is nice, three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it folks, sorry I could not be of more help.</li>
    <li> I was unsure why this product was priced so high ($150) and I now see it has dropped to under $20.  Very strange.  Either way, the product did a great job of moisturizing during this very dry (for us) winter.  However, it did not do much better of a job than your typical drugstore bought brand, but we believe it was in fact better.  It is possible I expected too much from the product given the original exorbitant price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is well packaged but did not include instructions. It comes with a nice case and small mirror making it ideal for travel.  We found the application of the evening product worked good at diminished crease lines while the day product worked good under foundation makeup. The scent of the product is very minor and not too strong.  However, this product seems to be prone toward encouraging pimples.  After just a few applications we noticed breaking out on the forehead.  We discussed continued use and it cleared up right away.  Researching other reviews led us to conclude that some people with sensitive or fair skin will be prone to breaking out. If your skin can tolerate the product, it will be softer and smoother after about a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I simply may have expected too much from this product based on the original price point.  But, in short, we believe the same benefits would be obtained by using nearly any other moisturizer.</li>
    <li> There is a lot to like in the AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack as well as some things to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the package comes with two products (Extreme Plus Repair and Extreme Eclat Instant). The instructions, which come in every imaginable language, mention there are four AINHOA products available; however, only two are supplied with this package. There is only one tiny paragraph for each product in English and those instructions are pretty much useless because it really doesn&#x27;t say when to apply these lotions, how much, for how long, etc. I assumed the repair lotion was to be used before bed and the instant lotion in the morning since it said that was ideal before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of using Extreme Plus Repair (the one with roller ball applicator) before bed, my skin became irritated, dry and itchy. After several days of using Extreme Eclat Instant (the one with brush applicator) in the morning, my skin was soft and smooth.  I did not \\&quot;see\\&quot; any noticeable improvement in my face from either lotion but I liked the softness that resulted from using the Extreme Eclat Instant. I love the brush applicator the best and although I am not fond of the roller ball applicator; both applicators are extremely innovative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a really nice case with mirror (white exterior with navy blue suede-like interior)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applicators are innovative and rich looking (I really think the vendor should license their applicators, especially the brush applicator because they are unique. The brush applicator could be used on many products such as self tanners, sunscreens, etc. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Eclat Instant left my face feeling smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Plus Repair irritated my face and left my skin feeling itchy and dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out with more pimples than usual and I believe one of the lotions is responsible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are useless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much solution is provided (only .68 ounces in each cylinder)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would not purchase this product because one of the solutions irritates my skin and it is too expensive at the current price of $99.63. If both lotions worked well and exceeded my Oil of Olay products (such as Total Effects) and the price was in the $33 range, then I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars and would consider purchasing it even though there isn&#x27;t much product provided.on is provided (only .68 ounces in each cylinder)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would not purchase this product because one of the solutions irritates my skin and it is too expensive at the current price of $99.63.

    <li> I love AINHOA, their mascara is one of my favorites.  This extreme pack was quite intriguing when I received it.  Top notch packaging and quality, a chic little white case. The roller and brush are pleasant to use and makes for very accurate, non-messy application.  This is a great skincare product to take traveling.  I have been using the extreme pack for two weeks now and I can&#x27;t see any discernible difference other than some breakouts on my extremely sensitive skin.  The breakout is not cool, so I have to discontinue use.  If you have the cash to spare and your skin is a bit tougher than mine, give it a go.  I do think it usually takes a month of using anti-aging products to see a difference.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer and it feels great on my winter dry skin.  I do wish the instructions included would have &#x27;instructed&#x27; me how to properly use these.  There is nothing saying which to use first, or if for day, night, under foundation etc.&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush applicator the best, as it easily smooth the product over your face and neck.  The roller ball didn&#x27;t dispense as easily and I&#x27;m not a fan of applying undue pressure to my 40-something face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I simply used this each night before bed for several weeks and my skin feels very soft.  I don&#x27;t think it diminished the appearance of fine lines, however, I&#x27;ll keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;I do massage this lotion into my skin after applying with the brush, otherwise it feels like it just lays on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I welcome comments with the correct procedure for use.  The company website provided zero help.</li>
    <li> First...this comes in a BEAUTIFUL box. A white leathery zippered case (which I immediately reused as a make up travel case!!!! ha ha!) The products are big...no tiny amounts in there. The applicators are a roller (like a pen) and a brush that you pump and the stuff squirts out into the brush. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the brush, it seemed like it would get all creepy and stick from the product, but I have actually grown to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the roller one on my right eye area and a different roller product ([[ASIN:B001DPMETG Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roller]]) on the left. I don&#x27;t think it was a good comparison though because one is more for puffiness, and the other is more moisturizing. I did like the Ainhoa much more than the Garnier for dryness. So I abandoned my experiment after 2 weeks and just use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin sort of drank both of these products up. It feels much smoother and the results even last until the next day, which has not been the case for many moisturizers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price...sigh...the price. I don&#x27;t understand the price of moisturizers. I mean LaMer is known as the gold standard, but I can&#x27;t afford it at all...so I don&#x27;t even know if it works. I have tried mid-priced items, and like them...but usually end up with drugstore brands to justify the cost. Now that I am older, I am wondering if I should indeed pay a little more. I am in an odd age where I still get breakouts AND the beginnings of wrinkles...so I just don&#x27;t know. It seems that a very expensive item should show super dramatic results, but I am not sure that is correct. Maybe good products, time and consistency of use are the things that make a difference, but it is something we won&#x27;t know for years. I am seriously leaning towards buying this again. Maybe there will be a sale!</li>
    <li> I got this to review through the Amazon vine program.  The product comes in a very nice case, it is faux white leather with a nice zip closure.  There is a nice little mirror in the case as well.  In there you get two cylinders of product.  One is the Extreme Repair Plus and the other is the Extreme Eclat Instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that are included with this are tough to use.  There are in super tiny print and you have to search through four or five languages to get to the English instructions.  Even once I found them I had to read the instructions a few times to figure out what to do with these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin that is sensitive and breaks out easily.  My current skin care regiment involves using [[ASIN:B004AJYOT0 Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer]] under my makeup for moisture and staying power and [[ASIN:B003B8G5TI Boscia Enlivening Amino-Ag Eye Treatment]] around my eyes.  At night I moisturize with [[ASIN:B00352MHE2 Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Sensitive Skin]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Repair Plus is meant to be an overnight treatment.  You are supposed to apply to areas susceptible to wrinkles and leave on overnight.  This applies with a roller ball.  You basically push the button on the bottom to pump out product and then roller ball it out on problem areas.  I am not all that keen on a roller ball application because all the dirt/oil from you face is just being rolled back into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Extreme Repair Plus for three days and had a lot of problems with it.  When I applied to my forehead and wrinkles around eyes it burned. My eyes also burned and watered even though the product wasn&#x27;t that close to my eyes.  I ended up with red swollen eyes that burned and felt dry.  I finally stopped using after three days because the discomfort didn&#x27;t fade or go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Eclat Instant is supposed to be worn under your makeup for an instant face lift.  This is pumped out from a button on the bottom of the container and comes out through a brush at the end.  It is an interesting application method, but the brush is pretty coarse so you end up having to rub the product in with your fingers to even it out.  I used this under my makeup in place of my [[ASIN:B004AJYOT0 Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Eclat Instant was even worse for my skin than the Repair Plus was.  It was very oily and caused my makeup to look glossy and smear easily.  After using it for three days my skin started to breakout everywhere.  A week after using it I am still trying to recover; my skin it red and blotchy and dried out. In addition to all of this it has a flowery scent to it that gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the packaging is very pretty and the application methods are interesting; this product was a disaster for me.  The Extreme Repair Plus made my eyes and skin burn.  The Extreme Eclat Instant was very oily, caused my whole face to go red, blotchy, and break out, and in addition to that had a sweet floral scent that I had trouble with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know skin products work differently for every individual.  I would just caution those with sensitive skin prone to breakouts against trying this product.  It was pretty much a painful disaster for me.  Mainly I am grateful I received this for free through the Vine program, otherwise I would be really angry at wasting so much money on this product.m a button on the bottom of the container and comes out through a brush at the end.

    <li> AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first statement will be -- Where are the instructions? This wasn&#x27;t an obvious smear here, squirt there type of cream. One tube has a roller ball, one tube has a make-up brush. Which one goes first, what is day, what is night? I don&#x27;t know, there were no instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the backstory. I&#x27;m mid-thirties. Did I just type that...? When did that happen? But, yes, mid-thirties and showing very little lines and crinkles, except for when I first wake-up and get that initial look in the mirror. SHEEH! And then maybe a few on my forehead because I guess I make a lot of sarcastic forehead wrinkling faces at people. So, this stuff isn&#x27;t going to be a POOF YOU&#x27;RE A TEENAGER type application, more preventative...here is hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied. It feels nice. Makes my skin feel nice and tight and rather soft. Especially now with all this Winter Weather messing up my skin and making it all dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the product casing though too. They came in this very nice zipper case box. Big enough to fit the applicators. When my AINHOA stuff runs out this will be great to use for other things like lipstick! Then the applicators are very shiny and silver and like two big lipsticks. When I pulled at first it did come out of the casing though, much like a cheap pen would break off from the tubing. But, it does seem like solid construction, just wish that would stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the applicators goes on like those old liquid deodorants that I used to use \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot; - they probably still make those, but it&#x27;s been awhile for me. The other is a brush. You push a button on the bottom and it feeds the lotion into the brush and applicator, then you smooth it on your face. Interesting dispensing technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stuff. I will use it. I&#x27;m upset about the instructions though and I&#x27;m not sure I would have paid the price for it without going into a store and having a make-up specialist demonstrate it for me. Maybe talk to a trusted make-up rep or see where it is sold at a Brick &amp; Mortar.ist demonstrate it for me. Maybe talk to a trusted make-up rep or see where it is sold at a Brick &amp; Mortar.</li>
    <li> The AINHOA Specific Extreme pack features two products that come in a very nice leather-like, mirrored zipper case.  I took it with me on a weekend getaway and it was awesome to have this little carrying case.  It felt very posh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, the instructions that accompany this set are vague, and are written in many languages, which make it extremely hard to find instructions for use.  I&#x27;m still not sure I am using the right product at the right time, because the names of the products are so similar - which is which?  One is Extreme Plus Repair, and the second is Extreme Eclat Instant, but I couldn&#x27;t find instructions with the same names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products come in nice silver toned bottles with applicators built in, and with the push of a button at the bottom of the units, product comes out of either a brush applicator or roll style applicator.  I have had to push the buttons several times to get enough product out of the units, so I am suspecting these bottles won&#x27;t last very long.  Each bottle contains less than one ounce, so obviously there isn&#x27;t much product in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the unclear instructions, I have been using these products on clean skin every morning.  One of the products made my face feel tighter, which is the same results one gets from using soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, any impression I had about my skin looking better or lines becoming smaller, was short-lived, as my skin looks exactly the same as before using this product for 7 days.  My pores are the same, and so are my wrinkles.  My skin is soft, but much cheaper products make my skin soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there is no way I could justify the cost of these products, for less than 2 ounces of product that surely won&#x27;t last much longer than a week.  As the bottles are silver toned, there&#x27;s no way to see how much product is left, but I suspect there isn&#x27;t much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice trial, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s back to the Department Store Counter products for me.  At least I can get more quantity for a like price.tore Counter products for me.  At least I can get more quantity for a like price.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 40s with a few squint lines around my eyes, very light laugh lines on my cheeks and serious lines under my chin.  I opened the package and was impressed with the case and the two pen like applicators.  Then I looked at the instruction sheet.  There are instructions in just about every language spoken and in very small print.  Let&#x27;s face it, if you need something to repair older skin, tiny print is not going to be very readable.  I pulled out the reading glasses and scanned through all the instructions to find English and then read through.  There really wasn&#x27;t much there other than a blurb about what the products were made of.  Also, the instructions contained descriptions for several products, not just the two in the package.  Sad to say, I resorted to the description on Amazon to see which applicator was for day and which was for night.  One product has a brush and applies the product smoothly.  You push the button on the bottom of the applicator and the product comes out between the bristles of the brush.  I smoothed it on all the \\&quot;aged\\&quot; places on my face. The other applicator has a ball on the end and the product is pushed up around the ball and it applies like roll-on deodorant.  It&#x27;s easy to accidentally get too much of this product.  I&#x27;ve used both for a little over a week and can see a little difference in the lines beside my eyes.  Under my chin is very improved as this was the most damaged skin I have.  My cheeks still have the same amount of laugh lines and I still have a deep crease in my forehead. The products are not irritating and feel good, not sticky or greasy.  I&#x27;m not big on wearing makeup but when I did, it went on smoothly over the product.</li>
    <li> AINHOA is a successful European cosmetic company that sells products world wide. This AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack comes nicely packaged and is a high end product for women over thirty and beyond. The two silver applicators come with their own zipper case, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two products included in this package: The Extreme Eclat is a wrinkle and tightening treatment that has a nice brush applicator. This does tighten skin under the chin, around the eyes and laugh lines. It&#x27;s a smooth formula that glides on nicely. The second applicator uses a roller ball applicator. Both are silver cylanders that use a pump type action to bring the product up to the applicators. The brush applicator is my favorite. I enjoy using this product under make-up and at night. The roller ball applicator is also meant to message the skin as you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Extreme Eclat is a very nice cream and the brush and applicator are very innovative. I think it&#x27;s a neat idea to have this type of applicators, especially for travel. No messy creams to pack and they come with a nice case which includes a mirror. This treatment has a drying effect due to the Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products can and should be used sparingly. I think the Extreme Eclat works best and would seek out the product on its own for purchase because I really like the feel of it under make-up and I like the brush applicator.</li>
    <li> After about 2 weeks of using these two lotions combined, I did notice my cheeks felt tighter and looked firmer.  However, a few days later I began to break out like I haven&#x27;t broken out since I was in my late 20s (now 41).  I even got one of the dreaded cystic acne pimples that still hasn&#x27;t gone away.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve stopped using the products.  I would also add that the caps are not very secure and I would pack in my gym back and the lid would always have come off - leaving the brush exposed to everything else in my make-up bag.</li>
    <li> As a woman of a certain age, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for skincare products that will keep my skin looking young and vibrant. I&#x27;m savvy enough to know that a lot of a skin&#x27;s luminosity is based on genetics (thanks, mom!), but I also know that a good skin product can provide it with that extra edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the top-branded skincare products - from Chanel to Murad to Velixa - and was eager to see how this new AINHOA product, from Barcelona, would stack up. The answer is: it stacks up well, but the company has a ways to go to appeal to a U.S. market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The presentation is awesome. It comes in a zippered faux white leather carrying bag, complete with a mirror inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The silver containers and click-pen applicators are easy to use and unique. All you do is push the bottom dispenser and then apply the serum to face lines with an applicator brush or roll-on ball. No measuring is needed and there&#x27;s no fuss, no muss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m impressed with the ingredients: ginseng, vitamins, plant extracts, algae extracts, marine DNA, antioxidant Vitamin E. From what I know of skin care, these are natural and good ingredients for those who are interested in improving their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m very surprised that the instructions are so meager. Both say that I should apply them to my face, especially over expression lines present in contour areas. But which should I put on first? Second? How long should I wait to put on moisturizer? Or should I even put on moisturizer? It&#x27;s all very confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The instructions come in a multi-page small insert, written in many languages. It took me time to locate the English instructions, and since the products are similarly named, even more time to determine which applied to the two products I had. Surely, AINHO could place a small insert, directly applicable to the appropriate products, in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the all-important question: how it works. I&#x27;ve used AINHO for three days on one side of my face (to compare); shortly I will use it on both sides. I have seen the appearance of \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot; diminish - not markedly, but noticeably nonetheless. It feels good on my face, not greasy or creamy.

    <li> Having just begun my last year of my 50&#x27;s, in spite of inheriting my mother&#x27;s wonderful genes, I have observed more noticeable \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; and wrinkles about my face and neck. (sigh) I guess it was inevitable, even though I&#x27;ve never smoked nor visited a tanning booth. I have been a regular user of \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; products and have pretty \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, never having dealt with acne problems, though it can be sensitive to some products.  This said, I was excited to try this, I think quite expensive, Ainhoa skin care line.  I confess that I had pretty high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is presented very nicely, the two, shiny chrome cylinders in an oyster-colored, zippered, faux-leather bag.  The cylinders hold 0.68 fluid ounces of product each and have a plunger that you press on the bottom to express a small amount onto the applicator brush or ball, specific to each product.  It looks and feels luxurious.  There is a page of folded instructions and ingredients in the package too, in seven languages. These seemed to me to leave many unanswered questions, such as, \\&quot;How often do you use it for best results\\&quot;, and \\&quot;How long do you let it dry before applying makeup?\\&quot;  The instructions also include information about another product, Extreme Active Repair Cream, (a stem cell re-structuring cream) that isn&#x27;t included, which seems odd to me.  It actually sounded like the product I would want more than either of the two in this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, pretty consistently, and I have not noticed any real changes in my skin.  Without adequate directions, I didn&#x27;t know if I should use it once or twice a day, or how long I should use the \\&quot;massaging roll-on ball applicator\\&quot; to \\&quot;facilitate draining action, permitting increased absorption of the product.\\&quot;  Even if I used it prior to using the \\&quot;Extreme Eclat Instant\\&quot; (which comes with a cool applicator brush), I still didn&#x27;t notice any change in the appearance of my wrinkles.  Yes, my makeup went on more smoothly, but that was about it.  I have to say, I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that, at best, Ainhoa is a fair moisturizing product in a very pretty package.  I didn&#x27;t see any results better than the \\&quot;over-the-counter\\&quot;, much less expensive products I have used through the years.  If you have never used moisturizers before and live in very dry, winter conditions, you would notice a big change, as you would from any moisturizer, but beyond that, I cannot honestly say that it did anything special. I would not purchase it at the near-$100 price, let alone the stated $150 retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it and will note any additional information if I have it.  I&#x27;d love it if my wrinkles suddenly disappeared!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product pack that I find is one of the few products that actually work as advertised. Application instructions are easy to understand and are supplied on each product. The product is very easy to use, and offers subtle results. The one thing you don&#x27;t want to do is use too much product, or you may experience some tingling or irritation, perhaps worse if you are a sensitive skin sufferer. The product itself is not greasy feeling if applied as directed, nor does it leave a sticky residue. As with all skin care products, your own experience may vary greatly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have to say myself. The scent is pleasant and not harsh like others I have used in the pass. I can say I see a small difference after using this for over two weeks. I like the fact that you get two products in one. Day and Evening. I have used a few of their other products for a few months as well and they work great. I guess depending on how many wrinkles you have on your face how good of a product this will be. I have a few around the eyes and this will be the best product for that.</li>
    <li> While this product looks fantastic and feels nice when you put it on, the actual results after a month of use aren&#x27;t anything to brag about. I might not be using it right though, the instructions are vague and I have been brushing the day cream on wrinkled areas in the morning and then rolling on the night cream on those same spots before bed. The cream is thick and clear without a noticeable scent. It takes quite some time to dry and my face feels tacky to the touch after using. If I use it on crows feet i got a bit of irritation spots where the skin is thin, almost like a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a product like this I would expect significant instructions detailing how to use it and what exactly it does. Unfortunately the info on this product is nearly non-exstant.</li>
    <li> Packaged in an attractive zippered white faux leather case, this skin care duo is encased in metal tubes. The Extreme Plus Repair has a roller ball tip while the Extreme Eclat Instant has a soft sable brush at the end of the container. Product is dispensed by pressing a button at the bottom of the tube. One or two presses was sufficient for my needs.The Extreme Plus Repair contains algae exptracts, bioplasma, marine plant dna and Hyaluronic Acid. The Extreme Eclat contains ginseng, fruit acids, vitamins, plant and algae extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was more impressed with the applicators than I was with the product. The applicators are fun to use and assist in precision application. The roller ball is reputed to assist with lymphatic drainage. The brush had a nice, soft feel. After about two weeks of use, I found the Eclat somewhat more effective than the Plus Repiar. The eclat had a light perfume scent that I did not care for and the results were subtle. It does leave the skin smooth and soft with minimal tightening. The Plus Repair had no scent and its effects to date were unremarkable.  I did not experience any irritation or allergic reactions and I do have sensitive skin. However I cannot say that the results thus far are superior to even the drug store brands.  I intend to completely use both and will update my review if that changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side the instructions are skimpy and are contained on a little leaflet. the leaflet has information on all of their products and in a number of languages. It was annoying to have to weed through all the langauages and products to find the english instructions. and then, the information provided was minimal.  I also noted that the tubes were not sealed in any manner. Although they are attractive, the metal tube and brush of the Eclat fell apart. I was able to put it back together but it does raise questions about overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth a try if you temper your expectations. I did not experience amazing and instant improvement but was not displeased with the results. The applicators are genius, easy and fun. The carrying case is cute and sturdy and the black interior and small mirror were thoughtful touches. If amazon had half stars, I would give this three and one-half for superior application of a pedestrian product.did not experience amazing and instant improvement but was not displeased with the results.

    <li> And that&#x27;s not a good thing, and there wasn&#x27;t much on the box or the Amazon page either. When I picked this pair of skin care treatments off the Vine newsletter I really didn&#x27;t know quite what I was getting - were these supposed to be used as a moisturizer (day/night), or as skin repair used in conjunction with a daily moisturizer? Unfortunately, the very tiny and hard to understand instruction sheet wasn&#x27;t terribly helpful - multiple languages, and discusses more products than these two. Incredibly tiny font too, which is rather odd considering the products are aimed at people who are getting older. When I finally found something in English, I couldn&#x27;t always tell if it was for the right product, so I went in rather blind and may not have used it according to the instructions I couldn&#x27;t find...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products have unusual dispensers, instead of a pump at the top, the Extreme Plus Repair is like a pen that you hold to your face and push down at the thingy at the other end to dispense the fluid. The Extreme Eclat Instant has a brush at one end, and you push at the other end to dispense the liquid onto the brush. Apparently you&#x27;re supposed to brush around the age lines, but I repeat - the instructions are not very clear (and pretty damn small print at that). I have a smallish bathroom with not much counter space on the vanity. Those products that do stay on said counter need to stand up so they take up less room, and with the push thingy at the bottom of these makes these easy to topple over. A minor quibble, but a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not knowing whether I should be using a daily/nightly moisturizer along with these, I did not use one. It is January and it is cold and my skin is dry and flaky. These products without a daily moisturizer for a week made my skin flakier than normal. I did notice some tightening of the skin, but not dramatic improvement on the wrinkles.  All in all, not a product worth the asking price. I&#x27;m going back to Olay.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new serum is very different to any serum I have used. Which I have&lt;br /&gt;used for over 2 months now. The serum comes in a neat box with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator makes it so easy to apply and brush to distributes&lt;br /&gt;the product well and it so soft to protect your skin. The serum&lt;br /&gt;itself is silky and makes my face baby soft. I have not notice any&lt;br /&gt;brightening effects but makes my skin super soft. It does run out&lt;br /&gt;fairly quickly and have used just enough every day so it would&lt;br /&gt;last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for a moisturizer but I haven&#x27;t seen those two lines disappear like I thought this would do. I mean if it can&#x27;t get rid of two little wrinkles than what good is it going to do for someone with a bunch of them. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and those 2 lines are still there but my face feels cleaner and glows a little because it is a good moisturizer...although it is a little greasy and I try to not get near my hair with it...or my mouth because it does not taste good. I&#x27;m not too sure a cheap jar of ponds wouldn&#x27;t have done the same thing though. But hey, Ponds doesn&#x27;t have caviar in it!</li>
    <li> I received AINHOA Specific Extreme pack from Amazon Vine. Unlike other reviewers, I did not see same day results on my wrinkles. I have paid close attention to applying the product to my laugh lines, undereye wrinkles and some fine lines around my mouth. The jury is still out, I will keep using and report back with any updates. The case is nice, good construction with a zipper and built in mirror. So for the traveling people this is ideal. The containers are silver and work from a push button bottom. I had no problems applying the product and found using the brush to be very effective in getting the product on my fact, less mess too. I didn&#x27;t notice any overwelming fragrance, but I did find that my skin felt better (softer and hydrated) after use.  I did not have any adverse reactions to this product either, no itching, breakouts or burning.  As for the cost, if my wrinkles look less noticeable eventually, then it&#x27;s worth it. If I just get soft skin, then it&#x27;s not, I could get soft skin much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The first thing you will notice about this product is the innovative and deluxe packaging.  The two products come in a nice leather case that would make them ideal for travelling, and also both feature interesting application processes.  One uses a brush - with the cream coming through the brush so you can \\&quot;brush on\\&quot; the moisturizer.  The other has a ball to apply the serum.  While both applicators are innovative and interesting, I do worry about the cost that goes into this level of packaging, as I prefer products that spend the money on the actual product.  Also, I don&#x27;t know if my concerns are valid, but I worry about the hygiene of the brush, since it stays caked in moisturizer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the products...  I find skin care is a very personal choice, as everyone has different skin that reacts differently to different products.  These feel to be extreme moisturizers that do a great job, and as other reviewers have noted I can see how some skin reacts very positively.  However, I prefer a cream that leaves my skin feeling moisturized but relatively dry.  With both of these products there was a bit of an oil sheen left on my skin that I did not find as pleasant as other creams I use.  That being said - they do a great job at moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product would be enhanced if they gave a more detailed instruction sheet.  It comes from a Spanish company, and can be a little confusing.</li>
    <li> I do have to give the disclaimer that my skin can be well, finicky when it comes to certain products. I still wanted to give this a try and I figured that since it was supposed to have plant stem cells, I wouldn&#x27;t really have that much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue here is that my skin broke out somewhat terribly after a day or so of using it. After a few days of use I had about 3-5 zits that weren&#x27;t there beforehand and so I stopped using it. My skin has cleared up since then, so I think that this stuff just isn&#x27;t compatible with my skin type. I&#x27;d classify my skin as \\&quot;combination\\&quot; leaning towards oily at times, depending on the temperature and humidity outside. I was also slightly irritated by the packaging. The silver tubes are pretty, but the brush seems like it&#x27;d get stiff with lotion gunk after a while and I can&#x27;t help but think that these wouldn&#x27;t be just as well served by putting them in a cheaper tub and scooping them out with your fingers rather than pushing a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing I can say about it is that while I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after one use as far as overall wrinkles and toning goes, my skin did feel softer. My mom has begun using it since I can&#x27;t and she hasn&#x27;t seen a huge difference either in comparison to cheaper \\&quot;lift and tighten\\&quot; brands, but she&#x27;s remarked that she really does like how soft it makes her skin. Now just to put people to rest, she hasn&#x27;t started breaking out and she&#x27;s been using it for over a week now. I think she&#x27;d consider her skin to be oily, if that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is OK, but given how easily it makes me break out I wouldn&#x27;t get another container of it. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it did make my skin soft and my mother&#x27;s skin soft, but I can&#x27;t help but wonder if you couldn&#x27;t find that in another product that&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have always been told I look young for my age but I can see the wrinkles...especially in the last few years. I like to blame it on the hard water and not my age &lt;G&gt;, but I have one really big crease in my forehead. (I wonder why the hard water settled there...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack comes with two elixirs, each one encased in its own solid-sized application tube. One is for heavy duty repair--you can put it on at night and in the morning--that big old forehead crease is actually diminished. The other is for daily application; you can put it on before your makeup. One comes in a brush, the other a silver roller-ball kinda applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually feel the ointments working on your skin. They smell nice, they tighten and relax as needed, and I really like them both. They both seem fairly effective, which is the bottom line. They aren&#x27;t cheap, but they do what they say they&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me likey.</li>
