      <li>The primer makes it so much easier to take off the mascara, not to say that my lashes are thicker and look longer.</li>
      <li>I thought that I had ordered another product but when I received and applied it on my lashes, I was pleasantly surprised to like the color and the affect it gave me.</li>
      <li>My sister says that some of them seem to be old.  </li>
      <li>I bought a bunch of these because it is the only mascara that makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
      <li>With thin lashes its easy to smear onto eyelid on the first application, with this it doesn&#x27;t show if it happens.</li>
      <li>Gives enough body after clear application to prevent errors.</li>
      <li>My lashes look long and lush.</li>
