    <li> Wonderful fragrance and not over powering to those around you. I have been reordering the Gardenia for several year&#x27;s now and plan to continue adding Plumeria. Price on both&lt;br /&gt; is also great. You should not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very subtle-not too strong-but nice</li>
    <li> I like this perfume but not crazy about it</li>
    <li> Really smells bad; not at all like the lovely plumeria I bought in Hawai&#x27;i.  I even had trouble giving it away - no one really wanted it.</li>
    <li> I love these perfumes.  I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Use as much as you like, it smells just like the plant. I always get remarks about how fresh and clean I smell when I wear it. It&#x27;s my favorite of all the fragrances, I&#x27;ve loved it for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present</li>
    <li> love this perfume, it has been my favorite for over 20 years. It reminds me of Hawaii and the few times I&#x27;ve been there. Their product is consistent order after order, the perfume doesn&#x27;t change the scent at all, it&#x27;s consistently wonderful each bottle I purchase.</li>
    <li> It was to be a mist type bottle, it came as a roll on. So how do you expect me to fell  on the quality control of your items. Bad QC.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Plumeria for years. She usually uses oil but this spray is perfect for travel or when she is in a hurry.</li>
    <li> So true to Hawaii. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> TAKE ME BACK TO HAWAII</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume :0)</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly..excellent quality. Reminds me of Hawaiievery time I wear I!  It is exactly the same as the one I bought in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I did not like the scent.  It did not smell like plumeria.</li>
    <li> I love this scent - it is exactly what I was hoping to find.  I wear it every day and will definitely purchase more when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Smells sooooooo good.  But like all colognes, the scent does not last.</li>
    <li> Smelled good, but scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the delivery process was really easy.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite hands down!!!  She wears this almost every day, and all special occasions.  I love the lightness and memories this cologne invokes.  Back to Hawaii when ever I smell this cologne.  If you love the Islands and would like to be carried back again, this is the cologne to give!!!!</li>
    <li> We bought this particular plumeria perfume while in Hawaii five years ago.  We liked it the best of all we sampled.  I have ordered more twice online but this is the first time from this seller, who did an excellent job.  It is easier to order it from Amazon than from the factory in Hawaii.  The difference in cost between the two is only a few bucks.  It is a lovely scent that my wife uses frequently.  And I love it too.</li>
    <li> My new favorite perfume, smells just like the beautiful flower I remember!  It shipped promptly and was packaged very carefully.  Thank you very much, I think of the beautiful island each time I smell it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and well packed with care. Smells very good.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this cologne people get next to me and sniff the fragrance and just say how beautifully tropical it is and those who have experienced the Plumeria in Hawaii first hand talk about how it reminds them of their sojourn in the islands.</li>
    <li> This is an enticing scent that makes me feel like I am back in the islands.  It does not last very long though, and requires frequent re-application.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a fragrance that I like.  When I found this in Hawaii, I bought some and I am glad that I can buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this fragrance because I love the Plumeria scent. I was NOT disappointed. It is ever so light and refreshing and just enough. I will be reordering and also trying the other fragrances: White Ginger and Pikake. I think this seller is a winner!</li>
    <li> Great gift for yourself!  Highly recommend.  Goes very well with the matching lotion.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in Hawaii.  Very good seller, too.</li>
