      <li>what a wonderful, high quality Tiara.  </li>
      <li>It came quickly, and most importantly, the bride-to-be loved it!!</li>
      <li>My girlfriend bought this for her birthday, it came in 2 days, it&#x27;s beautiful and exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.</li>
      <li>The first day I got it it looked great  </li>
      <li>This tiara is beautiful, heavy weight, feels like very good quality.  </li>
      <li>We ordered this Tiara for our High School prom and the kids just loved it!  </li>
      <li>The tiara is beautiful, very well-constructed and made of sturdy metal which makes it feel more &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The headband ones are much better.</li>
      <li>I love this tiara.</li>
      <li>I was still able to use with 2 Bo by pins</li>
      <li>This was a gift for a friend, and she quite enjoyed it on the day of her birthday.</li>
      <li>Cute but one of the stones fell out</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It was not well put on, if they were better placed I don&#x27;t think they would have fell off.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go around your head just up top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got weight to it, so make sure it is well fixed in your hair, but I am still so impressed to find such great quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Special because of the comb, making it very easy to put on head ( no headaches )</li>
      <li>The comb should be more securely attached.</li>
      <li>My wife bought this for her friend to wear to the bachelorette weekend and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that great of quality, but this thing looks really nice, it&#x27;s made of metal instead of cheap plastic and is very solidly built.</li>
      <li>So pretty absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I was looking for something sturdier that my daughter wouldn&#x27;t easily break.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful tiara</li>
      <li>But overall it looked beautiful.</li>
      <li>very nice weight..much more elegant than I expected</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and if I pile my hair on my head I can get it to work, sort of.</li>
      <li>With my innovation, the tiara worked out fine.</li>
      <li>maybe the fine hair...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> came missing stones, but still pretty</li>
    <li> Very pretty- missing one gem, hardly noticeable. Biggest problem was that it&#x27;s a bit top heavy (or front-heavy). Wanted the bride to be able to wear it at a surprise shower, so her hair was just down and the comb of this was stuck into the front, and it kept falling right out when she looked down to open gifts. Slightly dangerous actually as it&#x27;s so heavy. Very pretty for just standing around and looking straight forward though.</li>
    <li> The quality was much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This crown is heavy duty and not flimsy at all.  It only has one comb in the middle to hold it so I suggest pulling your hair back into a thick rubberband on top and sticking this comb through it.  Help hide the rubberband by pulling hair over it and securing it and the comb with a few bobby pins.  This lasted for a solid 8 hrs for prom before we took it out and it hadn&#x27;t moved an inch!</li>
    <li> It looked nice, unfortunately it was very poorly constructed.  The comb snapped off almost immediately, rendering it unwearable.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous!  Better quality than I/ expected, especially for the price.  It is only a front piece. There is no metal going around the head. It has a nice big comb that will hold it in place. Perfect for a wedding, birthday, pageant. Anything!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!! Just took a lot longer to get here than the description</li>
    <li> This tiara is beautiful, heavy weight, feels like very good quality.  I can only give it 4 stars just because it would NOT stay on my head. Another reviewer commented that maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for people with fine hair...? I have very fine but thick, curly hair, had it pulled back tight in a bun to wear this, and it would last maybe three minutes up there before sagging off to the side. I have a typical-sized head that is rather flat on top...maybe it was the flatness that did me in...maybe the fine hair...I don&#x27;t know. 5 stars for quality, 4 stars for universal fit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful tiara and the tiara itself is very nice quality. I was looking for something sturdier that my daughter wouldn&#x27;t easily break. Well, within 2 hours the flimsy comb piece that is attached to the tiara snapped right off. I was so disappointed, as was my daughter. The seller asked for my feedback and I told them what happened and got barely an acknowledgement...</li>
    <li> This arrived broken. The tiara itself is beautiful. The comb is held by thin wire. It isn&#x27;t sturdy.</li>
    <li> Way too heavy to keep in place with the flimsy hair comb that is welded to it...</li>
    <li> A little tiny, but for the present to a 7 year old it was exactly what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tiara, but didn&#x27;t seem to stay in hair well</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this for her birthday, it came in 2 days, it&#x27;s beautiful and exactly as pictured. EVEN bigger actually! Get this product, you won&#x27;t regret it, dudes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tiara but oh so difficult to keep on your head!</li>
    <li> It started falling apart the second I touched it. Lol. Oh well. It was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The tiara was beautiful. It had a lot of sparkle and did not look cheap or like costume jewelry at all. I had no problem with it staying on my head during my wedding and reception either.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tiara for a great price, the bride loved it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece, the only reason I put 4 instead of 5 is that the comb broke off after the first use. In it&#x27;s defense I did not have it stored in the box when this happened. If they soldered the comb piece in a bit better I think it would be perfect. I was still able to use with 2 Bo by pins so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Very bad product.&lt;br /&gt;The first day i tr&amp;iacute;ed putting This tiara on my head, broke. Doesn&#x27;t stay still. And there is not way to put it on my head.</li>
    <li> I love this tiara. I bought it for a librarian convention so I could be Queen, and sometimes I like to wear it just because. Similar tiaras at local bridal stores are 10x more expensive. This is great, everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend, and she quite enjoyed it on the day of her birthday. Two days later, a piece of it broke and now it is unusable. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The first day I got it it looked great  till I looked more at it and it was missing some stones.</li>
    <li> My daughter is thrilled!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  There&#x27;s a comb behind the jewels.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wedding day</li>
    <li> It was beautiful but the clip is made of extremely cheap thin metal and mine came broken</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 tiaras, one was broken</li>
    <li> Great quality and received it quickly!</li>
    <li> Great Value, Very Pretty piece of costume jewelry!</li>
    <li> Much better quality then I expected. Just don&#x27;t know how to use the two handles on each side. Hope they have instruction on how to make it stable on your head.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tiara. Solid, and well made for the price. Needs extra pins to hold it in place, but it has a spot for those, so it won&#x27;t show in your updo.</li>
    <li> This review is on the BelleSha Queen Sophia Tiara. what a wonderful, high quality Tiara.  I am pleasantly surprised at this tiara.  It is so well made with nice, sparkly, rhinestone crystals.  It is very beautiful. Can be used for many occasions such as pageants, prom, wedding or anytime.  I highly recommend it. I received this tiara for review purposes and provide my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> We ordered this Tiara for our High School prom and the kids just loved it!  It is beautiful (exp for the price!)</li>
    <li> Very well constructed for the low price. Surprised by the quality and dazzle. Niece who ordered it is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> So pretty absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought  this to wear on my wedding day. I love it. It is made very well .. but it only has one big comb to secure it to your head but it works and matches the necklace and earrings set I had bought. I can not wait to wear it on our big day!!!</li>
    <li> It took about 2 days to get to me and is a very good quality heavy in weight not cheap looking at all. Please not there is one big comb to put it on your head securely not two small ones on each side like most tiaras.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful tiara. I wore it for a couple days in a row. The only problem I have with it is that after a couple days of wearing, the comb became detached at one corner from the tiara. It&#x27;s a heavy piece! The comb should be more securely attached.</li>
    <li> Pretty and won&#x27;t fall out of your hair. A little on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> Was missing some stones but didn&#x27;t have time to return so had to purchase more stones to fill in</li>
    <li> Tiara was beautiful and arrived quickly. Only flaw was a few jewels missing</li>
    <li> The tiara I received was not like the one pictured in that it attached differently and, unfortunately, not for the better.  The quality of the tiara is excellent for the price in that it is heavy metal and nicely detailed.  My problem was that the comb with which you are supposed to attach the tiara was not at the back (like in the photo), but right behind the front of the tiara attached to a wire.  I thought maybe the wire was supposed to pivot toward the back but it was welded to the front.  There was nothing at the back to keep the tiara from moving around.  I ended up attaching a rubber band between the &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; in order to keep the tiara on.  With my innovation, the tiara worked out fine.</li>
    <li> This tiara was bought as a gag gift for one of my employees.  It is heavy, not flimsy and looks very stunning.  It definitely was a hit.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this tiara....It broke in my hand  as I was putting in my hair for the first time and I was very gentle with it.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and kept falling out.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous. This tiara is amazing. Great quality, more beautiful even than pictured. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. It&#x27;s got weight to it, so make sure it is well fixed in your hair, but I am still so impressed to find such great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter as a dress up piece.  I was hoping for a headband-type tiara but mis-read the description where is says haircomb piece.  It has two metal loops at the ends which we used to secure it with bobby pins.  The tiara is beautiful, very well-constructed and made of sturdy metal which makes it feel more &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;.  My daughter loves it and has worn it multiple times.</li>
    <li> Substantial size. Very pretty. Special because of the comb, making it very easy to put on head ( no headaches ) You will feel like a Queen when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Comb broke off before I even had a chance to wear it! Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I think itz my fault but the pic here is a mirror image.&lt;br /&gt;this tiara is very beautiful.  and very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;it is also meant for an &amp;#34;UPDO&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;and that wuz my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;but, buy it.  itz beautiful.</li>
    <li> Awesome shine and sparkle. Looks very expensive.</li>
    <li> The photo is a bit misleading. It looks like a full tiara in the photo when what you receive is more of a half moon shape. Imagine drawing a line directly under the middle, what that would cut off on each side is actually a reflection in the photo. It does feel sturdy,not cheap and flimsy. There is 1 comb in the middle which is more comfortable than 2 side combs. It does look great while wearing.</li>
    <li> It sits weird on my head. I wanted it for a Prom Night for Adults costume party. It really would be better for a wedding bridal head piece as it states in the title. It still is heavy and sits so far back on the head that even with a veil it would be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> gift recipient was happy</li>
    <li> Hair comb/clip broke off shortly after using a few times.</li>
    <li> considering this tiara only had rhinestones it sparkled like real ones. great packaging for shipment too</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her friend to wear to the bachelorette weekend and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that great of quality, but this thing looks really nice, it&#x27;s made of metal instead of cheap plastic and is very solidly built.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful and high quality item. It&#x27;s a nice weight as well. Perfect as a bridal accessory. Also, it arrived just as Amazon said it would.</li>
    <li> really great quality for the price, pretty good weight, very sturdy, not cheap looking at all - I was surprised</li>
    <li> Nice size, lovely craftmans ship, great value!!!</li>
    <li> This tiara is pretty but I received it missing rhinestones!</li>
    <li> The wifey liked it but her head is smaller and unfortunately the tiara cannot be bend in because there are 3 wires fused to the tiara that prevents it from bending either to the inside or to the outside. We tried to bend it in, but 2 or 3 of the decorative stones popped out. Ouch! not good. This tiara is kind of heavy my wife also have very smooth and thin hair so the only solution for the tiara to stay firm and prevent it from falling or moving was to make a firm and tight hair bun on top, slightly to the back of her head, tie the edges or the tiara with a thin string and wrap it around the bun and use small hair pins. That kept it in place for a long while. But you cannot jump or make sudden movements with your head because it may loosen up.</li>
    <li> I was surprise by this product. I was expecting a plastic regular tiara, well thisnprodict it is not plastic is metal and the stones are beautiful, cod easily pass for a real tiara.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Made my wedding day, so happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> Heavy well made tiara. Perfect for my wedding day.</li>
    <li> Better build quality than I expected and good value for money</li>
    <li> not a head band..just a comb, missing stones were in bag..very nice weight..much more elegant than I expected</li>
    <li> The bottom jewels fell off unexpectedly. It was not well put on, if they were better placed I don&#x27;t think they would have fell off. The tiara itself is nice minus jewels part.</li>
    <li> Cute but one of the stones fell out</li>
    <li> made of metal and fairly heavy</li>
    <li> Loved it, I was going to an Oscars party and had to dress as an actress, which had to guessed. I did Holly Go Lightly, Breakfast at Tiffanys, won an Oscar!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a costume for my daughter, she loved it and plays with it often.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy. Meant for a very small head, if you want to wear it as a crown instead of on top of a bun.  You&#x27;d need very thick hair and make it into a bun or add extensions and then attach the crown over it. It&#x27;s beautiful but not very useful. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece for price.  Just like the ones in the bridal shops.</li>
    <li> This tiara is so pretty and sparkly!!  I love it!  It looks classy and not at all cheap.  I would buy again as a gift.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sit on the head very well unless you find an elastic strap to hook to the sides even with the comb.  It sits lopsided.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t curve around the top of your head and they are quite heavy.  I don&#x27;t know how you would attach it to your head without tying it on!!  Very pretty, but not functional.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Big and sparkly! ! You may need extra Bobby pins to keep it in place depending on the thickness of your hair.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful tiara but unfortunately it has horrible construction. I bought this item twice and I returned them because they were both broken once I open the box :( I give it less than a star</li>
    <li> Bought this for a costume. Love it so much I want to wear it all the time. Well-made, gorgeous. Feel like a princess when I put it on.</li>
    <li> this is high quality and sturdy. It stands a little higher on my head than I thought. It is heavier than I expected. And you need a fair amount of hair for the comb to work. I have fine hair and if I pile my hair on my head I can get it to work, sort of. If I put my hair down, it is non-functional</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece, but hard to keep on the head.</li>
    <li> It was nice, but so heavy it wouldn&#x27;t stay on her head. The price was right</li>
    <li> perfect, best gift for our princes</li>
    <li> It was very pretty, but the comb broke off the first time it was put on and it was handled very gently. It can&#x27;t be fixed and it can&#x27;t be worn. And it didn&#x27;t have the headband piece shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it and it looked beautiful on.</li>
    <li> Soooo beautiful and so worth it!</li>
    <li> Beats the 160$ one at the bridal store, one stone fell out but u glued it back and I think it only feel out since I accidentally dropped it on the hard floor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 yr old niece to wear to Disneyland and was worried it would be too big considering this is an adult tiara. It went the entire width of her head and mine.  It has a wide comb and little hooks on each end to thread pins through.  The little hooks didn&#x27;t touch her head or mine, so they were useless.  That was the only downside.  We put a ton of pins where the comb was and she left this on all day and night without a single complaint.  It did not come loose during rides, after hugs from characters, and looked great in photos.  I gave it a 4-star rating b/c two of the smaller jewels fell out.  One fell out at home, when I had glue and could glue it back on.  The 2nd one fell out the morning of Disneyland.  You can&#x27;t tell unless you look at it, but kept me from giving it 5 stars.  In all honesty, they could have fallen out b/c I tried to curve the end with the hook in a little. That pressure could have loosened the jewels.  No big deal, it was a BIG hit.  It comes in a small shipping box (inside the amazon box,) which was nice for travel (it didn&#x27;t get broken in the suitcase) and unexpected.  It was beautiful and she loved it.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Too heavy to be held by a comb.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED it!!  It came quickly, and most importantly, the bride-to-be loved it!!</li>
    <li> A stone was missing.  Although it was in the package the prong to hold was broken.</li>
    <li> Really beautiful and perfect for my wedding</li>
    <li> Love it! Looks amazing. Would have given 5 stars however the comb part of tiara seems like it will break off and there is no other way to hold it on. It doesn&#x27;t go around your head just up top.</li>
    <li> This tiara is absolutely beautiful, nice weight to it. It did come with one stone missing right in the center but it was easily replaced with no need to go back to the seller. You can&#x27;t be it for the price!</li>
    <li> Wow! No complaints, great value it was more than i expected nice and heavy not flemzy or cheap looking and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day.</li>
    <li> Incredible quality for the price. For this price point, I would expect plastic but this item is not. It is seemingly metal, which creates quite a bit of weight, actually, so be prepared for that.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for child....and ugly!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Sturdy which is especially important for my purposes. I use it in my girls Bible class as a reward for good behavior so each week a different little girl is handling it. It would be nice if it came in a little plastic box for storage. Again given my use I think it would provide longer term protection but I can&#x27;t fault the company for not reading my mind for what would work best for me!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and it fits my head perfectly.  The comb is comfortable, and with a few bobby pins, should stay in place even in my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome piece! Looks very ellegant. The only thing is, it is a little heavy so it kept moving around. But overall it looked beautiful.</li>
    <li> Beautiful my daughter will love it!</li>
    <li> Way higher quality than I expected.</li>
    <li> Tiara would not stay on head, too top heavy.  The headband ones are much better.</li>
    <li> I think it is a beautiful piece but we had to re-glue many of the stones back in.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a full crown. Not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my little niece. I took her to see Cinderella for her 3rd birthday. It is a very good deal for the money. However I didn&#x27;t like the way that the comb was placed on it. Made it more difficult for it to stay anchored.</li>
