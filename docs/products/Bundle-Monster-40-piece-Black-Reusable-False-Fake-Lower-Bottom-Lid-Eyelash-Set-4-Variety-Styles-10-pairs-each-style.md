      <li>theyre good quality , love them</li>
      <li>For those who put good reviews perhaps you got a better box of lashes.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can re-use these lower lashes at this price for this amount.</li>
      <li>but I thought I&#x27;ll give it one more try</li>
      <li>ok for the price</li>
      <li>Love my bottom lashes.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did .</li>
      <li>Love this so many looks</li>
      <li>I love amazon but no these</li>
      <li>but I used duo lash glue for these babies and they went on like magic...</li>
      <li>but thr is a reason why you get so many</li>
      <li>but they could be better.</li>
      <li>Very good quality too, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>the Bundle Monster Top lashes too to go with it, and I think the top lashes look great all by themselves and with a double coat of mascara on the bottom lashes to tie them together.</li>
      <li>If you need something to stand out, and easily disposable then fine go ahead and purchase these, but I&#x27;m telling ya&#x27; these lashes suck.</li>
      <li>i think these are good eyelashes that will give you an idea of what eyelashes look good on you, and the really festive spikey thick ones would be great for halloween.</li>
      <li>I like it better than real lashes because these are more sturdy and don&#x27;t break as easily.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like them, they didn&#x27;t fit well.  </li>
      <li>cheap, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>I rarely use bottom lashes but when I want to make my yes pop even more I add sone bottom lashes.  </li>
      <li>If you have long bottom lashes this will look great</li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>I havent used the product yet but they came quickly and look like they look in the pictures.  </li>
      <li>The product is as described and is exactly what your looking for if you can do them, but I would say there is a huge learning curve.</li>
      <li>My medications have cause hair loss and these with the black adhesive look great.</li>
      <li>Pretty assortment of lashes!</li>
      <li>and although I don&#x27;t use everyday, I&#x27;ve been using the same one since I first started and they are still good and stay on great once applied.</li>
      <li>Even the most natural looking ones give that effect.</li>
      <li>I didn like but 2 of the styles but for the affordable price they were worth it.</li>
      <li>but once u learn how to apply them to look natural you will love them..</li>
      <li>Used with the right glue, it stays on all day.</li>
      <li>They kind of just give me a &#x27;doll eye&#x27; look, or pretty theatrical.</li>
      <li>and WOW do they really make your eyes look big and amazing!</li>
      <li>Many different styles of lashes.</li>
      <li>Im ready to try them!</li>
      <li>They look exactly how they were described.</li>
      <li>Especially coupled with the top eyelashes, these are a MUST.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy again if available but it&#x27;ll be a long while since it may take me almost a year to finish up the ones I have :)</li>
      <li>The price is really good for these lashes, but I find it really hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although some of the lashed aren&#x27;t very neatly cut, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter because nobody is going to pay that much attention to them anyways ^___^</li>
      <li>, i get so much in a box for such a cheap price .</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I bought some from a store and the adhesive burned my eye which really hurt.  </li>
      <li>there is so much of them</li>
      <li>I know they didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t resemble real lashes at all.</li>
      <li>Bottom lashes are really tricky</li>
      <li>I still have the whole box.</li>
      <li>so much they didn&#x27;t stay on</li>
      <li>Availability tends to be hit and miss, but it&#x27;s a reasonably priced variety.</li>
      <li>Really love it and look natural i bought bottom lashes from (red cherry)</li>
      <li>There are 4 different styles ranging from natural to more glam like.  </li>
      <li>These are neat but they are super long so it takes a lot of effort to get them just right.</li>
      <li>I use it on special occasions or parties and it makes my eyes look bigger.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look or how easy it would even be to apply, but I decided to take a chance, especially since I ordered the top fake lashes bundle from this same seller.</li>
      <li>Very flexible and not stiff at all.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really think they look natural at all.</li>
      <li>The eyelashes themselves are really great, they don&#x27;t feel fake or plasticy and there is a pair in there that will make your eyes look like Twiggy.</li>
      <li>According to the wife &amp;#34;Decent product, trim to fit then cut them in half because they are so much easier to put on.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, but you see more of the lashes than your supposed to, instead of them sticking</li>
      <li>You can clearly see the glue that was used to make them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve had these lashes for over a month</li>
      <li>The were a little challenging to apply at first since I&#x27;ve never used them, but after a few tries I got it just right</li>
      <li>made my eyes look so amazing which gave them that dramatic look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to stick to traditional brands even if you get 38 pieces less!!</li>
      <li>Ten each, I don&#x27;t use these often only when I really want to go for a doll like look.</li>
      <li>well, when placing these lashes near your eye, I found they irritated my eye immensely.</li>
      <li>I consider myself the guru at putting on false lashes but these are incredibly challenging.  </li>
      <li>So when I saw this awesome deal on these little bad babies I had to pick them up.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t the soft lashes that I am used to, more fake and plastic feeling, but for the quantity and price  no complaints.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I had trouble putting them on at first</li>
      <li>very cheap quality fake eye lashes.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that they are a bit on the cheap end, but can only be expected from the cost of the item.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> average quality .. ok for the price</li>
    <li> I bought some from a store and the adhesive burned my eye which really hurt.  So when I seen these I was skeptical in using lashes again but I thought I&#x27;ll give it one more try and I&#x27;m glad I did . The adhesive didn&#x27;t burn my eyes and the lashes made my eyes look so amazing which gave them that dramatic look.</li>
    <li> I still have the whole box. The lashes are plastic and look plastic. They don&#x27;t resemble real lashes at all. They are hard to glue on because of the material they&#x27;re made of. Wasted money and product. For those who put good reviews perhaps you got a better box of lashes. The box contains several different shape of lashes too which I wasn&#x27;t expecting because I didn&#x27;t see any where in the description at the time I ordered them that there would be some variety. Some of the lash shapes are just ridiculous and I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear them even if I went out for the night.. unless I decide to be a las vegas show girl. If you need something to stand out, and easily disposable then fine go ahead and purchase these, but I&#x27;m telling ya&#x27; these lashes suck.</li>
    <li> If you have long bottom lashes this will look great but if not then you may want to just get small individual lashes.  I have long dark bottom lashes so it hides the tiny plastic piece that has the lashes on it.</li>
    <li> Many different styles of lashes. Only complaint is that they are a bit on the cheap end, but can only be expected from the cost of the item.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can re-use these lower lashes at this price for this amount. I would give it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the very late delivery date. A great buy!</li>
    <li> these are so great , i get so much in a box for such a cheap price . I dont think i would purchase again becuz there is so much of them i dont even know when i would finish using them!</li>
    <li> Pretty assortment of lashes!</li>
    <li> Not a really good.quality. ........</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them, they didn&#x27;t fit well.  The lashes felt like they were plastic and not realistic looking.  Not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> i think these are good eyelashes that will give you an idea of what eyelashes look good on you, and the really festive spikey thick ones would be great for halloween. the bands are extremely thick and heavy. i found myself constantly having to push them up thru out the night. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on using these for long day or night outs bc theyll droop down a lot.</li>
    <li> Bottom lashes are really tricky but once u learn how to apply them to look natural you will love them..this package comes  4 different styles.I didn like but 2 of the styles but for the affordable price they were worth it.I have 20 pr that I do like .l  learned that if I cut them almost in half and apply mascara to my real lashes first then blend in false lashes with mascara, add a little gray or black eyeshadow under bottom lashes , they actually look natural..</li>
    <li> Arrived in tamper proof and unopened/new box condition. My medications have cause hair loss and these with the black adhesive look great. No need for lower lid eyeliner. Great price and arrived in time. Thanks</li>
    <li> thank you :) loved them! will be buying again, nice product over all loos natraul and pretty&lt;br /&gt;-Joselyn Cruz take care</li>
    <li> Great variety, they don&#x27;t stay put. I have to constantly reaply the glue at the corners or just cut the corners off.</li>
    <li> boo. cheap, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I rarely use bottom lashes but when I want to make my yes pop even more I add sone bottom lashes.  So when I saw this awesome deal on these little bad babies I had to pick them up.  I am so glad I did.  These were perfect.  There are 4 different styles ranging from natural to more glam like.  Very flexible and not stiff at all.  I will be repurchasing them again when I am done with these ones.  But with 40 pairs.  It&#x27;s going to take me awhile to go through unless I use them on my clients.</li>
    <li> Really love it and look natural i bought bottom lashes from (red cherry) and i was sooooo upset it was very long and look too fake.!!! But this product is very amazing and look natural love it!!!!</li>
    <li> These look really bad and very obviously fake and unnatural.</li>
    <li> According to the wife &amp;#34;Decent product, trim to fit then cut them in half because they are so much easier to put on.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes before but never bottom ones. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look or how easy it would even be to apply, but I decided to take a chance, especially since I ordered the top fake lashes bundle from this same seller. The were a little challenging to apply at first since I&#x27;ve never used them, but after a few tries I got it just right and WOW do they really make your eyes look big and amazing! Especially coupled with the top eyelashes, these are a MUST. Very good quality too, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> These are neat but they are super long so it takes a lot of effort to get them just right.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. They look exactly how they were described. Although some of the lashed aren&#x27;t very neatly cut, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter because nobody is going to pay that much attention to them anyways ^___^ Love them!</li>
    <li> I recommend these lashes for any and everyone who wears lashes... I have to admit that I had trouble putting them on at first but I used duo lash glue for these babies and they went on like magic... So if your having and trouble with the the duo lash glue works like a charm would definitely recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is not what my wife expected. Poor quality, no type of adhesive whatsoever and not worth the money. It&#x27;s better to stick to traditional brands even if you get 38 pieces less!!</li>
    <li> Never tried them and not for me . A waste money!  Will not but this ever again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry that I even purchased it.</li>
    <li> The price is really good for these lashes, but I find it really hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply this onto your skin, the eyelashes actually hang off the skin, rather than being supported by the band. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but you see more of the lashes than your supposed to, instead of them sticking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, when placing these lashes near your eye, I found they irritated my eye immensely. Everytime I blinked, it felt like these were being pushed in to my eyes slightly.</li>
    <li> Love my bottom lashes. Even my sister can&#x27;t keep her hands off of them, so I shared some.</li>
    <li> The box came with four different styles of lower lashes. Ten each, I don&#x27;t use these often only when I really want to go for a doll like look.</li>
    <li> I consider myself the guru at putting on false lashes but these are incredibly challenging.  The product is as described and is exactly what your looking for if you can do them, but I would say there is a huge learning curve. Practice Practice Practice before wasting a nights makeup on trying these bad boys for the first time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them. The strip itself and the lashes were too stiff. Tried a few times and the corners would always lift because they were not flexible enough to firm to the shape of my eye. Also, they were uncomfortable due to the stiffness.</li>
    <li> Availability tends to be hit and miss, but it&#x27;s a reasonably priced variety. Proper care and you can get several uses out of them.</li>
    <li> I was not inpressed. They were hard to put on and made my eyes water so much they didn&#x27;t stay on. They were very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes themselves are really great, they don&#x27;t feel fake or plasticy and there is a pair in there that will make your eyes look like Twiggy. But I don&#x27;t really think they look natural at all. They kind of just give me a &#x27;doll eye&#x27; look, or pretty theatrical.Even the most natural looking ones give that effect. I bought the Bundle Monster Top lashes too to go with it, and I think the top lashes look great all by themselves and with a double coat of mascara on the bottom lashes to tie them together.</li>
    <li> very cheap quality fake eye lashes. I am giving it a score of 3 because thr now all that bad for the price and how much you get... but thr is a reason why you get so many</li>
    <li> I love these falsies! They work great! Used with the right glue, it stays on all day. It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Took me a few tries to get it on since I&#x27;m new to false lashes but after that, it was simple and looks natural. I like it better than real lashes because these are more sturdy and don&#x27;t break as easily. So far I&#x27;ve had these lashes for over a month and although I don&#x27;t use everyday, I&#x27;ve been using the same one since I first started and they are still good and stay on great once applied. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again if available but it&#x27;ll be a long while since it may take me almost a year to finish up the ones I have :)</li>
    <li> I only received two styles and Ithought they&#x27;d be longer.  I know they didn&#x27;t cost much but they could be better.</li>
    <li> Does not stick at all</li>
    <li> the band is so uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Quality is great. I&#x27;m still practicing on putting them on.</li>
    <li> theyre good quality , love them</li>
    <li> I havent used the product yet but they came quickly and look like they look in the pictures.  Im ready to try them!</li>
    <li> These lashes look absolutely fake.  You can clearly see the glue that was used to make them.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even use these because they&#x27;re absolutely horrible looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend buy this.</li>
    <li> Horrible! I love amazon but no these where embarrassing Iwas at church and one i could see coming off i have the rest and do noot use them just waisted money do not by they dont stay on!</li>
    <li> Love this so many looks</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the soft lashes that I am used to, more fake and plastic feeling, but for the quantity and price  no complaints.</li>
    <li> band is a bit stiff but they&#x27;re sturdy and reusable.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I use it on special occasions or parties and it makes my eyes look bigger.</li>
