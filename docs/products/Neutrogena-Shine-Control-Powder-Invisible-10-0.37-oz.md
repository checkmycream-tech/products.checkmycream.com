      <li>Glad I found it at a great price and arrived quickly in original packaging as well.</li>

      <li>Had to order more;</li>
      <li>I use it with a powder brush and not the pad it comes with and that seems to work better for me.</li>
      <li>Perfect for controlling shine and you really only need to re-apply sparingly.</li>
      <li>and I like it much better.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love the shine control power of this powder.</li>

      <li>I love that the color truly IS invisible -</li>
      <li>My skin is combination, a bit oily on my forehead and eyelids mostly.</li>
      <li>and it was awesome, and I layered it on my face at night like a mask to put moisture back in</li>
      <li>Love this powder.</li>
      <li>I used Sally Hansen powder by Carmindy and my friend said the neutrogena powder would be so much better.......</li>
      <li>Nice product and worth the money!</li>
      <li>After using this powder on top of my makeup, I am shine free ALL DAY.  </li>
      <li>I applied this rather generously to really give it a fair shot.</li>
      <li>I like how it opens all the way up, easy to apply this or when checking eyeliner or trying to apply eye drops, etc.</li>
      <li>, it does a nice job of keeping my skin pretty matte for the day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>Following a youtube video for contouring they recommended this item as a great drug store find, easy to find anywhere..</li>
      <li>Still I enjoy they product.</li>
      <li>However it keeps my face oil free for maybe 4 hours NOT 8.</li>
      <li>I apply it over foundation and reapply lightly after lunch and by night my</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;skin is still oil free.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and silky</li>
      <li>I use an oil free lotion on days</li>

      <li>I blot my skin about every 30 minutes throughout the day and reapply powder if someone important is going to see me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not a problem -- you&#x27;ll get fabulous results with any makeup brush or disposabe puff that you have.</li>
      <li>, I have light to medium combination skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so light.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>I read about this product on Nouveau Cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
      <li>First, make sure that you toss out the sponge applicator packed inside.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really great stuff.  The only thing that I dislike about it is that it does lighten your color slightly.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, i&#x27;m glad with the results</li>
    <li> Spent hundreds of $ on skin care and powders. This stuff right here literally put my Arbonne skin care products to shame! Do not hesitate. If you have oily skin and can&#x27;t seem to keep your face looking fresh soon after applying makeup- then add this to your cart. I use an oil free lotion on days I go without make up. All I do is add this powder and out the door I go. I get complements on my flawless face. YAY! Found my &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t love without it&amp;#34; makeup addition.</li>
    <li> I love this shine control powder, it really works. it protects longer than other shine control powders, it is light and my face looks so natural. I&#x27;m not trying other powders after this one. If your skin type is oily or half oily I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin like I do, I recommend this one to set your makeup for the rest of the day. Once I set it with this in the morning, I barely have to retouch at the end of the day. But if you spend several hours outside in a place like FL at this time of the year... There is no magic makeup for that.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Invisible&amp;#34; really seems a bit too light, not truly invisible. But otherwise, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I like the powder fine, although it is a little white looking.  Luckily I&#x27;m pale so it blends.  It definitely controls the oil and the compact itself is very nice (easy to open).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT like the powder puff it came with.  The edge is sharp (not to you, just to the product) and it digs into the product making slice marks and wasting chunks of it.  I bought a new powder puff by CoverGirl (pack of 3) and I like it much better.  It fits inside the compact perfectly.</li>
    <li> I do love this product but I just opened mine and they forgot to put the puff pad applicator inside. No way to apply the product.</li>
    <li> A little on the pricey side for a drug store cosmetic purchase, but well worth it. If you have oily skin you need this stuff. It kills the shine instantly. This product really delivers.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is a Lil more expensive when it comes to health and beauty, and I say this because I&#x27;m a college student who has to work for the things she wants and pay for the things I have. I can honestly say I absolutely loved this shine control powder, it works it&#x27;s charms and I needed it, so I recommend it to all and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, really does improve shine. Only negative, it makes my skin appear a little more pale.</li>
    <li> I was using another loose powder for years that started out OK, then turned greasy, shinny within a couple of hours.  After speaking directly with a Neutrogena consultant, I switched to Neutrogena Shine Control Powder Invisible.  Delighted with the results.  It stays matted without shine for hours.  My only suggestion is to apply use a brush instead of the puff included in the compact.  It takes very little and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Really thick and heavy looking. It&#x27;s certainly &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; controlling. It will dry your skin out!</li>
    <li> I use it on my bald head, keeps the shine away but not as long as it claims, I guess it varies depending on your skin type.  Good product overall.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the shine control power of this powder. It is better than any other I have tried. My one complaint is that it settles into creases fairly easily (and I am young with little to no wrinkles). If you are careful with how you apply it, it can look very nice and not cakey. If you layer it on too thickly it is easy to look very bad.</li>
    <li> Works great for controlling oil.  I haven&#x27;t had to use blotting sheets all summer.</li>
    <li> Goes on well, clear, lasts for hours (depending on what your doing)...And I have no negative responses from my skin.  That&#x27;s huge!</li>
    <li> This shine control works well for my oily skin. It can hold for ~ 6 h. But I have used a half of it in a month. How can it goes so fast?</li>
    <li> I use it over foundation but under bronzer.  I also use a make-up brush to apply it.  I think if you did use the pad that comes with it and didn&#x27;t put bronzer or color over it, it could give you a white/pale look.  However I think the shine control it offers is great!  A little goes a long way so I see this lasting me a long time.  I would recommend this and will likely buy again when I use this up.  I use it just in the &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; where I need shine control and a finishing look.</li>
    <li> kind of works, but not my favourite. Also the shade was to white for me, so maybe they should give more choices of the product.</li>
    <li> Love this invisible control powder , I usually don&#x27;t wear allot of due makeup so this invisible powder is perfect, no Sheen or shimmer, nice translucent powder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shine Control Powder for a month now and at first I was really impressed with it as it does prevent oil from showing,&lt;br /&gt;but it also soaks up every ounce of moisture your face has.  I apply it over foundation and reapply lightly after lunch and by night my&lt;br /&gt;skin is still oil free.  (I apply it with a Kabuki brush) After about 3 weeks of consistently using it my skin got incredibly scaly.&lt;br /&gt;My cheeks, chin, forehead became parched for moisture.  I never even thought it could be this powder.  I&#x27;m 43 that is told I look 19 and 25 by&lt;br /&gt;women and men.  I&#x27;ve always kept my skin healthy so this was shocking.  I would literally get up in the morning and take packing tape, clear&lt;br /&gt;and cut off tape and stick it to my face and peel it off to get the surface dead skin off before applying moisturizer and make up.  (It works&lt;br /&gt;wonders by the way ladies, Scotch packing tape to peel off dead skin that is going to fall of anyway.  You can&#x27;t made dead skin reincarnate)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and bought Loreals Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition and it was awesome, and I layered it on my face at night like a mask to put moisture back in&lt;br /&gt;my skin and that STILL did not take away the dryness every morning.  I never use toner so nothing could be drying me out.  Then I realized maybe&lt;br /&gt;the Rice Bran formula was too much for me.  Even though I have oily skin usually (the reason why I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles) the powder, in my&lt;br /&gt;opinion only be used for special events not daily use.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it for 2 days now and this morning, hardly any dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result?  This is good every once in a while, it works well, but will turn your skin into the Mohave after a few weeks use.  I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;sorry I bought it, its a useful tool, but I&#x27;ll only use it if going on a date or interview.</li>
    <li> This powder is fantastic - my skin usually doesn&#x27;t trouble me, but my nose gets incredibly slick, even in winter. Once I apply my BB cream or foundation, I set only my nose with this powder by pressing it on using the applicator provided. Since I have tan skin, I like to brush away any excess using my foundation brush so it doesn&#x27;t look ashy. Once I brush the excess away, it&#x27;s fair to call this a \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; powder. It keeps the shine at bay for 6+ hours; even when it feels like my nose is getting oily after a few hours, I find that the powder keeps it looking matte. Amazing! I would recommend only applying it to areas where you get excess oil - applying it to normal skin makes it look dry/flaky, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Unable to comment on it&#x27;s actually ability to control oil because mine came completely destroyed.</li>
    <li> Not really a match for oily skin. Frequent touch-ups required. No irritation or skin reaction.</li>
    <li> Although this powder does what its supposed to when it comes to shine, I domnt like the finish at all, definitely not natural. And it looks cakey after a while:(</li>
    <li> Great color. Not cakey and doesnt break me out.  Great product will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> It really helps skin to look better. Do not overdo it and you will be pleased with result! I put it over my makeup and it works really well.</li>
    <li> It works, just needs to be reapplied for me since I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. It really does control the shine in a way no other powder I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several of the $20+ brands. I would only recommend it for light skin though, since it has no real color. (It&#x27;s not white by any means, just really light, and although it blends into the skin, the color doesn&#x27;t quite disappear. Perfect for fair skin.)</li>
    <li> it didnt do much. didnt abosorb any oli at all. kinda broke my makeup.I didnt like it. But meh. it&#x27;s fine i guess.</li>
    <li> This product works like magic BUT there is such a small quantity of it, it won&#x27;t last a week, if that.  It would be far too expensive to use this on a regular basis. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone with combo or oily skin. I have combo skin so the t-zone gets especially oily and shiny as the day goes on. I usually initially apply this over foundation and concealer to absorb the shine, and then dab once in a while afterwards to touch up. When my mom used this, she complained that the powder was visible, but that has never been the case for me. The powder looks whitish but goes on transparent if used correctly. I would recommend starting with less and layering on more as needed to prevent an excessive buildup of powder, since I&#x27;m fairly certain that would be what causes the powder to be visible.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and can&#x27;t even use mineral powder. I wanted something to set my foundation and touch up with throughout the day. This powder has no concealing qualities--just diminishes shine and sets foundation. I use it with a powder brush and not the pad it comes with and that seems to work better for me.</li>
    <li> Great light powder for the finishing touches to set your makeup and have no shine all day.</li>
    <li> Following a youtube video for contouring they recommended this item as a great drug store find, easy to find anywhere..not where i live! Glad I found it at a great price and arrived quickly in original packaging as well. Will order from them again if they have something I need!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smooth and soft. Light in color. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well but it doesnt last the 8 hours if you have oily skin. Oiliest part of my face (my nose) looked oily after about an hour or two. The puff it comes with is useless so just throw it out. Either use a different puff or a brush. No odd smell. Can be a bit white when applied with a puff but not if applied with a fluffy brush.</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and I use this powder multiple times daily. It&#x27;s almost invisible and gives your skin a very nice and healthy look. It&#x27;s always in my purse.</li>
    <li> Awesome product 2nd time repurchased doesn&#x27;t break my skin out will repurchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, gentle, and it really works. No need to pay for more expensive items. Great price to take advantage of.</li>
    <li> Helps control shine for a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Shipped to you new! But, I could have paid the same price to get it at my local drugstore or beauty store. Amazon is usually for lower prices but good quality and brand named products! Other than that, happy with it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have acne prone skin. This made me break out.</li>
    <li> I have very oily face and wanted a product that can help makeup stay on for a while and control shine, this controls shine for a small amount of time. Makes face appear white.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. First, I find that in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B0081E6TKC Neutrogena Shine Control Primer, 1 Ounce]], it does a nice job of keeping my skin pretty matte for the day. I can use a touchup mid-day, but overall, it&#x27;s a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I like that it&#x27;s so light. I have light skin, and most pressed and loose powder is really too dark for my skin and makes me look yellow or orange. I can put this on using the sponge inside, or using a big brush to make it act like loose powder. It just disappears as long as I don&#x27;t put it on too heavily (in which case it can indeed look like you stuck your nose in baby powder). I can see how people with darker skin would have issues with the color, though--it really is white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dermablend powder and tarte Amazonian clay powder and they&#x27;ve been alright. But I tried this and it works great! I think it&#x27;s the rice protein. As a TIP: regardless of skin tone, pat it on under your liquid or powder makeup and also use it on top. It will last a longer. That tip should work for other brands too. Think about it like this: by the time your oil makes it to the top layer of your makeup (the setting powder) it&#x27;s already too late. But if you stop it at the source by putting setting powder on the skin before makeup you can slow down the process</li>
    <li> this powder does what it says, it is truly a shine control, I like it its light and easy to apply, I like it so far, I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Love it...It&#x27;s smooth and silky</li>
    <li> I definitely like the way this powder works on my super oily and sensitive face.  After I put my foundation on I apply this powder to give me a longer matte look. I touch up a couple of times through out the work day.  With regular powder I had to touch up a lot more often.  So I would recommend this for those with a shiny complexion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! My nose was always shiny - no more. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping in your purse for a quick touch up during the day, eliminates shine, also great if you want to skip foundation and just go for a light look</li>
    <li> I like how soft and blendable the powder is, but it seems to only work for a few hours and then my face gets oily again. I usually have to use an oil absorbing sheet by early afternoon.</li>
    <li> я парень с начала я пользовался обычной присыпкой но и за этого я иногда чихал  купил этот пудру из за того что у меня кожа очень жирная иногда после бритья запудрить свою кожу чтобы кожа не была очень жирной от этого появляется прыщи но это пудра мне не помогло это не для жирной кожи....и тому же от него очень пахнет пудрой&lt;br /&gt;I guy I used regular powder but I sometimes sneeze bought this powder because my skin is very oily sometimes after shaving confused your skin so that the skin was not very oily from it appears pimples but this powder did not help me this is not for oily skin....and the same from him very smell of powder</li>
    <li> This is the best at controlling the shine on my face from oily skin of anything I have ever tried.  I agree with other reviewers that the puff that comes with it is pretty much worthless, but that&#x27;s okay because I use a brush anyway.  I almost gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the container runs out so quickly.  Using it daily, the compact lasts for less than two months.  That just doesn&#x27;t seem like very long, especially considering how expensive it is.  But I decided that probably should not affect my rating of the effectiveness of the powder.  I am getting ready to order my fourth compact of it anyway...it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Been a part of my makeup routine for 2 years now, works wonders &amp; I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice matte finish. Takes the shine from oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done. Why write a longer review?</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I wanted, but it came smashed and unusable.</li>
    <li> I use this powder everyday. I live in a very humid area and I only have to reapply once or twice at the most during the day. My skin is pretty oily without using it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A must have throughout the day!</li>
    <li> This is a real winner from Neutrogena. The name, Shine Control Powder Invisible, says it all. If your skin is oily or has any irregularities, definitely give this a try. First, make sure that you toss out the sponge applicator packed inside. It&#x27;s awful and could eventually cause breakouts. This is not a problem -- you&#x27;ll get fabulous results with any makeup brush or disposabe puff that you have. Allow it to sit for a few minutes, and before you&#x27;re ready to leave the house you&#x27;ll be ready to face your public! Nice product and worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is the first powder I&#x27;ve found that will keep the shine off my face for hours. It never looks like make-up (I do wear it over foundation) and seems to work perfectly for my daughter&#x27;s very pale complexion as well as my &amp;#34;ruddy&amp;#34; redhead complexion (both using the translucent fair &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; color).</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and can get rather shiny by midday. I love this powder compact. It&#x27;s translucent---instead of hiding/covering your make-up, it helps it look refreshed.  Feels weightless, but it&#x27;s no &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34;---it&#x27;s powerful stuff! Snuffs out that shine in no time, and it LASTS. I&#x27;ve used the enclosed applicator pad and also a dome brush and both provide great, smooth, matte results. I can&#x27;t say it enough---I love this compact. Used to buy it at my local CVS, but when they stopped carrying it, I was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Must have for oil/shine control.</li>
    <li> I used Sally Hansen powder by Carmindy and my friend said the neutrogena powder would be so much better.......it wasn&#x27;t. I am going back to Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> I really like this shine control powder it works for me for up to 6 hours and does not cake.</li>
    <li> I only got the primer &amp; this powder out of the set and this powder is what really makes the difference. I have combination skin, but my skin is just naturally shiny without being oily (though it&#x27;ll get oily later) &amp; this really covers that up! my skin isnt shiny at all so i love it!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Used on caucasian skin for video interviews. Cut down the glare making the subjects look more natural.</li>
    <li> This is great. I have always been an oily person and now this really helps control my shine all day long.</li>
    <li> wonderful product - about the only think I have found to control my shine</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last for 8 hours but it does the job. I have OILY skin....like Saudi Arabia oil skin....like George Bush would go to war for my skin. So yeah the product was decent as long as you have a make up brush. It makes your skin look a lot smoother and matte-ified as well.</li>
    <li> Love this, totally sheer, and I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend gave me her old one after saying the tone was too white for her skin, but I love this! Had to order more; Perfect for controlling shine and you really only need to re-apply sparingly. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent at all, making it a perfect touch-up powder.</li>
    <li> This powder works better than I thought. I know nothing will completly keep me matte all day. Let&#x27;s face reality. I use to use Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminous Matte Pressed Powder Neutralizer #01 by Carmindy; this does not work for me in the summer months. Neutrogena shine control powder does work in summer. I only need to touch up once in an 8 hour day. My diet changed how oily my skin isn&#x27;t now.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. It helps control shine throughout the day. I do wish that it wasn&#x27;t so pale since I am black, and once it falls, you have a problem.</li>
    <li> Works well, but only controls for a few hours 3-4...and sadly it dropped, turning the solid into crumbs. Its still useful but just messy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, it works but it&#x27;s light and you need to put bronzer over it. I have really oily skin so it&#x27;s still fairly oily but I think this does help a bit.</li>
    <li> it absorbs all the oils and give a very smooth texture</li>
    <li> Works for my oilve yellow base skin color. However it keeps my face oil free for maybe 4 hours NOT 8. I only apply it on my T zone though. Doesnt cause breakouts and I have breakout sensitive skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 with medium skin tone and my cheeks and forehead get oily throughout the day. I bought this product because it said \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; and \\&quot;shine control\\&quot;. It does help with shine (I use it under my regular powder and over my foundation and moisturizer) however it isn&#x27;t totally transparent and can leave your face looking pale if you don&#x27;t put anything over it. I usually put it on in the morning and it keeps my face looking matte throughout the work day. I woudl give it a 5 if it actually wasn&#x27;t noticable or if it came in other shades.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. This powder helps keep me from looking like I dumped oil on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the best anti-shine powder ever.  Invisible.  Once a day in cold weather, more often in hot sun.  Lovely matt but natural finish</li>
    <li> Awful  packing. The powder spread all over inside the package.It came out out of the compact even before removing  the plastic package.It makes it difficult to close the compact, the powder is inside all the groves.How can you present merchandise for sale like this and for the price that you are charging.Extremely unprofessional and unattractive. I have been using Neutrogena products but  as things are now I do not think I will again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works to reduce shine but can go on very pale so you have to be careful when you use it not to use too much. It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of loose powders but I purchased this to keep in my purse for midday shine touch-ups.  This product does exactly that, it does not add extra color or coverage to your face (which I wanted) and keeps the shine at bay.  The little puff it comes with is not great but that&#x27;s easy to throw in your own.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with the oily skin problem I&#x27;ve been having.  Unfortunately, it makes zero difference.  I&#x27;m just as oily after a couple hours whether or not I use this powder.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> My skin is combination, a bit oily on my forehead and eyelids mostly. After applying my usual foundation I applied the Neutrogena shine control using a powder brush, not the puff it comes with. I applied this rather generously to really give it a fair shot. My skin was definitely less oily after a few hours. After 5 hours it was not working quite so well, but it did at least help somewhat. I do wonder at the color \\&quot;invisible.\\&quot; It seems to leave a very slight chalky appearance and I wonder if it would be too light for someone with darker skin. I am fairly satisfied with this product and will keep using it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin, especially my T-zone. My makeup always looks caked on even though all I use is a little Maybelline powder foundation because my skin gets so shiny even 20 minutes after I wash my face. I use this powder over my foundation and even though it doesn&#x27;t last all day, it gives me really good shine control for about 4 hours. It works for me and I would definitely recommend this product to others with oily skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, although I wish it was a little less expensive, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. As a Dark Skinned African American woman with mostly oily skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a powder that won&#x27;t make you look like a ghost in photos or in person, but this stuff works well. The key is moderation, of course. I would recommend using a puff to apply this, not the applicator included, as it is on the thin side. Also, give the powder time to set on your face before taking photos or going out...it will adjust accordingly and not look so powdery after about 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love that the color truly IS invisible - I would not say it makes your skin lighter than it already is - it simply does not add any color to it.  For someone with shiny (oily) skin, this is perfect.  I do have to re-apply several times throughout the day in the T-zone, but this is due to my skin type, not that the product is lacking in any way.  It goes on light and feels natural - definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product helps control shine but doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem. It&#x27;s better than not using anything and better than the much more expensive Clinique shine control product I&#x27;ve tried, but it has to be reapplied several times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Good product. Came right away.</li>
    <li> I have excessively oily skin. It is oily to the point that 10 minutes after washing my skin with any type of wash, scrub, mask, Clarisonic, hands, toner, etc., it already has oil accumulating in the pores. This all started when I turned 12 and it hasn&#x27;t stopped since, and I&#x27;m 32 now. Eeek!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try this while perusing the aisles at my local shopping center. I&#x27;ve tried all makes and models of &#x27;oil absorbing/oil fighting/oil blocking&#x27; powders and potions. I have not found a single thing that has worked magically for me, not even &#x27;really well.&#x27; I suppose I am a lost cause. I blot my skin about every 30 minutes throughout the day and reapply powder if someone important is going to see me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder did absolutely nothing for me other than give me a ghostly white cast with a weird sheen all over my face. What the heck. It did nothing in regards to absorbing my oil. Bummer. I used this every day for about 3 weeks before throwing it away. Total BS, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten comparable results, without looking like Casper, from cheapo powders in the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I fear I am doomed to having disgustingly obvious oily skin forever. Woe is me. And yes, I&#x27;ve tried milk of magnesia, I&#x27;ve tried high end primers, I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, it seems. The best truly matte oil absorber I&#x27;ve found to date? ------ Cornstarch baby powder. Only problem with that is it can clog my pores and if I sweat with it on it turns into white streaks. Embarrassing.</li>
    <li> Love this item! Hard to find a pressed powder that isn&#x27;t tinted, and also has a nice consistency. I like how it opens all the way up, easy to apply this or when checking eyeliner or trying to apply eye drops, etc. I&#x27;ve had some that open awkwardly and then it&#x27;s no longer a one-handed hold, and you have to rest it somewhere. Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, compact and easy to carry in a purse.  Does a excellent job and will be recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on Nouveau Cheap and I figure I&#x27;ll try it out.  At $8, it really couldn&#x27;t hurt.  But the shine control power of this powder just blew me away!  A little info, I have light to medium combination skin and I used to blot 2-3 times a day at work.  At the end of the day, I still have a shiny forehead.  After using this powder on top of my makeup, I am shine free ALL DAY.  I have been using it for 2 weeks and no breakouts, so fingers crossed and I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Really combats shine through out the day in my t zone</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different shine control powders and products, but this is my favorite one so far. I put it on once in the morning with a kabuki brush and it makes my skin looked airbrushed for several hours. On really humid days or days which I spend a significant amount of time outside, I do need to re-apply once in the afternoon, but that keeps me shine-free until the end of the night. I have very sensitive skin but this has not made me break out and hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin either. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a couple of weeks and it seems like I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it, which I&#x27;m very happy about. I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying again!</li>
    <li> Powder works great to help control that shine that sneaks out sometimes and makes you feel greasy. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t control my shine very well.  Still I enjoy they product.</li>
