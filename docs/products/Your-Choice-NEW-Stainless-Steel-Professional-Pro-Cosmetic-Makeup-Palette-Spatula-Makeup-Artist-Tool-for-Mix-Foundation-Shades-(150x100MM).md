      <li>Very easy to clean and sanitize in between uses.</li>

      <li>As expected, awesome quality.</li>
      <li>This makeup palette is a good quality stainless steel.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t see this set needing to be replaced for a while due to the great quality!</li>
      <li>I also like that everything is washable and can be easily sanitized.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable and has a nice weight to it.</li>
      <li>The thumb hole has rubber in it making it comfortable to wear/</li>
      <li>The rubber ring makes it so comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>Looks very professional and nice on any makeup vanity and to decorate the &amp;#34;girly cave&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This is a really cool pallet.</li>
      <li>I really was most interested in the spatula.</li>
      <li>Worth every Penny.  </li>
      <li>It is sturdy (as in not flimsy at all) and is just the right size.  </li>
      <li>The palette is just the right size.</li>
      <li>I used it to blend several cream foundations I have to test different colors on people and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I like to apply my liquid foundation with a brush, and this palette is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>When I first received it in the mail, I opened it and was truly amazed at the weight of it.</li>
      <li>exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged in a yellow cute pouch and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - put some liquid makeup on there and not waste it on foam pads or the back of your hand.</li>
      <li>even more so with their customer service to check up and make sure I was satisfied with my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any short vacation, rest assured it&#x27;s slim enough and has a nice thick plastic that it slides into with a little bag as well</li>
      <li>Very helpful that it comes with</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not flimsy, very sturdy.</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy made, highly polished stainless steel just like a mirror on both sides.</li>
      <li>The bag it comes in is kind of cheap &amp; useless, but the actual palette &amp; spatula feel heavy duty &amp; great.</li>
      <li>the palette and spatula are both polished stainless regardless of what the color lt looks like, you can even see the reflection of my fingers holding the camera and a few smudges already from my fingers touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>I can see myself in a product, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
      <li>I can mix multiple things at a time because it&#x27;s pretty spacious, and</li>
      <li>The tool is a quality piece and offers itself for mixing to your hearts content.</li>
      <li>so you have literally no waste.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is make the flat head side a bit more flexible, but I know it&#x27;s hard to do that and keep it stainless steel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much heavier than I expected and because it has the rubber won&#x27;t move around on the counter when you have it resting.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a professional touch to a makeup artist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful product and quick shipping! I&#x27;ll definitely be a returning customer!</li>
    <li> Came came quickly and cleans nicely.  I use it daily for makeup application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected..</li>
    <li> Small so check the measurements. But does the job as a palette. Love the palette knife.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with my purchase, it was really cheap, and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The spatula is handy because I use it to scoop out some of my eyeshadow and I turn it into eyeliner with other products.  I can mix multiple things at a time because it&#x27;s pretty spacious, and seriously how much eye does one have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it&#x27;s great for custom blending of colors or even foundations.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and even more so with their customer service to check up and make sure I was satisfied with my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any short vacation, rest assured it&#x27;s slim enough and has a nice thick plastic that it slides into with a little bag as well so it can go in a purse or bag and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a mess or poked holes</li>
    <li> This makeup palette is a good quality stainless steel. It is sturdy (as in not flimsy at all) and is just the right size.  I probably won&#x27;t use the spatula, but it&#x27;s very nice that it is included with the palette for those who need it.  I like to apply my liquid foundation with a brush, and this palette is exactly what I needed.  The seller shipped very quickly and the palette arrived in perfect condition.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good packaging, this is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It is nice and sturdy and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Worth every Penny.  Works Great</li>
    <li> I received this at a cheaper rate for review. The seller shipped both of my purchases together and made sure they were not damaged during shipment. I wanted these so I can play around with making my own beauty products. Both plates are nice. This is the bigger one of the two I purchased.</li>
    <li> Great pallet and knife. exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Worked as needed and as described. I guess my only complaint would be the little plastic case to get the spatula out was a little too tight. Needed to wiggle around to get it out. Other than that zero complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on quiet a few jobs since I purchased it. When I first received it in the mail, I opened it and was truly amazed at the weight of it. It&#x27;s not flimsy, very sturdy. Easy to clean. I would definitely order it again. However, I don&#x27;t see this set needing to be replaced for a while due to the great quality!</li>
    <li> This was a great product. It&#x27;s much heavier than I expected and because it has the rubber won&#x27;t move around on the counter when you have it resting. The spatula are solid and work to blend product well. I used it to blend several cream foundations I have to test different colors on people and it worked great. As a bonus the spatula is double-ended with a scraping end and I used it to scrape out the last of a lipstick which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I also like that everything is washable and can be easily sanitized. The only thing I would change is make the flat head side a bit more flexible, but I know it&#x27;s hard to do that and keep it stainless steel. I received a discount on purchasing this for reviewing this product, but all reviews are my own.</li>
    <li> Great stainless steel makeup palette! As expected, awesome quality. I love using a brush or my beauty blender with this. Thumb-hole makes it very easy to use. The palette is just the right size. Not too large, and small enough for travel. Very helpful that it comes with it&#x27;s own bag.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I expected but no big deal!</li>
    <li> Great bargain, a must have if you love make up. I am not a professional, but makeup is a hobby and I want it all! I have always wanted one of these, just never invested in one yet. This one is superb! Perfect size, light weight enough to be easy to hold, but heavy enough it will not bend or break. It is very sturdy made, highly polished stainless steel just like a mirror on both sides. The picture makes it look white to me but it is not. The rubber ring makes it so comfortable to hold. I took a pic and I am not good with pics, but I put the fine point sharpie marker in there to show you the size of the spatula with something you could compare it to. It is highly polished also, pointed on one end and round on the other. Small enough to fit down in a narrow neck of a foundation bottle if need be but strong enough to not bend. Has a grip pattern on the handle so it doesn&#x27;t roll around and slide in your fingers. It is polished enough the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice for color, the palette and spatula are both polished stainless regardless of what the color lt looks like, you can even see the reflection of my fingers holding the camera and a few smudges already from my fingers touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a nice plastic pouch to hold it in with the spatula, then a drawstring bag to carry it in. In my one pic, the yellow bag underneath is the carry bag. Very easy to clean and sanitize in between uses. I keep a bottle of brush cleaner on my desk to give my brushes a quick wash after each use, it works perfect to clean this also. Looks very professional and nice on any makeup vanity and to decorate the &amp;#34;girly cave&amp;#34;. I will be buying more of these as Christmas gifts for my daughters I am so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

Now i can put it on the pallet than my face. Love that. Also the spatula will be great in getting the foundation out of the bottle.Not sure how i would like the thumb holder but i just dont use it so it does not bother me. I got this at a review and love it. This would make a great unique gift of a make up lover.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It has excellent weight to it and has a beautiful mirror finish so I can mix make up on it AND use it as a mirror!

    <li> This stainless steel palette and spatula are great for mixing make-up colors.  I would recommend this to everyone.  The spatula is especially helpful in getting the make-up from the bottom of the bottle so you have literally no waste.</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> great product! The bag it comes in is kind of cheap &amp; useless, but the actual palette &amp; spatula feel heavy duty &amp; great.</li>

    <li> very good, like the size and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a neat little palette. I really was most interested in the spatula. It is a good size for getting makeup out of bottles,but the palette makes mixing easy. I use it to mix primer and my favorite foundation to get my own kind of BB cream. I like it better than premixed formulas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very durable and has a nice weight to it. Not cheaply made at all. The thumb hole has rubber in it making it comfortable to wear/ hold on my thumb or any other finger. The spactula is nicely made as well. Overall, it&#x27;s a professional touch to a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Love using this when applying makeup for my clients. It keeps everything sanitary this way and I love it. :)</li>
