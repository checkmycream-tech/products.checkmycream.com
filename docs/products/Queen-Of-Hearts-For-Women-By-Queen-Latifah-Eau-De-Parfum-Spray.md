      <li>How much do I love Queen Latifah and her perfumes.</li>
      <li>But love Queen Latifah.</li>
      <li>Probably you can wear it at home, smells more like soap than like a perfume.</li>
      <li>As the day wears on it smells even better.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and always get asked what I am wearing.  </li>
      <li>So as long as she was happy, I guess I am too!!</li>

      <li>You got yourself one loyal customer!</li>
      <li>and I will continue to purchase this item once available</li>
      <li>Stronger floral smell than I usually enjoy.  </li>
      <li>It just depends on want you enjoy.</li>
      <li>It was a cheap bling buying</li>
      <li>and I do enjoy it, but I prefer the body lotion over the spray.</li>
      <li>well, we all have different taste, so in short the perfume is in a nice bottle, smells simply ok, but is more suitable for elder women I guess...</li>
      <li>people ask me what i am wearing it smell good and last all day</li>
      <li>everyone I pass when wearing this very people catcher love it.</li>
      <li>It has this peculiar sweet scent that has a pleasing effect.</li>
      <li>Came fast and on time could not ask for more</li>
      <li>I have loved it since I found it and will keep buying this one as well as the other one in this perfume family</li>
      <li>I like more sweet scents, but that&#x27;s just my personal perfume preference.</li>
      <li>It is just the right mix of everything, lasts a nice long while and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I am 32 and cannot use it (not because it&#x27;s strong, but it reminds me of old perfumes smell from 80s that my mom used to spray on).</li>
      <li>and my friend loves it very much .</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a little more Floral than the original</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
      <li>A little too strong for me.</li>
      <li>It is a long lasting, unique fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>but I felt was too old for me.</li>
      <li>But completely deferential smell.i have the filling</li>
      <li>Scent lasts long though and I use it as a overlay to my usual scented body oil, very strong smell.</li>
      <li>A bit sharp scented at first, but mellows out to a soft lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>Wow....from rapper to major cosmetics deal to let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s next....</li>

    <li> A bit sharp scented at first, but mellows out to a soft lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> A little too strong for me. But love Queen Latifah. A little on the church lady side for me sorry.</li>
    <li> Gross. Very sweet smell. Gave it to my grandmother, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I will always give five stars for this fragrance. I have loved it since I found it and will keep buying this one as well as the other one in this perfume family</li>
    <li> my mom is missing/presumed murdered 29 years... In CT  we have &#x27;inmate playing cards in which - deck 1 - my mom was the queen of hearts-  plus i just luv queen latifah!  [...]</li>
    <li> The gueen original awesome. I really loved the original this one is alright and I use it for work so serve purpose</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who likes the original Queen Latifaha and she loved it. This fragrance is a little more Floral than the original but it smells good. They even sent me some testers along with the package. That was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I love this for me it is great perfume everyone I pass when wearing this very people catcher love it. thanks everyone love the smell it is so clean smelling just like getting out the shower love this one the best.</li>
    <li> I am a perfume freak. It was a cheap bling buying and i regret this. The smell is very synthetic and is much worse than Queen Latifah red botttle. Probably you can wear it at home, smells more like soap than like a perfume. But ...still stays on your skin even for this price.</li>
    <li> How much do I love Queen Latifah and her perfumes. Queen of Hearts smells so good and it lasts all day which I love so much. Thank you Queen Latifah, keep those perfumes coming! You got yourself one loyal customer!</li>
    <li> It was  a gift and my friend loves it very much . Great Buy.  Great price and it last for a LOng time.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t wow me. Last time I buy a perfume I&#x27;ve never tried online.</li>
    <li> people ask me what i am wearing it smell good and last all day i even bought her other perfumes they all smell real good</li>
    <li> People at work says it smells very good.</li>
    <li> Queen of hearts is the best scent that i have come across for 2013 and I will continue to purchase this item once available</li>
    <li> this is a good price for the size of product you get. I love Queen by Queen Latifah so i decided to try this one and even though i am a big fan of Queen i don&#x27;t like this one as much. Its doesn&#x27;t mix well with my lotions or fabric softner in my clothing. So even though it smells ok it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this s smells great came on time and good packaging nice n a&lt;br /&gt;Small for a gift goods great iten</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, and I do enjoy it, but I prefer the body lotion over the spray.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it had great reviews.  Wasn&#x27;t disappointed; the woman I gave it to for a Christmas present loves it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is wonderful it makes me happy to wear it .My husband loves this perfume and that always helps and it really last a long time c.m.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and always get asked what I am wearing.  This is a keeper!  This is going to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fall fragrance!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived just fine. Every time I wear the fragrance I get compliments.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance. As the day wears on it smells even better.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and it lasts long</li>
    <li> Stronger floral smell than I usually enjoy.  Scent lasts long though and I use it as a overlay to my usual scented body oil, very strong smell.</li>
    <li> Wow....from rapper to major cosmetics deal to let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s next....Queen Latifah totally rules. I have a signature fragrance for the evening, but this is my every other time fragrance. It is just the right mix of everything, lasts a nice long while and I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Amazon has the lowest prices anywhere too on this fragrance....and I will be ordering it from them again and again.</li>
    <li> Is smell good and I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought it relying on the reviews I read.... well, we all have different taste, so in short the perfume is in a nice bottle, smells simply ok, but is more suitable for elder women I guess... I am 32 and cannot use it (not because it&#x27;s strong, but it reminds me of old perfumes smell from 80s that my mom used to spray on). will give it out as a present.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, that I receive compliments on all the time but it is not being worn by every woman on the street. It is a long lasting, unique fragrance that lasts all day. Excellent buy for the money and this is my 3rd order, to have the smaller purse-size bottles, along with the larger dresser size bottles.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom and aunt. It has this peculiar sweet scent that has a pleasing effect. I like it!</li>
    <li> I brought it for my sister and she really liked it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Queen Latifah fan and have been wanting to try her perfume. This scent is very nice but I felt was too old for me. I like more sweet scents, but that&#x27;s just my personal perfume preference. My mother though really liked this scent. It just depends on want you enjoy. But all in all great price for a perfume.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff, sh e had it in an oil too. So as long as she was happy, I guess I am too!!</li>
    <li> The svrnt is just nothing out of the ordinary.  A simple scent to spray on when running errands</li>
    <li> This is great smelling &amp; I wear it all the time!! The bottle is adorable as well! I will be buying more of it!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. I find myself always reaching for to wear it when i am going out. Will purchase it agai8n</li>
    <li> As always this is my fragance of choice and I couldnt beat the ptrice! I was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling perfume. Nicely designed bottle.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rhe same bottle that I got from Ross. But completely deferential smell.i have the filling it&#x27;s the imitation. Or I don&#x27;t know what to say.</li>
    <li> It was great, awesome exactly what it was suppose to be.  Came fast and on time could not ask for more</li>
