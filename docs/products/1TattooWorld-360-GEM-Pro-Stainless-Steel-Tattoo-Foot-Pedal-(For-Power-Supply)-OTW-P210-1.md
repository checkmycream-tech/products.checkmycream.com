<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this pedal is exactly as described, ergonomically shaped and standardized for best balance and posture alignment.  works great with my power supply and machines.</li>
    <li> stainless steel had black spots on one side an a small scrape on the top rim otherwise a step up from my other pedal</li>
    <li> basic all around good foot pedal</li>
    <li> Needed a new 360, paid half of the going rate. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. It looks fairly light in the photo,but be assured this is a heavy piece.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner and does what its supposed to. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well, wish it had a longer cord, but I does the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This was a great product for the price as it sold for 3 times elsewere, I actually purchased 3 to have spares as backup. It also came prewired so all that was left was to &amp;#34;plug and play&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This foot pedal is great! Perfect size and built to last. I love mine and would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> works really good and ive been using it daily and its exactly what i wanted...id buy it again with its price too.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Sturdy and very well made.  actually heavy and has great response and quick on off.  I really enjoy it.  Been using it for a while now, and have no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the foot pedal thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Gordon</li>
    <li> I love this petal. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sexy BUT I&#x27;l have to try it out... never use one like this before .. I&#x27;ll give a full review on this foot peddle when or after i use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Heavy duty foot pedal. Good price.fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Occasionally the petal may need to be pressed downmultiple times to get it to work properly, but not very often. Fairly high grade and works as intended. I&#x27;d recommend for any ametuer to moderately pro artist. No real complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfectly made. Good and heavy. I took it apart to look at the wires and everything was nicely made. Plugged it in and fired right up.</li>
    <li> just as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> continuous power flow with no glitch</li>
    <li> I had to sauder the power wire to the foot peddle switch bad connection...it works know</li>
    <li> This is the very best foot pedal that you can get, its heavy so you don&#x27;t have to worry with it sliding around, it works perfectly, and it is very responsive. I will order again, I need to get more for my shop!!</li>
    <li> This foot switch is awesome. I had the $50 GEM foot switch and it broke within a few months. This one has been ol reliable for me. Definitely worth picking up.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but the cord is very short. ended up pulling/dropping my power supply a few too many times... Should have just gotten something a little less um... cheap lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy, doesn&#x27;t skid on the floor, but the soldering on the wires keeps popping off of the contacts. If you know how to solder you can easily fix it, but should you have to?</li>
    <li> Works good, although it is not as sensitive as I would have preferred. I think I might buy a more expensive one actually. For the money it cant be beat, especially if your using a cheap-o pedal.</li>
    <li> It doesnt always make the connection but most of the time its better then the one ive been using though so thats a major plus</li>
    <li> Fast shipping on this pedal. It is made really sturdy for the price. Your foot is able to push the button with the greatest of ease. I like the entire design of the heavy stainless steel base too. Nice pedal.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing because the pedal that came with my kit was a piece of crap. For the price- this thing is the real deal. It&#x27;s solid, heavy, looks good, works great.</li>
    <li> this product works great, no screws coming loose or anything of the sort, it looks more professional than those simple pedals and its long enough to work comfortably with it, mine came with a scratch on the metal part, other than that its great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is a serious tattoo artist. I basically knew what this pedal looked like but was unsure of the quality. Usually these pedals run $40+ but I got this one for much less. He is using it and can&#x27;t even tell a difference from his old pedal that he&#x27;s been using for years. This was a great deal.</li>
    <li> really short cable makes it tough to use, otherwise its fine.</li>
    <li> just received my pedal had to try it out had a great feel my only complaint is the cord is a little too shortbut a great little pebble none the less</li>
    <li> Its a bit bulkier than i thought, as far as how much its raised from the ground. so if you have tiny feet like me you may have to tilt your foot more causing a bit of discomfort after a while. and sometimes it feels like power kinda cuts off but thats probably just probably the discomfort in using it that causes my own foot to slip ....in general....i dont love it...but i dont hate it either.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these because I liked the design and style of this foot pedal. However, neither of them worked. Instead of returning them, I opted to disassemble, and inspect to determine why they wouldn&#x27;t work. My conclusion was that they were built with too small a wire to be able to carry the voltage. They had used a 22-24 gauge wire, where most reputable foot pedals come with 18 or 16 ga. I went to the hardware store, purchased some 16/2 wire, pulled out my soldering gun, and re-wired them, and voila! They worked great. I do like the construction of the foot pedals, they are nice, and heavy, and they have a nice non-skid pad on the bottom to keep them in place during use.</li>
    <li> Received this and it did not work. Very displeased.</li>
    <li> I like this pedal because it is strong and very durable , the best thing is the weight it is very heavy and stay&#x27;s where you put it wont slid around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good foot pedal, well built it would suck if your you prefer a flat pedal .it&#x27;s worthy of the money</li>
    <li> Works great.  I used it as a Push-to-talk switch to key my Elecraft K3 Amateur (ham) radio.  During the last contest (November Phone Sweepstakes) it didn&#x27;t miss a beat.  Compared to the offerings from Heil, MFJ, Jetstream, etc, this one is superior for a couple reasons.  First, one can activate this switch from any angle in the 360 degree circle - no longer is it necessary to reposition the foot switch to ensure it is pressed &amp;#34;from the correct angle&amp;#34;.  Second, this switch does not require much downward pressure to activate - using the switch for 24 hours of the contest weekend was enjoyable and non-fatiguing.  There is a nice tactical &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when the switch activates.  The weighted base with rubber bottom stays put on the floor. The soldering inside the 1/4&amp;#34; mono jack was excellent.  The cord appears to be durable but, as others have mentioned, there is a slightly funny smell coming from the cord (which has dissiptated over time).</li>
    <li> looks nice and works as expected</li>
    <li> Well made, good cord and heavy, so it won&#x27;t be sliding around. Excellent pedal for the money.</li>
    <li> awesome foot pedal can&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
    <li> Love not having to keep straightening out the pedal so I can step on it! This works from where ever you are.</li>
    <li> This pedal is exactly as described. Heavy stainless with a very nice solid round 6&#x27; long cord. This pedal doesn&#x27;t have the cheap 2 wire cord that most pedals have. My machines lost no power switching to this pedal. I would definitely recommend this pedal to anyone looking for a nice pedal. The cord could be a bit longer but if your set up close to your power supply this is perfect. Oh and shipping was really fast. This actually shipped out on a sunday. I think I got it a couple days early too. Enjoy everyone I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly- as usual for Tattoo World. Great product. Comfortable and sensitive -- hardware is solid. Not worried about it coming undone mid-line.</li>
    <li> It dose not push the power the way it should don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This foot switch is awesome. It is heavy and doesn&#x27;t slide around like some do. This foot pedal is well made.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy, doesn&#x27;t slip and slide under your foot. Very sturdy. The cord is thick and strong too. My only complaint would be a couple super small scratches on the chrome, but my shoes are going to do worse to the chrome. Overall, 5/5.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this foot pedal! Buy one every couple years and for the price I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. The output is strong and consistent, have tried many and I like prefer this one overall</li>
    <li> the petals held pretty good so far,it my primary petal. i got almost two months on it,even its a two wire ,instead of the one round cord like advertised, but its not effected my voltage,for the money i recommend it. i have more problems with the soldier jobs on all the s***,than any thing elese in all the tattoo stuff chineze ,japan usa it don&#x27;nt matter,them machine do a s***ty soldier job, so if you are going to be a tattooist,you better own a soldier gun. BOTTOM LINE crazy rick  ps. or have alot of money to spend., well it&#x27;s march 24 and the petal sill performing and holding the voltage,but I had a bad thing to happen ,the cord got caught in the tattoo cart wheel and broke about eight inches from the petal and, I happen to have around 6 extra cords,so I got lucky and splided it and tape the wire together instead of having to solder it,and i&#x27;m up and running again, still holding its steady, here it is 2014 and my petals still holds it on its lasted a year that&#x27;s a miracle because I kinda like the petal. lol crazy rick  ps this petal has out lasted all the petals I&#x27;ve ever bought and that&#x27;s saying a lot. thanks piercing pro&#x27;s and monster point.</li>
    <li> better than any of the other cheap pedals on amazon. I bought this after getting two power supplies both with crappy pedals. I was very happy with spending a few extra bucks on this, I recommend for everyone. it stays in place, heavy, doesn&#x27;t stutter or slow down like some of these other pedals. pair this with a decent power supply and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made on amazon. This doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap pedal. It actually feels very good using it, and touching it. It is very heavy, and has gone through hours of operation. Good pedal.</li>
    <li> 360 GEM Pro Stainless Steel Tattoo Foot Pedal (For Power Supply)  works great and is very touchy. Easy to clean, and heavy weight? doesn&#x27;t slide around the floor</li>
    <li> this is a very good deal on this foot pedal and thus far been the cheapest deal i have found on this type of foot pedal yet thanks to amazon i have now a very good pedal and will not hesitate to buy another one if this one goes bad in the future very good buy thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Loved it nice foot pedal . its a perfect size and easy to use thank you guys</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best kinda foot pedals and monstersteel somehow manages to make orders right and on time.never had a problem and if i did it was fixed asap....deff gonna return and buy more</li>
    <li> not that Great .. works but gets stuck ! Troy Gregory Tattoos , Roscoe Illinois !</li>
    <li> This is a  Stainless Steel Tattoo Foot Pedal...  Nice &amp; Heavy so it will not slide around unless you want to move it.  It is quality made. I have used it a while &amp; it works great.  About 90% Cheaper than a U.S. Made one.  Bill</li>
    <li> Worked great for 3 months and then died. And the cable was really short - hard to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Arrived on time, as expected. I was very pleased, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great buy heavy duty and as described..... Arrived quickly via ups....</li>
    <li> The unit is decent quality. It is heavier than most of my other foot pedals that along with the nice soft padding on the bottom of the unit should assist in keeping it still while I work. I noticed no drop in voltage compared to my other pedals, All of my machines required no tuning after changing the pedal. I am more than satisfied with this purchase and would recommend for anybody looking to add a 360 degree foot switch to their arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update:  I was able to use the pedal for an extended session (6+ hours) and wanted to add that I found the pedal a pleasure to use. Not once did I have to readjust the pedals location or direction (a constant problem with other pedal designs) The design, weight/shape/materials is well worth the expense and really cast a shadow on the  cheapo foot pedals in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased this same product before at the Minneapolis Tattoo Convention for $20, was glad to see it here listed for cheaper even after the shipping cost.This product is not top quality but is a great substitute or it can be used in the daily work horse fashion but it may go quickly.When operating this, best to maintain cleaning it and keeping it free of any kind of sand or debris or it will have a hard time pressing down. Apply pressure downward only, do not twist your foot on the pad or this will break the soldered connection in the pedal.</li>
    <li> The end plug keeps coming off everytime i try to unplug it from the machine. It splits halfway through and revels the spring loacated inside the cord. I really cant complain about the foot pedal because it was only $8.00 and free shipping. All in all I will not be using the product or services provided by the manufacturing company of this tattoo machine foot pedal. Good day.</li>
    <li> Wow heavy duty cord, thing weighs about 1-2 lbs nice heavy chrome.</li>
    <li> Great product...heavy compared to other pedals I have...which is good cause when you´re tattooing sometimes I need to chase pedal everywhere...!!!</li>
    <li> Every so often I update all my tattoo equipment.  I knew I was due for a new pedal but wasnt exactly sure what I wanted but I knew what I didnt. After reading the reviews I gave this one a try and I am definitely glad I did. Its not lightweight like plastic ones so you dont need to go chasing your pedal around while trying to work. It has the ability if you double tap it to run on its on kind of like cruise control in a car. It increasingly made my lines smoother and didn&#x27;t know that was possible with the work I had produced with the old pedal. I am more than happy with it and am probably going to buy another</li>
    <li> Best pedal I&#x27;ve  used so far.  Very well built and no problems with connections. Been using it daily and so far so good.</li>
    <li> So much better then the other crappy plastic pedals you can get on here. Spend the extra money and get something that isn&#x27;t going to break after the first tattoo. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great product better than expected would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Love it. Has been good to me. I&#x27;ve seen heavier, but this is still stable. Its made well.</li>
    <li> i got this in the mail and pulled it out and was shocked at how heavy it is. very heavy maybe 5 pounds or so but i soon realized it doesnt have the rubber grip on the bottom and the weight holds it in place. i hooked it up and started to tighten up an old rose and skull tattoo of mine and i love this foot pedal. it stays in place very very well and u dont have to keep stomping the hell out of it to get the power flowing like most foot pedals it will work with just a lil tap. the cord is solid and u can use it from any angle. its great and i wouldnt trade it for nothing</li>
    <li> really like this pedal. Can press on my part of the pedal for power.</li>
    <li> continues to work everytime i use it. really sturdy and nice shop quality</li>
    <li> Good heavy gem switch</li>
    <li> So Much Better Than Those Flat pedals, Would Def recommend</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago it it worked but powered my machines at such a low voltage they couldn&#x27;t lay ink into the skin. I requested a return but by the time I would return it and go through the hassle of shipping it back I would be losing money. So I opted to keep it and am going to repair it myself the problem is that the wire that runs from pedal to the power supply are simple cheap thin gauge speaker wire so there is not enough current flowing through to make a complete strong circuit. Yet another Monster Point product that has failed me right out of the box I have no clue how this company stays in business everything I have ordered has needed repair in less then 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line Im a tattoo artist not a electrician and I warn anyone without a machine building building background in tattoo machines to stay away from Monster Point Products or you will have piles of useless metal and plastic laying around your shop.</li>
