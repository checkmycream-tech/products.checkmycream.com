      <li>One of my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>The packaging for this mascara is absolutely adorable.</li>
      <li>I think I like this one even better.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara; it is my holy grail.</li>
      <li>Packaging neglected to mention the mascara smells like vanilla, and you can&#x27;t escape the odor, especially on a hot day.</li>
      <li>so I feel like I need to layer a bit more</li>
      <li>but it smells like it has a hint of vanilla or something. :)</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d better try a hypoallergenic product.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s favorite mascara...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love how my eye lashes look.</li>
      <li>Nice and clean mascara.</li>
      <li>Other bonuses, the smell is good, the tube is fancier than the picture looks (embosses and with a cute charm attached), and it actually contains something that is supposed to attract males, like a fragrance/pheromone, which will be awesome if a guy smells my eyelashes, lol</li>
      <li>Some comments have mentioned it being overwhelming, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be too strong.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I wear it almost everyday and makes my eyelashes look flawless.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s perfectly fine, I adore the light vanilla scent, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, and I&#x27;m flat-out over brands that refuse to go cruelty-free.</li>
      <li>It also has a lovely, soft vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>Gives me feathery, full lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge too much</li>
      <li>A real winner for me!</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>hence the 5 stars) is that when I wash it off, I have to first wash my face and then wipe away all the</li>
      <li>But I feel like I have to apply several coats to make my eyelashes more noticeable.</li>
      <li>It separates and fans out my lashes beautifully, and the volume is buildable, so you can opt for a more natural look or apply a few coats for more dramatic, pronounced lashes.</li>
      <li>(just not a full waterworks kind of show).  </li>
      <li>I have spent much more on mascara that I liked less.  </li>
      <li>It could be a little blacker or a little better, but it is a really good product and definately exceeded my expectations for Physician&#x27;s Formula.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake off too much.</li>
      <li>The scent is a gentle vanilla, and by the time I&#x27;m done applying the scent has dissipated.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
      <li>Very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>This will be my new mascara, at least until I find a good one whose parent company is also CF.</li>
      <li>This is one of the food highly rated mascaras from a company that does not do animal testing.  </li>
      <li>However, the pros far outweigh the cons on this</li>
      <li>Color is true black.</li>
      <li>I got this because it reminded my of the new Cat Eye mascara recently released.</li>
      <li>It just seems to dry to me and doesn&#x27;t really separate the lashes.</li>
      <li>Can be a little clumpy, but worth the results.  </li>
      <li>The wand is a little bulky and it takes several swipes to make your lashes adequate, but it works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara flaked by the afternoon, and I had racoon eyes. I can not say it is a product I would recommend. I did like the fat brush.</li>
    <li> It could be a little blacker or a little better, but it is a really good product and definately exceeded my expectations for Physician&#x27;s Formula. My eyes were always red at the end of the day so I thought I&#x27;d better try a hypoallergenic product. The wand is a little bulky and it takes several swipes to make your lashes adequate, but it works. Other bonuses, the smell is good, the tube is fancier than the picture looks (embosses and with a cute charm attached), and it actually contains something that is supposed to attract males, like a fragrance/pheromone, which will be awesome if a guy smells my eyelashes, lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the all-time best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but it&#x27;s perfectly fine, I adore the light vanilla scent, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, and I&#x27;m flat-out over brands that refuse to go cruelty-free. This will be my new mascara, at least until I find a good one whose parent company is also CF.</li>
    <li> For a product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals this works really well. It&#x27;s a bit on the dryer side so I feel like I need to layer a bit more but it stays on well and doesn&#x27;t smudge. For the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Mascara does the job. Doesn&#x27;t flake off too much. But I feel like I have to apply several coats to make my eyelashes more noticeable. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara.  I have skimpy, almost non existent lashes.  This works great.  Can be a little clumpy, but worth the results.  Better than a 21.00 name brand tube of mascara I had been using.  Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the food highly rated mascaras from a company that does not do animal testing.  It works pretty well.  Lashes are not super long but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick so have to watch for clumping but it lasts, adds volume and does not irritate my eyes, thus the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  It&#x27;s free of gluten and parabens!  Usually these types of mascaras run badly as they are not waterproof.  This mascara does not do that!  I can even shed a couple tears without it running....(just not a full waterworks kind of show).  It&#x27;s my favorite mascara.  Every time I try and branch out with a different brand...I always come back to this one!  A real winner for me!</li>
    <li> I will never use another mascara. It goes on well and stays on. It never irritates my eyes, which is a problem I usually have. And it smells like chocolate!</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite mascara...and of course the only place she could still find it was on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it works great with physician formula extension fiber kit.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy.  Does not lengthen lashes.</li>
    <li> It just seems to dry to me and doesn&#x27;t really separate the lashes. At least it didn&#x27;t smudge. I will probably try one of this company&#x27;s different mascaras next time.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mascara</li>
    <li> Nice and clean mascara.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this mascara, and was grateful to locate it on Amazon.  I have spent much more on mascara that I liked less.  It coats well, gives great volume and does not irritate my contacts.  Five star mascara.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara!  It looks good and smells great! Strange, I know... but it smells like it has a hint of vanilla or something. :)</li>
    <li> Love this mascara; it is my holy grail. Gives me feathery, full lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge too much and I have oily skin. The scent is a gentle vanilla, and by the time I&#x27;m done applying the scent has dissipated.</li>
    <li> Packaging neglected to mention the mascara smells like vanilla, and you can&#x27;t escape the odor, especially on a hot day. Product is going back to the store. Why did Physicians Formula feel they needed to add unnecessary ingredients?</li>
    <li> The packaging for this mascara is absolutely adorable. I got this because it reminded my of the new Cat Eye mascara recently released. I think I like this one even better. The formula is a little dryer so it separates the lashes quite well and prevents clumping.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly. Color is true black. Love how my eye lashes look.</li>
    <li> Came dried out. Disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is by far, my favorite mascara ever!!!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail after I won it online,  and I love it!!!  This will forever be my mascara!  Will be purchasing more soon!  I wear it almost everyday and makes my eyelashes look flawless.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara. It separates and fans out my lashes beautifully, and the volume is buildable, so you can opt for a more natural look or apply a few coats for more dramatic, pronounced lashes. It also has a lovely, soft vanilla scent. Some comments have mentioned it being overwhelming, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be too strong. The only issue (and it&#x27;s a very minor one- hence the 5 stars) is that when I wash it off, I have to first wash my face and then wipe away all the mascara-- it doesn&#x27;t come all the way off otherwise, and I end up looking like a panda. I&#x27;ve also noticed that if I use a liquid concealer under my eyes, I need to set it with a little powder or the mascara will transfer a tiny bit. However, the pros far outweigh the cons on this and I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
