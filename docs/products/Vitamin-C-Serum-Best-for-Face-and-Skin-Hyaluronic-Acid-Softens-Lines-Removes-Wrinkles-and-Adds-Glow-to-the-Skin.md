      <li>The product arrives well packaged and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not very vain, but why not look as good as I can if it is so easy to do right?</li>
      <li>It absorbed quickly and made my face noticeably smoother.</li>
      <li>The serum is a clear gel and goes on smoothly and it absorbs very quick.</li>
      <li>, just it&#x27;s natural aroma which is very lightly earthy and yeasty.  </li>
      <li>It seems natural and healthy.  </li>
      <li>First I soak my feet for about 20 minutes, dry good, brush my teeth</li>
      <li>It dries fast and clean</li>
      <li>I found that i dont need a full pump of the serum to cover my whole face and neck.</li>

      <li>It does exactly what it says that it will.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth and clear.</li>

      <li>It goes on light and smooth and spreads beautifully so a little dab will do ya.  </li>
      <li>On recent attendance to a beauty convention, I learned of pyramid schemes where anyone can buy mass produced products cheaply from China, have them &amp;#34;reconstituted&amp;#34; here, and slap a label on it and sell.  </li>
      <li>Left my face soft and smooth, love that it came with a money back guarantee!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really amazed by this product since I&#x27;ve used others that claimed to do this with no results.</li>
      <li>And, as I mentioned, I really like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few days now and so far so good.</li>
      <li>It is a good emollient , but not exceptional</li>
      <li>I have used this product and it has definitely made a difference on my face as far as fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>particularly like this brand.  </li>
      <li>like this product very much I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Since Bianca auctioned aritsts against each other for their logo design from 99designs http://99designs.com/product-label-design/contests/guaranteed-winner-looking-elegant-simple-design-262579/brief, i doubt Bianca Ferosi had the financial resources to invest in any kind of legitimate trial.  </li>
      <li>I asked Bianca Ferosi, if the models they show in their photo ads, were actually the true results of people who used their product (the people they show in their ad, have near miraculous results).  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to get a coupon for this product through nokiddingcoupons.com, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much for the low price.</li>
      <li>We loose hyaluronic acid which keep our skin nice and firm as we age</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a product work faster, within two days I noticed the texture of my skin was smoother, and the fine lines around my mouth were much less noticeable!</li>
      <li>I gave it a 4 only because the pump tends to put too much out at once</li>
      <li>And lastly, you can only apply so much to your face but what you really eat/drink is a major factor on how your skin looks.</li>
      <li>Seriously this product could cost twice as much and it would be worth every penny!</li>
      <li>The consistency is slightly sticky at first</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin and this product caused me absolutely NO irritation or discomfort.</li>
      <li>Not sure I would pay full price for it for only .5 oz, I&#x27;ll wait and see how long it lasts her.  </li>

<li> I hadn&#x27;t expected much improvement there as they are a bit saggy due to my age and didn&#x27;t think anything short of plastic surgery would help.</li>

<li> Only used for a few days already and my skin feels smoother and soft!</li>
<li> for the serum, the pump is clumsy and delivers a large volume of product.  </li>

<li> My wife loves this, just got it the other day, and she likes the way it feels after applying.  </li>
<li> Other Vitiman C serums are half the cost of what Bianca charges.</li>
<li> I have almost no fine lines or wrinkles except for a few laugh lines in the crinkles of my eyes and those two annoying little lines between my eyebrows, which actually arent very deep.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There is a sort of tight sensation that makes me feel like it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I use a little bit of moisturizer after applying the serum.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve avoided eye shadow for the past few years due to it making them stand out</li>
<li> I have been using this serum for a little over 2 months now &amp; have seen a dramatic difference in my facial skin.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the case here, but it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve been pondering.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this product for anyone in their late twenty&#x27;s and up.</li>
<li> The serum leaves a sticky, uncomfortable plastic-like film on the face.  </li>
<li> I am under the impression that they took random stock photos of models, photoshopped, and pasted their product over these stock photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am 54 and no joke, people are always shocked when they find out my age.  </li>

    <li> This product, while advertising a lot and costing 2x as much as other serums per ounce, does not deliver nor follow up on any claims it makes in my experience.  The seller advertises that it will remove wrinkles and add glow to skin--I did not find this to be the case.  The seller looks like they photoshops their product over other people&#x27;s faces, which I found to be misleading.  I asked Bianca Ferosi, if the models they show in their photo ads, were actually the true results of people who used their product (the people they show in their ad, have near miraculous results).  I received no response from Bianca.  Since Bianca auctioned aritsts against each other for their logo design from 99designs http://99designs.com/product-label-design/contests/guaranteed-winner-looking-elegant-simple-design-262579/brief, i doubt Bianca Ferosi had the financial resources to invest in any kind of legitimate trial.  I am under the impression that they took random stock photos of models, photoshopped, and pasted their product over these stock photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum, the pump is clumsy and delivers a large volume of product.  The serum leaves a sticky, uncomfortable plastic-like film on the face.  After a month of use, I have not noticed any difference in skin quality (certainly NOTHING like the people they advertise in their pictures).  On recent attendance to a beauty convention, I learned of pyramid schemes where anyone can buy mass produced products cheaply from China, have them &amp;#34;reconstituted&amp;#34; here, and slap a label on it and sell.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is the case here, but it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve been pondering.  Other Vitiman C serums are half the cost of what Bianca charges.</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days already and my skin feels smoother and soft! Strongly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great product! I absolutely love it. It does exactly what it says that it will. I would recommend to anyone of all ethnicities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the serum for few days … my skin look much better.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month around my eyes and it makes those pesky wrinkles just disappear.  I&#x27;m not very vain, but why not look as good as I can if it is so easy to do right?</li>
    <li> I have used this product and it has definitely made a difference on my face as far as fine lines and wrinkles. My face seems smoother and even brighter. I put it on just at night and when I wake up, my face is glowing. I would recommend this product for anyone in their late twenty&#x27;s and up. This product is all you need if you are looking to prevent or treat wrinkles. We loose hyaluronic acid which keep our skin nice and firm as we age and this product help put back and maintain what we lost.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is so amazing, I wish I had discovered it years ago! I&#x27;ve never seen a product work faster, within two days I noticed the texture of my skin was smoother, and the fine lines around my mouth were much less noticeable! I use it every day on my face and neck and day but even on days when I don&#x27;t my skin is still noticeably smoother. Seriously this product could cost twice as much and it would be worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that reduces the appearance of line and wrinkles on your face.  Since this product has a money back guarantee I gave it a try and have been happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> It feels so good on my face. The luminosity is almost immediate and the moisturizing effect is unbelievable.  I really enjoy the glisten and softness it leaves my skin .</li>
    <li> This is the best serum that I have used so far. You can see a noticeable difference on my skin. I used other product to get rid of wrinkles but this product is one of the must have in all the product that I have used.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful. Immediately makes your skin feel wonderful. There is no sticky feeling or greasiness. It absorbed quickly and made my face noticeably smoother.</li>
    <li> i am loving this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a little over 2 months now &amp; have seen a dramatic difference in my facial skin. The lines around my eye&#x27;s &amp; mouth have soften a lot. My skin is also smoother than what is was. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning &amp; before i go to bed at night.I&#x27;m really amazed by this product since I&#x27;ve used others that claimed to do this with no results. Rub&#x27;s into the easy with no greasy feeling afterwards. This is a amazing product that does what it say&#x27;s. i recommend buying &amp; trying this for yourself and see the results.</li>
    <li> Not all that it is cracked up to be. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I waited for two weeks before i reviewed this product. I notice my skin clearing and lightening up. Give this serum a try. I just wish it&#x27;s a big bigger but for the price it is a bargain. And lastly, you can only apply so much to your face but what you really eat/drink is a major factor on how your skin looks.</li>
    <li> Just placed a second order for this item. I am very happy with the results it has given especially on my eyelids. I hadn&#x27;t expected much improvement there as they are a bit saggy due to my age and didn&#x27;t think anything short of plastic surgery would help. I&#x27;ve avoided eye shadow for the past few years due to it making them stand out but I might just try the shadow once again. I am very pleased with the results overall and it has reduced fine lines and made my skin feel and look younger. I gave it a 4 only because the pump tends to put too much out at once and I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it by using more than I should.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I recommend this serum to anyone great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Much s smaller portion than I hoped for.  It is a good emollient , but not exceptional</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice over the last day, but my initial impressions are positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a clear smooth gel, and is not tacky or goopy at all.&lt;br /&gt;It spreads nicely and does not make my skin feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and I do not feel like I have a film on my face.&lt;br /&gt;There is a sort of tight sensation that makes me feel like it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this product caused me absolutely NO irritation or discomfort.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now and so far so good. It is only .5 oz so the bottle is small. I found that i dont need a full pump of the serum to cover my whole face and neck. The serum is a clear gel and goes on smoothly and it absorbs very quick. I use a little bit of moisturizer after applying the serum.  Leaves skin smooth and clear. Glad i found this!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a coupon for this product through nokiddingcoupons.com, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much for the low price. However, this serum instantly brightened up my dark circles and left my skin glowing. The only complaint I have for this serum is the the pump squirts out a bit too much, since only a tiny bit of serum is needed for the face. But when I started applying the excess serum to my neck, it helped to reduce the line around my neck from a scar. I was extremely impressed with this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product received at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I don&#x27;t like putting things on my face, but I love to pamper my feet. First I soak my feet for about 20 minutes, dry good, brush my teeth so my feet get even dryer, then add a small amount of the Vitamin C Serum on my hands and give myself a good foot rub. It is glorious, relaxing, and my feet have never been smoother.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It was extremely inexpensive, and it feels &amp; works great!  I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Works great, absorbed quickly with no sticky or greasy feeling.  Left my face soft and smooth, love that it came with a money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this, just got it the other day, and she likes the way it feels after applying.  Not sure I would pay full price for it for only .5 oz, I&#x27;ll wait and see how long it lasts her.  So far so good though!</li>
    <li> Wow …Bianca Ferosi did again,I have being  using for few days fallowing direction&lt;br /&gt;and it works beautifully  in my skin …</li>
    <li> Product works great! I started seeing results within a week of use and I&#x27;m a dude. Planning on purchasing more for family members.</li>
    <li> Great serum for face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my trial of Amazon Prime and ordered this over the weekend- it came in 2 days! The packaging is nice and sturdy, unlike most serums in a glass bottle. My skin had no allergic reactions to this product. The consistency is slightly sticky at first but it dries as soon as you rub it on. My skin tone seems to have evened out after using this serum for a while. Even on days where I&#x27;m sleep deprived, I can put on this serum and look a lot more awake.</li>
    <li> Years ago my sister worked in an uber exclusive spa in Aspen Colorado and she asked all of the estheticians who worked there if they were stranded on a desert island and they could take just one skin care product with them, what would it be.  Every one of them said Vitamin C serum.  I have been using it for years and I swear by it.  I am 54 and no joke, people are always shocked when they find out my age.  I have almost no fine lines or wrinkles except for a few laugh lines in the crinkles of my eyes and those two annoying little lines between my eyebrows, which actually arent very deep.  I dont have any lines around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like this brand.  It goes on light and smooth and spreads beautifully so a little dab will do ya.  It dries fast and clean and I like the smell.  It seems to have no perfume, just it&#x27;s natural aroma which is very lightly earthy and yeasty.  It seems natural and healthy.  And, as I mentioned, I really like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about the packaging which dispenses easily and doesnt goop up or clog.  The product arrives well packaged and quickly.  All in all I give it five stars and two thumbs up.</li>
