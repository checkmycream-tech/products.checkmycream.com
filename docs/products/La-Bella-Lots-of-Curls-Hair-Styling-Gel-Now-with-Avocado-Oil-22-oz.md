### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And best of all, for all of this fabulousness, I can buy about eight 22 oz.</li>
      <li>Yeah, this is the best hair gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Very good gel, my hair is already curly</li>
      <li>This is a good gel!</li>
      <li>A great bargain.</li>
      <li>It truly does greatly minimize frizz, and has a great hold.</li>
      <li>Works great on holding my curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a good gel</li>
      <li>Perfect for scrunching my wavy straight hair into curls!!</li>
      <li>Boy, am I glad that this didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all!  </li>
      <li>Love this, ordered 2 bottles!</li>
      <li>Most of the suggested gels do not work for me, but this one does!</li>
      <li>Glad they&#x27;re still attainable!</li>
      <li>It defines my curls all while adding a nice shine.</li>
      <li>This product is my new best friend.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re safe going with any LaBella product.</li>
      <li>I can achieve up to day 5 hair with this lovely concoction (and this is in between workouts too).</li>
      <li>I was expecting something more like crunchy, frizzy &#x27;fro.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very light and pleasant and isn&#x27;t really detectable in my hair after it dries.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for my loose curly hair.</li>
      <li>It holds without being too crunchy, and if it does crunch, a gently dry-scrunch makes my curls perfect, highly recommended,</li>
      <li>Hmm, $16 vs $1.99; easy pick.  </li>
      <li>but still has that fantastic Labella hold with no flaky stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In closing, Lots of Curls gel is cheap ($1.84 for a 22 oz.</li>
      <li>Hope it doesn&#x27;t take another 20 years to find something as good &amp; inexpensive for my natural curls.</li>
      <li>Does not smell much at all, which I love, since I am allergic to stinging insects and do not want to attract them.</li>
      <li>Instant love affair from the moment I put it on!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll start his review by saying that I&#x27;ve paid way more money than I&#x27;ll ever care to admit trying products on my 4a, low-porosity, natural hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong but doesn&#x27;t leave a white flakey residue and has no alcohol</li>
      <li>I figured that for $1.99, I would get my product junkie fix at a cheap price, and I could once again tell myself that I was going to stop trying new products.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, so finding gel that will keep it in place without just pasting it to your head isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
      <li>I know, it&#x27;s not all natural and filled with oils and butters.  </li>
      <li>My previous container lasted more than 2 years!</li>
      <li>This size container lasts forever on dry, curly hair that is not washed more than twice weekly.</li>
      <li>It keeps them well-defined, shiny, springy and most importantly, DOES NOT flake, which has been a problem for me in the past.</li>
      <li>Without gel, or the right gel fit that matter, my hair stays laxed and loose.</li>
      <li>I found Lots of Curls while getting ready to fork over $16 for 8oz of Kinky Curly Custard.  </li>
      <li>Now I only use it to smooth when wearing a pony tail or braid.</li>
      <li>No noticeable difference to my curls really</li>
      <li>even sent her some just to say thanks.</li>
      <li>The only kind that works for my mixed raced hair.</li>
      <li>This works very well for me, better than any other gel I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>this product creates, it actually also creates a cool wavy texture as well.</li>
      <li>This gel really defines the curls and makes them come alive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The green bucket (Max Hold) is still my favorite of them all</li>
      <li>While I was waging an internal war with myself over paying that much money for yet another gel, I spotted this cute pink gel on another shelf.  </li>
      <li>Lol, I&#x27;ve never laughed for so long in my life.</li>
      <li>I actually got lots of curls; soft, shiny curls.  </li>
      <li>Is it worth the hard hair and white flakes...</li>
</ol>

<li> I actually got lots of curls; soft, shiny curls.  </li>
<li> Is it worth the hard hair and white flakes...</li>
<li> I have very thick extra curly hair and this used to be able to tame 95% of it.  </li>
<li> After taking a shower I simply apply Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine leave in conditioner followed by La Bella gel, let it dry, and voila!</li>
<li> Only problem is that Walmart is no longer carrying it, and I can&#x27;t find it in any other local stores either.</li>
<li> both when I air dry</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair.  </li>
<li> and when I diffuse and doesn&#x27;t take forever to air dry.</li>
<li> Most products I&#x27;ve tried have either made my hair dry, flaky, or hard as a rock...which might look okay, but feels horrible!!!!</li>
<li> Only con is that the sorbitol in it is a humectant and can give me slight frizz in humid weather.</li>
<li> But all i could remember of it was that the gel itself was pink.</li>
<li> so i was curious as to what this product would do to it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> This hair gel does wonders for my hair and it doesn&#x27;t flake like the other gels</li>
<li> My curls are soft yet firm, not crunchy or hard.</li>
<li> I only need a small amount to get medium hold with no crunch, and it cost less than $3 at Rite Aid.</li>
<li> Besides the white flakes &amp; hard hair</li>
<li> I got here because I was searching for a gel that I used a sample of at a black hair showcase.</li>
<li> and it has a slight berry/fruity smell.</li>
<li> couldn&#x27;t  even save it waste of money!</li>
<li> very few of them can stand up to the south Texas humidity.  </li>
<li> If you have curly hair you know how hard it is to find a product that complements your curls.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find lately, so we stocked up.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores anymore.</li>
<li> If you reviewed t under 5 stars, then you&#x27;re using it wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found this gel about 3 years ago &amp; it&#x27;s been my daily product since. Only problem is that Walmart is no longer carrying it, and I can&#x27;t find it in any other local stores either. 22 oz bottle was only $1.84, how can you beat that?!? Now I&#x27;ll have to find a replacement. Hope it doesn&#x27;t take another 20 years to find something as good &amp; inexpensive for my natural curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It&#x27;s very strong but doesn&#x27;t leave a white flakey residue and has no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair.  I have wirey frizzy curly unmanageable hair, but when I use this I get compliments about my curls.</li>
    <li> This hair gel does wonders for my hair and it doesn&#x27;t flake like the other gels and it also holds the curls, I tried others and its not like this one. Dollie4us</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It truly does greatly minimize frizz, and has a great hold. Mmm, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it through Amazon; it&#x27;s only $2-$3 at CVS. If you reviewed t under 5 stars, then you&#x27;re using it wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a good gel! I only need a small amount to get medium hold with no crunch, and it cost less than $3 at Rite Aid. The smell is very light and pleasant and isn&#x27;t really detectable in my hair after it dries. It works well both when I air dry and when I diffuse and doesn&#x27;t take forever to air dry. Only con is that the sorbitol in it is a humectant and can give me slight frizz in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I got here because I was searching for a gel that I used a sample of at a black hair showcase. It was ahmazing! But all i could remember of it was that the gel itself was pink. So, ive been searching the internet to see if i could recognize it if i could just see the logo. In my search i came across this gel selling for 7.99 plus shipping and handling. Lol, I&#x27;ve never laughed for so long in my life. Guys this stuff cost a dollar at family dollar. Whoever is selling this ripping you guys off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start his review by saying that I&#x27;ve paid way more money than I&#x27;ll ever care to admit trying products on my 4a, low-porosity, natural hair.  I found Lots of Curls while getting ready to fork over $16 for 8oz of Kinky Curly Custard.  While I was waging an internal war with myself over paying that much money for yet another gel, I spotted this cute pink gel on another shelf.  It was $1.99.  Hmm, $16 vs $1.99; easy pick.  Granted, I&#x27;ve used Kinky Curly before, so I know it works, buy, hey, I&#x27;m on a budget.  I figured that for $1.99, I would get my product junkie fix at a cheap price, and I could once again tell myself that I was going to stop trying new products.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting lots of curls from Lots of Curls.  I was expecting something more like crunchy, frizzy &#x27;fro.  Boy, am I glad that this didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all!  Instant love affair from the moment I put it on!  I actually got lots of curls; soft, shiny curls.  I can run my fingers through my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a gel on it.  I don&#x27;t have any flaking!  And best of all, for all of this fabulousness, I can buy about eight 22 oz. bottles with the same money that I would have used for one 8 oz. jar of Kinky Curly.  I know, it&#x27;s not all natural and filled with oils and butters.  Well, I&#x27;ve got oils and butters literally falling out of my bathroom cabinets and very few of them can stand up to the south Texas humidity.  This product is my new best friend.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this is the best hair gel I have ever used. I have used several products but this is the only one that defines my curls and doesn&#x27;t flake. Check my youtube channel @PinkPaintz to see pics of my hair. All I do is wash my hair and apply this gel. Thats it!!!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair you know how hard it is to find a product that complements your curls. Most products I&#x27;ve tried have either made my hair dry, flaky, or hard as a rock...which might look okay, but feels horrible!!!! This gel has become part of my permanent routine. It defines my curls all while adding a nice shine. After taking a shower I simply apply Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine leave in conditioner followed by La Bella gel, let it dry, and voila! Shiny and well defined curls for the rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a link to the garnier product&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Fructis-Intensely-Leave-In-Conditioning/dp/B005GQ6HUK</li>
    <li> My sister got me started using no not sold in store so got enough to last a while--even sent her some just to say thanks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for scrunching my wavy straight hair into curls!! Love this, ordered 2 bottles!</li>
    <li> The only kind that works for my mixed raced hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, so finding gel that will keep it in place without just pasting it to your head isn&#x27;t easy.  This works very well for me, better than any other gel I&#x27;ve found. It lasts throughout the day and I haven&#x27;t had any flaking.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good gel, my hair is already curly so i was curious as to what this product would do to it. No noticeable difference to my curls really but still has that fantastic Labella hold with no flaky stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green bucket (Max Hold) is still my favorite of them all but if you&#x27;re looking for a good gel you&#x27;re safe going with any LaBella product.</li>
    <li> Works great on holding my curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t frizz. Does not smell much at all, which I love, since I am allergic to stinging insects and do not want to attract them. This size container lasts forever on dry, curly hair that is not washed more than twice weekly. My previous container lasted more than 2 years! A great bargain.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my loose curly hair. Without gel, or the right gel fit that matter, my hair stays laxed and loose. This gel really defines the curls and makes them come alive. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores anymore. Glad they&#x27;re still attainable!</li>
    <li> I am trying to go with the curly girl program. Most of the suggested gels do not work for me, but this one does! It holds without being too crunchy, and if it does crunch, a gently dry-scrunch makes my curls perfect, highly recommended,</li>
    <li> Besides the white flakes &amp; hard hair this product creates, it actually also creates a cool wavy texture as well. Is it worth the hard hair and white flakes...that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and now it does not work as it did.  I have very thick extra curly hair and this used to be able to tame 95% of it.  Now I only use it to smooth when wearing a pony tail or braid.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for my curls! It keeps them well-defined, shiny, springy and most importantly, DOES NOT flake, which has been a problem for me in the past. My curls are soft yet firm, not crunchy or hard. I co-wash and then use this. I can achieve up to day 5 hair with this lovely concoction (and this is in between workouts too). I could probably stretch it out to day 7, but with my exercise routine, that&#x27;d be pushing it. In closing, Lots of Curls gel is cheap ($1.84 for a 22 oz. bottle at Wal-Mart) and it has a slight berry/fruity smell. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> I have found what works for me! This is it! I will forever use this product. I co-wash and apply this gel to my hair, style and go. For me, one application lasts for days.</li>
    <li> My husband has curly hair, and swears by this stuff. It&#x27;s inexpensive, and a little goes a long way. Even his hair stylist wanted to know what he used. It&#x27;s getting hard to find lately, so we stocked up.</li>
    <li> They put my gel in a bag and it broke and got all over couldn&#x27;t  even save it waste of money!</li>
