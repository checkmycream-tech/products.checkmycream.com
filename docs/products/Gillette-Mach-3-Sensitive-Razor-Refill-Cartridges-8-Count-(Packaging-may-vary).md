      <li>This was my first purchase of these razor blades.</li>
      <li>I have been using the same first razor out of the box for 3 weeks now and it still works better than anything else out there that doesn&#x27;t run with the classic Mach 3 razor (the vibrating one).</li>
      <li>I have a new Fusion which I love to use if I had not shaved in a few days as it cuts easily without pulling .</li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone who gets razor burn easily, and has to shave their face on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>But it worked fine on my American bought razor as a refill.</li>
      <li>you probably did pay to much for it........</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Shipment was fast as aleasy.</li>
      <li>and I really like them</li>
      <li>I recently moved and found my old Gillette mach 3 without blades , this has always been my favorite razor .</li>
      <li>Much smoother shave, and the razor cleans out more completely than other brands.</li>
      <li>Razors are decent but just not for me ...</li>
      <li>super sharp right out of the box.</li>
      <li>Great shave and not as expensive as the ones in the store.</li>
      <li>...and my sensitive face thanks you Gillette.</li>
      <li>Works well enough and is priced right</li>
      <li>The same razors that I was paying around $10 more, only in packaging with Spanish writing.</li>
      <li>Funny colors, but they are the same blades.</li>
      <li>Genuine Gillette blades at half the price.</li>
      <li>finally a sensitive Gillette razor that works</li>
      <li>My face is sensitive when it comes to shaving and so these blades are like mana from heaven.</li>
      <li>excelent product, I never used sensitive before I bought these</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every sensitive product out there</li>
      <li>just as expected, thanks!</li>
      <li>Packaging certainly did vary:  all words were in Spanish, and one pack had only 3, not 4 cartridges.  </li>
      <li>Photo suggested these were the Mach3 Sensitive Power blades, but the regular blades are what arrived.</li>
      <li>Thanks, everything like was expected</li>
      <li>Which i though was half funny.</li>
      <li>and so far they seem to be performing and lasting just as long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are good. I use a Mach 3 and a Fusion razor. I like the Mach 3 when I have a longer beard, then follow up with the Fusion. Still waiting for the perfect blade though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 16 years and have always had an issue with razor burn. I&#x27;ve tried every sensitive product out there and it still didn&#x27;t matter. I stumbled upon these razors because they were one of the cheaper refills and figured why not. WELL....let me tell you, I no longer have razor burn!! I cannot believe it&#x27;s possible. No more red neck, no more burning....life is good!</li>
    <li> Will be reordering when I need more?</li>
    <li> Not &amp;#34;American Made&amp;#34; (I think they come from Brazil), but irregardless, I cannot tell any difference between these and the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve bought here in the USA from various drugstores or groceries stores.  Great razors!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying it at the stores and so far they seem to be performing and lasting just as long. Foreign packaging.</li>
    <li> Foreign packaging but blades were perfectly sealed, authentic and a great value.  Fresh, clean and happy camper :)</li>
    <li> This is the second time my husband ordered these and they work great.  Will order again</li>
    <li> Packaging was in Spanish and/or Portuguese.  Definitely not a USA retail product.  Not a good blade. Couldn&#x27;t even use them all. Definitely not a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the Spanish writing on the package fool you, these are the same replacement razors Gillette sells in the USA stores.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever! I am 74 years old and have tried many, many shavers, blade and electric. Blades are perfect for the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> Great buy...cost so much less than purchasing from store!</li>
    <li> Love it and very cheap</li>
    <li> Works fine. Not sure if they are any less-irritating but no complaints as compared to other blades.</li>
    <li> The same razors that I was paying around $10 more, only in packaging with Spanish writing. The packaging is even the same, just the writing is not English. I don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s a better deal on the same thing I have been paying a lot more for.</li>
    <li> Genuine Gillette blades at half the price.</li>
    <li> These are well worth the cost&lt;br /&gt;I get a snoot shave every time&lt;br /&gt;And u can use the blade 5 times</li>
    <li> Packaging is a tiche off, but all things considered; I&#x27;ll probably purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;Price is ok, more convenient than heading into the real world.</li>
    <li> finally a sensitive Gillette razor that works</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Great price. Arrived on time. Cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My face is sensitive when it comes to shaving and so these blades are like mana from heaven. They give a smooth and clean shave with no skin irritation. Win!</li>
    <li> good price good product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> These razors work well, and my skin feels better than it has with the regular Mach 3 refills. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> ...and my sensitive face thanks you Gillette.</li>
    <li> The razor cartridges were awesome and came sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great price on Gillette Mach 3</li>
    <li> I really feel that these are the real deal and get a smooth shave  for sure!</li>
    <li> A great deal, I may never buy these in the store again! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great price!!! Husband has not complained so I am guessing they work great!</li>
    <li> Great price and super fast delivery!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> 1 out of the blades was defective. Seems like poorer quality control than usual. Will not buy again, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure what do say about razors but they came in intact and work as well as expected.</li>
    <li> excelent product, I never used sensitive before I bought these and I really like them</li>
    <li> Very reasonable deal!</li>
    <li> super sharp right out of the box. arrived on time and with no issues, will renew when I run out of blades again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them wil buy more soon</li>
    <li> Came in two packages. Exactly as described​, not sure what else to say!</li>
    <li> The BEST razor cartridges I have ever bought. I have tried every competitor brand, and I have always gotten razor burn. These are the only razors I use now. I would recommend these to anyone who gets razor burn easily, and has to shave their face on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> if the babes aren&#x27;t all over you after using this product.....you probably did pay to much for it........</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of these razor blades. I like the closeness of the shave and the fact that I don&#x27;t feel that I am going to draw blood. Very happy and will continue to purchase these vs the other Mach 3 blades I have been purchasing for years.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find on Gillette cartridges on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always come back to Gillette. Much smoother shave, and the razor cleans out more completely than other brands.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased these! I hate having to buy these in the store it is such a pain and they are so expensive! They came exactly like they do in store. I will definitely be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> The words were in Spanish but these are the same great blades I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I have been using the same first razor out of the box for 3 weeks now and it still works better than anything else out there that doesn&#x27;t run with the classic Mach 3 razor (the vibrating one).</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast as aleasy. Razors are decent but just not for me ... They actually cut more than they shave correctly.</li>
    <li> I started to develop terrible redness after shaving that no cream could fix.  I switched to these razors from the regular Mach 3 Turbo&#x27;s and the rash went away.</li>
    <li> I was missled.  It is not flexible.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> No different than the regular mach3</li>
    <li> When I received razors they looked refurbished I threw them right away, a gentleman before me could have had hep C wasn&#x27;t taking the risk</li>
    <li> Great shave and not as expensive as the ones in the store. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Work well. Slightly better price.</li>
    <li> Very Good product and the price is also ok.I will buy it again 100%</li>
    <li> The photo showed that these were the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; version, which we use and are hard to find. I received them and they are the regular ones. Disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> Mach 3 blades. Funny colors, but they are the same blades.</li>
    <li> Packaging certainly did vary:  all words were in Spanish, and one pack had only 3, not 4 cartridges.  The seven we got in two packs were good--just short one.</li>
    <li> Just like you buy in the stores, but less $$.  Target had Mach3 for sale and was still $6 more than these.  They must come from another country since it&#x27;s mostly in Spanish.  But it worked fine on my American bought razor as a refill.</li>
    <li> Good razors, accurate advertising, work quite well on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Razors worked real good. It seems that price went down since I ordered them last week.</li>
    <li> It is a brazilian gillet mach 3 refill, so far is good but not as good as the american.</li>
    <li> I have a new Fusion which I love to use if I had not shaved in a few days as it cuts easily without pulling . I recently moved and found my old Gillette mach 3 without blades , this has always been my favorite razor . The Gillette 3 is so great at shaving into places around the nose and mouth without missing parts like the newer Fusion does . I am glad I bought these blades they perform well and do the job they are suppose to .Quick shipping by seller .Shave On !!</li>
    <li> very good product, it could recommend</li>
    <li> Cheapest price I could find anywhere for Mach 3 blades.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I find the regular mach3 blades to be much better. These cut me up every time.</li>
    <li> Packaging was from another country. Which i though was half funny. Product is as expected. Packaging is indifferent to me. Not like we read any of it anyways...</li>
    <li> Husband was happy with these blades.</li>
    <li> Last only for 3 shaves whereas any other Gillette Mach 3 lasts for at least 10</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as advertised.  Works well.  I am highly pleased and recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Shop around here on Amazon,you can find these at better prices,good blades,close shave but pricey</li>
    <li> Best blades ever for my tough whiskers and beard</li>
    <li> Razor blades fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Costly found out after ordering not made in USA</li>
    <li> Great value and a close clean shave. No issues will order again as needed such a great value.</li>
    <li> On time and as expected</li>
    <li> Thanks, everything like was expected</li>
    <li> It was the best buy on blades anywhere.  My husband was very pleased.</li>
    <li> No different from the basic Mach 3, except for the green color.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, works great</li>
    <li> just as expected, thanks!</li>
    <li> Delivered what was promised. Product made in USA, packaged in Spanish. No compromise in quality.</li>
    <li> Photo suggested these were the Mach3 Sensitive Power blades, but the regular blades are what arrived.</li>
    <li> Works well enough and is priced right but I think I like the regular Mach3 razor better.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I was honestly so excited to fin theys razors on amazin for this price.  But when i received them the packageing came from mexico...  They dont cut as close as the trditional razors and nor do they last as long</li>
