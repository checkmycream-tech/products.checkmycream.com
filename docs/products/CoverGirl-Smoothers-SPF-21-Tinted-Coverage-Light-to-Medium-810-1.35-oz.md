      <li>Love, love, love the product!</li>
      <li>It feels very light and evens out my skin while adding a touch of color.  </li>

      <li>So, the price is very cheap for me.  </li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it...</li>

      <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 and will be buying many more to keep in reserve.</li>

      <li>I will for sure keep buying this for years to come &amp;lt;3</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for more coverage, this one is probably not for you.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>Ive waited to review it because I wanted to make sure It didnt make me break out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know WHY this happened - I do love the product, but I&#x27;m not going to be able to use it.  </li>

      <li>I am immensely pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish it provided more coverage, because then I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend 50 bucks for a CC cream.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love CoverGirl Smoothers.</li>
      <li>so if you want more coverage in one area you can do that.</li>
      <li>My skin has a healthy glow without looking like I&#x27;m wearing s mask.</li>
      <li>this is just a nice, light tinted moisturizer that helps protect your skin from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>

      <li>I purchased the light to medium tube, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>so, despite being pretty fair, I chose the light to medium color and it has the effect that I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>and we all know more is better to get the full SPF 15.</li>
      <li>-- sweet!</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to get this product to get a more even complexion and really did not want to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant with ordering the light to medium color since I love to tan a lot, but this moisturizer blends in with my skin flawlessly!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quick, easy and the light coverage I want.</li>
      <li>The reviews I found most compelling in favor of this product said that it didn&#x27;t gather in fine lines and didn&#x27;t look like makeup.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I also have light skin</li>

      <li>I started using it this summer because it had SPF protection while also being a lightly tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Well, Im so happy to say that it has actually improved my skin!</li>
      <li>stopped carrying this product and was very happy to find it on Amazon, it is not a heavy make up, and totally fits my needs with the sunscreen and moisturizer, and matches skin tones, a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>(I use it as a foundation and add a light powder).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer (light to medium) since I was 15 and I absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t like wearing tons of make-up, but this is quick and easy and completely smooths out my skin. This plus a little bronzer and mascara and I&#x27;m out the door in 5 minutes. Only problem was that I could only get it at Target, which was a bit out of my way. Now Amazon will send them automatically and I get a discount -- sweet!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and I am a huge fan.  My skin tends to be both oily and dry, so I shy away from thick foundations; the tinted moisturizer is very light and does not leave my skin oily. I also have light skin but I use the Light to Medium color to give my face a little bit of a bronzed look without streaks or lines.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good foundation for a while now, and decided to give tinted moisturizer a try. I am soooo glad I did! I absolutely love CoverGirl Smoothers. I was a little hesitant with ordering the light to medium color since I love to tan a lot, but this moisturizer blends in with my skin flawlessly! Highly recommended that you give this a try, because you definitely won&#x27;t be sorry. I will for sure keep buying this for years to come &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> CoverGirl smoothers is everything it says it is.  The moisturizer goes on smooth and hides tiny imperfections.  It has sunscreen and the color is great.</li>
    <li> I got this on special deal on 2 pack. So, the price is very cheap for me.  I tried it on and found that it has very sheer coverage.  It blends in nicely (like moisturizer) and has no streaks or leaves any residue.  But if you&#x27;re looking for more coverage, this one is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a month or so back because I was purchasing something else and wanted to get to the &#x27;free shipping&#x27; $$ amount. Ive been trying all diff types of tinted moisturizers because I like the idea of not wearing a lot of makeup but I havent found one that really lives up to the dream. This one was different. Ive waited to review it because I wanted to make sure It didnt make me break out. Well, Im so happy to say that it has actually improved my skin! Ive tried almost all the tinted moisturizers out there from aveeno to laura mercier and this one takes the cake. It has a very light coverage, perfect for summer, and absorbs well. It doesnt leave streaks because it truly is a moisturizer and not a foundation. I put this on after my shower and follow with a loose powder- My skin looks awesome ( well relatively, im 29 lol) and natural!</li>
    <li> I bought the 2 pack of the CG Smoothers SPF15 tinted moisturizer, and purchased this because it had noncomedogenic properties and really needed a product that was lightweight. The product is lightweight but after using it everyday for a couple of weeks I developed bumps that resembled pimples. I just thought it was stress, the humidity, and me sweating through my workouts that caused the pimples. It was not until my mom said it must be something I was using on my face. I dismissed it as I am in my 30s and thought I knew my skin. Well after a week I thought maybe I should stop using it to counter to my mom that it wasn&#x27;t my moisturizer. Added note I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I was thrilled to get this product to get a more even complexion and really did not want to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;Well about two to three days of not using it my \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; slowly diminished and I now have a clear complexion again. Overall I think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price/value but can honestly say that besides the fact of my previous breakouts with this product I also did not really mind the feel of it but I am comparing it to my previous use with a brand that is at least 5xs more expensive (Jan Marini). Anyway I wish I could use it as it is so much cheaper than what I used before...</li>
    <li> I was using another tinted moisturizing product I have liked a lot. Of course, I could no longer find it when I needed a lighter shade for paler winter skin. On a whim, I looked here on Amazon and decided to give this a try. It was a very good value and it is just what I needed. It provides just enough coverage to even out skin tone without being visible. I have very dry skin, so I use my everyday (untinted) moisturizer first, then a light layer of the CoverGirl tinted moisturizer. Quick and easy. So glad I found it...just hope it won&#x27;t be changed or discontinued soon because the product is lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I seared Covergirls AQUA SMOOTHERS and this is what came up. I saw the picture and assumed it was that one. When it comes in the mail it is not that one. I am disapointed because it does not work the same( ive tried it before) and amsending it back.</li>
    <li> I like the covergirl smoothers because if you&#x27;re in a hurry and do not want to bother with the whole makeup thing it works well.  The moisterizer has an SPF 15 so that helps if you will be outside.  It feels very light and goes on like lotion, but covers redness and flaws.    The only problem was trying to find it.  I found it once at Rite Aid and then could not seem to find it again.  I ordered it through Amazon.com and then stumbled on it in the local Kroger&#x27;s of all places.</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Smoothers was a real surprise to me. I bought it to wear on workdays (my job is very physical and I usually end up sweaty and disheveled) because I liked the idea of having lightweight coverage as well as sun protection. I am immensely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My days start early, so being able to wash my face and apply this as moisturizer plus coverage is a huge bonus. This product is lightweight, not at all oily or greasy. It absorbs immediately and the coverage is tinted enough that you don&#x27;t feel naked but sheer enough for you to put your best face forward. I love that I can toss this in my overnight bag with a tube of mascara and some Chapstick and feel totally prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High five, CoverGirl!</li>
    <li> great product, first time i have ever used a tinted moisturizer and it&#x27;s a perfect product for me since i&#x27;m not a fan of foundation at all but like a little bronzed look.  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d found the product in my local drugstore and loved it. After that, it became very difficult to find at any store.  I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on-line to order. It&#x27;s lightly tinted moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it doesn&#x27;t clump like some foundations (I use it as a foundation and add a light powder).  I hope they continue to make this product.  My shipment arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> I buy the CoverGirl Smoothers SPF 15 Tinted Moisturizer, Light to Medium for my teenaged daughter.  She doesn&#x27;t need heavy coverage, so this tinted moisturizer is ideal for her skin.  She uses topical acne medications, which can dry the skin.  This product moisturizes her skin, as well as adds light, even coverage.  It feels nearly weightless on, smooths on easily, and dispenses easily from the container.</li>
    <li> I am a chronic make-up and skin care product sampler.  After reading Paula Begoun&#x27;s positive review of this product, I decided to purchase CG Smoothers.  What an incredible product!  So far, I have sampled and used Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s tinted moisturizer, Estee Lauder Day Wear, Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge Tint, Marcelle Sheer Tint Fluid Moisturizer, Dermalogica Clean Start Brighten Up tinted moisturizer, and Cover FX Skin Tint.  Even though I love all Cover FX products, their tinted moisturizer does not have a range of colors that typically match my skin.  I&#x27;ve only been able to use it during the summer after getting some color from the sun (which I try to avoid religiously anyway). Not to mention, Cover FX is very expensive - about $37.00 a tube.  In terms of SPF coverage, CG Smoothers is great!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the SPF 15 rating (kind of low).  It includes UVA/UVB protection with zinc oxide which is the magic ingredient in terms of sun protection.  I purchased the light to medium tube, and I absolutely love it.  I am Greek, so my skin color is between a light to medium range with yellow undertones.  It is a light-weight forumla that blends in very well.  I also have combination skin so I use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel in the winter to moisturize the dry patches on my face before I apply the tint.  I have yet to try Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer which allegedly holds the title for best tinted moisturizer.  Given how satisfied I am with CG Smoothers, I doubt I&#x27;ll make that expensive leap for a product that may not even live up to its reputation.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price of some of these tints - having tried a wide range of products, I&#x27;ve quickly realized that super expensive does not equal superior.  I am so impressed with CG Smoothers.  I will definitely recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this last summer and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores this year! Do glad that amazon came to the rescue!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this stuff! I suppose being just a \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; you should not expect any coverage whats so ever which is exactly the case! So I suppose if you are a teen and/or have \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; skin this will be for you. Me, I am going to pass! Too bad I got a 2 pack..... what a waste! :(</li>
    <li> Pretty easy make up to use. Doesn&#x27;t add too much color, but enough. I bought it as a fill in since I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on make up each month. The price was great too. I find the shade blends in well and isn&#x27;t too greasy. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup - and typically, no foundation at all.  I purchased this because I always wear moisturizer and here in So Cal, it&#x27;s a good idea to wear some sunscreen every day.  The reviews I found most compelling in favor of this product said that it didn&#x27;t gather in fine lines and didn&#x27;t look like makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with those statements wholeheartedly - this is just a nice, light tinted moisturizer that helps protect your skin from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I apply my regular daily Retinol creme and then put a light dabbing of this product on cheeks, chin, tip of nose and middle of forehead.  I use my RealTechniques foundation brush to spread the CG Smoothers tint all over my face and partway down my throat and neck. When needed, I use a concealing product over blemishes, and a light dusting of contouring blush under my cheekbones - finish with bare minerals Clear Radiance over all to make my mature skin glow, and I&#x27;m set.  :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED APRIL 11, 2015 TO ADD AN UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I write this, I want to be very clear that I&#x27;m not accusing the product of being bad for you.  The problems I&#x27;ve experienced might be binary - a reaction to using this with other producrts at the same time, and might just be an allergic reaction MY system is having to the moisturizing sun screen.  Your system may not react the way mine apparently is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that disclaimer, I&#x27;ll tell you that I&#x27;ve been using the product every day for 3 weeks.  I began noticing headaches after the first week, but who thinks about a headache being attributable to sunscreen?  I continued using the product and before long, I began feeling like I&#x27;d been run over by a train, no matter how much sleep I got.  I just didn&#x27;t have any energy.  Still, I didn&#x27;t think about sunscreen having any possible role to play in this exhausted condition.  I began thinking I had mono.  The third week, my eyes began to do really funny things and it was like somebody had turned the contrast WAY up on my computer monitor.  I still didn&#x27;t think about it being because of this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the ladies room first thing Monday morning, and while doing my business I was listening to the workers on the roof trying to fix the A/C at work, and I thought to myself that I hope they wore their sunscreen.  It dawned on me at that moment that I had forgotten to wear mine for the first time since I&#x27;d bought this product... and while I was washing my hands, I just happened to look up at my reflection and noticed how WHITE the whites of my eyes were.  I hadn&#x27;t seen them look that good for weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And walking back to my office, things just kind of clicked into place in my brain.  I didn&#x27;t wear the sunscreen, I didn&#x27;t feel super-tired, I had white in the whites of my eyes, and my eyes didn&#x27;t hurt.  I came home and explained all this to the Hubs, who said he thought I should discontinue using the product for the rest of the week and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did - and I&#x27;m back here writing to hopefully help somebody recognize possible problems.  I don&#x27;t know WHY this happened - I do love the product, but I&#x27;m not going to be able to use it.  Please be aware that if you try this and begin experiencing headaches, lack of energy and/or vision problems, you might have the same kind of body chemistry that causes you to be unable to continue wearing it.still didn&#x27;t think about it being because of this sunscreen.

    <li> If you got rosecea, this is a great way to cover it up and protect your skin from it getting worse &#x27;cause it has SPF in it. Mix it with eucerin redness relief (green stuff) and you&#x27;ll be even-toned and well protected from the sun all day!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really cover up any redness but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s a great moisturizer to apply before applying my PTR CC cream. I have dry skin and this stuff just glides on. I wish it provided more coverage, because then I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend 50 bucks for a CC cream.</li>
    <li> I like this much better than regular makeup.  It is lighter and does not rub off on my clothes as readily.  I order it when my local stores are out of my color.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to apply, very smooth, and keeps your skin free of dry patches. It doesn&#x27;t fell oily or uncomfortable like other moisturizers and it gives a light, even coverage. I&#x27;ve been having problems with my skin lately and suffer from acne so, in order to conceal blemishes, I still have to use a regular foundation on the problem spot. But with combination skin like mine (dry and oily) this is perfect because it hydrates the dry parts without making the oily parts worse. What I do, is I take an ivory colored foundation and dab it on the really red and stubborn blemishes. it all blends in quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have good skin and/or it&#x27;s your first time trying on make up, this is the best product to use. There&#x27;s nothing better than light and even coverage while nourishing your skin at the same time. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica brand tinted moisturizer forever until I stumbled on this item in Walmart. It is absolutely wonderful and, in  my opinion, as good my previous brand. It covers beautifully, the shade is perfect, it keeps my 50+ aged skin smooth and soft, and it is considerably cheaper than paying $27-42.00 for Dermalogica. And Amazon has the best price and service anywhere. I bought 2 and will be buying many more to keep in reserve.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the product! If you are looking to even out your skin tone, your search ends here! Awesome product! Wonder why I did not discover this product earlier!</li>
    <li> This is very lightweight and full of moisture.  It does a good job of covering my &amp;#34;speckly&amp;#34; face.  I am happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> The product is good for a tinted moisturizer. It leaves my face a little dry do I mix it in my hand with my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this tinted moisturizer.  It makes a great base for my foundation, and provides sun protection.  My skin tone is uneven and it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of pigment, so I can&#x27;t wear it alone, but if you have good skin you could.  Way better than other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Cover Girl Smoothers Tinted Moisturizer is my every day foundation now.  I started using it this summer because it had SPF protection while also being a lightly tinted moisturizer. i thought I would use it for everyday outdoor activities in the summer and go back to a traditional foundation for work and special occasions. Not! I can&#x27;t tell you how pleasantly surprised I was with this inexpensive item.  It beats heavy foundations by a mile. I have now stopped using foundation entirely - and I am in my 50s! While it IS very lightweight and not one of those heavy \\&quot;coverage\\&quot; foundations, it still disguises minor imperfections and gives your skin a beautiful glow while looking completely natural. In fact, I think this stuff is perfect for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  Because it is so moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;fake\\&quot;, dry look that some foundations do.  I do have pretty good skin with few wrinkles, but it minimizes those. I have actually gotten compliments that I look \\&quot;10 years younger.\\&quot; This is a WINNER by Covergirl at about 1/3 of the price of cosmetic counter tinted moisturizers. Love, love, love this stuff.  Now, don&#x27;t buy it all before I stock up on a lifetime supply ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought some tinted moisturizer (NARS) at Sephora, for about $45. It&#x27;s really nice, a great substitute for actual foundation; but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much again. I thought I&#x27;d try a drugstore brand. This product is equivalent to the NARS (in my opinion) for a fraction of the price. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
    <li> I tend to try out a lot of different products and don&#x27;t typically stick to one brand but this tinted moisturizer has become a daily must for me! I love it&#x27;s sheer coverage, it&#x27;s not heavy but creates a very even smooth skin tone.</li>
    <li> I understand that this is supposed to just be a tinted moisturizer, however, when applied there is absolutely no tint. There is no color at all when applied. I bought this item so that I would not look \\&quot;made up\\&quot; but still hoped it would help even out my skin tone somewhat. It does not do this. It would be cheaper to just buy a regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This was the first BB cream I ever tried and I must say I have stuck to it.  It gives me a glow during this wintry season that I needed.  I like how it blends with my skin complexion, that is very difficult because I am more tanned in the summer months and the tan fades in the winter season.  This BB CREAM blends with my amazing cosmetics concealer in medium golden very well.  ME GUSTA!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful...a smooth tint and a moisturizer in one.  My skin has a healthy glow without looking like I&#x27;m wearing s mask. Great for daytime use.</li>
    <li> Smooth, color is even, especially good in the winter but good makeup base in the summer. Soaks right in. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this but it is really sheer. I dont have creepy under eye skin with this as it sinks in but if you need to cover big zit forget about it. This is good if you already have god skin.</li>
    <li> I am alergic to a lot of makeup products but so far so good with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now (since the time it was called tinted moisturizer and not BB cream).  Seems like the formula didn&#x27;t change much when they switched it to a BB cream.  I used to buy it in my local supermarket or big box store, but it&#x27;s gotten harder and harder to find, especially since I switch often between the superlight shade and this one.  But I just can&#x27;t give this stuff up. I hate heavy foundation and don&#x27;t need a ton of coverage, and this product blends right into my skin without any trouble. It provides just enough coverage to even out my skin without caking on or looking fake.  I can just apply it with my hands like moisturizer, which saves a lot of time in the morning.  It feels like nothing on my face, and comes off clean at the end of the day without a bit of trouble.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when Walgreens where I always purchased this,(also looked at other stores) stopped carrying this product and was very happy to find it on Amazon, it is not a heavy make up, and totally fits my needs with the sunscreen and moisturizer, and matches skin tones, a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> Sun screen, moisture and a bit of color and it&#x27;s very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, easy and the light coverage I want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with fair, sensitive skin.  This tinted moisturizer has worked very well for me.  The first day or two I noticed that my skin felt a little warm after putting it on, but there was no redness or breaking out.  Now I don&#x27;t have any reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that some reviews said the tint was almost unnoticeable; so, despite being pretty fair, I chose the light to medium color and it has the effect that I was hoping for.  It feels very light and evens out my skin while adding a touch of color.  My friend actually complimented me on my skin/makeup, she said my skin looked  smooth and &amp;#34;sun-kissed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: hooray for SPF!  Boo melanoma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying the smoothers, even if you have sensitive skin.  If you don&#x27;t have a severe reaction, give it a couple days to see if you acclimate to it.</li>
    <li> This  moisturizer is exactly what I wanted.  It evens my tone and moisturizes my skin all at the same time and it&#x27;s light so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m starting anything at all.</li>
    <li> I have looked for 3 months in all the stores  for this one product #810. never thought to look here untill the other day. I have used this covergirl product for a long time and it never lets me down, no matter what the weather. The prices are fair too. Thank you for the prompt delivery too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years now.  It&#x27;s really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy (my skin is on the dryer side).  It gives a little hint of color without looking or feeling heavy like a foundation.  Lots of companies sell this kind of thing for a lot more money, but this is a great product and does the job just as well.</li>
    <li> I find matching makeup colors tedious and frustrating.  And I find buying makeup expensive.  I used to get a similar kind of makeup from Clinique -- their sport tint with spf15.  They discontinued it and the only similar replacement was a smaller amount of makeup for a larger amount of money.  So I tried several different brands from the drugstore (carefully, as my skin sometimes reacts to... something... in makeup).  This is the one I&#x27;ve settled on.  It&#x27;s smooth, a great, blendable color.  And a very attractive price.  I could wish for just a tiny bit more opacity to make it a perfect 5-star.</li>
    <li> I love it. Will continue to use it too.</li>
    <li> I used to use a tinted moisturizer, and so glad to see them come back.  CC&#x27;s colors  are great, the product isn&#x27;t greasy, they blend very well. It&#x27;s just a great product.</li>
    <li> Why this is good:1. It&#x27;s cheap and that means I use as much as I want and we all know more is better to get the full SPF 15. It has both a chemical and non-chemical (zinc oxide) sunscreen which is a requirement for me. 2. The color is perfect for my light olive skin. 3. You can layer without problems (no pilling) so if you want more coverage in one area you can do that. 4. It dries to a dewy - not matte and not shiny finish.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an excellent product that compares to tinted moisturizers sold at department store prices. It&#x27;s great for those occasions when you are looking for a more natural, not made-up look. However, it does give some light coverage, so your little imprefections will seem to fade away without a line of demarcation. If you are going to be wearing this while spending time outdoors, it&#x27;s a good choice because it does offer protection from sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a tinted moisture before, this CoverGirl Smoother is a good place to start!</li>
    <li> A long time Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer fan, given the economy I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable alternative. I may have found it in CGSMoothers. Have only used it a few times, want to be sure it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and will update this review if it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: It smooths on easily, blends nicely, and is very natural looking. I use the light to medium, and there are no yellow/orange tones, just a nice natural color. Doesn&#x27;t get caught up and show in the hairline or eyebrows the way some do. Very sheer, more so than Laura Mercier, but evens out the skin tone, and you can layer it on little here and there for a little extra coverage if you need it. SPF is really nice, too. So far I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue to use it if my skin continues to react well to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have trouble spreading it (someone mentioned that), it&#x27;s always a good idea to still use a good moisturizer under a tinted moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin or live in a dry climate. I always do, and it keeps my skin looking great. A face primer is nice, too, makes for an even smoother look, and holds the color all day long.</li>
