      <li>or you can do a warm set on it by dampening the hair and putting it on hot rollers or do a steam set.</li>
      <li>Your hair has to be extremely straight in order for it to blend well with your own</li>
      <li>: ) i love them super soft and not as tangled.</li>
      <li>, you can&#x27;t style with heat, and overall just weren&#x27;t good hair extensions.</li>
      <li>To create a full full in to my hair I would have needed 3 packs which does not make it a deal</li>

      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to much for me</li>
      <li>Just be gentle and take care of them</li>
      <li>but these are not thin the thicker than I thought</li>
      <li>Plenty enough to go around your whole head, they were actually hard to fit them all in there because there&#x27;s so many!</li>
      <li>They are good but too thin</li>
      <li>I was able to curl them a few times till they completely fried.</li>
      <li>I absolutely will order again in the future!</li>
      <li>They got tangled ALOT, the ends got real frizzy when you brushed the hair</li>
      <li>And people actually thought it was my real hair</li>
      <li>I thought they were going to be thin because most are</li>
      <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of it being synthetic and shedding a little when I first got it out of the packaging.</li>

    <li> These extensions are well worth what you pay. I ordered 22&amp;#34; jet black extensions and they were amazing. Came super neat and soft, and 18 clip ins. Also they came earlier than expected! Plenty enough to go around your whole head, they were actually hard to fit them all in there because there&#x27;s so many! Yes they do get tangled, as regular hair does, but I just take a comb and start from the bottom and brush them out. No hair falls out unless you jerk it obviously. Just be gentle and take care of them and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Very stringy. Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get all of my extentions I got 1pc and they were the wrong color, fortunately I had someone to give it to but I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thin but it&#x27;s easy to put them in and take them out. I prefer these over the glue or weave in hair extensions...</li>
    <li> Suck. To thick on the bottle</li>
    <li> The hair was falling out of the clips just taking it out of the package. To create a full full in to my hair I would have needed 3 packs which does not make it a deal and they sucked. On the good side, they arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Just got these extensions.: ) i love them super soft and not as tangled. I just wished it was a little more thicker but still satisfied with them! Will order again :)</li>
    <li> They are good but too thin</li>
    <li> Too thin to blend into my natural hair. Tangles so so bad :(</li>
    <li> These extensions ate very long, but they are a cheap plastic and tangle easily.</li>
    <li> I just got these extensions and I am in love with them! &amp;lt;3 They were a little tangled when I got them. So worth the money though. (:</li>

    <li> I love my extensions so far I&#x27;m wearing them now thy get tangled easy but not as bad as I thought but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to much for me I got them like a week early and the price for these awesome! Lol there so long which I absolutely LOVE! And people actually thought it was my real hair lol they are still so gorgeous! I absolutely will order again in the future! And I thought they were going to be short I open the package and got really long hair and they are very thick I thought they were going to be thin because most are but these are not thin the thicker than I thought but I&#x27;m still in love with these the only reason I gave it a four starred rating is because of the tangling issue but that aside I would give it a five.....but I would definitely recommend this product:)</li>
    <li> Besides them getting tangled they are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;They blend great with your natural hair .&lt;br /&gt;Definitely should include instructions on how to take care of synthetic hair.</li>
    <li> Ive used extensions for so long, I wear real human hair and synthetic hair &amp; im Asian so its hard to match hair texture to mine. These were very shiny &amp; a bit fake looking. And got very tangled easily. If its not for everyday use I recommend. I was able to curl them a few times till they completely fried.</li>
    <li> bad quality . I din&#x27;t use it i had to trow it away.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend getting these. You get what you pay for. They got tangled ALOT, the ends got real frizzy when you brushed the hair, you can&#x27;t style with heat, and overall just weren&#x27;t good hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Horrible got to nappy it and its. Just a big waste</li>
    <li> First it says 12 piece but that&#x27;s not what I got, it was one piece and it wasn&#x27;t even black. It was a ugly blonde color. I&#x27;m not happy with what I got this time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely sucked very disappointed. Chunks of hair were coming out of the clips and they tangle very easy. Very thin and missing a lot of hair on clips. Terrible never buying again. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Had to throw them away.</li>
    <li> I love these! They&#x27;re great! They do get tangled but i just keep a brush with me anyways, matches my hair purrfectly</li>
    <li> Super Fast delivery. You CAN CURL but only if you dampen the hair and curl with very low heat not above 120 degrees. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of it being synthetic and shedding a little when I first got it out of the packaging. After that, I curled and combed it with no problem. Your hair has to be extremely straight in order for it to blend well with your own or you can do a warm set on it by dampening the hair and putting it on hot rollers or do a steam set. But IT WILL CURL. I found a few Youtube videos helpful in regards to curling or setting synthetic hair.</li>
    <li> Super fake . tangled within first day .hair falls off so easily.</li>
    <li> they were okay but I guess you get what you paid for</li>
