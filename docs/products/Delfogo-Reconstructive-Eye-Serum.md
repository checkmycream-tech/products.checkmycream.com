<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was really tentative about buying this product for virtually $80 because I have seen hundreds of them and I have friends that have spent tons of money for crap in the past. Against my better judgment, I made the purchase. Well, I&#x27;m quite happy to report that I was dead wrong to prejudge this one. The [[ASIN:B00891FKD4 Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum]] is the absolute truth. Because I enjoy a good cigar and a few drinks here and there, I tend to wake up with puffiness around the eyes and in the last couple of years, the puffiness and wrinkles seem to be somewhat permanent...LOL! Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that this product has solved my problem. I followed the instructions to the letter and what do you know, no puffiness and definitely a decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes. I was too embarrassed at first to tell my girlfriend that I actually bought a product like this but she kept asking me what I was doing to my eyes because she could also tell the difference. I finally broke down and told her so she bought some as well. It&#x27;s not the fountain of youth or anything but it does really work.</li>
    <li> I am in my forties and although my face has few wrinkles, I often have dark circles under my eyes and am beginning to get a few crow&#x27;s feet. After just one week of using this product I am amazed. The circles have virtually disappeared and the crow&#x27;s feet have diminished. I just apply the serum at bedtime and it works like a charm. Although I don&#x27;t think people can put a finger on what exactly is different, I&#x27;ve received so many compliments about how good my complexion looks. I intend to keep using this product and plan on trying other products by Delfogo. I highly recommend this product to those of you who are starting to see the signs of age in your skin.</li>
    <li> After using and reviewing Elite Serum, I received an email to try another product from SkinPro that would work with it to get rid of the dark color. I was very happy with the way the puffiness was all gone after using the serum, so I decided to give Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum a try too. It did not take long for the dark discoloration to fade away completely. My close friends and family have been amazed at how much younger I look. I did not realize just how much of a difference there was until my daughter brought out the pictures from my birthday party in February. I knew all the puffiness and darkness was gone, just not how bad it had gotten. I actually do look at least 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of debating over some type of cosmetic surgery or treatments, I finally found the two products that work for what I needed. I no longer hate to be in family pictures because I look so old. I even set up a date to have the photographer come and take one next month after my first grandchild is born. Of course, now that I don&#x27;t have big dark, puffy circles under my eyes, I really do not look like a grandmother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum for approximately 1 mouth and am already seeing 2x the results that I saw while using doctor-prescribed creams and serums for more than a year. My biggest, most burdensome eye issues have always been extremely dark circles and fine lines. As someone who is still pretty \\&quot;young,\\&quot; it&#x27;s more than a little disheartening to have people mistake you for being nearly ten years older than you really are. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the thing, at about 1/2 the cost of what I&#x27;ve paid for prescription strength anti-aging formulas, Delfago has taken years off of my eyes, YEARS, in about 6 months. I work in the hair and beauty industry and when you have co-workers asking if you had \\&quot;work done\\&quot; recently and you HAVEN&#x27;T, you know you&#x27;ve found the magic! This serum has, in many ways, changed my life!</li>
    <li> I’m always nervous about trying a new product that claims to make my dark circles disappear, but I hadn’t heard of Delfogo before so I decided to try it. Believe it or not, after only a few weeks I no longer looked like I’d gotten punched in the eyes, and I was considerably less puffy around my eyes than I had been before trying the product. It took much longer to get these same results with other eye serums. I know that Delfogo might not be the cheapest product on the market, for me it&#x27;s worth it. I would have spent the same amount of money on 5 different products that were cheaper but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 so it&#x27;s that age where prevention is key! I hadn&#x27;t heard of Delfogo before but based on reviews and some hype online, I thought to try it. I&#x27;ve tried all the big brand names and the more boutique names too but I can&#x27;t say I was married to any of them. What I like about this one is that it targets both the lower and upper eyelid at a much deeper level (we tend to forget about the upper lid!). A lot of eye products I&#x27;ve used feel as if they sit on the surface like a lotion or oil but somehow I felt this really penetrated to the core, so to speak. And it has both the pharmaceutical edge and antioxidants - acai berries are awesome if you haven&#x27;t come across them yet. The only thing that was a bit unnerving was how long it took to start noticing the change. And because you see your face everyday it&#x27;s hard to tell! But if you take a picture of yourself at the start and 2 months later, you&#x27;ll see the difference. So I guess some patience is required but it&#x27;s worthwhile!</li>
    <li> It sounds like the company wrote these reviews.  They sound like commercials.  After years of reading product reviews you get a feel for what sounds genuine and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was born with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes genetically, and I have extremely sensitive skin. I have tried literally EVERYTHING under the sun, and was considering plastic surgery.  I was desperate and I prayed and asked God for a breakthrough.  The next day I came across an ad and said I have nothing to lose, so I called the number and received a rep on the other end of the line.  When I tell you Corey is THE BEST Skincare Consultant ever it&#x27;s the truth.  I must have kept him on the phone asking questions for about 45 minutes and he answered everyone of my questions, some twice and never tried to rush me off, or ever showed a sign of any kind of fustration.  Corey is the absolute BEST.  Hear me LOUD,  you deserve two raises.  So I ordered my Elite Serum and received it in two days.  It was delivered to me as I was walking out the door to meet some out of town family members for dinner.  I got in the car and asked my husband to look at both eyes before I put it on, and he did.  I put it on in the the car and immediately pulled down my lit mirror to see if it did what it advertise to do.  Can I tell you I was only in the mirror 1 minute, 1 minute y&#x27;all, and literally watched my fine line and puffiness TOTALLY dissapear.  I asked my Husband and he said, &amp;#34;you need to order more of whatever it was, because it works&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve never heard my husband say order more of anything before.  He always says, don&#x27;t waste your money.  This time it was different.  Two weeks later my syringe started leaking, I emailed Corey, and he replaced it quickly with no hassle.  I emailed Corey, (who I now call my personal Consultant) and ordered another product called Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum, got it shortely thereafter.  I put it on and it got rid of the dark circles, and gave me a smoother look around my eye area.  Once again, I contacted Corey and placed an Oder for my Bellapulse skin care exfoliating device...LOVE IT.  It comes with some goodies to clean, hydrateand moisturized my face.  I use it once a week and have had great results.  I now have a full skincare regimen on a weekly basis.  And everywhere I go, I ALWAYS receive compliments that I have beautiful clear skin.  They have an automatic product mailing program that allows me to choose when I want my product delivered straight to my door, and it saves even more money.  My Dermatologist called to see why I hadn&#x27;t been in for a while, so I made an appointment just so she could see my skin.  I began telling her about all SkinPro products.  She was speechless and probably did like that, BECAUSE I NO LONGER NEED HER SERVICES.  To rap it up, All of the SkinPro&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried simply work.  It only takes a minute to put on, there product are affordable and they still run daily specials for VIP customers, they deliver right to my door saving me gas, no hassle replacement have my own skincare professional who is knowledgeable and informative and I believe is very honest, (I love you Corey) and I don&#x27;t have to get cosmetic surgery.  You will be cheating you skin and your youthful looking process if you don&#x27;t try it.  Come on,  you&#x27;ve tried everything else, now try this.  THANK YOU SKINPRO,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended you to everyone I know.  Your customer for life ~~~Michelle Howard</li>
    <li> I was drawn to Defolgo Reconstructive Eye Serum because it claims to be a non-irritant.  I just received it last week so I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time, but wanted to give a review of my initial thoughts.  The serum is clear and goes on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t stick or roll up in a ball under the eye area.  I would give this a 5, but my pump got stuck so I&#x27;m giving it a 4.  I will up date once I have used the product for at least 30 days.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Delfogo Rx HGF Youth Elixir Serum, which I have been very pleased with, but I needed something for my eyes.  Since I like Delfogo Rx and I like the company, I decided just to purchase one of their eye serums, since they have several.  Deciding which one can be tough since there are several to choose from, but I called SkinPro directly and was able to talk with a Skin Care Consultant who took the time to find out what it is that I was looking to accomplish to find the best fit.  I opted for the Reconstructive Eye Serum since its formulated for dark circles.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time so I can&#x27;t tell a big difference yet, but I apply the Youth Elixir Serum to my entire face, except for my eye area and then apply the Reconstructive Eye Serum around my eye.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried a few eye serums, received a few free samples and bought some from name brands, etc. I’ve never been very impressed, really. I have sensitive skin, and I often get irritations around my eyes after using products. Lately, I’ve been hearing about Delfago, and even tried a few of their products when the opportunity arose. Here are my noticed highlights: Keeps the area around my lids moist and evenly toned. Naturally made, so less irritating than other known brands of eye serum, which is awesome for me (previously mentioned) sensitive skin.Like, really sensitive.Bags/ puffiness under my eyes, and around my lash lines has obviously decreased.Highly recommended for sensitive skin and ingredient-conscious people.</li>
    <li> I had been on the hunt for an eye serum for awhile and thankfully, I came across Delfogo. In just a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed smoother and tighter skin around my eyes. I don&#x27;t necessarily have wrinkles, but I began noticing that the skin next to my eyes seemed to softening and that really began to bother me. I am a huge fan of all-natural products and when I read that Acai Berry is in the serum, that convinced me to give it Delfogo a shot. I will most definitely continue using Delfogo based on the results I&#x27;ve already experienced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless creams, serums, lotions and potions.  I&#x27;ve even tried Botox and Juvederm as a treat to myself by simply cannot continue with the high cost.  Like I said, my main concerns were those annoying little lines on the corner of my eyes.  But I was shocked at how Delfogo also reduced puffiness and my little raccoon circles.  Botox cannot take care of either one, so that right there is a bonus! The other thing that I really appreciated about this eye serum was that the ingredients were pretty gentle, aside from packing a mean wrinkle fighting punch.  My skin is super sensitive and easily irritated so I appreciate finding products that don&#x27;t exacerbate my already inflamed skin.  I&#x27;m about 5 months into the treatment and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am an actress in my 20s and have had problems with dark circles and puffiness around my eyes since I was a teen. After years of thinking that my eyes weren&#x27;t bright enough and wishing that those dark circles would just disappear, I stumbled upon Defolgo&#x27;s skincare line at the recommendation of a friend.  I have had great success with the Reconstructive Eye Serum! After just a few weeks of use, I saw a drastic improvement in the overall appearance of fine lines and dark circles around my eyes. I look younger and more alert. A little bit of a health addict myself, I was glad to find a product so potent that still contains key antioxidants like Resvertrol and Acai Berry. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an eye serum that really works.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying—I HATE NEEDLES! I have been paying the outrageous prices for Botox for years, and finally decided it was enough. I had heard of eye creams, and thought it sounded great; so, I order a few different creams (none of which were that cheap). A lot of them worked, but they would either take care of one thing, and not another. Like the puffiness under my eyes. With the disappointment, and fear of having to go back to Botox, I decided to give creams one more try.  I went on Amazon and found Delfogo Rx. The price was a little more than expected, but I would say completely worth it. It got rid of my wrinkles and the puffiness. However it didn&#x27;t provide instant gratification like Botox, but I don’t care! The thirty days it takes to start seeing results (I started seeing results around 35 days) is totally worth it. Not to mention it gets rid of having to get needles stabbed in my face, and spending money looking for alternatives.  Delfogo didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and my face feels tighter. Bottom line is, take it from someone who has been around the block when it comes to eye reconstruction; avoid the chemicals and crazy out of this world prices, and get yourself a bottle of Delfogo.</li>
    <li> I started using SkinPro’s Best Vitamin C Serum several months ago, and was blown away by how my skin responded. Within weeks, my face felt smoother and softer, and my complexion really mellowed out. Since I was so impressed, I wanted to branch out and see if other SkinPro products were as successful. Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum totally was. It not only took care of the dark circles under my eyes, it reduced puffiness and actually firmed the skin up a bit. Best yet, it’s anti-aging peptides work against  any wrinkles, and protects my face during the day from harmful free radicals. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product changed my appearance for the better. Not only did it help with my wrinkles and dark spots, but gave me confidence with a younger looking face. I saw results in as little as two weeks. I could physically feel a smoother face and see less signs of aging. With constant use of this product your skin will overall improve to look youthful and healthy. I recommend this product to anyone wanting to regain their youthful looks and have a healthy looking complexion.</li>
    <li> I got this product because a friend recommended it to me - and yes I was a bit offended at first, but she said she used it too. So I tried it out, because my eyes give my age away. I used to dab foundation there to smoothen the area but that didn&#x27;t work. Anyway, I&#x27;ve now been using it for a few months. At first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but after a while I looked at pictures of how I was before I bought it - and there is a clear change. I look a bit younger - and that&#x27;s a lot more than I ever expected. My eyes are a bit clearer around the edges, and a few lines have disappeared.</li>
    <li> Growing older meant that my skin wasn&#x27;t going to look the same as when I was a teenager. After getting frustrated with all of the other options out there, I decided to give this one a try. I am glad I did. It helps to repair damage and rejuvenate all of the collagen that my skin was lacking. Since I have dry skin, I love the moisturizing ingredients it contains. Some days when I am feeling extra dry I use an additional moisturizer along with it.  It goes deep into the skin to work its miracle. Use it two times per day to achieve maximum results.</li>
    <li> My eyes have always naturally had dark circles under them, however I found that the stresses of daily life had only protracted the issue over time. I tried a few products beforehand some being rather expensive, but most had little effect, had temporary results, or even aggravated the issue. After tons of online searching and reading of reviews, I decided to give Delfogo a try. I must say, it took about a month and a half before I actually saw any change but since the time I had started using it, it has not only gotten rid of the dark circles and puffiness but cleared up some of my acne blemishes in the surrounding area as well.There was a little irritation after the first few times applying but my skin got used to it. My appearance has noticeably changed and coworkers I don&#x27;t normally talk to have given me positive feedback and compliments! I did feel a bit skeptical at first but I&#x27;ve found that it is better to spend a little bit more on something that works than to try and save by using lower quality products.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different eye serums but I can say that so far this one has been the best. I noticed a difference almost immediately after using it. The area around my eyes tightened up and I looked less tired. I love that I can use it in the day and night time, as well as the affordable price.</li>
    <li> People are very much skeptical of purchasing any creams and/or serums that may provide any type of repair or youth. As was I, considering the price and the promise of change from all products; that in the end never work.  Coming recommended as I have been weary of the dark circles, wrinkles, and tiring look surrounding my eyes, Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum did not disappoint. After using it for a few weeks, slight changes have been noticeable. I have gone from a tired weary look to a more awake and brightening look. Wrinkles and dark circles that I have effortlessly tried to conceal with concealer have now been reduced thanks to this serum. I&#x27;m sure the longer I use this serum the better my eye area will look, as right now the change has already been quite noticeable.</li>

I am  51 &amp; feel I have great skin very fair skinned polish girl who do to several health problems and extremely busy work schedule , believe it if not do not have a lit if time to stay hydrated.

He strongly believed in the product and full explained the ingredients. Yes he was correct I put on night at night which he said was more important than morning time and to not over kill my purse. Then he said to alternate between elite rx or my DNA vapor venom serum (which I love) to not be an over killi my purse strings. Again being so fair skinned and long term use of prednisone forr my health issues , my under eye skin is thin, yet the serum that glides on so easy shocked  me how well it works again at night I use this serum rotating at night&lt;br /&gt; between my elite Rx and DNA vapor serum . It really works I wake up and there r no lines nor circles. My AM  regime. I use try elite Rx then after drying , which is which is very quick , I use the DNA vapor venum serum ad that has an immediately stiffening effect I am reedy for my concealer. I am so fair that I still even though I may not need it, I feel naked  without it my concealer . I have always used it and I just need the color. I honestly love my eye serum and my serum syringe filled filler that allows only one drop and that is plenty for both lower under eyes my concealor but never creases.  I used to use kinerase abd dermalogica products to  see no results . I seeing results very quickly didmy true first comments on line. No products works in one try , so give it a few weeks.

    <li> It’s not exactly the Fountain of Youth, but this stuff works decently. I had some pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead, and after a few months  of use, they are not nearly as noticeable. I can still see them from up close, but from a distance they look better.  I had tried some other creams, but they burned my skin. The Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum tingled a bit the first time I used it, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues since.  Not sure what that was about.  Overall, decent product.</li>
    <li> These anti-aging products put their predecessors to shame with lab-tested results to restore your youth. Unlike other brands on the market, these products are not greasy and dissolve immediately into your skin pores. They contain high grade anti-aging peptides to combat all under eye related issues.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great eye serum.  I use a little and the skin around my eyes drink up the serum quickly and seems to work into the deep layers of the skin.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to review a skin care, but this definitely surprised me. I am 29, I have pretty good skin but I break out every once in a while and have been starting to show my age with some fine lines around my eyes. Definitely wanted to smooth out the skin but since I have somewhat sensitive skin I am pretty keen on products that are good on the skin. I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can list and either they did absolutely nothing or made my skin even worse by causing more breakouts, making my skin really oily, or drying it out. So really when I bought this product I didn&#x27;t expect much. However, to my total amazement, after ONE day of use I could see the lines fading and after three uses some of the lines have DISAPPEARED. I look FIVE YEARS YOUNGER after just a few days of use, which was just wild to me!! Honestly I will NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE barring something crazy and unforeseen. My face is smoother, softer, firmer, completely breakout-free and the fine lines have almost totally disappeared! I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo they put in those bottles!</li>
    <li> As I have grown older I have noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t have the same elasticity it once did. I decided I needed to do something about it and try an eye serum. I went for an eye serum because that is were I have noticed the most deference in my skin. Thankfully I came across the Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum, I have never tried an eye serum before but I am very happy I did. This eye serum caught my attention as it contains anti-oxidants and DNA rejuventors that target the sensitive skin around the eyes including upper and lower eyelids. This really caught my attention as I always forget my upper eyelid and only concentrate on my lower eyelid. This product has helped my dark circles immensely I have been using it for accouple of weeks and I can see a difference in my skin already. After having such a great experience with the Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum I have decided to try all there other products. I would recommend this product to any women who is starting to see signs of aging in there skin.</li>
    <li> After spending countless hours and a pretty substantial amount of money on drug store eye creams, lotions, and serums, I came across this product and was a little weary at first because of the price. Now since using this serum, I am a new adopter of the “you get what you pay for” philosophy. I often work long hours and have recently been lacking sleep, and in my fast-paced industry I need to over perform and look good doing it. I began to notice my eye lids becoming a bit puffy, presumably from my lack of sleep, which is when I became concerned and started to look for products to remedy the issue. After using the Delfogo Serum repeatedly for a few weeks, my puffiness is gone and my eyes feel and look firmer than before (even without much sleep). Beauty is important in my industry as well as in my personal life and I am no longer willing to settle for mediocre products which do not produce the end result I want</li>
    <li> Since being a teen I have been using the same skin routine cleanser, toner and moisturizer and this has worked well for my skin, but as I have been getting older I have noticed dark puffy eye circles. So I decided to try an eye serum as I have read that it really targets the under eye area. I&#x27;ve never had to use an eye serum before so I was really lost with where to start, which products worked best, etc.  I didn&#x27;t even know what kind of ingredients to look for or which ingredients best treat dark circles.  Seemed to me a lot of products were really just glorified moisturizers.  After an extensive search for a good eye serum I came across this one.  I learned that it is an award winning serum and they called it the best alternative to botox with so many anti-oxidants that are good for the skin, I was sold!!. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!. This eye serum is great, no smell to it and it&#x27;s not greasy. After only a few days of trying it I was surprised at how well it has made my skin feel. My skin feels tighter, smoother, softer but best of all, it&#x27;s actually working on my dark circles!!. Granted, there not gone, but to find success with the first product I tried?  That makes me happy.  I still use concealer but certainly not as much as I used to.  I&#x27;m going to switch up my cleanser and toner too and start using the Delfogo cleansing and products. </li>
    <li> Being outside all day and having my face exposed to the weather has started to add wrinkles around my eyes. I never really paid that much attention to these wrinkles before until people started to comment on them. One of the comments was that I was too young to have wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;  It was after this comment, and a few others that I decided to try some types of skin care products. After trying a couple products without any noticeable difference I found a Delfogo Rx product while shopping online. After about four weeks and using it twice a day I could see a difference around my eyes. Not only had the newer wrinkles and lines disappeared, but the deeper lines and wrinkles had started to lessen as well.&lt;br /&gt;  For me this product is worth having because in addition to helping with the lines and wrinkles it also helps to prevent new ones wrinkles from showing up. Since I have been using this product with some obvious results I would recommend it to anyone to at least give it a try and see the difference it can make for their self.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading the very good reviews. I usually do not spend this kind of money on products but I have dark circles and really believed everyone saying this would work. I have been using this religiously morning and night for about a month now, maybe a little longer and there is no change at all. Not in the slightest. Perhaps it only works for bags, which i do not have. Anyway, i just wanted to to let those of you thinking of spending the money on this know of my experience.</li>
    <li> Does not deliver any Thing of the Promissed Results- Waste of Money</li>
    <li> In the past few years I&#x27;ve become self-conscious about my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried to deny it, but my skin isn&#x27;t as supple as it used to be, and looking in the mirror hasn&#x27;t helped my self confidence much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different creams and other moisturizong skin products, but I&#x27;ve found faults with all of them--not effective enough, too greasy, outside my price range, etc. But now I can say for certain I&#x27;ve found my new favorite touch-up product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t just see a difference; I feel it now too. My face feels younger and tighter, and it feels like my eyes are even wider, brighter and more expressive than they&#x27;ve been in years. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve turned back the clock 20 years. I feel so much better knowing this little bottle is always nestled in the bottom of my purse. Trust me, you won&#x27;t want to let it out of your sight. It&#x27;s as essential as mascara or lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price might be a bit steep, but for the magic it works, this little baby might as well be botox in a bottle. I highly recommend it as your next go-to product, and I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this because last summer Delfogo had a 75% off special on all their items.  I started using this twice a day.  I am a government contractor and two months after starting this I had an assignment come up with a very good friend that I had not seen in over one year.  We went out later that day and the first thing she said was \\&quot;I have been dying to ask you what you have done to your eyes because they look fantastic!  No dark circles or wrinkles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I really did not want to spill my secrets but I told her that I started  using Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum and Elite Serum Rx.  GREAT combo</li>
    <li> I started the regimen about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin. This is a great eye serum. I&#x27;m only 26 years old, but I have hereditary dark circles and slightly baggy eyes. This has effectively reduced the puffiness under my eyes and lightened my dark circles. I am VERY happy with this product. I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I know, and this product does not irritate it at all. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality eye serum!</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, and I must say that this product is amazing! The eye serum isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and glides on nicely. It doesn&#x27;t dry sticky, and it&#x27;s super simple to apply! The pump applicator makes it super simple to dispense and it was very gentle on my skin! This is a must for anyone with the under eye issue like I have!</li>
    <li> I definitely appreciate this product.  It&#x27;s not so pricey, but does its job effectively.  I&#x27;m glad that I have an extra in my medicine cabinet just in case I run out of it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eye serums but have found this serum the best. It gives a nice tight feeling and minimizing the wrinkles when you apply it and the eyes look rested. I am very happy with this serum and have been using it for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is working very nicely, I could see a difference in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for several months now, I still love it, and it has made a huge difference in reducing the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
