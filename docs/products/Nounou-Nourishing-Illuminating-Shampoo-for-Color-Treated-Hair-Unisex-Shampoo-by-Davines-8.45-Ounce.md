      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>There is no residue buildup and my hair is clean and shiny!</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and is just barely there which is perfect.</li>
      <li>When I have purchased in a salon the bottle was more full.  </li>
      <li>fortunately I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your hair will still feel clean and after 1 or 2</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, manageable and feels clean.</li>
      <li>Great for my red color treated hair, the scent of there products are great and a little bit does a lot.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still so full, shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>It has a black tea aroma and is great when used with the nou nou conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair that tangles easily and using this shampoo, with the corresponding conditioner, makes my hair so silky!!</li>
      <li>My old time favorite was Aveda&#x27;s  Sap Moss and</li>
      <li>I am a swimmer and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner are the best that I have found for my hair in a long, long time!  </li>
      <li>The price is right, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try something less spendy when I run out of this, and hope it does as good as job.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today</li>
      <li>when that was discontinued, I tried so many brands all of which came up short until I found the Davines Nounou.  </li>
      <li>and I love having darker low lights in my hair</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been just allowing it to dry on its own</li>
      <li>I have used the conditioner which it great, and so I thought the shampoo would be too, but it turned out to be a total waste of money for me.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews for this shampoo and still purchased it because I really like the mask product.</li>
      <li>Price + shipping was reasonable and came well sealed and packaged.</li>
      <li>If you want to really try this product buy it from the website, its a few dollars more but its worth the price.</li>
      <li>This one of the line makes your hair really shine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Minus one star for the high price-to-amount ratio, though.</li>
      <li>It might just be a normal variation of the product</li>
      <li>I like the scent too - very clean, fresh and subtle.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I generally color my hair every 6 weeks, so I need a shampoo that really takes care of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I actually end up having to use more than a half-dollar-sized amount and mix with a little water to get it to do a decent job.</li>
      <li>A bottle of shampoo has lasted me several months and while it does not lather well, it cleans really well without stripping the color.</li>
      <li>A shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of natural oils.</li>
      <li>Also I had some shampoo left in my old bottle and the color wasn&#x27;t exactly the same</li>
      <li>The problem is that the bottle came and was 1/3 empty -- only 2/3s full.  </li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate so my hair needs alot of hydration to be fluffy and full.  </li>

<li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  </li>
<li> sometimes flat iron and use this line to keep nature shine and curl</li>
<li> I have very long tick hair which was starting to get damaged and dry.</li>
<li> Also lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I usually love this product - but I&#x27;m a little wary.</li>
<li> and you don&#x27;t get a dry scalp</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not using junk but for some reason my hair was still dry.</li>
<li> I had to use a lot of this small bottle to get it through my hair and resorted to using my old shampoo as this one seemed to dry my hair out.  </li>
<li> I have naturally blonde hair, but I color it dark brown.</li>
<li> but after it cooled and I tried it for about a week or so, it just does not have the same effect on my hair as the previous bottle.  </li>
<li> The smell is a little different</li>
<li> Takes a little while to get used to little sudsing (no sulfates!), but it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  </li>
<li> I took me over a year with the help of these products and my stylist to restore the damage done by other stylists through over processing.  </li>
<li> Cleanses &amp; nourishes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
<li> but when I compared it to a previous bottle that I purchased from the Davines website, this bottle from Amazon is diluted</li>
<li> have long thick curly hair</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m a little suspicious...</li>
<li> It took a little getting used to-</li>
<li> In order to boost the lather factor, I usually pour half of this and half of some inexpensive grocery store brand into my hand and mix them together.  </li>
<li> I went through a tough financial period</li>
<li> I have very long, very thick hair ...until I found Davines my hair was a dried out frizzy mess.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;blow out&#x27; my &#x27;do&#x27; for a shiny, slick hair shaft.</li>
<li> No more yanking my hair out when I run a comb through it.</li>
<li> My poor hair was so dull, brittle and dry.</li>
<li> I have thick curly hair and it does not lather.  </li>
<li> Maybe it would work with someone with thin silky hair, but forget it for thick hair.  </li>
<li> It seems as if  this shampoo was diluted as it is way too thin.</li>
<li> Yes, this is expensive stuff - but use it and discover the difference between this and &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34;</li>
<li> At this price, that&#x27;s an awful lot of shampoo!</li>

    <li> This product helps maintain my hair color without fading.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Takes a little while to get used to little sudsing (no sulfates!), but it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  Also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I generally color my hair every 6 weeks, so I need a shampoo that really takes care of my hair.  This is it. Davines!</li>
    <li> Finally! A shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of natural oils. My hair is shiny, manageable and feels clean. The scent is fresh and is just barely there which is perfect.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best that I have found for my hair in a long, long time!  I live in a dry climate so my hair needs alot of hydration to be fluffy and full.  My old time favorite was Aveda&#x27;s  Sap Moss and when that was discontinued, I tried so many brands all of which came up short until I found the Davines Nounou.  A bottle of shampoo has lasted me several months and while it does not lather well, it cleans really well without stripping the color.</li>
    <li> I usually love this product - but I&#x27;m a little wary. Did they recently change their product and/or packaging? If so, this came in a smaller bottle but it still says 8.45 oz. Also I had some shampoo left in my old bottle and the color wasn&#x27;t exactly the same and I think the smell was even different. It might just be a normal variation of the product but I&#x27;m a little suspicious...</li>
    <li> This one of the line makes your hair really shine&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between two shampoos&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick curly hair&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes flat iron and use this line to keep nature shine and curl</li>
    <li> Cleanses &amp; nourishes my hair without weighing it down. And I love the scent!  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  I will be repurchasing this again &amp; again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply incredible. I have very long tick hair which was starting to get damaged and dry. I use pureology daily so I&#x27;m not using junk but for some reason my hair was still dry. I used this for the first time today and I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my hair feels. It&#x27;s like I just got it cut.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever - my hair has more shine and easy to style....</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to- the shampoo does not lather, but it smells AMAZING!  Your hair will still feel clean and after 1 or 2 uses I am ok without the lather.</li>
    <li> I bought Davines products before and this is just not the same for some reason. It smells like Davines product but when I compared it to a previous bottle that I purchased from the Davines website, this bottle from Amazon is diluted some how. I thought maybe it was because of the heat  (it sat outside for sometime in the heat before I came home and saw it on the door step) but after it cooled and I tried it for about a week or so, it just does not have the same effect on my hair as the previous bottle.  Davines is a great product I love their shampoos, conditioners and even their oil treatment for hair. If you want to really try this product buy it from the website, its a few dollars more but its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for my red color treated hair, the scent of there products are great and a little bit does a lot. Price + shipping was reasonable and came well sealed and packaged.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.  There is no residue buildup and my hair is clean and shiny!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is rather watery.  In order to boost the lather factor, I usually pour half of this and half of some inexpensive grocery store brand into my hand and mix them together.  That way I get the smell I like from this shampoo, and still the shine benefits, and it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick hair ...until I found Davines my hair was a dried out frizzy mess.  I took me over a year with the help of these products and my stylist to restore the damage done by other stylists through over processing.  Yes, this is expensive stuff - but use it and discover the difference between this and &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best! I have very long hair that tangles easily and using this shampoo, with the corresponding conditioner, makes my hair so silky!! No more yanking my hair out when I run a comb through it. I like the scent too - very clean, fresh and subtle. I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners out there, both high-end and lower priced, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Great nourishing shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave any feel of waxy residue.  And it&#x27;s healthy for your hair.</li>
    <li> It seems as if  this shampoo was diluted as it is way too thin. I have thick curly hair and it does not lather.

    <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for many years.  It is the best.  I have colored hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this shampoo and still purchased it because I really like the mask product. It does not lather unless you use a ton of it.you definitely need a conditioner as you cannot comb your hair out if not.</li>
    <li> This product is Eco friendly, has the scent of a spa, and is altogether great. The price is right, too.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo, leaving my fine hair very clean, shiny, and healthy-feeling without stripping. I don&#x27;t find that my color fades noticeably when I use this (alternating with Tressa color-depositing shampoo).  The fragrance sticks around, but fortunately I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for the high price-to-amount ratio, though. I actually end up having to use more than a half-dollar-sized amount and mix with a little water to get it to do a decent job. At this price, that&#x27;s an awful lot of shampoo! I&#x27;ll probably try something less spendy when I run out of this, and hope it does as good as job.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money and it nourishes color treated hairand leaves your hair more managable. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little different but I like the way my hair feels and shines.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite shampoos of all time, it smells great and you don&#x27;t get a dry scalp</li>
    <li> Love these products from Italy!!!  Very good to hair and love the smell  -  Great price cheaper than anywhere around!!!  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair, but I color it dark brown. I went through a tough financial period so I was using dollar store shampoo. My poor hair was so dull, brittle and dry. Even after lobbing off 4 inches, it just still lacked softness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with the &amp;#34;Davines Conditioner, NouNou Illluminating with Tomato Extract for Colour Treated Hair&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m very happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;blow out&#x27; my &#x27;do&#x27; for a shiny, slick hair shaft. So far, I&#x27;ve been just allowing it to dry on its own and it&#x27;s still so full, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I am a swimmer and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and soft. I accidentally ordered two bottles on my last order which was greast because one of them leaked during shipment!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I have used and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m blonde and I love having darker low lights in my hair, this shampoo held maintain the color while keeping hair healthy &amp; sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and smells amazing :)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend trying</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I have been using it for 5 years. I wish it would be sold in retail stores.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best. It has a black tea aroma and is great when used with the nou nou conditioner.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time and only go to Davines salons.</li>
    <li> The problem is that the bottle came and was 1/3 empty -- only 2/3s full.  When I have purchased in a salon the bottle was more full.  I don&#x27;t understand.  Did someone use some?</li>
