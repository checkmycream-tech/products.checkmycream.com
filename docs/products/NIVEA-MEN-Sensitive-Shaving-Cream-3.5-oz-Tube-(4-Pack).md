      <li>Great for traveling (if you&#x27;re not flying...</li>
      <li>I use Arko for that), and great when you&#x27;re in a rush.    </li>

      <li>Great shave and no</li>
      <li>It was very nice.  </li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>I do get a very nice shave from Nivea.</li>
      <li>both brands are very popular amongst us shaving geeks.</li>
      <li>This is very nice cream.  </li>
      <li>Great scent, great slickness and amazing lather!&lt;br</li>
      <li>found it bvery pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>My husband wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this item and usually he is a huge fan of Nivea products</li>
      <li>Best non-foaming shave cream available.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and smells great!</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t use a brush, so maybe that&#x27;s why it just didn&#x27;t make up a good lather, either.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>being said this is as good as any cream I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
      <li>this said, it&#x27;s a good product, and I will reconsider it.  </li>
      <li>it was a good deal at rite aid.</li>
      <li>However, I find that the closeness of the shave isn;t as good as when I sue a shave cream.  </li>
      <li>Good protection, slickness and after shave feel.</li>
      <li>Most appealing, the scent was very pleasant: sort of a lemon, cream, soap, spring day sort of smell.</li>
      <li>One of my very favorite shaving creams, always dependable for a soothing balm and great lather, I also love the price</li>
      <li>I use a Plisson brush with it and it creates a great lather and agrees with my skin better than some of the Proraso creams I have used.  </li>
      <li>Excellent but economical shaving cream.</li>
      <li>The price is nice as well anything in the $2 to $4 price range per ounce is good and this is about a dollar per ounce.</li>
      <li>I must say that the 2 products are both good in their own way.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product!  </li>
      <li>Almost makes me wish I had to shave more often!</li>
      <li>It is more of a cream than a gel, and is adequate at best.</li>
      <li>Amazing value for the price.</li>
      <li>The ingredient list for a mass produced non-artisanal product is amazing.</li>
      <li>recommended, except that it might be good as a travel tube or emergency supply because of the robustness of the metal tube which promises to safely store this stuff</li>
      <li>Proraso is still my go-to, but this might come in handy for a change once in a while.  </li>
      <li>and I get a nice shave.</li>
      <li>It rinses off well and didn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all, and we both liked its scent.</li>
      <li>post shave is nice to no razor burn.</li>
      <li>The Scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The Nivea cream uses some kind of sticky substance to help the cream bind to your skin as you massage it in, presumably designed to yield a closer shave.  </li>
      <li>It kind of foams up, so I started shaving.</li>
      <li>the product smells nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of scent you&#x27;d expect from a men&#x27;s deodorant stick labeled &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The witch hazel adds a nice tingle.</li>
      <li>my own opinion</li>
      <li>Comes in a nice metal tube, made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it balances the wire between offering good protection/slickness AND also rinsing easily from the razor.</li>
      <li>It is easy to lather, which makes it good for beginners.</li>
      <li>I am in a hurry and need to shave quickly, I do use the Nivea with the Dorko razor as it gives me great results.  </li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t get the great fragrances those brands provide but the fragrances of these creams and soaps go away quickly.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Helps get a good shave with light scent</li>
      <li>but this one is good and cheap.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best shaving cream I have.</li>
      <li>product shaves even better, and leaves the face feeling nicely moisturized.</li>
      <li>The best part about this cream is it&#x27;s rich in Glycerin and very sleek and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Very nice shave cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product with a very light scent, but it did not offer me protection from irritation as well as another product I use.  </li>
      <li>I opened the tube of this shave cream, I noticed a very light scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super good cream that you can apply with your hands or a brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excelent shaving crean!!!!</li>
    <li> I love most of Nivea&#x27;s products. I wouldn&#x27;t dare use any other aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that they came out with a traditional shaving cream I was very excited to give it a try, but after about 3 uses, I have given up on it. Every use yielded the same results&lt;br /&gt;• hard to lather&lt;br /&gt;• quick to dry out&lt;br /&gt;• lots of nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great shave. Enjoyed the lather.</li>
    <li> Meh... prefer promos cream.... this was just okay.</li>
    <li> great lather...awesome scent...</li>
    <li> For the money, a great shave cream.  Good protection, slickness and after shave feel. Smells just like sensitive after shave balm by nivea</li>
    <li> I have bought about 10 different shaving creams since taking up shaving with a double edge safety razor.  The Nivea shaving cream is outstanding, I even sometimes add it to my other shaving creams.  Comes in a nice metal tube, made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good smell not overpowering and if you want to mix it with something else you bought works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a badger brush and a shaving mug.  You can either put it right in the mug and start whipping it up, or apply it directly to the brush and your face if you so choose.  A little does go a long way, but I find myself constantly using too much :P.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent even at 2x the price I paid. It lathers well with my badger brush and gave me an excellent cushion to protect my skin from my Merkur slant safety razor. Left my face feeling hydrated and smooth, where some creams leave my skin feeling dry where I have to use a post shave product. Did not need a balm or lotion with this. Excellent scent also.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for someone else.  he loves this - says it works better than cream.  Cheaper on amazon vs a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. It&#x27;s a super good cream that you can apply with your hands or a brush. I&#x27;m a DE shaver mainly and it works great for me. It&#x27;s a nice upgrade from generic shaving creams/foams/gels you might find at Wal-Mart and for a better price.</li>
    <li> This is a much heavier shave cream than I am used to, meaning it&#x27;s a but creamier and fuller.  Others are a bit more watered down.  This works a nice lather that adheres to your face very well and a little bit goes a long way.  The creaminess also gives you a close shave.  I have particularly sensitive skin and since I have made the switch I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues or irritation at all.  The scent is not noticeable which I also find appealing about this product.  My only gripe about it is that the tube doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Worth a try if you are looking for a new shave cream and have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I came across this and had to try it.  For the cost of one premium shaving cream (full of parabens, no less), I could get several tubes of this. It&#x27;s made in Germany, comes in a sturdy metal tube and has NO harsh chemicals or parabens OR alcohols in it.  Putting a pea-sized amount on a badger brush whips up tons of thick, creamy foam that holds water well and the scent is pretty good.  It&#x27;s a hard scent to describe, but isn&#x27;t floral, isn&#x27;t musky and isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  It kind of smells like old-timey barbershop shaving cream and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a close shave every time and the power of German manufacturing ensures a very consistent product.  I&#x27;ve never had a bad shave with this and I appreciate that the ingredients are gentle.  You can spend a lot more on shaving soaps and gels and get a LOT less than this.  This, Giovanni, and Dermalogica creams are my basic rotation.  I rotate twice and then rest my face for a day.  I&#x27;ve noticed that since adding this to the rotation, I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on the subtle leftover scent from shaving....my girl is really digging the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this gets 5 stars and I can say that I like to buy this 2 or 3 tubes at a time.  Were it ever to be discontinued, I&#x27;d buy a case of 144 and hoard it like gold....</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have sensitive skin. Not a lot of facial hair but very sensitive sking. This product has been great.</li>
    <li> Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Cream is made in Germany of high quality ingredients and is packaged in a metal tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is intended to be applied with a shaving brush and creates a dense foam that works especially well with straight or safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell reminiscent of barber shops and leaves the skin feeling clean and moist.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product!  I have been DE shaving for about a year now and this may be my favorite shave cream.  I have tried TOBS, Cell, Arko, MWF, Proraso, and several others.  I have very hard water and often have a lot of trouble getting a good protective lather.  The Nivea lathers with little to no effort and easily provides me with the slickest shave I have ever had.  I have an extremely dense, bristly beard with very sensitive skin and the Nivea gives me better protection than most of the other more expensive brands I have tried.  Do yourself a favor and try this product.  At such a low price, you have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> This is a gentle skin balm which made me feel quite relieved after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple nicks and often my face feels &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; after shaving and this shaving cream really helps make shaving more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it bvery pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> It took me a little bit to get the correct ratio of water to cream to get the right lather I prefer.  now that I have that established, this works great.  It is a lot less expensive than some of the premium shave creams I have used and works just as well.  I have not had any clogging issues as some have stated.  It also leaves my skin very smooth and clean.  No oily build up or soapy dryness.</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten to try this before I went out and bought another container of Baxter of California Super Close Shave Formula. I reviewed that for Vine previously and was pretty impressed with it. I had seen this Nivea product before and was curious, so getting it through Vine was a good fit. I must say that the 2 products are both good in their own way. The ingredients lists are different. Nivea is half the price and may last me as long. Nivea is lighter than Baxters and does allow you to shave close. I experience very few nicks. Baxters is richer and leaves you face feeling softer because it uses different moisturizers, and maybe because it numbs your face a bit. Both are much better than the cheap stuff and have made me a fan of spending more on shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issues with each is that Baxters takes a little more effort to clean off and, if you get it on your lips, it leaves them a bit numb (mint, I think). Nivea is so slippery, though, that it is hard for me to feel any whiskers I may have missed. It is so slippery my fingers glide right over the rough spots. I have to press a bit to rub away the cream to find the rough spots I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Nivea good, Baxters good, both worth the price, but each have minor issues you learn to live with. I do tell people Baxters makes a great gift because it is in a nice jar, and expensive. Nivea is in a tube and may seem like a lesser gift (it&#x27;s cheaper, too), but, still, I think these premium shaving creams makes great gifts because a lot of guys wouldn&#x27;t spend so much for shaving cream.</li>
    <li> this is imo the best shaving cream on the market. both this and the aftershave balm are great products for men with sensitive skin. 5*</li>
    <li> This is a very thick, rich, and luxurious shaving cream. It’s almost like shaving oil mixed with regular shaving cream but it doesn’t gum up your razor nearly as much as oil will.  It definitely provides more moisturizing than your average cream and allows for a smooth clean shave. I would use it again.</li>
    <li> Someone mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t lather up like regular cream. I could be wrong but it sounds like that person may be comparing apples to oranges. You don&#x27;t use your hands to lather this cream on your face. This type of cream is for wet shavers who apply the cream to their faces with brushes and it lathers exceptionally well. Personally, as far as creams go, I like Proraso better but this one is good and cheap. To paraphrase someone else&#x27;s comment, this is an excellent, hard to get wrong cream for newcomers to wet shaving (and people experienced at it) that really does perform just as well as some of the expensive brands. You won&#x27;t get the great fragrances those brands provide but the fragrances of these creams and soaps go away quickly. I&#x27;d rather pay less here and get the good fragrances in an aftershave. As always, everyone&#x27;s face is different. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wet shaver, using a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]] and usually [[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap]].  This is a good shaving cream, but it does require a brush, which obviously has flummoxed a few people here.  However, with lots of water and a good badger hair brush, this requires no more than a pencil eraser sized drop in the brush for a full three passes (I am clean shaven, and shave both my face and neck every morning).  After three weeks of daily use, the tube is about one-third used up - so this is good for about two and a half months of daily use.  It does not lather very thickly, but does provide sufficient lubrication.  Oddly, it is scented - think of a light citrus - a hint of [[ASIN:B001M9KX78 Ed Hardy Love &amp; Luck]] but diluted.  As pleasant as the scent is, the choice is a little odd considering it is marketed as &#x27;for sensitive skin&#x27;.  Frankly, I&#x27;m getting a little tired of so many grooming products having a scent - even hair gel has perfume in it these days - as though just smelling clean isn&#x27;t enough (and a possible clash with your chosen fragrance as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is encouraging to see a mainstream brand produce a product aimed at wet shavers, though - maybe more men will start to learn the art of using a real blade and brush!  Ironically, this might also be its achilles heel, as evidenced by the reviewers here who claim they need to use such a huge amount (I can&#x27;t even imagine), or decry the necessity of a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this said, it&#x27;s a good product, and I will reconsider it.  Proraso is still my go-to, but this might come in handy for a change once in a while.  With the scent, however, I wouldn&#x27;t take the &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; claim too seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a wet shaver with a brush and blade, and you&#x27;re not afraid to use a little water, it&#x27;s well worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It is August 8, 2014 - and I am just finishing the tube.  So it lasted for about four months and two weeks of daily two-pass shaves.  They could have easily been three pass as there was sufficient cream in the brush after each.  I am definitely reordering this product.  Excellent!ly two-pass shaves.  They could have easily been three pass as there was sufficient cream in the brush after each.  I am definitely reordering this product.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> This product does work very well, but if you truly have sensitive skin ... to scents etc. this very well may irritate.  My skin is very sensitive to scents/chemicals and the cream burned a little but enough.  Otherwise it is great to use with a brush. Just a dab easily produces a lot of lather that is fairly slick.  It is too bad that so many companies feel the need to put fragrance into products that are supposedly for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye the way, this product produced a little lasting burn/irritation.  The Nivea balm for sensitive really irritated my face.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product with a very light scent, but it did not offer me protection from irritation as well as another product I use.  It is also difficult to rinse from the razor.  However, since it is better than your average shaving cream, I would still recommend trying it if you&#x27;re fighting razor burn.  It might work for you!</li>
    <li> Excellent but economical shaving cream. It beats the expensive shaving creams such as Taylor of Bond Street etc.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with their products!</li>
    <li> smooth shaving for electric or reg blade</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but what made me try it was a good deal at rite aid. I got it for a bargain, two bucks.&lt;br /&gt;lathered quite well with my truefitt &amp; hill silver tip brush and lathers just as well with my parker best badger. post shave is nice to no razor burn. ive tried many a soaps and creams, at least 40+ varieties. That being said, this for the price and performance is on my top 5.</li>
    <li> I picked up one of these a few years ago when I was in Europe and used it for about a year. I found this cream to be as good as any famous brands such as truefitt and hill, TOBS, Proraso ets. This shaving cream lasted a bout 1 year with 3 times use per week. The best part about this cream is it&#x27;s rich in Glycerin and very sleek and moisturizing. I have a very sensitive skin and many creams cause skin irritations. But not this cream. Any time I had some break outs I went back to this cream and the break out went away. Recently I saw this on counters in drugstores which is great news so I don&#x27;t have to order it online and don&#x27;t have to pay any more for name brands that don&#x27;t necessarily perform any better.</li>
    <li> I used the whole tube and I didn&#x27;t have a single problem with my skin. And my skin is not easy to work with, however, the biggest problem with this product is the thickness. I used a couple different razors with it and the problem with new age razors is they all have quite a few blades that are very close together so the shaving cream got stuck in between the blades. So if you use a single blade you&#x27;ll probably be fine but it&#x27;s not the most easy to use product out there.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Almost no scent.  Slick and smooth.  Paint it on your face, don&#x27;t swirl.  Zero irritation.  Soothing ingredients.</li>
    <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this item and usually he is a huge fan of Nivea products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice light scent&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive faces&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t dry out his face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;To me his shave wasn&#x27;t any closer than it has been in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Need a shaving brush to apply it&lt;br /&gt;Small tube doesn&#x27;t go far for the price&lt;br /&gt;Very bad build up on razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this item. He may use it again in the future but it&#x27;s not on his must have list.</li>
    <li> The product recommends using a shaving brush - which I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it without a brush, and it&#x27;s not ideal to generate a lather. Then, using it WITH a brush made it easy to generate a very soapy lather, and since I shave my entire head, I need a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any scent at all, which is fine - and my girlfriend who is usually very sensitive to new products didn&#x27;t even mention it. With most new products, she says something immediately. I prefer no scent, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a close shave, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it was shockingly closer than using normal Gillette gel. What was different was how soapy the lather was...a little too soapy and a little too sticky for an easy rinse, but since I&#x27;m using it on my head, there&#x27;s a lot more than just shaving my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My head feels a little dry, but not razor-burned or anything. So I think the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; tag holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my own opinion, I&#x27;d probably go with three stars because it&#x27;s not so memorable I&#x27;d seek it out again - but the product did everything right, so I think four stars is more fair.</li>
    <li> In fairness, I am a soap, lather, and brush double edge shaver. So, I knew going in that the Nivea shave cream wasn&#x27;t going to compete straight up. Instead, I thought to evaluate it as a travel kit shave cream so we&#x27;d be talking apples to apples. And, in that respect, the Nivea held up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as my daily driver (Proraso soft soap). But, it goes on smoothly and offers good coverage and slickness. Also, it balances the wire between offering good protection/slickness AND also rinsing easily from the razor. I haven&#x27;t had any nicks after using it, and candidly, I do like it loads more than the usual shaving creams on the supermarket shelves (especially the ones with propellant). Most appealing, the scent was very pleasant: sort of a lemon, cream, soap, spring day sort of smell. In fact, I much prefer the smell to Nivea&#x27;s sensitive facial wash (which I&#x27;ve also tried). Instead of smelling like cologne, it smells light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as you already know, the Nivea won&#x27;t replace my daily shave soap, BUT I will put it in the dop kit and use it when I travel.</li>
    <li> This cream is very easy to use with a shaving brush and makes an impressively slick lather.  It also has an good ingredient list with few synthetic chemicals and some bonus extracts like chamomile and witch hazel. So it&#x27;s great that a quality product like this is available from a global brand at a bargain price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A committed shaving snob may fault the pedigree, but they cannot argue with the performance of this cream. A novice can make a slicker and more protective lather with this cream than an experienced wet shaver can make with most high-end soaps and creams. This stuff is nearly foolproof. It can handle a lot of water without falling apart. Really the only way to go wrong is to leave it too dry. When in doubt, add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is high in glycerin, which will hold water and provide slickness. Compared to other products, it particularly excels when you want to go back over an area without applying more lather. It leaves plenty of slickness behind. The fragrance is neither exotic nor medicinal. It&#x27;s the kind of scent you&#x27;d expect from a men&#x27;s deodorant stick labeled &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s the same exact fragrance as the popular Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, which I also recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend a lot of money on boutique soaps and creams, or you can use this stuff and probably get a better shave.</li>
    <li> Great sensitive skin cream. With or without a brush it gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s creamy and super slick so my razor just glides along. I use a vibrating razor, and it&#x27;s fantastic with this shave cream. Almost makes me wish I had to shave more often!</li>
    <li> Nice to see this product available in the US as it&#x27;s been a tough one to find. For anyone who is serious about wet shaving, this is an exceptional product for face or bowl lathering - slick, good lather, and easily add more product if it&#x27;s too thin/watery. Good travel soap for me; otherwise at home I&#x27;m using any of the better shaving soaps from RazoRock, Strop Shoppe, Tiki, or countless other artisanal soap makers.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best store bought creams in a tube. There are a few other ones that are also good that i can buy in local stores, but this is one of the best ones.&lt;br /&gt;All those people that gave negative reviews all gave stupid reasons that seemed fabricated. These people either dont know how to use the product or just plain make up stories.&lt;br /&gt;I had to laugh at some of the tales they told about their experiances using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this using my double edge safety razor and a shaving brush with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This is not for electric shavers, so stop giving this product 2 stars if it didnt work with your kiddie shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a mans shaver and a brush and it will work wonderful for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many creams, soaps, sticks and oils - brushable and non-brushable and I must say this is one of them. I&#x27;d use this in a pinch but to me subjectively it seems less lubricatory than some of its upscale brethren.. I put this in my middle of five ters also know as next to the next to the best. I git it for $3,29 on sale at local supermarket and will keep well enough to use as a backup or on a short trip where size does matter.</li>
    <li> I got this to travel since the TSA doesn&#x27;t like aerosol cans on the plane. It is more of a cream than a gel, and is adequate at best. Shave gel is much better.</li>
    <li> Great Shave Cream! This is a traditional shave cream so you will need a shaving brush of some kind. I have been wet shaving for some time now and take this with me when I travel. A little dab goes a long way. The Scent is nice and not overpowering. It works in hard water as well as soft water. It gives rich, thick and slick lather. I will buy it again when I run out. The price is nice as well anything in the $2 to $4 price range per ounce is good and this is about a dollar per ounce.</li>
    <li> Sensitive shaving cream nivea is special. An exceptional product for lovers of classic shaving, has the 3 E: ecological, economic and special.</li>
    <li> impossible to find; great product at perfect price point. hope they keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> I tried this sensitive shave cream for awhile and it&#x27;s just not for me. It&#x27;s ok but there are a couple of negatives that drag it down. First, it&#x27;s simply hard to apply. I know the directions say use a brush but I don&#x27;t have a brush so used my hand. It didn&#x27;t go well. It went on uneven and without a lot of evenness. That caused the shave to just be so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a brush - they&#x27;re kinda expensive - then go for it. I think some reviewers say it applies better with a brush. Otherwise, i would think there are better creams out there for men.</li>
    <li> I have used countless different Italian soaps and creams to D.E. shave with and this is my favorite.  It has a light scent that is not overpowering, just enough so you know it is there.  I use a Plisson brush with it and it creates a great lather and agrees with my skin better than some of the Proraso creams I have used.  I would highly recommend trying this, you really can&#x27;t lose at this price.</li>
    <li> Happy to find this product</li>
    <li> Very nice shave cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Have only tried a couple of different creams, but really like the way this feels and I get a nice shave.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re supposed to lather it with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this is as good as any cream I&#x27;ve ever tried and it&#x27;s half the price of most.  This stuff is a solid buy.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this would be something that you spread on your face, like shaving cream...it&#x27;s actually a paste-like product that you&#x27;re supposed to lather up and apply with a shaving brush. Does anyone even make shaving brushes anymore...? My grandfather used to have one...that was the last one I ever saw, and that was about 35 years ago. I&#x27;m not inclined to either search out or buy a shaving brush, so...strike one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put some in my hands, wet it a little, and rubbed it into my face like a madman. It kind of foams up, so I started shaving. The first few times I used it, it felt like it was actually burning off layers of skin as I shaved, for some reason. My face was really raw and sensitive for the next couple of days. After that I stopped using it. Also, this stuff gets between the blades like glue, and it&#x27;s tough to get out...gummed-up blades while you&#x27;re shaving are not fun. I wasted a ton of water ungunking the blades after every swipe of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After running out of shaving cream the other day, I was forced, against my will, to use this odd product again....it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin as much these last few times, and it did give me a close shave...although, if I wasn&#x27;t careful to constantly ungunk the blades, I would end up getting cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like I said, this is an odd, outdated product...I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of this tube but I can&#x27;t see actually buying more. I&#x27;d love to see Nivea make an actual shaving cream that wasn&#x27;t in a paste form.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of how much I like the nivea sensitive after shave balm.  This cream doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It softens my whiskers much better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried previously. (I&#x27;m a hard soap guy mostly)  It smells incredible and has a wonderful post shave feel.  These tubes last for quite a while too...probably 2-3 times as long as canned goo.  Now that I have a small stockpile, I found out this product is sold a my local Safeway store for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have used the sensitive aftershave balm for years and the tube was small enough to carry on when I fly. But I don&#x27;t have a shave brush. The hand lather was pitiful, and the cream goes on sticky. I use a straight razor, but it felt like shaving with a chainsaw. My regular shave gel (Aveno sensitive) blows this garbage out of the water. If you have extra sensitive skin, do yourself a favor. Skip this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about  a year now.  I really like it.  I squeeze it right onto my shaving brush and work up a lather on my face.  It works great, providing moisture and a slick shave without drying my face.  It lasts a long time and it travels well. I see no reason to switch to any other product.</li>
    <li> Great, great, great shaving cream! Just a small dollop on the shaving brush and you&#x27;re good to go. Extremely gentle on the skin, rinses clean and clear. Even packaged in an old-school aluminum tube &#x3D; recycling friendly.</li>
    <li> Thought Id like it better. I use Nivea shave balm so I thought this would be the best cream. Its good but not great, Im a little disappointed  in the lathering process doesn&#x27;t seem to create a lot of lather with my badger brush .Still searching for the best cream. I have to try Proraso  Update. 5 months later. I was a bit harsh on this review. I do get a very nice shave from Nivea. It has no fragrance that can discern. I did try Proraso and it&#x27;s no better or worse. My favorite is still TOBS</li>
    <li> One of my very favorite shaving creams, always dependable for a soothing balm and great lather, I also love the price</li>
    <li> I really like this. I&#x27;ve always been a spray can shave guy, and only flirted with various gels. This is a very good choice for shaving, and much, much more compact for travel than big cans. Better still it rinses clean faster than most shave products.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I used Nivea products, but then slowly migrated to Gillette products.  Then I tried Proraso cream, Van Der Hagen soap, and Barbasol foam.  In my opinion, all of those perform very similarly.  The nicks/cuts depend on the razor and how accurately you use it.  For example, with a new double edge razor I get a clean shave with minimum of nicks and cuts, bit as the razor dulls, the occurence of nicks and cuts increases as expected.  Either product performed the same when I tried them with rotary or linear electric razors.  I like Nivea&#x27;s marketing presentation, but I think this shaving cream is too expensive for the same or marginally better performance than the one cheaper products offer.</li>
    <li> This tube of shaving cream is only 3.5 ounces and can last you about 3-4 weeks.  It doesn’t’ lather up like regular shaving cream, but it does give you an even distribution of velvety cream with a ton of ingredients, the most obvious being Witch Hazel and Glycerin.  I had to let it sit on my face for a few hot steamy minutes before I trudged along with my razor.  It is smooth and after shaving, my face does feel tingly and better.  Having had a persistent rash on one side of my face from sun damage, this cream helps me shave over that so I don’t develop raw skin.  The fragrance is very minimal.  For the price, this is far above the rest of the standard shaving creams available.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and so we were looking forward to trying this cream, but the simple truth is that we will not be buying it. It just wasn&#x27;t as good as what we normally use. He doesn&#x27;t use a brush, so maybe that&#x27;s why it just didn&#x27;t make up a good lather, either. He did think it made shaving easier and gave him a very pleasingly close shave. It rinses off well and didn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all, and we both liked its scent. But that said, it dried his skin out considerably and that dryness didn&#x27;t go away during the day. He ended up having to use moisturizer/lotion on his face after using this cream, which is something he never had to do before and something he doesn&#x27;t like to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He liked the closeness of the shave he got with this cream, but the way his skin felt afterwards was just so dry and unpleasant that he didn&#x27;t want to use it more than a few times to test it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving soap/cream and a brush for a few years now, and have been particularly impressed with [[ASIN:B00837ZOI0 Proraso]] and [[ASIN:B000JXU4PY Omega]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m always on the lookout for other brands to try. The first thing I notice about this shave cream is the consistency. It seems more whipped and fluffy than my regular brands and very similar to the [[ASIN:B0061KU8W8 Baxter]] shave cream I tested last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the shave cream directly to a shaving brush (as directed) and applying to my face does not result in the kind of lather I&#x27;m used to from a brush. Much like the Baxter, this more or less smears a thin layer of cream on your face. Applying directly with your fingers (also as directed) produces approximately the same result. I even tried adding some to a shaving bowl like I do my regular shave cream, but the cream never really whipped into a lather. I still have to use approximately 3 times as much to lather my face that I do with my regular brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the cream reminds me of a 1960s barbershop. It&#x27;s not an offensive fragrance, but I prefer something a bit more neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get done with my shower, shaving, and the rest of my daily routine, I don&#x27;t want to smell like anything. Whether it&#x27;s from my shower gel, deodorant, shampoo, shaving cream, or anything else, when I leave the bathroom I would prefer to not have any lingering fragrances. The one left behind from this shave cream not only leaves the bathroom with me, but announces the whole world, \\&quot;HE&#x27;S JUST AROUND THE CORNER!\\&quot; And that fragrance is long-lasting. I could still smell it the next morning. This alone is enough for me to not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it shave? IMO, MEH! I used this as I normally do, with my Schick Quattro razor or my [[ASIN:B006W2SYHG Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch Electric Razor]]. I didn&#x27;t think it shaves as closely or as cleanly as my regular brands. It seemed to tend to clog the razor and was difficult to rinse out from both the shaver and the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream doesn&#x27;t lather well, clogs the razor, doesn&#x27;t shave is closely, and has a fragrance that won&#x27;t quit. I will definitely pass on this one.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, you NEED a brush to use this stuff properly. Since Nivea is such a big company, this cream is sort of a cross-over product that is purchased by people who use traditional safety razors/straight razors, but also people who use modern cartridge razors. I hate cartridge razors, but this cream + a shaving brush may improve your experience. Brushes do not have to be expensive, if you get boar hair brush by [[ASIN:B003BWNR9A Omega]] or [[ASIN:B004OJQC0U Semogue]] -- both brands are very popular amongst us shaving geeks. Cheap boar brushes are way better than cheap badger brushes.     This is my first shaving cream. I have plenty of soaps (Razorock, Rustic Soaps, Stirling, [[ASIN:B00997FR44 Arko]], etc) but I wanted to try a cream because they seem like a great way to save time and perhaps even get other people into traditional wet shaving. I went with Nivea because I love their balm and I didn&#x27;t enjoy Proraso&#x27;s shave soap. There&#x27;s honestly no reason for me to try Proraso&#x27;s cream now. This Nivea is very surprising. It lathers very very quickly and easily (as you might expect), but the real surprise is in the slickness and protection. It&#x27;s not as slick as Stirling or other artisan soaps, but it&#x27;s more than slick enough to protect your skin. Great for traveling (if you&#x27;re not flying... I use Arko for that), and great when you&#x27;re in a rush.    I particularly recommend this to people using regular cartridge razors (Mach3, Fusion, etc). I hope that it will make your current equipment work better for you, but more than that I hope it will make you consider picking up a double edge safety razor. If you&#x27;re comfortable lathering this stuff directly on your face, then all you need is a safety razor and a sample pack of blades (a variety of brands... everyone&#x27;s skin agrees with certain blades differently) to give double edge shaving a try. I would recommend the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]] (aka Merkur 180/23C), the [[ASIN:B003LW4L2W Edwin Jagger DE89bl]], and if you&#x27;re on a tighter budget there&#x27;s the [[ASIN:B001D4Z87W Weishi 9306-F]], which I use as my travel razor. Any of those razors would combine with this cream and a boar brush to treat your skin MUCH better than cartridge razors ever did, and once you find what brand of blade works for you it should be easy to find them for $0.10 - $0.25 per blade right here on Amazon. In the words of Obi Wan Kenobi: \\&quot;You&#x27;ve taken your first step into a larger world.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I object to the use of non-recyclable pressurized cans for something as mundane as shaving. With this Nivea product and an inexpensive brush, my daily shave is inexpensive, green and luxurious.</li>
    <li> Very good but hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. This would be a good value at double the price. I like Nivea products, especially the ones that you can get overseas which are of a higher quality usually. This shaving cream is only found online and I would throw it in your cart, the next chance you get if you are a wet shaver. You can&#x27;t go wrong. It performs as well as any cream that comes out of a tube and better than anything that comes out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use a traditional cream, then this is a great way to get your feet wet. It is easy to lather, which makes it good for beginners. inexpensive, and produces great results when used with a shave brush. Just pust and almond size dollop on a wet shaving brush and 90 seconds later you have something far superior to anything you can get at your local pharmacy or megastore. Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have that slight medicinal nivea smell that I am not crazy about. But that is the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for the price. It creates a wonderful face lather with my boar brushes, and combined with the matching post shave balm it leaves you smelling and feeling great. It&#x27;s right up there with other expensive, artisan creams. Nice and hydrating, and give a super slick shave with the right blade and DE razor.  This is my go-to shaving cream for traveling, as it never lets me down for a great shave. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> Easy to lather.  Smooth shave.  Smells great.  Really low price.  What&#x27;s not to love?  I think some early reviewers  who didn&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t use a shave brush.  It works great with a brush.  Great lather.  Not enough slickness.</li>
    <li> The one thing I did like about this Nivea shave cream was that it left my skin feeling refreshed when I was finished shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, here are three BIG problems with the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shave I got from the Nivea cream was less close than with the generic shaving cream I had been using before this.  I had to go over my face again with my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a large quantity of Nivea shave cream for a single shave.  It comes in a toothpaste-like tube, and I had to squeeze out more than a dozen inch-long squirts of cream before I was done -- just for one shave of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Nivea cream uses some kind of sticky substance to help the cream bind to your skin as you massage it in, presumably designed to yield a closer shave.  Not only did it fail on that count, but the sticky stuff also made it bind to the razor blades as well, to the point where it was much harder to wash off than regular shaving cream.  PLUS, it stuck to my wash cloth and towel!  This problem #3 was the worst one of all, and was what made me throw the Nivea shave cream away after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - When I first removed the cap, I noticed there was no safety seal of any kind over the tube opening.  I don&#x27;t know the rules for this (FDA?), but I think there should be a seal.</li>
    <li> NOTE: This is an update a year and one half later....Today I dropped the star rating to ONE stars.  This stuff is just not worthy of consideration.  I had bought 3 tubes of it after thinking that I would like it based on the free sample I got.  Today I threw out two full tubes of it because it is difficult to use, causes severe razor burn unless it is so thinned out that the stuff streams down one&#x27;s neck and face, and it clogs up the razor so that I finally took to scrubbing with a toothbrush to get the embedded hairs and thick paste out of the crevices so that I could actually shave myself.  Terrible product.  A complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff because of its novelty.  It smells funny, looks cool, has a strange presentation and is quite different from other shaving lubricants I had encountered.  After initially liking the stuff, I bought four tubes thinking that I would use it regularly if infrequently primarily because of its relative difficulty of use compared to the Col. Conk&#x27;s shave soaps I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found after multiple uses is that it isn&#x27;t a very good shave cream.  It&#x27;s problem is that if it is beat into a lather that goes on easily to the face, the film is too thin to adequately lubricate the razor resulting in razor burn.  If, on the other hand, it is put on per instructions, it goes on so thickly that it is difficult to wash off (we have soft water) and clogs the gap between my double razors, AND I still get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through two tubes now and I rarely, rarely use it and am unhappy with it when I do.  The smell, the look and the unusual dispenser are no longer a draw as they are outweighed by the inferior shave this cream provides.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended, except that it might be good as a travel tube or emergency supply because of the robustness of the metal tube which promises to safely store this stuff indefinitely.as thickly one&#x27;s skin is not left feeling quite as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I really like the way this stuff make my face smooth after using it.  I can even put up with the smell for that close, smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is all of the extra water usage necessary for thorough clean up.  Having said that the more I use it, the more I like it. It remains to be seen if I&#x27;ll continue to use it once the novelty has worn off.</li>
    <li> I tried this out a few days ago. It was not a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream looks and feels a lot like Noxzema when it comes out the tube. Kind of odd to me for a shave cream, but I went ahead and shaved with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is that the cream dried out VERY quickly once on my face and then it was impossible to shave unless I rewet the area I was working on. Note that I had wet my face very well before applying the cream to it. Had to rewet the cream on my face over and over. Even then, the blade did not slide over the cream very well most of the time. I cut myself worse than when I shaved the first time almost 40 years ago. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the cream was shaved off, it left a residue of sorts that had to be scrubbed off. I did not care for the scent all that much, and it stuck around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a close shave with this stuff - that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star - but it takes a real effort and you have to be careful or there is a danger of getting bad nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this product, will not use it again and don&#x27;t recommend it to others. I have used Edge for years and like it and will be using that for my next shave.</li>
    <li> I struggle with dry skin throughout the year.  It&#x27;s severity changes with the seasons.  I also have very sensitive skin (specifically on my neck) and I welcome any chance to try out a new shave cream that heralds itself as &amp;#34;for sensitive skin.&amp;#34;  Nivea has always been well regarded in my household, so I expected nothing short of wonderful when I picked up this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the tube of this shave cream, I noticed a very light scent.  When I squirted it out on my hand, it instantly reminded me of other cold cream-like shaving creams.  I rubbed it on my face and commenced to shave.  It was very nice.  Not only did it give me a very close shave, it left my face feeling smooth and soft.  My skin wasn&#x27;t dry, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used properly, it doesn&#x27;t take much cream to cover your face.  I do recommend using a brush (which can be picked up anywhere from pharmacies to department stores), but it isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d give Nivea Sensitive Shave Cream five stars.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply. The directions say to use a brush but it isn&#x27;t necessary--you can work up enough lather with your hands. It also lathers very easily and covers your entire face no problem with a small amount. The scent is clean and pleasing. The witch hazel adds a nice tingle. I currently use it with a wet/dry razor and it doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely gets five stars because the closest I&#x27;ve come to the same quality item is a $15 shave cream at Bath &amp; Body Works. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this.</li>
    <li> i was a bit skeptical about this product, and you may not like it so much if you simply squeeze the tube then rub the cream on your face to shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the secret is to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. wet your face&lt;br /&gt;2. dab a pea-sized squeeze onto a wet badger brush softened in hot water&lt;br /&gt;3. lather on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll find that this cream provides a hot, soapy shave that is equal to a quality shaving soap! and considering the amount of shave cream in the tube, there is enough to last for more than half a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very economical, a nice lather, a smooth shave and nice finish w/no abrasion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I switched to a safety razor about a year ago and spent most of that time finding the right blades and shaving cream that gave me the best shave possible.  I have found that the feather blased and (don&#x27;t laugh) Shave Secret shave oil gives me the most consistent shave without irritation or cuts.  However, I find that the closeness of the shave isn;t as good as when I sue a shave cream.  I have tried everything from cheap creams to expensive creams so I feel I have a good base for comparison when looking at the Nivea shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with the cream resulted in a very close shave but some irriation around my neck.  Nothing as bad as some of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried however and my Nivea after shave balm seemd to help a lot.  I tried this for a few more days with my safety razor befre deciding to try my old Gillette Fusion razor to get a good comparison.  With the Fusion, the shave was much more comfortable with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have tried it with a Mach 3, and  a Dorko 6 blade razor (same razor that a lot of people overpay for through that shave club for men website).  The Mach 3 was a bit of a challenge on my face but the Dorko did fine.  However, I find the safety razor method still gives me the best results when I shave to I have moved back to the feather/shave secret combo for most of my shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if I am in a hurry and need to shave quickly, I do use the Nivea with the Dorko razor as it gives me great results.  When compared to other creams I have when doing teh quick shave, the Nivea one is top of the bunch.  And considering it costs $20 less than a lot of them, that is saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing I;ve found about this cream (and with most I have) is a little goes a long way.  When applied with a brush, I can easily reaaply to my face 4 or 5 times during the shave if needed.  And that is with only using a half inch to three qaurter inch amount.  This tube will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried soap, aerosol foam and lotion for shaving.  Soap is the least convenient but cheapest.  Foam is the messiest.  Lotions suit me best I think, but tend to be expensive.  This is a paste or cream, very like toothpaste in appearance and texture, and comes in a toothpaste-like tube.  The tube is better than an aerosol can, which can leave those nasty rust rings.  The paste works very well if you simply smooth it on, but you can lather it up with some water if you really want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a particularly good product for travelling, the tube being small and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a smooth, moistened feel and a light, pleasant scent.  Which is what you&#x27;d expect from a Nivea product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price too, as it goes a long way.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had such sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve endured decades of trial and error, things that worked for a while and then stopped being as effective, combinations of razor and cream or gel that worked best, and mini-crises that emerged when I went traveling and forgot to bring part of my shaving arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I&#x27;ve moved from razor to rotary electric shaver, and I shave over an application of a lubricating cream or gel. My favorite has been:  [[ASIN:B007KE40EQ AHAVA Time to Energize Foam-Free Shaving Cream for Men, 6.8 fl. oz.]] But it&#x27;s really expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, although I do normally use the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D electric rotary shaver, I do sometimes use a triple-blade razor, so this review can apply equally well regardless of the shaving method you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Nivea cream to try a cheaper alternative to the Ahava. It&#x27;s a very thick cream when you squeeze it out of the tube. It almost reminded me of the Balmex cream we used to use when our kids had diaper rash. Since it squeezed out so thick, I tried starting with just a little dab, about the size of a pea (a full-sized pea, not a Le Suere baby-sized pea!). And that&#x27;s not very big. I applied it to my wet beard, and I found I could spread that amount thinly over the entire shaving area. A little bit went a long way. With a thick cream like this--or any cream, even the Ahava--I find that a thin coat works just as well as a thick coat, plus it allows you to see more of what you&#x27;re doing to your face and helps you avoid nicks and scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shave went smoothly over the cream and cleaned out easily from my shaver. I got a clean, close shave, and absolutely no irritation. The next week, I tried a Gillette Fusion ProGlide, and it worked just as well. Great shave and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service, A+++!</li>
    <li> For years, I have used a Nivea product sold in Canada and Europe that is a similar formula. That one has fewer moisturizers and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as well, but it&#x27;s been my favorite shave creme for about ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product shaves even better, and leaves the face feeling nicely moisturized. However, I don&#x27;t know why manufacturers think all men want everything they use to smell like a house of ill-repute. When I shave with this product, there is a strong, lingering scent for hours afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really the only flaw in this product, but it&#x27;s enough to get me to use something else. Besides the foreign Nivea version that doesn&#x27;t have the strong scent, I have also used and like &amp;#34;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream&amp;#34;, which has a similar formulation and is a bit better for shaving. It has a mild, lemony scent that I can stand, so when I can&#x27;t get my foreign Nivea product, I use the Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others such as &amp;#34;Neutrogena Skin Cleaning Shave Cream&amp;#34;, and they&#x27;re OK, but they are too gel-like for my taste and don&#x27;t seem to soften the whiskers as well. So this product will be my #3 choice after the foreign version and the Cremo - unless they someday remove the eye-burning scent, and then it will move to #1.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to shaving with a DE safety razor and thought I would try this shaving cream out. Take my advice: use a brush to work up it up into a lather. If you try to spread it on with your hands, it applies TOO THICK (like a paste) and makes things difficult. If you do it right with a brush, it applies with with a nice combo of lather/cream that works really well and makes shaving a smooth experience with a nice smell. Compared with other low-cost similar products like the Proraso brand or the Old Spice cream made in India, it really holds up well. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It has a gentle scent and a pearly white color. I do a 3 pass shave and I only need a fingertip size dollop for the whole job. I squeeze it directly into my boar brush and lather up in my hand. In between each pass I very quickly pass the brush through the dripping faucet to add a little moisture. I get a really close shave with this product. I prefer a slightly wet shave, so you&#x27;ll have to experiment with this cream to find what works best for you.</li>
    <li> This is very nice cream.  Lathers well in a bowl and on face.  I was impressed when I was in a hurry and latherd on my face.  Faster and nice slick surface.  I had no irritation with different blades.</li>
    <li> Dedicated wet shaver here so know that going into this review of this wonderful shaving cream. I use vintage Gillettes and Semogue badger and boar brushes. I make lathers from soaps as well as creams and have tried the lion&#x27;s share of what is available on line. I am always looking for local product and found this in a Rite Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a small dollop of this Nivea cream in my pewter lather bowl and attacked it with a well soaked Semogue 740 badger brush. I did find this cream to be a &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; cream in that it takes quite a bit of water added to get that whipped cream consistency that I like to produce. But once that water to product ratio is found, this cream takes on a yogurt/whipped cream consistency that gives one a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lathered up and found that it doesn&#x27;t dry on the skin while shaving like some creams/soaps can. The scent is a chamomile scent that is light and refreshing.....very European scent...which stands to reason as this cream is manufactured in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very slick cream....very little razor drag while completing my passes. Lots of cushioning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans off the face with a few splashes of cold water and cleaned out of my brush and Gillette Fatboy with simple rinses. I followed up with a splash of Aqua Velva which I found compliments the scent of the cream well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I type this, my face feels extremely smooth....what we in the wet shaving game call BBS....and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good cream.....for those of us that take the time to do the job right. I would imagine that the performance is less than stellar if you merely slather this on your beard straight from the tube as it is a very thirsty cream. That is why they call it wet shaving. Water is key. Water is your friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when water meets this cream, and it whipped up right.......results are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
    <li> Been waiting for this to come to America for a decade. Best non-foaming shave cream available. Inexpensive, effective, tube is TSA legal (unless the officer doesn&#x27;t know that 99mg &amp;#60; 100ml and 100ml (not 3oz) is the actual limit.</li>
    <li> The ingredient list for a mass produced non-artisanal product is amazing. Great scent, great slickness and amazing lather!&lt;br /&gt;Nivea has really &amp;#34;done it right&amp;#34; with this shaving cream. A shaving brush is recommended to build the proper lather but I&#x27;ve had great shaves without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely pick this up, your face will thank you for it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving cream I have.</li>
    <li> used daily, does as promised, and smells great too</li>
    <li> Helps get a good shave with light scent</li>
    <li> the product smells nice but later i found out it can make your brush waterproof with a certain chemical in it.</li>
    <li> A little thicker than what I buy off the shelf in Canada.  Great lubrication for both head and face.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great at achieving a closer shave but It left parts of my skin severely dry. This might be a reaction to one of the ingredients. But hey, it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> The lather was odd to me, but my main hang-up was that the cream stuck to the razor blade to the point where I had to manually clean it off every time after I made a pass.</li>
