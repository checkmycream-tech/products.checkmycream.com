### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>There&#x27;s excellent videos on youtube to teach you how to do this.</li>
      <li>When I want to look my best, I use this as part of my makeup application.</li>
      <li>and I’m impressed with how well it blends the liquid foundation without any streaks,</li>
      <li>I use a cream foundation, which is perfect for this sponge.</li>
      <li>And the price is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>It blends the foundation perfectly!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shape makes it perfect for applying and blending foundations, liquid or crime blushes or sparkly highlights.</li>
      <li>think this is a very good value at an affordable price for what you get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blown away by what a great job this sponge does in evenly spreading foundation and getting it neatly in all the corners and edges.</li>
      <li>I can say I was really happy with the way it made my make up look.  </li>
      <li>and I was happy with the result.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great at helping to blend</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this product would have been a great deal.</li>
      <li>and the makeup applies so very nicely and evenly.</li>
      <li>, the cone shape at the top is perfect for around your eyes and mouth.  </li>
      <li>It allows for precision application, just as good as with a foundation brush.</li>
      <li>Its a treat to use and does a good job.</li>
      <li>The BB is great at that, but if you have more to cover, it can be time consuming (and sometimes you just want to get your makeup done and get out the door!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When damp, I found it created light, flawless coverage and my makeup looked better than when I use a foundation</li>
      <li>Well, if you need more foundation to solve your skin issues, the UBU does a good job of making heavier coverage</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes for a nice even coating without rubbing off.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Take a loving hold of her waist,</li>
      <li>It may just be with the kind of makeup I use.  </li>
      <li>It provides a nice even coverage.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a sponge I liked -</li>
      <li>I feel like my make up came out well blended and looked really nice.</li>
      <li>skin is fairly good, so the BB is more my speed.</li>
      <li>It really makes my skin look flawless and gives the look that I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.  </li>
      <li>The neat shape is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>I am able to apply just as quickly and with just as good results.</li>
      <li>To get my best results I apply primer, under eye concealer, then use UBU Blender when slightly damp and my foundation looks good</li>
      <li>The sponge works perfected for this application - so much better than the brush that I had attempted to use before.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually really happy with how I&#x27;m able to blend with just my fingers at this point, but wanted to see if I could get an even nicer finish without too much effort or time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>The plastic bag it comes in also has a resealable ziploc at the top</li>
      <li>I think I still need more practice</li>
      <li>If you love applying your foundation with a Beauty Blender and you&#x27;re looking for a lower cost alternative, keep looking.</li>
      <li>I love the contour of this foundation sponge.  </li>
      <li>but I actually love it.  </li>
      <li>This blender foundation sponge is fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t absorb the foundation and blends it amazingly.</li>
      <li>Even better, my fingers don&#x27;t end up with tinted moisturizer all over them in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>I am not the most refined at my beauty routine and, for many years, have used my fingers to apply foundation.</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to try this out.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this makeup sponge</li>
      <li>I would buy more of these.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also latex free!</li>
      <li>but are they trying to make a sponge seem sexy?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for wiping off stray eyeshadow at the corners of my eyes without removing too much.</li>
      <li>Beauty Blender works at giving a light finish, which is great if you haven&#x27;t that much to cover up.</li>
      <li>The pointy tip is good for application around the eyes (without accidentally poking myself), and the bottom part of the sponge is great for wide swaths like cheeks, t-zone and forehead.</li>
      <li>If your skin is less than perfect and requires more work, you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot more work with a Beauty Blender to get the level of coverage</li>
      <li>This sponge is much more dense and fine textured.</li>
      <li>It is quite large, about the size of an egg with an ergonomic shape that allows you to use a variety of angles and also maintain a good grip.</li>
      <li>it spread smoothly and evenly and I was able to put on a heavier layer of foundation when I tried it out.  </li>
      <li>My skin isn’t the best, so I need a little more coverage.</li>
      <li>I was able to achieve a smooth, light application that wasn&#x27;t blotchy or cakey.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of in depth reviews by people obviously more experienced at applying makeup than me, so I&#x27;m keeping this short.</li>
      <li>I really loved this sponge and would say that it is definitely comparable to the beauty blender and that it did a nice job evenly spreading my makeup.</li>
      <li>It washes up easily and does such a great job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Previously, I was using cheap make-up sponges from the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll admit that I was feeling too cheap for something</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb your makeup, or water so it does take a bit of scrubbing lightly to get the makeup off afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I primarily use this sponge for concealer application</li>
      <li>It allows me to get close and be precise without sticking myself in the eye.</li>
      <li>The texture is so smooth that it can not quite be described, but I now think of this as a must-have item in my makeup kit</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend those that are looking for a great sponge to blend your foundation</li>
      <li>It is latex free for those who have an allergy to latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love that the little point gets right up to the eye and blends perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Found a new product that i love!</li>
      <li>After some trial and error I&#x27;ve settled on the new routine of applying the foundation with my finger tip and as a last step using the Blender Baby to remove the streaks and give the foundation a perfect finish.</li>
      <li>From my wife:  Upon opening, it had a nice soft feel of a quality sponge, but it had a strong chemical smell as well.</li>
      <li>You can use the point to get into creases around nose, eyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up easily and stays fresh smelling</li>
      <li>It is very soft and seems to glide across the skin so nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars as its unique (to me), but I can&#x27;t get a good application with it and the red dye basically creeps me out.</li>
      <li>But, it is rather large to get into corners or around the eyes; a narrower top and tip would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a good job of applying foundation, but it goes on more thickly and covers more.</li>
      <li>The indented section in the middle is a good place to hold it.  </li>
      <li>but I like it damp better because it doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup as much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both damp and dry and have had good results both times obtaining the streak-free, well blended light coverage that I like (although there was no miracle level results with the application).  </li>
      <li>For larger areas, like my forehead, I used the opposite end and get perfect coverage.</li>
      <li>The material of this sponge is made to last through many, many uses.</li>
      <li>If you need a more complete foundation coverage, the UBU may well fit your needs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m editing my review because I apparently didn&#x27;t give a very good enough review for someone.</li>
      <li>so it could be my technique, but I just don&#x27;t feel motivated to perfect the use of this sponge given that I can&#x27;t get past the idea that the red dye leaching out may be harmful and my stippler brush works better for me.</li>
      <li>The teardrop shape is useful around the nose, chin and eyes but could be a little more pointy to be truly effective around</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s latex free, and the shape of it works really well for foundation.</li>
      <li>I did notice that it does &amp;#34;swell&amp;#34; after many uses, as it retains foundation, just like with the old wedges.</li>
      <li>look more natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
      <li>So I was intrigued at this UBU Blender Baby and thought it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer rightly noted, this is made in China ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft to the touch when wet and latex free, which I guess is good if you have latex allergy.</li>
      <li>I was unable to get that kind of good heavier to lighter coverage with this</li>
      <li>For blending, it is not bad, and worked little better than cheap wedge shapes.</li>
      <li>the wedge ones felt wasteful because they absorbed so much foundation, and when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t look quite right because it always felt so clunky.</li>
      <li>this is streaky and far from precise.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m blown away by what a great job this sponge does in evenly spreading foundation and getting it neatly in all the corners and edges. I&#x27;ve used the drugstore sponges for years and much of the foundation gets left on the sponge - not the case with the UBU Blender sponge. It washes up easily and does such a great job. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I like this makeup sponge, but I wish it had a slightly different shape.  The tapered end is a little too blunt to use effectively around eyes and nose.  Even so, it&#x27;s a functional shape.  The instructions say to use it slightly damp and that does help (I use BB cream) with better blending.  It is easy to clean.  It even comes with a ziplock type pouch in case you want to separate it when you pack up your makeup.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife who has been using drugstore/disposal wedges for years.  She said this blows those out of the water.  For references, the ones she’s used have been purchased from CVS and Walgreens, usually.  This sponge contours easily to her face and lets her get those difficult places using the pointy tip.  I’ve already purchased a few extra for her.</li>
    <li> This sponge is shaped sort of like a weeble with a pointed hat, only all red and spongy. Before you use it the first time, wet it and squeeze out the excess water, then let dry. I pressed mine between paper towels to get out the water then wrapped it in a dry paper towel and let dry for 24 hours. It comes out softer then when it&#x27;s new. Don&#x27;t wet it when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold the pointy end between your fingers and roll the round end in foundation and pat on your face. I use a cream foundation, which is perfect for this sponge. Flip the sponge over and use the pointy end to get in the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes for a nice even coating without rubbing off.  I&#x27;ve used sea sponges for years that take make-up away with it, but this doesn&#x27;t absorb the make-up, which means you get it on your face where you want it. This sponge is so much better than the flat sponge that comes with the makeup.  I probably won&#x27;t ever use anything different now that I&#x27;ve tried this.</li>
    <li> I love the contour of this foundation sponge.  It allows the foundation to be smoothed on very well in the corners of your eyes and nose area. It&#x27;s not cushiony soft, it is firm and doesn&#x27;t quickly absorb the make up product. Definite plus for my make up bag. It&#x27;s also latex free!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this makeup sponge but I actually love it.  It does swell up when wet but dries back to original size.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb your makeup, or water so it does take a bit of scrubbing lightly to get the makeup off afterwards.  It does work really well, the cone shape at the top is perfect for around your eyes and mouth.  I really like it so far, my make up looks so much smoother and even than when I use my fingers or those white triangle type sponges to apply.</li>
    <li> Wow, who would have thought a little sponge would make this much of a makeup difference?  It really makes my skin look flawless and gives the look that I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.  Even better, my fingers don&#x27;t end up with tinted moisturizer all over them in the mornings.  Love that the little point gets right up to the eye and blends perfectly.  A+++</li>
    <li> This is not quite as firm as the Sonya Kashuk blender from Target, but is much firmer than the BeautyBlender that I normally prefer. It lasts longer without pilling than the BeautyBlender and is cheaper to boot. I would buy more of these. I do like how soft the BeautyBlender is, but I go through them a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to wet this, squeeze it out in a towel, and use it damp to apply foundation with a dabbing motion. You can use the point to get into creases around nose, eyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up easily and stays fresh smelling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this Blender Baby Sponge a few times and I’m impressed with how well it blends the liquid foundation without any streaks, but I found that it spreads the foundation a little too thin for my needs.  My skin isn’t the best, so I need a little more coverage. After some trial and error I&#x27;ve settled on the new routine of applying the foundation with my finger tip and as a last step using the Blender Baby to remove the streaks and give the foundation a perfect finish.</li>
    <li> I must admit it, I was somewhat skeptical about this sponge.  I thought a sponge was a sponge was a sponge and what could be so different about this one?  Well, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I was using cheap make-up sponges from the drugstore.  They seemed to work okay.  Then I tried the UBU Baby Blender sponge and wow, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* My foundation just glides on and seems much smoother on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The neat shape is very comfortable to hold.  My old sponges were these triangular thingies and it was hard to figure out exactly where to put the foundation so that I could evenly apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s fun to use.  Putting on make-up can be a chore, but with this cute little item, it&#x27;s fun.  The red color and unusual shape stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a moderately priced sponge for your make-up application, you may just like this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used one of these types of sponges. I have been using a foundation brush for years. Prior to that I had always used the old school wedges. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this sponge, but it actually works really well. It allows for precision application, just as good as with a foundation brush. I am able to apply just as quickly and with just as good results. It is very soft and seems to glide across the skin so nicely. The pointed end allows you to get up really close to the lash line, as well as in creases of the nose etc. For larger areas, like my forehead, I used the opposite end and get perfect coverage. There really is no streaking at all and the makeup applies so very nicely and evenly. I may just give up my foundation brush after using this sponge. I really like it! It has no funky smell and no latex. It can be washed and reused as needed. I did notice that it does &amp;#34;swell&amp;#34; after many uses, as it retains foundation, just like with the old wedges. The material of this sponge is made to last through many, many uses. It is not going to fall apart or deteriorate like the wedges used to. I am glad I decided to try this out. Found a new product that i love!</li>
    <li> I primarily use this sponge for concealer application and I was happy with the result. I was able to achieve a smooth, light application that wasn&#x27;t blotchy or cakey.</li>
    <li> I am using this with a new concealer that I have that requires a brush or a sponge in order to blend it properly.  The sponge works perfected for this application - so much better than the brush that I had attempted to use before.  I will buy another of these sponges to apply my regular foundation so that I can keep the colors separated.  The sponge fits well in my hand and is very soft on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a make up sponge before so I am definitely not a pro when it comes to knowing things about different brands of sponges and all that other stuff. I can say I was really happy with the way it made my make up look.  I wet the sponge first and squeezed the excess water out.  I tried applying my make up two different ways. The first time I used it I applied the make up directly to the sponge and blended it in via the sponge and I did feel like it used more foundation than I usually use when applying without the sponge. The second time I dabbed the make up on with my fingers and then blended it in with the damp sponge using soft short sweeping motions and a dabbing motion. I feel like my make up came out well blended and looked really nice. I like the way you can rinse this clean and let it dry and then place it back in the Ziploc like bag it came in.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the bag of cheap beauty sponges from Walmart and I have never tried any other sponges such as the Beauty Blender, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to that one. I can compare them to the sponges I get from Walmart though, and this one is definitely a step up from those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is dense enough that it doesn&#x27;t soak up your foundation, and I found that it blends the makeup very well, without streaks. Per the instructions, you wet the sponge and wring out the water first, then use as any other makeup sponge. I had no problems with it at all. It is latex free for those who have an allergy to latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to chuckle at the instructions though, they refer to the sponge as she and her. \\&quot;Take a loving hold of her waist, and with just a few dabs she&#x27;ll effortlessly blend powder, liquid and paste foundations.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing my review because I apparently didn&#x27;t give a very good enough review for someone. It&#x27;s a sponge. It is pointy on top, round on the bottom, and it&#x27;s curvy. Like all sponges, it expands when it gets wet, but goes back to size when it&#x27;s dry. It measures 1.4 x 3.4 x 6.3 inches, and it weighs 0.2 ounces. Oh, and it&#x27;s red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a beauty blender for awhile now but I&#x27;ll admit that I was feeling too cheap for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like. I used to use foundation brushes to carefully apply &amp; blend my liquid foundations, as I got older &amp; had kids I never had the time so I&#x27;d just use my fingers... I&#x27;m actually really happy with how I&#x27;m able to blend with just my fingers at this point, but wanted to see if I could get an even nicer finish without too much effort or time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching some youtube videos I gave it a shot.. I think I still need more practice but I&#x27;ve decided I like the application and finish I can achieve with this enough to splurge on a more expensive version (not that this one is horrible, but I think this might be a case of getting what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend this one if you&#x27;re unsure you want to splurge on a more expensive one and want to try out a beauty blender :)</li>
    <li> If you love applying your foundation with a Beauty Blender and you&#x27;re looking for a lower cost alternative, keep looking. The UBU blender is not the same, but that not necessarily be a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beauty Blender works at giving a light finish, which is great if you haven&#x27;t that much to cover up. If your skin is less than perfect and requires more work, you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot more work with a Beauty Blender to get the level of coverage you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UBU is more dense and feels less light than a Beauty Blender. It does a good job of applying foundation, but it goes on more thickly and covers more. If your skin needs a denser coverae, the UBU is probably the better choice - it certainly takes a lot less time than multiple stiples with the BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How natural is the UBU&#x27;s coverage? Well, if you need more foundation to solve your skin issues, the UBU does a good job of making heavier coverage look more natural. The BB is great at that, but if you have more to cover, it can be time consuming (and sometimes you just want to get your makeup done and get out the door!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fairly good, so the BB is more my speed. But I can see the need for the UBU, esp. when time is of the essence. If you need a more complete foundation coverage, the UBU may well fit your needs.</li>
    <li> This blender foundation sponge is fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t absorb the foundation and blends it amazingly. The texture is so smooth that it can not quite be described, but I now think of this as a must-have item in my makeup kit</li>
    <li> This is the first make-up sponge of this type that I have used. The only other type was those wedge-shaped sponges that came in a pack of 10 or more. This sponge is much more dense and fine textured. It is latex-free which is nice for someone like me who has a slight allergic reaction to latex. It&#x27;s shape makes it perfect for applying and blending foundations, liquid or crime blushes or sparkly highlights. I especially like the pointed tip for applying make up around my eye area. It allows me to get close and be precise without sticking myself in the eye. It&#x27;s great for wiping off stray eyeshadow at the corners of my eyes without removing too much. I also like the bottom part because there&#x27;s a big surface for applying foundation. The indented section in the middle is a good place to hold it.  I have used it both wet and dry but I like it damp better because it doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup as much. I just wet it and then squeeze out as much water as possible. When I&#x27;m finished using it I just rinse it under the faucet, squeezing it a few times to get out any makeup that might remain. I leave it to dry in the open air.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. It blends the foundation perfectly! No more brush for me. And the price is AMAZING!!! I definitely recommend those that are looking for a great sponge to blend your foundation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the fault is with the sponge.  It may just be with the kind of makeup I use.  I get the feeling this was only designed to work with liquid foundation.  I use powder foundation and it just made the makeup go on too heavy.  Eventually I found a compromise in using the tip of it just to get concealer into hard to reach areas like the corners of the eyes, around the nose and so forth, and because of the added moisture (because, yes, you must wet this sponge) it&#x27;s great at helping to blend but I still need to use another sponge to actually apply the powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is quite large, almost too large for use on the face, especially if you have small features.  I really only use the tip of it to and the rest as a handle because the sponge is just too bulky to get around the nooks and crannies of my face any other way.</li>
    <li> This BeautyBlender knock-off does not even come close to the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot; Now, I know this is tempting. The price is SOOO low, but know that low-price is for a reason. It simply cannot replicate the results of BeautyBlender ... this is streaky and far from precise. On this alone, the product is a one-star product. For me, it&#x27;s unusable.    Now, let&#x27;s dig into the \\&quot;creepy\\&quot; factor. The packaging is so creepy that it nearly defies words. The front reads, \\&quot;No Latex Ladies!\\&quot; Not only is the word \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; bizarre (and shockingly outdated) but the lack of a comma is spectacularly weird. And the description on the back ... check this out: \\&quot;take a loving hold around her waist and with just a few dabs she&#x27;ll effortlessly blend ... \\&quot; This just makes me skin crawl. Why is this blender gendered? To whom is this being marketed? Why are women grabbing at her waist? As another reviewer rightly noted, this is made in China ... therefore, it is possible that we are dealing with a really bad translation? I certainly do hope so.    Avoid this product because it simply doesn&#x27;t work. Continue to avoid it because ... sexist products for women are always disappointing.</li>
    <li> So this is my first blender sponge so I can&#x27;t compare it to other blenders but I do think its a step above the sponges I used in the past. While slightly larger than the sponge I used before (those little white wedges, included a photo for reference) it is still small enough to toss in your makeup bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the shape and feel of this sponge and also the fact that it doesn&#x27;t absorb all my foundation like those little white wedge sponges do, especially if you wet the sponge first before applying your makeup.  It provides a nice even coverage.  The plastic bag it comes in also has a resealable ziploc at the top so I guess you could store the sponge in there when not in use but I doubt I would do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like this sponge and the results!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a foundation sponge.  I have the Beauty Blender on my Christmas wishlist so the timing to test out the UBU was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both damp and dry and have had good results both times obtaining the streak-free, well blended light coverage that I like (although there was no miracle level results with the application).  I use a liquid foundation.  My worst skin issues are age spots so I had hoped using the dab/roll technique might give me the extra coverage I needed in that area.  I was unable to get that kind of good heavier to lighter coverage with this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping the Beauty Blender on my wish list and will compare the two soon.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a low cost alternative to the beauty blender, consider this product. It works in a similar way despite having a different shape. You get this blender wet, then dry it with a towel. It puffs up and then you put your foundation in your palm, dab the sponge into the foundation and then on your face. It allows for even coverage. There&#x27;s excellent videos on youtube to teach you how to do this. I really loved this sponge and would say that it is definitely comparable to the beauty blender and that it did a nice job evenly spreading my makeup.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using this for applying foundation, as these were recommended by the cosmetics woman where we bought her makeup.  She said by wetting the sponge and dabbbing on the liquid foundation, it would apply a lighter amount vs. using a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is small in size, which is nice for a younger girl.  It&#x27;s dense without being too hard, and I don&#x27;t think the picture really gives you a good idea of how it actually feels.  Seems to be working well without lifting off the makeup or absorbing it too much.</li>
    <li> I am not the most refined at my beauty routine and, for many years, have used my fingers to apply foundation. I couldn&#x27;t find a sponge I liked - the wedge ones felt wasteful because they absorbed so much foundation, and when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t look quite right because it always felt so clunky. So I was intrigued at this UBU Blender Baby and thought it was worth a shot. As it turns out, I really like it a lot. It&#x27;s latex free, and the shape of it works really well for foundation. The pointy tip is good for application around the eyes (without accidentally poking myself), and the bottom part of the sponge is great for wide swaths like cheeks, t-zone and forehead. It definitely absorbs less and makes the foundation meld to my skin better when it&#x27;s wet. The biggest complaint is that you need at least two: rinsing it off, squeezing the excess moisture, and leaving it to air dry means it&#x27;s still wet in the morning. So then I bought another one. I use them every day now, and it&#x27;s helped my complexion - I am having fewer adult acne issues, probably because I&#x27;m not using my fingers to apply my foundation.</li>
    <li> From my wife:  Upon opening, it had a nice soft feel of a quality sponge, but it had a strong chemical smell as well. I washed three times over with liquid soap to take out the smell and let it dry overnight.  It still had a slight smell the next day, but I decided to use it.  It worked just as good as the more expensive version of this sponge,  it spread smoothly and evenly and I was able to put on a heavier layer of foundation when I tried it out.  After use, I washed it once again with mild soap, and I could still whiff a slight chemical smell.  It is a bit bothersome to have that artificial smell and using the item right on your face.  Otherwise, this product would have been a great deal.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of in depth reviews by people obviously more experienced at applying makeup than me, so I&#x27;m keeping this short. I was intrigued by this oddly shaped sponge -- the shape alone is a conversation piece. But I sampled the red sponge and when I wet this made in China blender sponge the first time red dye literally poured out from it. I gave it a good washing with liquid soap and, while not as much red is coming out, the water still has a red tinge to it. I really didn&#x27;t want to even test it because the idea of red dye on my face is not appealing. I braved the red dye and wet the sponge thoroughly and squeezed the excess water out of it. It&#x27;s very soft to the touch when wet and latex free, which I guess is good if you have latex allergy. I attempted to apply Japonesque cream-like foundation with it and for some reason I was unable to achieve a blended result. On one hand, I think it&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s not porous and absorbing my expensive foundation but on the other hand my makeup seems to just sit on my face and not blend in with this sponge, instead just leaving blotches. I&#x27;m not a make up expert so it could be my technique, but I just don&#x27;t feel motivated to perfect the use of this sponge given that I can&#x27;t get past the idea that the red dye leaching out may be harmful and my stippler brush works better for me. I&#x27;m giving it two stars as its unique (to me), but I can&#x27;t get a good application with it and the red dye basically creeps me out. Also, maybe it&#x27;s just me but are they trying to make a sponge seem sexy? Seems weird to me.</li>
    <li> I have used a wide variety of standard wedge sponges and foundation brushes. I use normal liquid foundation and tried this both wet and dry. When using it dry, it provided a light coat, but seemed to really drink up a lot of foundation. When damp, I found it created light, flawless coverage and my makeup looked better than when I use a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UBU sponge is very dense and retains some water, so you really have to get as much moisture out when you can while not damaging it. It will stay damp on the bottom for a few hours. It is quite large, about the size of an egg with an ergonomic shape that allows you to use a variety of angles and also maintain a good grip. The teardrop shape is useful around the nose, chin and eyes but could be a little more pointy to be truly effective around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the sponge is soft and slightly porous, and gets ultra smooth when damp. It is far superior to those white wedge sponges, and glides smoothly on delicate skin. I anticipate it will last a 3-6 months before it has to be replaced. When I want to look my best, I use this as part of my makeup application. To get my best results I apply primer, under eye concealer, then use UBU Blender when slightly damp and my foundation looks good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a very good value at an affordable price for what you get. Its a treat to use and does a good job.</li>
    <li> First off, I use brushes to apply my (MAC) makeup, so am not familiar with using a sponge. Following the directions on the package, I found that the sponge used at least twice as much liquid makeup as did a stippling brush. It claims to not soak up makeup, but I could not get the spot of makeup off the sponge despite several tries with soap and warm water. Once, dried, and the sponge shrinks, the spot is not as noticeable. For blending, it is not bad, and worked little better than cheap wedge shapes. But, it is rather large to get into corners or around the eyes; a narrower top and tip would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a less expensive product for those who do not work with a lot of makeup and do not want to sink a lot of money into a sponge for infrequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd product description about its &#x27;sexy&#x27; shape and the directions to grasp it by its waist is just plain strange, weird hype.</li>
