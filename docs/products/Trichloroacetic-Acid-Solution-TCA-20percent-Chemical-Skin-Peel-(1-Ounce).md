      <li>Happy with the result.</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a good idea to have someone with you just in case you don&#x27;t react well to the peel and need some assistance.</li>
      <li>Now I dont know how soon i can apply again, maybe it would help make it come off for good??</li>
      <li>Then I hadthese brown marks whenever I had gotten really good with that cotton swab.</li>

      <li>Amazing customer service</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a neutralizer handy</li>
      <li>Kind of like when you pour hydrogen peroxide over a wound... looks kinda like that.</li>
      <li>had bought the best seller before on 15%, since I was new to it.</li>
      <li>Very strong.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear cute tank tops for the summer and not have to wear a shirt in the pool :) !</li>
      <li>/&gt;And is very cheap :)</li>
      <li>Thought it&#x27;d be even better.</li>
      <li>It has removed or lighten most of my freckles.</li>
      <li>I peeled the most around the mouth and chin area and then my cheeks.</li>
      <li>sure you have the baking soda solution or the neutralizer nearby.  </li>
      <li>but I am glad I did so.</li>
      <li>I am actually trained &amp; licensed to use TCA, and I found this product to work perfectly as a light/med chemical peel, as well as any I have used in a clinical setting.</li>
      <li>You can do up to three layers safely.</li>
      <li>My mother was able to do two layers with five minutes between each layer.</li>
      <li>I  LOVE</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be so confident and Happy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the better the peel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The more frosting...</li>
      <li>I love using a peel to exfoliate my face</li>
      <li>I will be buying more but in a stronger percentage</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is better to buy the concentration you intend on using than attempting to mix it yourself.</li>
      <li>If anyone is helping you make sure they are wearing gloves too.</li>
      <li>Expect more.</li>
      <li>This time I should be able to go longer than 30</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results and would recommend it to others but with a warning that the &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34; might be more than 7 days.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it will do!!!  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality product for a great price.</li>
      <li>The skin looks beautiful and young again.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised and happy but also nervous.</li>
      <li>strong stuff</li>
      <li>But I think since I got a nice frost from the first layer</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
      <li>Although I do not expect that one prosidure can make a huge difference in my face.</li>
      <li>Keep this handy for when you are ready to get the TCA off your face.</li>
      <li>the some light from the window could cause a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you follow the instructions, this is a fantastic product that produces fantastic results.</li>
      <li>but it is very worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin healed very fast and looks so much better, toned and smooth.</li>
      <li>my skin is pink beautiful</li>
      <li>, most first peels are recommended to be between 30-60</li>
      <li>He even did his own glycolic peel at the same time, so it was like a party. :-)</li>
      <li>then used cotton balls soaked in alcohol to clean my face off until I saw nothing on the cotton ball at all.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t expectit to be perfect the first round though.</li>
      <li>Amazing product, has completely changed my skin.</li>
      <li>That party ended pretty quickly for me though!</li>
      <li>This product arrived fairly quick.</li>
      <li>A light 3 coatings of this solution every 3 weeks will guarantee a clear and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;After application, it takes 3-4 days to show signs of light peeling.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced and definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Soaking in the tub works really well!!</li>
      <li>amazing, product what can i say about this litte bottle ,let me begin , i did three application on my face with this peel , the peel turn brown by the 3rd day</li>
      <li>Their prices are fantastic, much lower than their competitors&#x27;, and the product is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS PEEL&amp;#62;&amp;#62;AWESOME PEEL GREAT FOR MELASMA, UNEVEN SKIN TONE , ACNE MARKS</li>
      <li>You will just need to use it quickly and remove it very fast.</li>
      <li>I used it 5 times and the 5th time I got it right.</li>
      <li>This product works well when used right.</li>
      <li>Okay people, first of all I am 17 years old.</li>
      <li>(do not exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;Follow that with a good wipe down with alcohol and cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>That way the peel is exactly the right percentage you want to use and the results will be consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
      <li>the skin under the old skin is nice so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It hurts very much</li>
      <li>After my face had dried, I applied EMU oil, another great product that I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>There was a lot more stinging sensation and it only took about 1 minute to start frosting on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>First I used a cotton swab dipped in TCA and went over the wrinkles that were on my forehead.</li>
      <li>more then enough for the first time.</li>
      <li>I applyed the first layer and my face started to burn like a hell, just in one minut</li>
      <li>I used it on a scar and after it peeled it looked pink and kind of burned.</li>
      <li>this is the first time I am doing chemical peel.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know that at first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am satisfied with the results and would recommend it to others but with a warning that the &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34; might be more than 7 days. For me it was 10.</li>
    <li> It takes more than one time to see improvement but at least it did not burn my sensitive skin. Happy with the result. Will keep using it once every 2 months.</li>
    <li> Works just like my plastic surgeon used to do. Works best if you prep your skin before. I will definitely purchase this again. Much cheaper than $1,200. Same results.</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time using this. I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing at 1st there are no direction that comes with this product. I used it 5 times and the 5th time I got it right. You have to leave on until it frost on your face then put baconsoada on it works good.im going through the 5 the time now and I&#x27;m starting to peel and the skin under the old skin is nice so far. This product need directions to help you through the process... Hope that helps</li>
    <li> Amazing product, has completely changed my skin. Amazing customer service I will be ordering another bottle of this incredible product! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I used it on my forehead and applied it with a fan brush. I left it on for about 3 minutes but it never frosted.  It  stung so bad so I applied the baking soda pronto! Unfortunately, it pooled between my eyebrows. The skin there started to peel the next day and, stupidly, I peeled that skin. Not what anyone should do! That skin got red and crusty and hurt like heck. I used a triple antibiotic and it took over a week to heal. The skin looks beautiful and young again. Brown spots are almost gone! Deep lines are a lot less noticeable. So I used it on my forearms. Two layers on one arm. Another big mistake! That skin turned a very dark brown (I am light) This time I didn&#x27;t peel the skin. I am shocked that the brown spots either disappeared or lightened dramatically. Learn from my mistakes and don&#x27;t peel your skin! I just applied it again tonight onto the last of the spots on my forehead. I would absolutely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Just have to be careful. I used aquaphor to put around the areas I was treating to help with it running. I helped most with taking down scar tissue build up I have. It&#x27;s a process just like laser removal little at a time or it could be really bad.</li>
    <li> Works great for warts.  If you get it on a non-wart area it will burn; keep baking soda + water slurry ready to neutralize.  Read and believe all warning labels.</li>
    <li> its everything it says it is</li>
    <li> I am absolutely happy with this product! Okay people, first of all I am 17 years old. I had HORRIBLE acne on my back as a pre teen then it calmed down as I got a little older but left me with RIDICULOUSLY embarrassing scars on my back!&lt;br /&gt;I never ever wear anything that shows my shoulders or back at all, which sucks because I have a nice body that I want to show off but my scars were holding me back!&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this because I tried everything from cocoa butter for months, expensive creams,etc.  Keep in mind that I was YOUNG. I would use my birthday money to not feel so insecure..!&lt;br /&gt;Okay now fast forward to now. I started using this and WOW IT BURNS , I kept it on for 1 minute 30 sec. And ran in the shower rubbing baking soda on me !! It was horrible. It really feels terrible so please be prepared before you do it.&lt;br /&gt;It first became raw skin then later in the day it started the darken. Two days later the skin is very dark and is peeling very very well. I&#x27;m glad that I kept it on that long !! The longer you keep it on, the thicker the skin that peels off and the faster it feels off! So I am impatient so I peel my skin when it irritates me having skin peeling on my back.... Tmi sorry.&lt;br /&gt;But oh my goodness , wonderful skin underneath ! I am so happy. I can&#x27;t wait to wear cute tank tops for the summer and not have to wear a shirt in the pool :) !&lt;br /&gt;The skin under isnt perfect but it is literally so much Better that I don&#x27;t even need to do another round. But I bought 3 bottles so I&#x27;m planning to keep using it. I&#x27;m only on my first round and the skin is so even and fresh ;) I plan to do at least 4 more rounds and I&#x27;ll be so confident and Happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truely happy for this and this changed my life. Sounds crazy to say I know.. But it is really embarrassing having to hide your skin this young :(&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy though.&lt;br /&gt;I heard that this product isn&#x27;t well with skin tags and such but for acne scars... YES YES YES. PERFECT. don&#x27;t expectit to be perfect the first round though. Expect more. But you will be So happy. My life is going to be turning around.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts very much but it is very worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And is very cheap :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked perfectly. I uses it as a chemical peel. It worked like a charm. I would recommend to someone else</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s been the 4th day I applyed 20% TCA to my face and this is the first time I am doing chemical peel.  It was scary for me to start it but I decided to rick, and so far it works as it described. I applyed the first layer and my face started to burn like a hell, just in one minut my faced turned white. It happened so fast and I was to scared to put the second layer, and neutrilized it. All day long my face was red just like you get very bad sunburn. But I think since I got a nice frost from the first layer that&#x60;s more then enough for the first time. Day 2 my face turned brown and wrinkly. I&#x60;ve started peeling since yesterday, on my 3 day, will write another review after I get my final results. Although I do not expect that one prosidure can make a huge difference in my face. I got a very deep fine lines which I want to get rid of.((( So let&#x60;s see what happenes.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for TCA, Erlenmeyer&#x27;s is going to be your best bet.  Their prices are fantastic, much lower than their competitors&#x27;, and the product is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sell medical grade Trichloroacetic Acid, and it worked beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> strong stuff it makes your hands peel as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still peeling and I love what I see underneath!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Very strong. My first major peel and I could only stand it for 60 seconds before neutralizing-splashing cold water on my face. Still peeling 3 days post. I definitely don&#x27;t look as awful as some that look like they&#x27;ve been roasted. I&#x27;d say practice with a milder peel first to get the hang of the technique before trying this one. This is not one you want to make mistakes with. Plus a hand held fan helps a lot.</li>
    <li> It worked very well, especially as an intro to TCA peel. I&#x27;m not going into details on how to use TCA peels, that&#x27;s what the internet is for. But odds are if someone complains about getting burned or disfigured they misused it. I don&#x27;t know what the pH is, but I know it worked so it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
    <li> I love using a peel to exfoliate my face but if you want a big peel you need stronger than this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african American person. New to chemical peels. I did heavy research about peels before doing my DIY. This product arrived fairly quick. I just could not wait to start my process. I want to look refreshed by New Years. Anyway I applied this tca peel on Monday. Yes it does sting but it&#x27;s bearable for me. I had some frosting on my cheeks. I currently have some flaking around my mouth and nose. I plan on doing another peel in the future. I don&#x27;t have anymore fears.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product cause I used this product on my skin and did nothing. I did the peel about 4 days ago and i still haven&#x27;t peel, Where i suppose to after the application. Im really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This TCA peel has done wonders! It has removed or lighten most of my freckles. The process to get to clear skin with this peel is not the nicest. Your skin will be brown for a week if you frosted. If you didn&#x27;t frost don&#x27;t believe that its not working. The skin that did frost or didn&#x27;t will peel within 5 days atleast for me.And you will peel like a snake</li>
    <li> I used it on a scar and after it peeled it looked pink and kind of burned. I dont want my face to turn pink if i keep using it</li>
    <li> This really works and works well.  You must follow directions carefully though.  It does burn so make sure you have the baking soda solution or the neutralizer nearby.  My skin healed very fast and looks so much better, toned and smooth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this product.. I bought this product to help lighten my stretch marks before the summer.. I used it as directed. I applied two layers and it darken after a few days, which is normal. The area I applied it to didn&#x27;t peel until after a week. After the area completely peeled a week after the area darken.. It has almost been a month a the area is still dark.. In a couple of weeks I will try again.. I guess Im happy I didn&#x27;t apply this to my face.</li>
    <li> amazing, product what can i say about this litte bottle ,let me begin , i did three application on my face with this peel , the peel turn brown by the 3rd day i began to peel continuing for another 3days it remove my stubborn melasma , my freckles on my nose old acne scar my skin is pink beautiful i am impressed in just one peel it did all that ................I  LOVE THIS PEEL&amp;#62;&amp;#62;AWESOME PEEL GREAT FOR MELASMA, UNEVEN SKIN TONE , ACNE MARKS ,GIVES YOU A BEAUTIFUL GLOW TO YOUR SKIN.</li>
    <li> I am actually trained &amp; licensed to use TCA, and I found this product to work perfectly as a light/med chemical peel, as well as any I have used in a clinical setting. It&#x27;s a great value for the price, too! I like that there are no other additives, just TCA. You must know what you&#x27;re doing with this product, there are no instructions included. I purchased the 1 oz. size which will be more than enough for several facial peels, or a few on the the body (depending upon the size of the area you&#x27;re treating).</li>
    <li> This product works well when used right. A light 3 coatings of this solution every 3 weeks will guarantee a clear and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;After application, it takes 3-4 days to show signs of light peeling. This process should not be rushed. It may lead to complications.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do. Be careful or you will burn yourself, and be prepared for the downtime...!!! Do your research if you plan to do this yourself because you can really hurt yourself.</li>
    <li> I have done exhaustive research on TCA peels and decided I was ready to try my first peel. I purchased this particular TCA peel to begin with. I have glycolic peels in the past. I am a 34 year old red head with extremely sensitive skin. I have been battling adult onset acne for the past few years. And because I was using makeup that helped to prevent acne, it actually dried my skin up to the point where it damaged the skin on my forehead and caused me to wrinkle a bit. So correcting this damage is my main goal. I should also mention that I cannot be out in the sun already, so sun damage is not a factor with my skin... I have never tanned. I&#x27;ve been on a medicine that causes me to burn badly if I am out in the sun for more than a couple of minutes... so I have just never done so. So staying out of the sun during the course of the peel isn&#x27;t a big deal for me at all. I have heard from others who have done the peel to stay out of the sun at any cost... including indirect sunlight. So I am wearing sunscreen on my face just in case the some light from the window could cause a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my husband help me with my peel. I think it&#x27;s a good idea to have someone with you just in case you don&#x27;t react well to the peel and need some assistance. He even did his own glycolic peel at the same time, so it was like a party. :-) That party ended pretty quickly for me though! First I washed my face with a gentle cleanser, dried my face then used cotton balls soaked in alcohol to clean my face off until I saw nothing on the cotton ball at all. This took a couple of cotton balls because I wear make up daily. Then I allowed my face to dry completely. I did not dilute the TCA solution, I used it straight out of the bottle. First I used a cotton swab dipped in TCA and went over the wrinkles that were on my forehead. The burning started within seconds and became quite terrible. The intensity of the burning increased every second! I quickly realized I didn&#x27;t really have the time to go over every little area. So I used a cotton ball soaked in the solution all over my face and tried to cover it quickly as possible. Once the solution was on... I was pretty much freaking out. My face turned so red, like I had been burned very badly by the sun is what it looked like. I ended up jumping up and down and stomping my feet to distract myself from the pain. My husband turned on the fan and put it in front of my face. I thought this would help... it really didn&#x27;t. Now I know this helps for others but I think my pain was just too intense to have an effect. I only last about 30-45 seconds before I had to get it off. I also frosted within about 10-15 seconds... So I used the neutralizer quickly, there were tears running down my face... I was a mess! HOWEVER... I feel that this is just because of the fact that I have sensitive skin. Now don&#x27;t let my experience frighten you because I recently gave my mother a TCA peel of the same strength and it wasn&#x27;t as nearly dramatic of an experience for her. So this really just depends on your skin. My mother was able to do two layers with five minutes between each layer. And she didn&#x27;t get red like I did. A layer is when you cover your face in the solution... wait some time usually three to five minutes then cover your face all over again. I should also mention that you really don&#x27;t even need neutralizer. I didn&#x27;t know that at first. TCA will only be active for about five minutes. Then it will stop working. It&#x27;s nice to have a neutralizer handy but you don&#x27;t need to make a paste with baking soda. Just put a few tablespoons of baking soda in a big bowl of water. And mix it till the baking soda disappears. Keep this handy for when you are ready to get the TCA off your face. From doing my peel and then my mothers peel... I see that experiences just can really vary. But it&#x27;s best to prepared for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after the peel was done my face was red like that bad sunburn look for at least a day. Then I hadthese brown marks whenever I had gotten really good with that cotton swab. Once the redness had faded I was a bit worried cause my skin looked pretty normal other than those brown marks. I thought I might not peel. But boy was I wrong! It takes a few days for the acid to actually really work well. The browner the area was the longer it took to peel but it peel deeper than the other areas! So it really worked in my case. Currently I am at the last stage of peeling and my skin looks so good. I had a bit of acne under my chin and it&#x27;s completely gone. I have also fought whiteheads for years and any signs of them are gone as well. I can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have any whiteheads anymore. The wrinkles on my forehead have really softened. Think I will wait a couple of weeks and try again. This time I should be able to go longer than 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve learned: Wear latex gloves. If anyone is helping you make sure they are wearing gloves too. Just in case.&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with a gentle cleaner (do not exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;Follow that with a good wipe down with alcohol and cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;Let your face dry completely before you apply the peel.&lt;br /&gt;It is better to buy the concentration you intend on using than attempting to mix it yourself. That way the peel is exactly the right percentage you want to use and the results will be consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Shake the bottle of TCA a little before applying.&lt;br /&gt;If you turn red instantly that means you&#x27;re likely sensitive to TCA like I am. This is not a deal breaker. You will just need to use it quickly and remove it very fast. (as long as it&#x27;s not an allergy, you can do a patch test to make sure you&#x27;re not allergic)&lt;br /&gt;Frosting is when your skin turns white. Kind of like when you pour hydrogen peroxide over a wound... looks kinda like that. You want to keep the peel on until you see this at least. The more frosting... the better the peel.&lt;br /&gt;The first TCA peel is the worst and it&#x27;s typically recommended that you onlydo it till you frost, most first peels are recommended to be between 30-60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;TCA can be removed with plain old water... but if you mix a few tablespoons of baking soda in the water it will neutralize the acid faster.&lt;br /&gt;TCA will stop working at around five minutes, the burning will subside... at this point you can do another layer or just rinse your face.&lt;br /&gt;Every time you cover your face in TCA that is referred to as a layer. You can do up to three layers safely. Up to five minutes in between.&lt;br /&gt;After the peel the best thing I have found to use is Neosporin plus pain reliever... that stuff is a God send. Use it for a few days then change to Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pick at the peeling skin... at least try not too. Sometimes you do it without even thinking. As long as you don&#x27;t feel any pain, you&#x27;re probably not causing any damage.&lt;br /&gt;If you are peeling in sheets and it&#x27;s driving you crazy... you can cut the dead skin off with scissors. Just be careful... don&#x27;t be an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;Use common sense! I know people still have that.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a lot of my info straight from my momma&#x27;s plastic surgeon who has done ton of these things.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do!!!  It peels!!</li>
    <li> This is actually my second one. I will keep buying it works great If you know what your doing.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product! I read reviews and watched videos to reacquaint myself with facials and peels. I am a European trained Esthetician. I started with 15%, then 20% and did not notice much peeling. I was able to keep those on at least 12 minutes with 3 layers so I knew my skin was tough, and very thick. This product definitely works, my skin is much tougher than normal and I will go up to at least 25%. I recommend using gauze pads to apply. The product worked well, I just need a stronger strength. Very reasonably priced and definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions, this is a fantastic product that produces fantastic results.</li>
    <li> Arrived quicly! I was very surprised about that.&lt;br /&gt;I had bought the best seller before on 15%, since I was new to it. It peeled great. Lots of dead skin came off and evenly. Soaking in the tub works really well!! (I used it on my body, not face).&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided to get a 20% this time. Thought it&#x27;d be even better. Nah. I applied the peel about 5 or 6 days ago and only a small section is peeling, the rest is nothing but a huge patch of very dry skin. Looks like it wants to peel, but nothing.  I soak in the tub and use the same lotion I used before and it just doesnt help. Now I dont know how soon i can apply again, maybe it would help make it come off for good??</li>
    <li> Watch out  for your skin.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a great product. I was hesitant to purchase this chemical but I am glad I did so. I have done a lot of Glycolic 30% peels and they sting but I never peel. I really didn&#x27;t expect to peel from this TCA solution, because I had my doubts; however, I took all necessary precautions when doing so. After applying the solution, I was surprised at how intense it felt compared to glycolic acid. There was a lot more stinging sensation and it only took about 1 minute to start frosting on my cheeks. I was really surprised and happy but also nervous. After 2-3 minutes I immediately applied the baking soda/water mixture to my face so the chemical would neutralize. After my face had dried, I applied EMU oil, another great product that I highly recommend. 2-3 days after applying the TCA solution is when I started to peel. I peeled the most around the mouth and chin area and then my cheeks. My neck area started to peel last. Next time I will only apply it to my cheeks as it was really too intense around the mouth for my needs. This is a high quality product for a great price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> not working as described yet</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  I will be buying more but in a stronger percentage so I can dilute it to make it last longer!  I had bad acne scars and most have completely disappeared!</li>
