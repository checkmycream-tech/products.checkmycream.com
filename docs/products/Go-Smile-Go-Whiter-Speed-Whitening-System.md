<li> I really like the product so far, but one of my products was completely dried out and I had to throw it away.  </li>
<li> Smile got me probably a little over halfway where I want to eventually be (what I&#x27;d guess is probably about two or three shades whiter than the average non-whitened tooth).&lt;br</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning like I am, this sucks, but it&#x27;s not avoidable and not something that can really be improved on.</li>
<li> I was disappointed because I have used Go Smile in the past &amp; was satisfied with the results.</li>
<li> Ampules were dried out and seemed old.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used whiteners before, both the crest strips and various whitening trays, and they&#x27;ve all resulted in extreme pain.</li>
<li> There is no expiration date on the kit, but the pre-whitening swabs are expanded with the pre-whitening gel and are dry.  </li>
<li> so they are dry from spit before you put on the pre-whitening gel or else</li>
<li> Since it does take a while, I recommend putting a bundle of tissue under your tongue when you dry your teeth before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The kit was fairly easy to use, although it is nearly impossible to keep my bottom teeth dry long enough to apply the pre-whitening primer and the whitening liquid.</li>
<li> Not sure if my product was just old or if that is how it is supposed to be.</li>
<li> It did not really whiten my teeth and it was cumbersome to use.</li>
<li> I know strips of various brands work well because I have used them in the past.</li>
<li> The first stage was almost useless.</li>
<li> This product worked for me because my teeth did get whiter,but I gave it four stars because I had slight sensitivity</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.  </li>

<li> My teeth are much whiter and it happened without painful gums.</li>

    <li> No sensitivity whatsover. It&#x27;s such a great deal considering the actual retail price from Go Smile&#x27;s website. I&#x27;ve experimented with different products from this line and they&#x27;re all wonderful.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitener on the market!</li>
    <li> First Let me say that i have tried many different types of whitening systems.( you can read about this at bottom on review)&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am in my early 20s, I do not smoke and i do not drink coffee, so my teeth were not yellow but they also were not as white as i wanted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is designed to whiten your teeth in 4 days (you use it once in morning and once in evening.) Even though i usually follow instructions, for some reason i didn&#x27;t this time. I felt that it would not be that beneficial if i whitened in the morning, therefore i only used it as night.&lt;br /&gt;It took 4 ampoules out of 9 to get my teeth to the white i wanted. This is absolutely amazing, since i can keep the left over ampoules for touch up later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING:&lt;br /&gt;When using this whitening system make sure you brush your teeth first, then wipes your teeth with a kleenex so they are dry from spit before you put on the pre-whitening gel or else the whitening gel does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you floss and then use the whitening gel right away the gel will get under your gums and bleach them, however in my experience the white gums go away by the time you wake up in the morning&lt;br /&gt;Also, Apply it to the back of your front teeth, it will make them even whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS, But not really Cons.&lt;br /&gt;-Ampoules are a bit hard to work first when you use them the first time (however GO Smile realized this and placed a extra set of ampoules in there just in case)&lt;br /&gt;-Can bleach gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-Only teeth whitening system i found that did not leave my teeth sensitive&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing FAST results!&lt;br /&gt;-Minty Taste, so whitening your teeth is not uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-Compared to Dentist Bleaching-- quite cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Smile Go Whiter Speed Whitening System, is the Whitening system for me.

    <li> Applied it according to the instruction. Did not have the least bit effect on my teeth. If you are really keen then I suggest you buy it from gosmile.com instead of here, because if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can get a refund from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I do have stains, and after using this item, it did work somewhat.  I guess I was expecting too much.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.  You are better off suffering with the pain of regular whitening systems (such as Crest Whitestrips) instead of this.  I&#x27;d rather get results and have a little discomfort than seeing no changes whatsoever!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF, make your teeth beautiful and naturally white looking... very easy to use and works fast!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after seeing a review for this but saw no results at all and used just as the directions said &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after faithfully using the product as directed. I was disappointed because I have used Go Smile in the past &amp; was satisfied with the results. Not sure what happened here!</li>
    <li> It did not really whiten my teeth and it was cumbersome to use. Not a fan and will not reorder.</li>
    <li> while it didn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, which was nice, it also didn&#x27;t result in much whitening. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like this because comparing to similar products in the market, this works as effective and yet not too sensitive to teeth.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions as stated and I didn&#x27;t see any change.  Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I really like the product so far, but one of my products was completely dried out and I had to throw it away.  Another tube wouldn&#x27;t open so I had to cut it open with scissors which damaged the wand and I had to try and use a q-tip to get it out.  I hope the rest of the package is not like that.</li>
    <li> Many whitening products are more cumbersome. This is very easy to use and I actually could tell a difference after one week.</li>
    <li> def noticed a big diff!!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth seem whiter after just a couple of treatments.  I love the fact that I can get the results so quickly.</li>
    <li> My teeth are much whiter and it happened without painful gums. I love this product. I will say that my teeth never became truly &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but it definitely lightens, evens out and enhances. I would buy this product again and maybe go another shade lighter. But it&#x27;s a really great start.</li>
    <li> This two step system is new to me, although I use the Go Smile system regularly. I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. The prep gel is almost non-existent. Not sure if my product was just old or if that is how it is supposed to be. The gel in the tube was all at the bottom and very thick and globby. In one tube the gel had hardened. I&#x27;ve tried 3 days worth (of 4) and can see some whitening, but not as much as the new(ish) double-ended tubes. Sorry for the lack of technical terms!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have actually noticed a real difference.  I have used whitening products from the dentist as well&lt;br /&gt;as Crest Whitestrips.  They were both okay at best but I was disappointed.  I thought I would try these because&lt;br /&gt;Sephora had them on sale for only $39.00 and it was cheaper than Crest.  After 4 days I noticed a significant color&lt;br /&gt;change and I am very pleased!  My teeth changed at least 4 shades lighter.  The only thing with these, make sure to&lt;br /&gt;put something between your teeth and lips as it did irritate my inner lip.  I used paper towel folded up and put it&lt;br /&gt;under my lips to keep the gel from getting on there.  Thats the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;I have just signed up to have these auto delivered every 2 months because I feel it did the trick.</li>
    <li> USAGE:&lt;br /&gt;The directions are clear and concise. The extra &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; ampoule included is nice, but wasn&#x27;t necessary for me, so I just used it in addition to the regular ones. This is a time consuming process. I used it on all of my teeth, on all sides of my teeth, so effectively covering everything took a while. If you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning like I am, this sucks, but it&#x27;s not avoidable and not something that can really be improved on. Since it does take a while, I recommend putting a bundle of tissue under your tongue when you dry your teeth before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVITY:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used whiteners before, both the crest strips and various whitening trays, and they&#x27;ve all resulted in extreme pain. Forget sensitivity, I was curled up in bed on the verge of tears for hours.&lt;br /&gt;This product, for me, resulted in very MILD sensitivity. Absolutely NOTHING compared to others I&#x27;ve used. In fact, it was barely noticeable and I was able to eat and drink both hot and cold foods over the course of the treatment without any pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITENING:&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost: it works.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty hectic schedule and I didn&#x27;t really have time to always use it twice a day, so my four day + 1 supply lasted more like a week. In spite of this, I saw definitive results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a committed and excessive drinker of coffees and teas, (even while whitening) so despite rigorous oral hygiene, I started probably yellower than most. Go Smile got me probably a little over halfway where I want to eventually be (what I&#x27;d guess is probably about two or three shades whiter than the average non-whitened tooth).&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t a perfect, sparkling white, but the results are both noticeable and far better than I had been expecting with my sensitivity and inconsistent usage.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice: it doesn&#x27;t leave those random blotches of white that the strips gave me, the color of each tooth is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it again (hopefullyaccording to directions) with the full expectation of getting my teeth to where I want them.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me because my teeth did get whiter,but I gave it four stars because I had slight sensitivity</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading many reviews on it. This product does work for me. It whitened my teeth and made quite a difference, now I am not going to say it made a dramatic difference, but I am pleased with the results that I received. I have extremely sensitive teeth and this whitening system kept my teeth feeling just perfect. I used crest white strips before and had to stop using them after a single use due to my teeth being too sensitive.  This product prevented any sensitivity and actually whitened my teeth really well. I am very pleased, and I will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 years.  It is great.  I give it as gifts too.  Everyon loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years, and I am always getting compliments on how white my teeth are when I smile.  Much better that keeping those whitening strips in your mouth!</li>
    <li> There is no expiration date on the kit, but the pre-whitening swabs are expanded with the pre-whitening gel and are dry.  They were either not stored properly or expired.  I would like to try and return the item or  get a refund, however, per Amazon, I cannot return &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34;.  The product is great; I have purchased it elsewhere, but I would recommend not getting it from Amazon.  I really want my money back for the product not being what it should be.</li>
    <li> Ampules were dried out and seemed old.  The first stage was almost useless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit because my teeth are cold sensitive and thought it would be perfect to whiten quickly without that pesky, sensitivity side effect. The kit was fairly easy to use, although it is nearly impossible to keep my bottom teeth dry long enough to apply the pre-whitening primer and the whitening liquid. I used the full kit and my teeth have not changed at all in color. Do not waste your time or money with this product. I purchased some advanced whitening strips (from Target, store brand) to use now that I am finished with this waste-of-money product. I know strips of various brands work well because I have used them in the past. They are cheaper and effective, so I&#x27;ll deal with the sensitivity in order to achieve the whiter smile that this kit promised and did not deliver.</li>
