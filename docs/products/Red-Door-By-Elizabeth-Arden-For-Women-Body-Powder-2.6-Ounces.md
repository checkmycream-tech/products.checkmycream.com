    <li> my all time favorite---</li>
    <li> Been purchasing for years and always great quality</li>
    <li> I have used Red door fragrance for YEARS. I love this powder&lt;br /&gt;Good buy, will order again. fresh product. No old</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it. Not much to say, it&#x27;s power and it&#x27;s perfumed! Nice scent and a nice big pouf to apply it with.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t hold the blue star, they keep turning yellow, but I do love it. The fragrance is so pleasant and after I discovered Elizabeth Arden Red Door I have not looked at any other.</li>

    <li> Love this powder, smells so wonderful, I get compliments all the time, the powder just seems to complete the application</li>
    <li> Amazingly, for something sold and shipped by Amazon, this item arrived in a used looking box that was missing the original sealed wrapping. Would have returned it immediately if not for the fact it was a gift and had no time to make alternate arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will think twice before purchasing any similar products through Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS  FOR  MY  MOTHER  IN LOVE  ,  87 YEARS OLD  .  SHE  REALLY LOVE  IT  .  SMELL  VERY CLEAN AND SWEET.</li>
    <li> I did not like this item but with a 20% restocking fee couldn&#x27;t return it even though not opened.  Very sorry I purchased from purfumania on line.</li>
    <li> I chose it as its a product u don&#x27;t often come across anywhere else an the price was a good one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> Must be old because there is very little fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  This talc comes with a built in screen and puff.  Some perfumed talc&#x27;s do not, but I was pleased to see this one has it all.  It is also a nice, large size.  Great price for a really good product.  Love the talc for everyday instead of perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a value price and I got it delivered too. After a nice bath in the afternoon put on your powder and you smell beautiful, nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> My mom and my Aunt loved this product. Good quality, good brand, excellent price</li>
    <li> Good product with a wonderful scent.  However, this was my first time using powder, and I didn&#x27;t realize that it would get everywhere when I used it.  Since then, I have been using my make-up brush to apply it while the can rests in the skin.  Maybe others have had more success?</li>
    <li> fast delivery.smells great</li>
    <li> I love this bath powder and have been unable to find it in a local store.  It is true to the smell of the perfume.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother in law...she loved it.</li>
    <li> Very fragrant! Fragrance is a bit overpowering if I powder too close to my face. But I like the perfume form so I had try the powder form.  I received square box containers without the outer carton box, not round container in an outer carton box, as pictured and seen here.  Still a great value and great product.</li>
