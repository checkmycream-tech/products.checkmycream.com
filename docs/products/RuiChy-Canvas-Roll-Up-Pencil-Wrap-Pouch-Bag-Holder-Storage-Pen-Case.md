      <li>Good...</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>It is leather, so it will get damaged by water--not good for anything that is used in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The material is very nice, does not look or feel cheap, and it matches with most of my handbags!</li>
      <li>NICE SUPPLE LEATHER.  </li>

      <li>My wife loved this well crafted and unique bag.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
      <li>:) There are several pockets for lots of pens,pencils, lip gloss, eyeliner, and mascara, and it folds up very nicely and you can just toss is in your purse and</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit my brushes.</li>
      <li>Cheap junk.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s actually thinking of ordering of ordering a couple more, she thinks they make great gifts due to their price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Their slim and compact design makes it a great traveling accessory.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Convenient little case that makes the essentials easy to access in my purse, not to mention beautiful and unusual.  </li>
      <li>but over all this case is well worth its price.</li>
      <li>The only plus side is that I can use it as a pattern to make my own case.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t worth two pennies.</li>
      <li>it was a worth the wait.</li>
      <li>(I saw a website with the exact product for sale for around $2.00 shipping from China) and is reselling them at 5x the price they paid.</li>
      <li>Other than that it has a nice appearance and it does the job.</li>
      <li>but the smell is just too much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very small and easy to carry around or fit into a makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Took nearly a month to arrive, and really didn&#x27;t hold my brushes that I needed it to hold.  </li>
      <li>Being at an APO receiving an item 4 days later is extremely fast.</li>
      <li>Aired out for a day and odor is not budging.</li>
      <li>The flap that covers the brushes is sewn onto the sides so it is hard to fit brushes into the edge spots.</li>
      <li>Small enough to throw in my purse but large enough to fit at least 12 Mac brushes without appearing bulky or losing its shape.</li>

<li> It would be okay for a small paintbrush set but not really great for larger make up brush sets.....</li>

<li> Mad and disappointed I was tricked.</li>
<li> its not to bad.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this bag.</li>
<li> In addition, the pencil bag is TWILIGHT themed, aka the horrible movie Twilight.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay... Took nearly a month to arrive, and really didn&#x27;t hold my brushes that I needed it to hold.  It would be okay for a small paintbrush set but not really great for larger make up brush sets.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It was very cheap -- almost free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Didn&#x27;t work as expected, but then again - you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Mine has a weird smell, like BBQ smoke, there is no way I&#x27;m putting my make up brushes in this thing so my face can smell like beef jerky. Aired out for a day and odor is not budging. The only plus side is that I can use it as a pattern to make my own case. You get what you pay for, I expected it to be $1 store quality but the smell is just too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for me and my sister I haven&#x27;t used it yet but she is and she likes it. I bought it for the purpose of our makeup brushes. They hold quite a few and I like look and feel of the bag its not to bad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very small and easy to carry around or fit into a makeup bag. The wrap closure is neat and unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two big downsides: (1) The flap that covers the brushes is sewn onto the sides so it is hard to fit brushes into the edge spots. Also, I&#x27;m afraid of my bristles being bent when I close it, since the flap closes perpendicular to the brush direction. (2) It is leather, so it will get damaged by water--not good for anything that is used in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, and it&#x27;s a great value for the price. But I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose and was inexpensive. I hope it holds up for a while.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this well crafted and unique bag. She&#x27;s actually thinking of ordering of ordering a couple more, she thinks they make great gifts due to their price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Their slim and compact design makes it a great traveling accessory.&lt;br /&gt;Though it took a long time getting here it was a worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item about about 4 days ago. Being at an APO receiving an item 4 days later is extremely fast. The case came perfectly packaged. The brown is just as beautiful as it is in the picture. Small enough to throw in my purse but large enough to fit at least 12 Mac brushes without appearing bulky or losing its shape. The wrapping strap could stand to be a little thicker but over all this case is well worth its price. Great way to tote around you beloved makeup brushes in style.</li>
    <li> I love this little brown bad of goodness! You can put several different things in this bag, you can put in your makeup drawer to help organize your eyeliners, or mascaras. Or if you don&#x27;t have a lot of makeup to store you can also use this bag at your desk, or car to store pencils and pens. Personally, I keep this bag in my purse! I have my backup mascara, eyeliner, and my pencils and pens in it! I CANNOT STAND when I go to look for a pen in my purse and have to fumble around the bottom and of course never find what I&#x27;m looking for, then you have to take the entire contents of your purse out just to find that darn pen you were looking for to begin with! This bag eliminates all that headache :) There are several pockets for lots of pens,pencils, lip gloss, eyeliner, and mascara, and it folds up very nicely and you can just toss is in your purse and viola you have everything that is loose in your purse organized!! The material is very nice, does not look or feel cheap, and it matches with most of my handbags! LOVE :) A must buy!</li>
    <li> Product discretion is misleading. It is twilight themed and has twilight written on it at least 3 times. It&#x27;s VERY thin and cheap feeling. Mad and disappointed I was tricked.</li>
    <li> FITS ALL MY MAKE UP BRUSHES WELL.  NICE SUPPLE LEATHER.  FITS IN MY MAKE UP CARRYING CASE THAT I PURCHASED AT TARGET.</li>
    <li> Cheap junk.  Not worth it!  If you are looking for a makeup brush bag, keep looking.  This isn&#x27;t worth two pennies.</li>
    <li> Classic, well done, beautiful, what more can I say about it ?  My wive just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Now she can take her stuff with her in fashionable way.</li>
    <li> Convenient little case that makes the essentials easy to access in my purse, not to mention beautiful and unusual.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> not just the case, but love the work/design on it. It has space for my longest brush and even holds an eyeliner bottle if needed.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this bag. It is a rip off. The seller obviously ordered a bunch of these from China (I saw a website with the exact product for sale for around $2.00 shipping from China) and is reselling them at 5x the price they paid. In addition, the pencil bag is TWILIGHT themed, aka the horrible movie Twilight. While this was on the item&#x27;s page, it was very hard to see and described very briefly in the \\&quot;item details\\&quot; section. I would not have bought this item had I known it was based off of the movie. Returning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small for make up brushes. The tip of my make up brushes hang outside when you roll it up&lt;br /&gt; Other than that it has a nice appearance and it does the job.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t fit my brushes. It looks nice with one brush and skinny ones. not meant for thick brushes or handles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, its not what I expected. It looks so much better in the picture. I&#x27;m gonna use it, until it&#x27;s useless. The material is so flimsy. That&#x27;s what you get for the price, and it comes from China. I will definitely not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good... Its just like they said, the quality and size.</li>
