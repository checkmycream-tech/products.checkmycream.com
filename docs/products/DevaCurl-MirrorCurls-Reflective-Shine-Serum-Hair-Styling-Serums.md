### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!!</li>
      <li>I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time.</li>
      <li>So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...</li>
      <li>always a great product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t personally experienced that, but I do know it doesn&#x27;t add any moisture to my hair like the product claims.</li>
      <li>LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
      <li>the shine is amazing.</li>
      <li>I love Deva products and have had good luck with all but this one.  </li>
      <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t just the bottle I bought because it kind of smelled that way at the salon too.  </li>
      <li>I think if you have thicker, stronger curls this might work for you, and if you don&#x27;t mind the smell, but for me it was just kind of sticky.</li>
      <li>I love most of the deva curl products but this one has an offensive odor.  </li>
      <li>It is also shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I love every product from Deva Curl.... except this one.</li>
      <li>all others from DevaCurl have been fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the deva curl line, but this is one of non-favorites.  </li>
      <li>As with all Deva products, fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love all of Deva Curl products and I was sure I was going to love this one.</li>
      <li>I feel like Deva Curl could have done a much better job making a shine product for curls.</li>
      <li>I love that it has no damaging silicone.  </li>
      <li>I would suggest using just one squirt, even though the bottle says to use more than that.</li>
      <li>I use and love most of the Deva Curl line and was hoping to find a product to control frizz and add shine.</li>
      <li>I love Deva Curl and the Curly Girl Book changed my life.</li>
      <li>I am trying the Low-Poo and One Condition right now, after having been somewhat satisfied with Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Hydrate Me combo, and it&#x27;s too soon to say what I think of the Deva products on their own.  </li>
      <li>Since most of the serums I used to use contained silicone products, I was looking for something that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t build up in my hair since I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoos now.</li>
      <li>I get very consistent results day to day this way and have been very happy for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is sticky and does not slide through hair easily.</li>
      <li>It is the consistency of lip gloss too, which would be fine if my curls were lips.  </li>
      <li>I have fine wavy/partially curly hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic must have product for curly hair.</li>
      <li>Smooth and shiny hair now</li>
      <li>It could be because this product is silicone free</li>
      <li>For a silicone/-cone free product that works without leaving hair sticky, try Collective Wellbeing&#x27;s Enemy of Frizz.</li>
      <li>I use DevaPoo as well and a light leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>All other Deva products smell great.</li>
      <li>Luckily the hairdresser let me try it while my order was in transit.</li>
      <li>I do think my hair curls a bit more nicely with it than without it, but it&#x27;s not worth putting up with the sticky yuckies.</li>
      <li>Good travel size- used on my curly and dry hair..</li>
      <li>I love Deva products this is the first one I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>When this product was first released I was so excited to try it.</li>
      <li>serum makes my hair almost completely frizz free -- it still get some halo frizz, but it is a HUGE improvement over what my hair looked like before MirrorCurls.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t even worth trying to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works best on wet or damp hair -- rather than already dry hair..</li>
      <li>It is good for special occasions or if my hair is looking dull.</li>
      <li>When I first started using the Mirrorcurls, I put it in after I put in the AnGEL and wound up with sticky hair that clumped together and felt greasy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>and she thought it made her hair more fragile and prone to breakage.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about the product was the smell.</li>
      <li>It really left my hair greasy and nothing more.  </li>
      <li>My hair almost always needs more smoothing and Mirrorcurls further smooths my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will be using it regularly from now on.</li>
      <li>I have spiral curly hair, maybe if you have a different hair type it would be more beneficial for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for occasional use</li>
      <li>first time I used it I added a couple of pumps of Mirrorcurls.  </li>
      <li>one day I was running late and decided to mix the AnGEL and Mirrorcurls together in my palm and put them in at the same time and the result was perfect --</li>
      <li>(No joke...sort of infamous in my group of friends for delivering plastic bags full of quarter- to half-used bottles of shampoo, conditioner and product whenever it&#x27;s time to clean out the cupboards.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the Curly Girl handbook and think that many of the ideas that Lorraine Massey discusses are sound.  </li>
      <li>I rub a pump or two on my fingertips and gently follow my curl pattern.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to like this stuff.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t see much increased shininess from this product.  </li>
      <li>which is sort of the whole point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very greasy, and smells like motor oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with wet hair and it works a bit better.</li>
      <li>does make hair shiny but also very sticky ...</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing for my hair, and it has the smell of burnt plastic.</li>
      <li>that makes it kind of weird, but it seems like they could have made a better product.</li>
      <li>I really tried to like this product as I love all the other Deva products that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>This particular product is sticky and STINKY; I wish I had talked to my hairdresser before buying it, as she doesn&#x27;t carry it for that very reason.</li>
      <li>Then I quickly flip my hair back and do not touch it again!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, so much so that I bought a second product after I used up my first.</li>
      <li>I did not notice that they were highly shiny but shinier than without it.     </li>
      <li>After years and years of trying to consistently get smooth shiny thick curls on my fine wavy/curly hair, MirrorCurls is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked - and I live near the ocean in a humid climate.  </li>
      <li>This new products works but not as well as before.  </li>
      <li>When the other reviewer mentioned that it is like lip gloss for your curls, she was right!  </li>
      <li>I have fine (but thick) curly hair that is very prone to frizz at all times of the year (not just in humid weather).</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and there are a lot of products out there that promise a lot of things and at the end of the day you wind up with frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
      <li>It was like my hair never dried -</li>
      <li>I was surprised and saddened when I tried this product--</li>
      <li>I did not use the product for a long time and went to a new stylist that was very helpful in how to apply it.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine with straight hair used this after she blew dry her hair</li>
      <li>I stopped using other shine serums due to being worried about the silicone since curly hair is more fragile.  </li>
      <li>Each of them is clear, but when you mix them they turn white; I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
      <li>Maybe others used too much for their hair type or used it with other products that are not compatible?  </li>
      <li>Does make hair a little stiff, but better than alternatives that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only line of products that hasn&#x27;t made my very fine, very curly hair frizz like crazy, and has given me the most consistent day-to-day results (fewer bad hair days).</li>
      <li>I was really disappointed because the rest of the deva curl line is really great.  </li>
      <li>But it does work pretty well, just not something I would use everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this stuff! I was really disappointed because the rest of the deva curl line is really great.  This is both the worst and most expensive hair serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves your hair extremely sticky with an unpleasant residue that gets on your hands each time you touch your curls, even after they&#x27;ve dried.</li>
    <li> I have fine (but thick) curly hair that is very prone to frizz at all times of the year (not just in humid weather). I bought this a few weeks ago, and it has worked wonders. I scrunch it into my hair after my leave-in conditioner and before all other styling products while my hair is dripping wet. I then put in my curl cream and gel, and plop my hair in a microfiber towel for 15 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum makes my hair almost completely frizz free -- it still get some halo frizz, but it is a HUGE improvement over what my hair looked like before MirrorCurls. It is also shiny and healthy looking. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people have issues where the serum has made their hair sticky and/or limp. I would suggest using just one squirt, even though the bottle says to use more than that. I find that one squirt is plenty on my shoulder length thick hair. This will also make the bottle last longer as it is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I love every product from Deva Curl.... except this one. It does absolutely nothing for my hair, and it has the smell of burnt plastic. If you have never tried this and want to \\&quot;experiment buy\\&quot; like I did, I would hold off and buy something else. I have spiral curly hair, maybe if you have a different hair type it would be more beneficial for you.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. Made my hair feel like dried out stiff old straw.</li>
    <li> does make hair shiny but also very sticky ...so hair gets dirty quickly and after a few hours feels like it really needs to be washed...so I recommend it only for occasional, very short term use</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy/partially curly hair, and a lot of it.  Finding products that work without weighing down these touchy critters and making my scalp flake is an ongoing quest and I&#x27;ve gone through hundreds of products over the years. (No joke...sort of infamous in my group of friends for delivering plastic bags full of quarter- to half-used bottles of shampoo, conditioner and product whenever it&#x27;s time to clean out the cupboards.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the Curly Girl handbook and think that many of the ideas that Lorraine Massey discusses are sound.  I am trying the Low-Poo and One Condition right now, after having been somewhat satisfied with Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Hydrate Me combo, and it&#x27;s too soon to say what I think of the Deva products on their own.  However, I&#x27;ve tried Mirror Curls a couple of times before, and again today, and I have to admit, it just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny, or shinier, at all...which is sort of the whole point. It also makes it feel very coarse and sticky, and does nothing to improve the curl structure in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t claim that it won&#x27;t work for some people; my curls are definitely not the hardy type.  But it&#x27;s going in the plastic bag \\&quot;for delivery\\&quot; tonight when I get home.</li>
    <li> I use and love most of the Deva Curl line and was hoping to find a product to control frizz and add shine. I found this to be rather sticky and smells a little like turpentine. I tried it on wet and dry hair and even tried to dilute it with water on my hands before applying. The smell isn&#x27;t even worth trying to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether to try to return it or just throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retract the negative review. I did not use the product for a long time and went to a new stylist that was very helpful in how to apply it. I rub a pump or two on my fingertips and gently follow my curl pattern. NO more frizz and the shine is amazing.</li>
    <li> Must be used as part of the Devacurl program as a final step with styling cream and one condition.  If used properly, it does its job, which is to eliminate frizz.  Odorless.  Does make hair a little stiff, but better than alternatives that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Noticed some other reviewers did not like this product, but I do.  I have thick, course, curly hair and it needs a lot of product.  Maybe others used too much for their hair type or used it with other products that are not compatible?  I put it on my hair after I have blow dried it.  My hair almost always needs more smoothing and Mirrorcurls further smooths my hair.  I love that it has no damaging silicone.  I stopped using other shine serums due to being worried about the silicone since curly hair is more fragile.  I tried Set it Free and AnGEL, but gave them up because these make my hair sticky and feel dirty the next day. Mirrorcurls does NOT leave my hair sticky or dirty.  I use Wen to wash/condition my hair and WEN oils.</li>
    <li> When this product was first released I was so excited to try it. I love all of Deva Curl products and I was sure I was going to love this one. Not the case...it leaves my hair a bit greasy and the next day if I use the lavender spray it gets sticky. It&#x27;s okay for occasional use but it isn&#x27;t for every day. I&#x27;m disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised and saddened when I tried this product--all others from DevaCurl have been fantastic! This particular product is sticky and STINKY; I wish I had talked to my hairdresser before buying it, as she doesn&#x27;t carry it for that very reason. The scent is appalling, and my hair felt sticky and greasy. Used it once and threw it away--what a waste.</li>
    <li> Mirror Curls does not live up to my expectations.  I thought it would reduce frizz and also add some shine. It does neither.  It really left my hair greasy and nothing more.  It is also very expensive.  I would not recommend buying it, though I do use all the other deva curl products</li>
    <li> After years and years of trying to consistently get smooth shiny thick curls on my fine wavy/curly hair, MirrorCurls is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked - and I live near the ocean in a humid climate.  I&#x27;m wondering if the other reviewers are using it improperly.  I only use a bit - about half a pump and I work it through damp hair with my head upside down.  Then I quickly flip my hair back and do not touch it again! The curls dry in place and are soft and thick.  The next day or if I need to refresh I just dampen my hands with water and sort of scrunch a bit from under at the root.  I use DevaPoo as well and a light leave in conditioner.  I tried the Deva Angell and that left my hair too crunchy and also a little frizzy.</li>
    <li> I use this product mixed with Deva Curl Arc Angel, as is suggested on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I added a couple of pumps of Mirrorcurls.  Ugh!  It was like my hair never dried - it felt wet and sticky all day, like it had sap in it, until I finally had to take a second shower to wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used as little as I could dispense from the pump.  My hair was still very slightly sticky and it transfers - every time I touched my hair I came away with sticky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see much increased shininess from this product.  I do think my hair curls a bit more nicely with it than without it, but it&#x27;s not worth putting up with the sticky yuckies.</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this product as I love all the other Deva products that I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ll have to agree with the other reviews, this stuff has an odd odor and is sticky. I tried to see if I could ignore these attributes but when I looked in the mirror I saw that it gave my hair a really odd shine that was sort or choppy or blotchy looking.</li>
    <li> Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!</li>
    <li> Deva Curl Mirror Curls is like lip gloss for your hair. It makes your curls glossy. I did not notice that they were highly shiny but shinier than without it.     It is very thick and I don&#x27;t use it every day as it makes my hair sticky the next day if I just want to spray it with lavender water.     It is good for special occasions or if my hair is looking dull.</li>
    <li> always a great product.</li>
    <li> I love Deva products and have had good luck with all but this one.  This is NASTY!  It leaves hair sticky and limp.  When the other reviewer mentioned that it is like lip gloss for your curls, she was right!  It is the consistency of lip gloss too, which would be fine if my curls were lips.  Since they are curls, I will NEVER use this junk again!</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my curls and I can&#x27;t stand the smell. All other Deva products smell great. This smells like rancid oil. I know it wasn&#x27;t just the bottle I bought because it kind of smelled that way at the salon too.  I think if you have thicker, stronger curls this might work for you, and if you don&#x27;t mind the smell, but for me it was just kind of sticky. I&#x27;ve tried it with wet hair and it works a bit better.</li>
    <li> I love Deva products this is the first one I really don&#x27;t like. It feels like thick goo, and I think it smells rancid. I have tried using it several different ways to give it benefit of a doubt...but for me it does not work!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, so much so that I bought a second product after I used up my first. I feel like Deva Curl could have done a much better job making a shine product for curls. This product is sticky and does not slide through hair easily. It could be because this product is silicone free that makes it kind of weird, but it seems like they could have made a better product. A friend of mine with straight hair used this after she blew dry her hair and she thought it made her hair more fragile and prone to breakage. I haven&#x27;t personally experienced that, but I do know it doesn&#x27;t add any moisture to my hair like the product claims. In conclusion, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. For a silicone/-cone free product that works without leaving hair sticky, try Collective Wellbeing&#x27;s Enemy of Frizz.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this stuff. I did. Since most of the serums I used to use contained silicone products, I was looking for something that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t build up in my hair since I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoos now. The first thing I noticed about the product was the smell. It&#x27;s very greasy, and smells like motor oil. I thought that the smell would go away after I used it, but I found myself noticing the smell in my hair throughout the day. Awful.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Works well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic must have product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible! I applied to my wavy-to-curly hair and it made my hair feel coarse, frizzy and dry-looking. I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair for 4 days- even after washing repeatedly. It is like glue. Will be doing a clarifying treatment to rectify the damage. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product smells like rancid oil.  I&#x27;ve smelled this at a store once and it didn&#x27;t smell like this.  I feel like it&#x27;s gone bad.  Can&#x27;t stand to put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> this product seem that it is very old, had a bad smell and very stickie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva products exclusively for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s the only line of products that hasn&#x27;t made my very fine, very curly hair frizz like crazy, and has given me the most consistent day-to-day results (fewer bad hair days). When I first started using the Mirrorcurls, I put it in after I put in the AnGEL and wound up with sticky hair that clumped together and felt greasy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I was running late and decided to mix the AnGEL and Mirrorcurls together in my palm and put them in at the same time and the result was perfect -- no frizz, no heaviness, no stickiness. I get very consistent results day to day this way and have been very happy for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do 2 pumps of the AnGEL and then 1.5-2 pumps of Mirrorcurls and mix them together. Each of them is clear, but when you mix them they turn white; I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe a chemist could explain it. The salient point is IT WORKS. (For me at least.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn&#x27;t like the results as listed on the label, and because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
    <li> I love the deva curl line, but this is one of non-favorites.  It leaves hair feeling a bit like it will attract lint, and the scent is just so so.  But it does work pretty well, just not something I would use everyday.</li>
    <li> Good travel size- used on my curly and dry hair.. Works best on wet or damp hair -- rather than already dry hair.. Smooth and shiny hair now</li>
    <li> Packaging was horrible when I revived the product it was half gone spilled in the cap and envelope I didn&#x27;t like the way it worked in my hair lets just say I will never buy it again</li>
    <li> Geraldine Liebert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirrorcurls does not seem up to its usual shine and thickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Mirrorcurls for a long time.  This bottle does not seem as thick as I am used to buying.  Usually, it is a thicker paste that I can spread sparingly through my hair.  This new products works but not as well as before.  Perhaps the company changed the formula?</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly and there are a lot of products out there that promise a lot of things and at the end of the day you wind up with frizzy unmanageable hair. This is absolutely different and delivers as expected. I love it and will be using it regularly from now on.</li>
    <li> If I could give it no stars, I would. It is so sticky and made my hair heavy. Luckily the hairdresser let me try it while my order was in transit. I sent my order back ASAP.</li>
    <li> I love most of the deva curl products but this one has an offensive odor.  It does give curls shine, but it is hard to get past the smel.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl and the Curly Girl Book changed my life. The only hair products I use now are Deva Curl. This is product is simply vegetable oil. The same results can be acheived by using olive oil.</li>
    <li> As with all Deva products, fantastic!</li>
