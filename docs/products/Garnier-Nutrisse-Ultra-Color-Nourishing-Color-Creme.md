      <li>My husband helped me make sure that all my hair was covered well.  </li>

      <li>Last a while and turns out great!</li>
      <li>My hair comes out feeling better than before I colored it.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the color while it lasted.</li>

      <li>Very true to the color.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair look great and feel extremely soft.  </li>
      <li>like more blue hue than most, this is great for me.  </li>
      <li>Fairly fine/soft strands, but a decent amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed cosmetologist, and I have access to \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair color.</li>
      <li>The smell is sort of strong still</li>
      <li>Beautiful blue tone.</li>
      <li>Its a great store bought dye, and I would totally recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>(it looked silvery/blue in the light).</li>
      <li>In two weeks, my hair is now medium brown with light brown highlights.</li>
      <li>Loved how dark it was and the blue tones were sooo perfect!</li>
      <li>I was excited to have that, but it&#x27;s not there.</li>
      <li>We stumbled upon this line by accident; we were too lazy to go to the beauty supply, so we grabbed a box of the R3 and it was so awesome</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cool.</li>
      <li>Nice product, complete with fruit-based oils.</li>
      <li>Cleaning up the dye that strayed in the process was also pretty easy.</li>
      <li>To respond to issues experienced by other reviewers, there are two things you can do to create a bit of longevity for this hair color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love it my new go to for hair color.</li>
      <li>I was excited by the fact that this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t stain my skin.</li>
      <li>I had read another reviewer say the same thing but didn&#x27;t believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.  </li>
      <li>This time, it wiped right off.</li>
      <li>Very beautiful dark blue.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for light brown and lighter shades</li>
      <li>This is the best really blue black with gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Which was a dark reddish color that I loved.  </li>
      <li>Washing in luke warm water helps to not open the cuticle too much, which will help a bit with retention of the pigment, but</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this brand.</li>
      <li>My hair is so shiny soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t stain as and was amazed on how pretty the color came out</li>
      <li>with that said I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another brand more than this one, get whichever brand you personally prefer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;a) never wash in hot water and&lt;br /&gt;b)</li>
      <li>This is the only Garnier dye I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Since my tips are very porous, they absorbed the color immediately upon washing it all together.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best blue black color out there.</li>
      <li>I have naturally light brown hair, similar to Garnier&#x27;s 535 Medium Golden Mahogany Brown Chocolate Caramel.</li>
      <li>At first, it gave my hair a really nice black and silvery look</li>
      <li>Blue black color is beautiful and leaves your hair shiny.</li>
      <li>While most haircolors that cover grey are flat and heavy, this product has incredible shine and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>As for my blonde, all but the tips are fine.</li>
      <li>and it has faded some already, but only enough to make the blue more prominent.</li>
      <li>really...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see any blue tints in the light, but sometimes it does look silvery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>yet i dont wash my hair very often</li>
      <li>But it is still a box, so you can&#x27;t reasonably expect salon quality or longevity.</li>
      <li>After using this dye my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used other brands and this is the only one that I have had good results with.</li>
      <li>And in the right light, you can actually see an almost cerulean blue tone as well.  </li>
      <li>The black dye makes the hair more porous.</li>
      <li>so maybe if ny hair was darker it would have been more black</li>
      <li>(so glad I did) and used one and a half on my hair.</li>
      <li>I know the blue tones wash out quickly</li>
      <li>It only lasted a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;m yet to find a dye that last more than that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a convenient, cost-effective alternative with decent results.</li>
      <li>&quot; Most of what they have added to the dye to make it blue is a semi-permanent gloss, which will coat the outside of the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s just a little bit of blue tint on the tips, and honestly, it kind of toned my blond and got rid of some orange/yellow hues - which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>their other colors are good but this one is a little too intense if you have a professional job</li>
      <li>On my coppery brown hair, the color turned out a nice cool black that looks natural after a few washes.</li>
      <li>It really came out a lovely shade of blue black.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, when the sun shines from a CERTAIN ANGLE, it does reflect blue color (not as vibrant as it was though).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My favorite and go to color for blue black.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, but have noticeable silver hairs.</li>
      <li>and it is just like my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Everyone always wants to open the boxes and rearrange things.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve dyed my natural ashy brown hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason that \\&quot;blue\\&quot; dyes bleed so much is that blue is the largest hair color pigment molecule and it literally \\&quot;falls</li>
      <li>So far, this one is a keeper.  </li>
      <li>The color will fade quickly if you wash your hair frequently, so I suggest keeping the washes down to every 2-3 days and using a color-safe shampoo/conditioner to extend the life of the dye.</li>
      <li>Well this is pretty much exactly the same as every other black drugstore hair dye, it looks awesome for the first few days, it&#x27;s the same to apply as every other hair dye, it smells pretty much the same, it makes your hair black just the same, and it lasts about the same amount of time before you need to dye it again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My little sister uses one of their reds, R3 Light Intense Auburn, intended for dark hair.</li>
      <li>Its very similar to professional dye.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Blue black color is beautiful and leaves your hair shiny. I have received tons of compliments. I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s black hair dye, not much else to say. Lol</li>
    <li> love it my new go to for hair color. didn&#x27;t stain as and was amazed on how pretty the color came out</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Reflective Blue Black. This is the only Garnier dye I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. On my coppery brown hair, the color turned out a nice cool black that looks natural after a few washes. I can&#x27;t see any blue tints in the light, but sometimes it does look silvery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is a little messy. The mixture is thick and you have to put it on dry hair. I&#x27;ve used other at-home dyes that you can apply wet, and they&#x27;re much easier to distribute evenly through the hair. Because this one isn&#x27;t, one box is not enough if you have long locks, like me. There&#x27;s enough product in one box to saturate your hair about down to your shoulders, but if it&#x27;s longer than that you&#x27;ll need a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water in your bath or shower will come out purple for the first couple of washes, so be careful and wipe down your tub and walls! The color will fade quickly if you wash your hair frequently, so I suggest keeping the washes down to every 2-3 days and using a color-safe shampoo/conditioner to extend the life of the dye. I use a semi-permanent black dye that&#x27;s gentler on hair (and easier to apply) to touch up the roots, so I only need to redo the entire job about three times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this dye because I don&#x27;t want to spend the time and big bucks to go to a salon. But it is still a box, so you can&#x27;t reasonably expect salon quality or longevity. It&#x27;s a convenient, cost-effective alternative with decent results.</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of the best if not the best haircoloring product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve dyed my natural ashy brown hair. I&#x27;ve used this brand before the last time I added color. Which was a dark reddish color that I loved.  I&#x27;ve also used other brands and this is the only one that I have had good results with. My hair is so shiny soft and smooth. After using this dye my hair looks so much healthier. Split ends are barely noticeable. I  ordered two boxes of the reflective blue black (so glad I did) and used one and a half on my hair. I  am now sitting here waiting for my hair to dry but I am so pleased with the results! And can&#x27;t wait to style it! I&#x27;m sticking with garnier nutrirse ultra color!</li>
    <li> This is a good color. I have naturally brown black hair (just imagine the darkest brown possible- everyone says my hair is black- but it&#x27;s not LOL). I have been looking for a blue permanent color for a long time. I found this and read some very good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;The color at first was GORGEOUS! Very beautiful dark blue. However, didn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s been almost two months since I dyed it and it is just like my natural hair. Yes, it is a little darker, however I wished that the blue didn&#x27;t fade away so fast.&lt;br /&gt;Still, when the sun shines from a CERTAIN ANGLE, it does reflect blue color (not as vibrant as it was though).&lt;br /&gt;I believe if I dye it again, it may take the color in...&lt;br /&gt;The dye has a good smell and it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Will use this product again.</li>
    <li> My color didn&#x27;t last very long which is weird because it normally does.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only hair color brands that won&#x27;t fade out of my hair. (my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color well) I usually buy it in store, but considering it costs $9 in store, I got a deal with this. Its very similar to professional dye. Also, all items inside were not tampered with. Thats hard to find on the shelf nowadays! Everyone always wants to open the boxes and rearrange things. I&#x27;ll probably just end up buying on here from now on.</li>
    <li> My favorite and go to color for blue black. Last a while and turns out great!</li>
    <li> This new Blue Black provides the same coverage as the old Blue Black which is now discontinued. I am very happy with the result and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon but in the store, and just wanted to review.  I am a natural brunette that had bleached and dyed my hair blue with Manic Panic.  4 months later, I have 4 inches of &#x27;roots&#x27; and the blue had faded to a greenish blue.  It was time for a change.  I decided to go with a blue black in case some of the blue wasn&#x27;t covered.  This stuff ROCKS.  I bought two boxes (my hair is thick and mid back length) and took a deep breath.  My husband helped me make sure that all my hair was covered well.  The smell of the dye wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I waited 30 minutes and rinsed.  It only took about 5 minutes of solid rinsing before the water ran clear and then I applied the included conditioner.  I waited that out for a few minutes and rinsed well again.  Now I&#x27;m sitting here will with really pretty, glossy black hair.  The smell is sort of strong still and that is the only problem I have with the product.  I know not to wash it for a couple of days and hopefully being outside tomorrow will &#x27;air it out&#x27; some.  I am pleased with this product because I saved salon money, didn&#x27;t have to apply a color remover before use, and got good color and coverage.</li>
    <li> i got the reflective blue/black.  I use blue black hair dye all the time, and it comes out super dark black.  this dye made my hair BLUE. i looked like freakin sonic the hedgehhog.  so awful.  their other colors are good but this one is a little too intense if you have a professional job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s daring but it looks normal not blue, only in the lighting. Loved how dark it was and the blue tones were sooo perfect!</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure when I bought this because it is blue based and my hair had red in it. I had been dying my hair reddish brown for a while but I let it fade a little and grew it out about half an inch to 1 inch. I also have some blonde in my hair and was worried about this dye bleeding into it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously from my 5 star rating it came out well. In fact, I think it came out perfectly - the exact color it was intended to be (sometimes hair dye doesn&#x27;t always come out as expected). I&#x27;ve washed it once since I dyed it and it has faded some already, but only enough to make the blue more prominent. It&#x27;s really cool. As for my blonde, all but the tips are fine. Since my tips are very porous, they absorbed the color immediately upon washing it all together. But it isn&#x27;t bad at all. There&#x27;s just a little bit of blue tint on the tips, and honestly, it kind of toned my blond and got rid of some orange/yellow hues - which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will edit this later to report on how many washes it takes before the color starts to look bad.</li>
    <li> If your hair usually tints red when you die it black, this product is for you. In my experience, the blue black isn&#x27;t so much blue as it is solid black that doesn&#x27;t tint red. I love this product, and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blue black color out there. Surprisingly it&#x27;s not even one of the more expensive colors. Color stays. Covers gray. Beautiful blue tone.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a year,very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> lovd the effect but it didnt last so long in my hair. I put it in last year towards the end and by mid this year all the colour was washed out yet i dont wash my hair very often</li>
    <li> Very true to the color.  Makes hair look great and feel extremely soft.  After coloring, hair coroporated much better than beforehand.  Nice product, complete with fruit-based oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my second black hair dye. At first, it gave my hair a really nice black and silvery look (it looked silvery/blue in the light). I did have a couple of problems, though. It didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I thought it faded quicker because, hair dye or not, I always shower with warm/hot water and use shampoo, so that could be my fault. However, I wash my hair every other day regardless. The other problem was that it made my hair feel rather dry and squeaky. I enjoyed the color while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I was thinking this was going to be black/blue but this is truly blue/black, with emphasises on the blue!&lt;br /&gt;nice but blue.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light brown hair, similar to Garnier&#x27;s 535 Medium Golden Mahogany Brown Chocolate Caramel. Fairly fine/soft strands, but a decent amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed cosmetologist, and I have access to \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair color. I think the whole Garnier Ultra Color line is awesome. My little sister uses one of their reds, R3 Light Intense Auburn, intended for dark hair. We stumbled upon this line by accident; we were too lazy to go to the beauty supply, so we grabbed a box of the R3 and it was so awesome, we never tried to find her a pro red dye again. Her hair is actually a dirty blonde, so the effect is super intense on her. Her color never fades... it just grows out! It almost looks magenta on her, she can&#x27;t go anywhere without someone commenting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freshly colored, this product is indeed BLUE, and it&#x27;s DARK. It&#x27;s very striking; I get compliments on it often. To respond to issues experienced by other reviewers, there are two things you can do to create a bit of longevity for this hair color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) never wash in hot water and&lt;br /&gt;b) try not to use shampoo every time (sometimes you can \\&quot;wash\\&quot; with just conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that \\&quot;blue\\&quot; dyes bleed so much is that blue is the largest hair color pigment molecule and it literally \\&quot;falls out\\&quot; of  your hair shaft, due to it&#x27;s inability to penetrate far enough into the follicle to really \\&quot;grab hold.\\&quot; Most of what they have added to the dye to make it blue is a semi-permanent gloss, which will coat the outside of the hair shaft. So in that way, it&#x27;s not necessarily a defect in Garnier&#x27;s product; just a fact of hair color maintenance. Washing in luke warm water helps to not open the cuticle too much, which will help a bit with retention of the pigment, but really... it&#x27;s only a matter of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color and I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Garnier 100% color and loved the blueberry colored hue it gave me when I&#x27;m out in the sun but since that&#x27;s been discontinued, I decided to try this new Garnier after using countless other blue black dyes.  I ended up leaving it on longer than the 30 minutes which I think was a good thing.  It really came out a lovely shade of blue black.  And in the right light, you can actually see an almost cerulean blue tone as well.  I had read another reviewer say the same thing but didn&#x27;t believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.  I know the blue tones wash out quickly so I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of the black as its only been a few days, but the color is still deep and dark.  I decided this one on a whim after using the new Loreal Excellence Intense blue black, which faded to brown after less than 2 weeks and really disappointed me.  So far, this one is a keeper.  My hair is so glossy it&#x27;s ridiculous.  And the damage is minimal.  Hopefully this one will last longer than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Garnier Nutrisse Permanent Hair color Blue black was a waste of money and time. Every time i attempt to color my hair blue black, the color washes out within a week. In two weeks, my hair is now medium brown with light brown highlights. I used 2-bottles and allowed it to stay in my hair for 40 min. I highly recommend this product for light brown and lighter shades it works great on light shades. Also, it made my hair dry and hard to manage. The black dye makes the hair more porous. It was impossible  to get a freakin wide tooth comb through my hair after I&lt;br /&gt;washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this product, I&#x27;m now stuck with 2-toned brown hair. A far cry from Blue black.</li>
    <li> Well this is pretty much exactly the same as every other black drugstore hair dye, it looks awesome for the first few days, it&#x27;s the same to apply as every other hair dye, it smells pretty much the same, it makes your hair black just the same, and it lasts about the same amount of time before you need to dye it again.&lt;br /&gt;Basically it&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect from a drugstore hair dye, it functions exactly the same as any other brand. But with that it doesn&#x27;t do a bad job either, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it above any other brand in that it doesn&#x27;t do anything miraculous like making my hair black until the end of time, with that said I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another brand more than this one, get whichever brand you personally prefer.</li>
    <li> I used to choose a brown-black shade when I began dyeing my hair, but one day I couldn&#x27;t find one at the grocery store and opted for this brand and color. It was a fortuitous choice. While most haircolors that cover grey are flat and heavy, this product has incredible shine and looks very natural. My hair comes out feeling better than before I colored it. Since it&#x27;s often hard to find this shade in the stores, I not only buy it here on Amazon but have it on a Subscribe and Save account. If you have naturally black hair, don&#x27;t be afraid of the &amp;#34;blue black&amp;#34; label -- this is the color for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, but have noticeable silver hairs. Since the salon costs more than I wish to pay, every now and then I try a variety of at-home hair coloring kits and this, hands down, beats them all! I received even coverage and noticed the highlights reflecting in the daylight. While the ammonia smell is still there, it&#x27;s masked with a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent...at least that&#x27;s the way my daughter put it.</li>
    <li> Turned out royal blue but I did have my hair plantum before I died it so maybe if ny hair was darker it would have been more black</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand. I was excited by the fact that this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t stain my skin. I have very long hair and dye it myself. Usually the dye sticks around for a few days even after scrubbing it off my arm or shoulder. This time, it wiped right off. That&#x27;s my favorite part of this product. I&#x27;m am slightly disappointed. I haven&#x27;t seen any blueness or tint to it AT ALL. I was excited to have that, but it&#x27;s not there. We&#x27;ll see, maybe if I get out in the sun or something. Otherwise, this is a great product and I&#x27;ll use this brand again.</li>
    <li> Great hair dye. I got to Blue Black, and its exactly what I wanted. It left my hair feeling soft afterwards too. It only lasted a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;m yet to find a dye that last more than that. It was easy to use, and the gloves were more manageable then the plastic bag like ones other dyes give you. Cleaning up the dye that strayed in the process was also pretty easy. Its a great store bought dye, and I would totally recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is the best really blue black with gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I like more blue hue than most, this is great for me.  Gray coverage is 4-star, but I love the hue.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous! Only thing I didnt like was how messy this was and how much this product washes out of the hair even after a week post dyeing.</li>
