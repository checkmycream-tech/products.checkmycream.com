<ol>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I use it as body splash but also on my bedding, it is wonderful</li>
      <li>and it still has me smelling good !!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to spray a ton to make yourself smell like a delicious mystery.</li>
      <li>Very happy for my spalsh&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari Aqva Toniq Men Eau-De-Toilette Spray by Bvlgari, 3.4 Ounce</li>
      <li>They work great for me.</li>
      <li>It has the most wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>Honestly twilight from bbw&#x27;s is a nice fragrance  and is one of their best products.</li>
      <li>The bottle however is beautiful and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful, strong but shouting.</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>
      <li>So after smelling this from time to time trying to convince myself that it might smell good on me, I gave up and gave it to my sons friend.</li>
      <li>I have gotten a lot of compilments on how good it</li>
      <li>I thought the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; would HAVE to be better!</li>
      <li>and when I found this I was in love!</li>
      <li>Love the smell, and loved the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She said she really liked it, so I told her she could have it instead.</li>
      <li>The product came rather quickly and that was great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s one of my Mother&#x27;s favorite body spray.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE them all.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>But truthfully speaking you can buy a BodyCology brand fragrance called \\&quot;enchanted</li>
      <li>I went to get more and bought 2 bottles.  </li>
      <li>From what I read online in the description, this sounded like something I was sure I would like.</li>
      <li>although it smelled ok, there was a fragrance \\&quot;note\\</li>
      <li>I love it and use it every day.</li>
      <li>But that was 2 weeks ago or more.</li>
      <li>If asked to choose my all time favorite body spray/ perfume, I&#x27;d have to say that Twilight Woods body spray by Bath and Body Works is the Number 1 choice for me.</li>
      <li>It smells beautiful and feminine, and so far it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the Bath and Body Works brand&#x27;s scents.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong , but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>My favorite application is spraying it on freshly laundered sheets.</li>
      <li>and if I remember correctly either peach or nectarine blossom or a type of mimosa blossom which adds a light sweetish flowery smell.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a cloying scent, it&#x27;s light and dissipates well.</li>
      <li>The product smells fantastic, but the response was poor.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body spray and I received it in a surprisingly fast amount of time!</li>
      <li>This is great fragrance that last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t take more than one spray for you to be noticed  with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s up to you,this is worth it</li>
      <li>love it and will definitly be buying more when the bottle is empty.</li>
      <li>&quot; I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on, that just didn&#x27;t smell right to me.</li>
      <li>I rationed it until I was able to go down to the mall to get more.  </li>
      <li>First received this as a gift.</li>
      <li>Very well done!</li>
      <li>My first bottle lasted 4 months.  </li>
      <li>They were delivered at warp speed and were very well packed; someone at &amp;#34;Teleported Treasures&amp;#34; took the time to tape all the bottle caps on.</li>
      <li>My friend encouraged me to use this scent after I decided not to get really into body scents anymore, but one spray of this stuff</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that, even when you include shipping, the price of this perfume is still much cheaper on amazon.com than at the Bath and Body Works store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>forest\\&quot; smells pretty much the same but only costs $3.99 most retail at target or Walmart stores.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
      <li>It is far weaker and does not last for more than a half hr.</li>

    <li> Love it it&#x27;s my favorite perfume and I have now got it will be ordering from you soon as I will need another one as I use it all the time</li>
    <li> This is great fragrance that last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t take more than one spray for you to be noticed  with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this from a friend as a gift. It is wonderful, strong but shouting. I use it as body splash but also on my bedding, it is wonderful</li>
    <li> OMG!  I got a bottle of this last year for my birthday and upon fisrt whiff of the product, I was hooked.  It has the most wonderful scent.  It&#x27;s strong , but not overpowering.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.  I went to get more and bought 2 bottles.  My first bottle lasted 4 months.  I rationed it until I was able to go down to the mall to get more.  If asked to choose my all time favorite body spray/ perfume, I&#x27;d have to say that Twilight Woods body spray by Bath and Body Works is the Number 1 choice for me.</li>
    <li> My friend encouraged me to use this scent after I decided not to get really into body scents anymore, but one spray of this stuff and I changed my policy! It smells beautiful and feminine, and so far it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the Bath and Body Works brand&#x27;s scents. I also like the fact that, even when you include shipping, the price of this perfume is still much cheaper on amazon.com than at the Bath and Body Works store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically...thumbs up for this body mist!</li>
    <li> The product came rather quickly and that was great. The only thing was that one of the bottles had leaked half its contents all over the paperwork and packaging. I went through the channels and did let the company know what happened. I asked if I should send back the invoice and bottle and to receive a replacement.I later received an \\&quot;email\\&quot; that my email had been received. But that was 2 weeks ago or more. I have not heard a word. Until now. About writing a review. The product smells fantastic, but the response was poor.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for christmas along with the bath gel and loition. I love it and use it every day. I have gotten a lot of compilments on how good it smells!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will definitly be buying more when the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I just like this scent. so I got both the spray and the body mist. They work great for me.</li>
    <li> Excelent&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for me. Very happy for my spalsh&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari Aqva Toniq Men Eau-De-Toilette Spray by Bvlgari, 3.4 Ounce</li>
    <li> Nice smell but very faint. Really not worth money.</li>
    <li> From what I read online in the description, this sounded like something I was sure I would like. I got it and although it smelled ok, there was a fragrance \\&quot;note\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on, that just didn&#x27;t smell right to me. It might be the mimosa, or the juicy berry note. I&#x27;m not sure. So after smelling this from time to time trying to convince myself that it might smell good on me, I gave up and gave it to my sons friend. She said she really liked it, so I told her she could have it instead. It would save me from sending it back.</li>
    <li> I was never really into body sprays but my friend took me into Bath and Body works a few months ago and when I found this I was in love! I have the spray, lotion, and the body wash and I LOVE them all. The price is also a plus from Amazon because now the body sprays are $14.50 in the store, so now even with shipping you;re saving money.</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed in this fragrance that seems kind of heavy but lame if you can understand that.  The bottle however is beautiful and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and loved the price.&lt;br /&gt;It has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I got my bottle months ago and it still has me smelling good !!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body spray and I received it in a surprisingly fast amount of time!</li>
    <li> My employee had bought me the dollar store version of this and I loved it. I thought the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; would HAVE to be better! NOT! It is far weaker and does not last for more than a half hr. or so.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s one of my Mother&#x27;s favorite body spray. However I did brought this Body &amp; Works Twilight Woods Signature Collection Mist Splash for my Mother&#x27;s Birthday.</li>
    <li> I wear this fragrance at least once a week, ad it&#x27;s lasted me forever! You don&#x27;t have to spray a ton to make yourself smell like a delicious mystery.</li>
    <li> Honestly twilight from bbw&#x27;s is a nice fragrance  and is one of their best products. The scent is kinda like a vanilla undertone, tuscan cypress (this is a hint of musk basically) and if I remember correctly either peach or nectarine blossom or a type of mimosa blossom which adds a light sweetish flowery smell. But truthfully speaking you can buy a BodyCology brand fragrance called \\&quot;enchanted forest\\&quot; smells pretty much the same but only costs $3.99 most retail at target or Walmart stores. It&#x27;s up to you,this is worth it but there is a less expensive, easier to obtain product In target/Walmart stores.</li>
    <li> First received this as a gift. I like that it&#x27;s not a cloying scent, it&#x27;s light and dissipates well. My favorite application is spraying it on freshly laundered sheets. I heard that B&amp;BW changed the formula so when I saw the old bottle here, I jumped on it and ordered a few bottles. They were delivered at warp speed and were very well packed; someone at &amp;#34;Teleported Treasures&amp;#34; took the time to tape all the bottle caps on. Very well done!</li>
