### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent shampoo for all men.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent shampoo.</li>
      <li>Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)  Shampoo/Conditioner was the perfect companion to &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (Hair Coloring and conditioning)</li>
      <li>We think this is a great shampoo for mens color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>good product considering me being allergic to this kind of stuff, and it does maintain the color of your hair.</li>
      <li>You can even call me a lying bonehead that cost you more money, if it pleases, as well.  :p</li>
      <li>nice to have a shampoo that&#x27;s not too harse of colored hair, just wish</li>
      <li>, glad I found it here</li>
      <li>How many bottles do you get for $25.00?  </li>
      <li>So why did the Just For Men company, cancel this wonderful product back in 2009?</li>
      <li>Great for those with colored hair or natural hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels clean and is easy to style.</li>
      <li>since it was 4 times the cost of original price when available</li>
      <li>There were some concerns over this purchase and all my questions were responded to quickly and with professionalism.</li>
      <li>I finally found the shampoo that I liked to use with the Just For Men hair coloring products and they discontinue it.  </li>
      <li>Cleans and has just a right amount of conditioner.</li>
      <li>Good shampoo, no longer made by manufacturer, but one would need to have Alzheimer&#x27;s to pay $40 for what used to sell for less than $5.</li>
      <li>I found that this product cleans your hair, keeps the color, has a fresh scent, and conditions the hair so that the hair has more body and luster than other shampoos.  </li>
      <li>There is no other shampoo that stays with your original color/conditioning like &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)</li>
      <li>And  I REALLY like the product.</li>
      <li>Allows color to last longer and look more natural.  </li>
      <li>The product was not any superior to other similar products but the price was very unreasonable.</li>
      <li>This is not a miracle product by any means, but I prefer the simple shampooing - which I&#x27;d daily perform anyway - to the more frequent dye usage, which is somewhat tedious on the best days.  </li>
      <li>It makes no sense to me.&amp;#34; They should know how many men still buy the existing product that’s still out there, and put it back out on the market as soon as possible!</li>
      <li>Since purchasing this product in August, I have found that the 3 1/2 weeks of color (in my experience), provided by the Just For Men hair dye, gets an extra week to ten days of strong hues before greying toward normal.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t leave hair very soft</li>
      <li>My husband uses the hair color and this shampoo is not harsh on it and the color lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by both my barber and a young fellow in a drugstore.  </li>
      <li>I have searched high and low online and can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an excellent shampoo for all men.  Cleans and has just a right amount of conditioner. Hair feels clean and is easy to style.Only need to lather and rinse once. Doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s shampoo.  Great for those with colored hair or natural hair.  Recommended by both my barber and a young fellow in a drugstore.  Very poorly promoted by the company whose main target is men who color their hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before while using the color product.  I found that this product cleans your hair, keeps the color, has a fresh scent, and conditions the hair so that the hair has more body and luster than other shampoos.  I have found only a few places that still carry the product.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works as advertised.  Does not strip color.  Enhances color.  Allows color to last longer and look more natural.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)  Shampoo/Conditioner was the perfect companion to &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (Hair Coloring and conditioning) There is no other shampoo that stays with your original color/conditioning like &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1) So why did the Just For Men company, cancel this wonderful product back in 2009?

The only other company I have found to do things like this is Sony. If it isn’t broke do not fix it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product no longer available in stores. And  I REALLY like the product. However I feel it&#x27;s waaaaaaaaaaay overpriced !!!</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this product in August, I have found that the 3 1/2 weeks of color (in my experience), provided by the Just For Men hair dye, gets an extra week to ten days of strong hues before greying toward normal.

    <li> The product was not any superior to other similar products but the price was very unreasonable. At this price I will buy Infusion Colorologie</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find an expensive to boot...Just for men should not discontinue this product.....</li>
    <li> There were some concerns over this purchase and all my questions were responded to quickly and with professionalism. The items purchased arrived on time. I would definitely deal with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> good product considering me being allergic to this kind of stuff, and it does maintain the color of your hair.</li>
    <li> How many bottles do you get for $25.00?  Five?  Six?  Doesn&#x27;t say.  I previously purchased at Walgreens for $4 or $5 each.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, no longer made by manufacturer, but one would need to have Alzheimer&#x27;s to pay $40 for what used to sell for less than $5.</li>
    <li> too expensive for just 1 bottle.  since it was 4 times the cost of original price when available I thought there might be 4 bottles&lt;br /&gt;wouldnt purchase again</li>
    <li> I finally found the shampoo that I liked to use with the Just For Men hair coloring products and they discontinue it.  Why?  I have searched high and low online and can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I&#x27;m in the USA and I did find it in Australia but I&#x27;m not going to pay the outrageous shipping charge to order shampoo.  Curses to you JFM for cancelling this product!!</li>
    <li> nice to have a shampoo that&#x27;s not too harse of colored hair, just wish&lt;br /&gt;it would help with dandruff control also.  doesn&#x27;t leave hair very soft</li>
