### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this deoderant is awesome!</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m riding a horse with a beautiful girl through a waterfall while being serenaded by mermaids.</li>
      <li>Great scent.  </li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s happy with this</li>
      <li>Smells great and works well.</li>
      <li>Not the kind I wanted!</li>
      <li>Your arm pits will smell good and that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>All my friends tell me how good i smell and that it reminds them of the beach.</li>
      <li>Love the Spice!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>These were cheaper than buying them in the store and just as nice smelling.</li>
      <li>My favorite.</li>
      <li>My hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.  </li>
      <li>Some women find the men&#x27;s deodorants work better</li>
      <li>and this is a really nice, fresh, not-too-strong smell.</li>
      <li>My teenage girls use and love it lol</li>
      <li>I bought this for my tween son who hates the strong cologne smell deodorants  </li>
      <li>Luckily, it smells awesome and is my official scent ever since I started wearing it a few years ago.</li>
      <li>Has a freshh clean smell to it.</li>
      <li>However, it works surprisingly well despite that fact; I can actually get away with using it and not stinking.  </li>
      <li>So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective and easier to apply than the white stick.</li>
      <li>After getting a sampler Old Spice set for my husband one year, I feel in love with the smell of the Fiji deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when it&#x27;s available on S&amp;S</li>
      <li>Long lasting, doesn&#x27;t leave a whole lot of residue, smells great!</li>
      <li>It is indeed fresh and lasts throughout the whole day without reapplication.</li>
      <li>I guess this is personal, but I love how this smells.  </li>
      <li>(I love it), but for some reason it irritates my armpits, leaving them rash-like (in appearance only) after a day&#x27;s use.</li>
      <li>Either way I am dissatisfied, it should have been packed better, I taped it back together, so I guess he&#x27;ll just have to deal.</li>
      <li>Although I normally like the clear gel, Fiji Scent for Men has a clean scent that is unmistakable.</li>
      <li>I wish they make clear ones, I will be buying them again and again regardless and love the fact I can get it to my home without going to local store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet with only a background of a traditional Old Spice scent.  </li>
      <li>I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend giving this one a pass.</li>
      <li>Thus, on days I have this specific deodorant on, I normally stick with just putting this on and not both.</li>
      <li>The scent is not overwhelming, however it&#x27;s strong enough to act almost as a cologne replacement.</li>
      <li>I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to.</li>

<li> I have used old Spice brand for last 5 years and will never go back to any other brand.</li>
<li> I am an avid Old Spice user from the first time I tried their pure sport deodorant and I have never been disappointed!</li>
<li> Love the scent but this irritated my armpits like crazy, leaving them itchy all day.</li>
<li> My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a solid deodorant that lasts me all day however the con is that if you apply it to your sweaty armpit you will feel extreme pain and irritation.</li>
<li> Arrived without a lid or clear protector that deodorant sticks usually have, making me think that it was used already......</li>
<li> Probably the least offensive old spice smell and we saved 15% using amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save.</li>
<li> The other island scents are merely average.</li>
<li> Tried it for a few days to see if I just had to get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it.</li>
<li> This smells like a little coconut with a little musk, so it doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s Secret Coconut Splash.</li>
<li> I realized too late that I wanted anti-perspirant, not deodorant.</li>
<li> Sucks to be them.</li>
<li> When I opened it in the mail the lid was broken in two.</li>
<li> I am unsure if it was sent to me broken or if it was broken in the mail.</li>
<li> Everyone else stinks but me.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find deodorant (read: NOT antiperspirant) for women that have staying power - if you can find them at all.  </li>

    <li> My teenage girls use and love it lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m riding a horse with a beautiful girl through a waterfall while being serenaded by mermaids.</li>
    <li> I have used old Spice brand for last 5 years and will never go back to any other brand. Only thing I dont like is the blue stains it can make sometimes on white shirts. I wish they make clear ones, I will be buying them again and again regardless and love the fact I can get it to my home without going to local store.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Repeat Customer</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  It reminds me of standing in a crowd in Waikiki during Halloween.  Everyone else stinks but me.  Sucks to be them.</li>
    <li> This item is on re-order.  Seeing how I don&#x27;t go through massive amounts of sticks of deodorant in short periods of time, I have a back-stock of this Fiji scent. Luckily, it smells awesome and is my official scent ever since I started wearing it a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to. So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.

After getting a sampler Old Spice set for my husband one year, I feel in love with the smell of the Fiji deodorant.  It&#x27;s sweet with only a background of a traditional Old Spice scent.  It works perfectly for me and I get complimented on the scent regularly.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, doesn&#x27;t leave a whole lot of residue, smells great! I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when it&#x27;s available on S&amp;S</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> Your arm pits will smell good and that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but this irritated my armpits like crazy, leaving them itchy all day. Tried it for a few days to see if I just had to get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it. No go, still had the itchiness. I think I&#x27;ll use the Antiperspirant variety from now on as that provided no irritation whatsoever. This ended up in the trash. If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend giving this one a pass.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my tween son who hates the strong cologne smell deodorants  He&#x27;s happy with this and I like it, too.This smells like a little coconut with a little musk, so it doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s Secret Coconut Splash. It&#x27;s still a man&#x27;s deodorant, but I think a woman could wear it too. Some women find the men&#x27;s deodorants work better and this is a really nice, fresh, not-too-strong smell.</li>
    <li> this deoderant is awesome! All my friends tell me how good i smell and that it reminds them of the beach.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was a deodorant only (not antiperspirant).  However, it works surprisingly well despite that fact; I can actually get away with using it and not stinking.  Smells like vacation (I love it), but for some reason it irritates my armpits, leaving them rash-like (in appearance only) after a day&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant. Probably the least offensive old spice smell and we saved 15% using amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save. Now I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy it for him and I get it cheaper than in the store!</li>
    <li> Not the kind I wanted! I realized too late that I wanted anti-perspirant, not deodorant.</li>
    <li> These were cheaper than buying them in the store and just as nice smelling. I also checked and the size is the same 2.6oz.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am in the process of making a care package for my boyfriend. When I opened it in the mail the lid was broken in two. I am unsure if it was sent to me broken or if it was broken in the mail. Either way I am dissatisfied, it should have been packed better, I taped it back together, so I guess he&#x27;ll just have to deal.</li>
    <li> I guess this is personal, but I love how this smells.  It&#x27;s effective and easier to apply than the white stick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a solid deodorant that lasts me all day however the con is that if you apply it to your sweaty armpit you will feel extreme pain and irritation. I don&#x27;t know why it just hurts when you apply it and you have just sweated.</li>
    <li> Arrived without a lid or clear protector that deodorant sticks usually have, making me think that it was used already......</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great scent.  Love the Spice!</li>
