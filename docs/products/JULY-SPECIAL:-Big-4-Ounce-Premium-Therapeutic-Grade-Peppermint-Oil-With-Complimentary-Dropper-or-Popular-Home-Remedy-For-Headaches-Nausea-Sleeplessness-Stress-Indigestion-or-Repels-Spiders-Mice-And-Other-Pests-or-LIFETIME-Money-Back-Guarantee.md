    <li> arrived in a timely manner.  have not used it yet, but did smell it and it is great</li>
    <li> Great product, price and communication from seller ....</li>
    <li> This was a great offer, thank you!  I love the oil, it smells great.  I&#x27;ll look to purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love diffusing Peppermint oil with Lavender when I get home and wind down from work.!</li>
    <li> LHXHVYDI coupon code and got it for a dollar for 4 oz bottle . Cant beat that.</li>
    <li> What a good deal! It&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle - quite large for an essential oil! And it&#x27;s therapeutic grade! I&#x27;m quite pleased as there are so many things you can do with peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great value!</li>
    <li> This Is The Best Smelling Peppermint Essential Oil I Have Ever Bought. I Will Buy Again Thank You</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I&#x27;M DEBATING ABOUT USING IT INTERNALLY, I PRESENTLY DOING RESEARCH IF ITS SAFE TO.</li>
    <li> When colds and flu are around I use peppermint oil in bedrooms to help clear nasal passages for breathing...Put a little on a cotton ball and set it on a stand and it will fill the room and help breathing.  It is a wonderful product...Thank you</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Oil smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was having a small mice problem and had read that peppermint oil was useful as a deterrent. I am happy to say that it seems to be working. I also had a severe pain in my shoulder and the peppermint oil really helped to alleviate the pain. The large bottle will last me for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is strong stuff.  Got rid of the ants almost immediately, which is what I bought it for.  I just put some on a cotton ball and spread it around where they were congregating, then left the cotton ball in a corner.  There were a few the next morning but not nearly as many.  Did this for a few more nights, and then they were totally gone.  Wanted to get rid of them especially before we went on vacation.  I was wondering if they would make a reappearance while we were gone, but they did not. Very pleased.  Giving some to my son to see if it helps with his mouse problem at his place in the woods.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Is great for colds and anything you can think of&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order another bottle</li>
    <li> I had a terrible sinus headache this morning. I rubbed some of this oil on the area above my eyebrows, and the pain was immediately gone and has not returned in the 8 hours since. With other peppermint EO&#x27;s and lotions that I&#x27;ve used for headache and sinus pain, the pain is immediately numbed, but when the product wears off the pain is still there. This is in all honesty the only peppermint EO I&#x27;ve used, including the ones from MLM companies, that has produced this result. While I applied the oil undiluted in a small amount to my skin, I would like to state that you should consider diluting the oil if you have not used it before and/or if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this offer I am enjoying the oil.</li>
    <li> My husband took his Jeep to be serviced about a week ago for break work.  At the time he also asked the mechanic to look and make sure there weren&#x27;t any problems.  The mechanic finished the work on the brake system and called him to the shop to look at some things.  The &amp;#34;some things&amp;#34;  turned out to be a mouse next in his engine compartment.  He then took my hubby to a car on the lift and opened the hood and showed him a mess.  Mice had not only built a nest there, but had eaten wiring, rubber hoses, even the tops off the spart plugs.  The man had over 3,000 dollars worth of damage caused by those tiny mice.  My hubby asked, &amp;#34;What do I do?&amp;#34;.  The mechanic then told him to put a can in the engine compartment.  then put three or four cotton balls in the can.  put on a lid which he had drilled holes in the top.  Then he told bill to buy some peppermint essencial oil, but to get the good stuff, really quality and it would stop mice dead.  They apparently hate pepperming.  So, hubby cleaned out two cat food cans, purchased hard plastic covers purchased at Walmart (pet food can lids).  He drilled a hole in the side away from moving parts and screwed it down.  Sure enough.  NO More MICE!!  What a shock.  Then we used them in our log cabin.  We have a mouse problem as all who live in the woods do.  But not any more.  One cotton ball in each drawer, no more mouse poop, no more mice at all.  Then I used jellly Jars, one for each set of cabinets.  Any two door cabinate will be covered.  I put four cotton balls and drilled holes in the metal rings.  No More mice, or ants or anything at all.......and it smells nice too.  I espically appreciated the booklet of a ton of other uses for this essensial oil.  Wonderful product, great useful and love it.</li>
    <li> Received my Peppermint right away. It&#x27;s a large bottle and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Fantastic bargain!</li>
    <li> Top notch customer service, and I absolutely am 100% pleased with the quality of this product! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love! I will be using this as a flavoring for mints and to diffuse for a &amp;#34;Christmas&amp;#34; scent in my home!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love love love my peppermint oil! Perfect size for all my projects!</li>
    <li> living in the country we get our share of mice and spiders, the peppermint seems to be helping quite a bit.. thanks</li>
    <li> was pleasantly surprised to find these were on sale when I placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;This is great quality.</li>
    <li> Love it arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> excellent quality great customer service  i will absolutly use this company for my future oil purchases  i am very impressed with the strength of the oil and the price is fantastic  im used to purchasing oils from a company that is and extremly expensive  now that i &#x27;ve found this company i &#x27;m able to enjoy my oils at an affordable price  thank you</li>
    <li> Great for keeping mice away</li>
    <li> Fast service - great product</li>
    <li> Good packaging of the product and speedy delivery.  A quality product that will work for my needs superbly.  It smells just wonderful and is a good quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product,best peppermint oil I have used,shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!  I use this to freshen breath, drink in water for upset or acid stomach, apply to temples for headache.  I also diffuse in the air to make my house smell wonderful. Really lifts the mood and makes my house smell wonderful. LOVE this product.  Great deal at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  It was described perfectly and was delivered promptly!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t wait to use to to make my toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Very potent! Just the way it&#x27;s supposed to be. :-)</li>
    <li> I really like this peppermint oil,  I have used it my laudry room to get rid of ants.  It works for rubbing on the chest with a carrier oil to help open up your sinus&#x27;s as well as use of tired and sore muscles again, with a carrier oil. You can add a few drops to water and use it as a mouthwash. It feels wonderful on the feet in a soak.  There are also several recipes on the internet to make your self a scrub with this oil.  The immaculife oil has a candy cane like aroma, I was not able to find any info on the distillation process from immaculife.  I was impressed that even though it was a larger bottle it still had the reducer cap so that I didn&#x27;t end up dumbing oil when I only wanted a few drops. I would purchase this oil again.  Due to the lack of information I wouldn&#x27;t use this one internally.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful find!!!  reasonably priced and great quality!!</li>
    <li> It came on time and everything worked out great with it.  The product is far superior to any other Peppermint oil I have found.  Thanks  so much.</li>
    <li> Wow...what a bargain this was!!!..with a coupon (that another customer was nice enough to post), this cost $1.00!! -- It is just a potent as any other peppermint oil I have purchased!  How could I not be thrilled w/this bargain!!!??  If you can use this coupon, I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality product.  Just wish that they had other oils available.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love my Peppermint oil!! As soon as I removed the cap the smell was divine! I have been suffering with migraines for several months, prescribed several different types of medication with little to no relief. As soon as I used the Peppermint Oil I was feeling better almost instantly! Then (only because I was feeling better) I used the Peppermint Oil to keep the mice out of my home from the feed mill next door to us. Next, I used it in homemade peppermint fudge, and homemade peppermint dog treats (greenies) for my 3 Fur Kids! I definitely am not exaggerating when I am saying to you, BEFORE I used this Peppermint Oil for my Migraine, I wasn&#x27;t able to do anything. Dr.Oz even spoke about the many benefits of this Peppermint Oil! Just don&#x27;t buy low quality!! Order the Best and its Right Here!! :-)</li>
    <li> This really is a large bottle of peppermint oil! I like that it is steam distilled and 100% pure, and it really does smell like peppermint candy. I plan to use this around the house and in my homemade body care recipes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gives our home a very pleasant aroma,  helps my wife sinus, also the scent has gotten rid of ants that had started to come in our home. Excellent and fast transaction! I highly recommend this product and company, looks forward to doing business with again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am using the peppermint oil in my diffuser and my apartment smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Great peppermint works well on Ants!!</li>
    <li> Top Notch Peppermint Oil.  I have used it to relieve headaches by applying it to the temples and back of the neck.  Also placed a few drops in my humidifier to help with sinus issues during these dry winter months.  What a wonderful improvement.  Will definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it use daily has helped with stomach.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  I put this oil in my cabinets in my cellar and around my garage.  It smells great not overpowering like some oils and is a small rodent detterent.  The best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> i love love love this! its so much stronger than others that i&#x27;ve purchased and i only 1 drop of it to do my aroma therapy compared to others that i&#x27;ve used that require about 4 or 5 drops. I did receive this product at a discounted price, but I will definitely purchase at full price.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
    <li> Everything I expected</li>
    <li> Excellent product, a bit pricey though.</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil smells wonderful. I have been putting it straight on my achy joints and muscles and it gives quick refreshing relief!</li>
    <li> Smell great. A little goes a long way. It works great for nausea.</li>
