      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Okay, I don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
      <li>I do love this product and I will order again, but the packaging that the product comes in has a defect.</li>
      <li>and sometimes it&#x27;s drastically more.</li>
      <li>However, I was pleased to find that this product caused me no irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Using this for many years.</li>
      <li>Love the coverage.</li>
      <li>love stuff that works this well..</li>
      <li>There is more product, it covers better, and it doesn&#x27;t settle in creases.  </li>
      <li>This is okay</li>
      <li>Works much better than even the heaviest flesh-tinted concealers.</li>
      <li>and it works better than I thought at brightening your eye area.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Her makeup lasts long and she looks damn good!!</li>
      <li>effect on the eyelids themselves were pretty good.</li>
      <li>People wonder why my skin always shines brightly around my eyes-this is my best kept secret :)</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a mirror in the lid, so it&#x27;s easy to make touch-ups.  </li>
      <li>It is a great and safe cover up for the redness and irritation that remains around the eye for several weeks.</li>
      <li>It is creamy and applies easily with your fingertip.  </li>
      <li>The creamy texture is easy to blend and stays where you put it.    </li>
      <li>So easy and</li>
      <li>I then tried it on top of a variety of products, including a primer that normally makes everything stick and not budge, but this just kept settling into lines and creasing when I smiled.</li>
      <li>Apply lightly using ur finger, dont use brush.</li>
      <li>It is a bit TOO LIGHT for my skin color....</li>
      <li>This product hides the color variations of the eyelid and gives a smooth surface to apply eye shadow on or leave eyelids as is.  </li>
      <li>I have worn it a few times and I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
      <li>I follow up with a light concealer.  </li>
      <li>it covers perfectly, lasts all day,doesn&#x27;t look cakey, REALLY brightens my eyes and makes my eyeshadow last all day as well....</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff, certainly does exactly as described and easily to apply to eye area, the best buy I made for my discolorations around my eye area, I have seen it but never purchased till now, I will be back again</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find that true for me since I felt it sort of &#x27;highlighted&#x27; the area being the concealer is so much lighter than my own skin tone.</li>
      <li>I was already familiar with this product</li>
      <li>I love love love this yellow concealer.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for their other concealers (Boing and Erase Paste), but this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>It really brightens my eyes and makes me look rested and healthy.  </li>
      <li>you can no longer see the pouches...amazing but true.</li>
      <li>( other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>-I purchased this for a steal ($10 including shipping),especially considering the Benefit brand is fairly reputable, but most likely will not buy again.</li>
      <li>It also works well to counteract the redness of my mild rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also kind of greasy and if you have Asian eyelids, it will leave an oily crease on your eyelid line.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars simply because it&#x27;s nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>Gently blend in...and you are 10 years younger, and good to</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this ...and many others for that clean blank canvas on the eyelid.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, this is a good buy :)</li>
      <li>Honestly, I am pretty much all thumbs when it comes to most makeup, but I can really work with this stuff and see</li>
      <li>Uncle Fester style circles right here</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last quite a full workday, but it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a few tips to best use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was too dry to apply nicely</li>
      <li>It was very promising.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy and excited to try this out after seeing it suggested in several make up tutorial videos, but it seems this product does a vanishing act on my super pale skin...</li>
      <li>Just be cautious at first.</li>
      <li>How refreshing to find a product that actually does what it claims to do!!  </li>
      <li>bought it hoping it would be more versatile for the price rather than a one-trick pony, but instead I&#x27;ll need to just keep it for the eyelids only and advise anyone over 30 (or with drying skin) to consider something else to combat redness on your cheeks.</li>
      <li>This product is just \\&quot;pretty good\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>There are a ton of fans of Lemon Aid, but unfortunately, I am not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for lids and covering other red areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and you get a good amount of product for what you pay for, considering you should use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton on makeup products, but this one is a new staple and welllll worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I figured ok maybe the product needs time to dry</li>
      <li>I will certainly repurchase this again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried so many other highly rated (and very expensive) concealers, but nothing works as well as this one. I use this as both an under eye concealer and eyelid primer. It never cakes or creases and lasts all day long. The yellow tint helps camouflage any darkness or red undertones. The color works any time of the year, no matter how pale I am in the winter or tan in the summer. If I wear no other makeup, I don&#x27;t leave the house without this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product.  It really does cover-up any redness or other discoloration around the eyes, though I do wonder if it would work as well on darker skin tones than mine which is pretty pale.  There&#x27;s a mirror in the lid, so it&#x27;s easy to make touch-ups.  It doesn&#x27;t last quite a full workday, but it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever tried, and I LOVE cosmetics. This is a must have for anyones makeup bag. It is perfect for eyelids which it was intended for, but also great for blemishes. This will cover anything that is red. So say a pimple sprouts up or even if you get redness around the nose in the winter months- this is perfect for it. Some other concealers I have used tend to get very dry, this one is nice and creamy so it doesnt get cakey looking on skin. Sometimes I use it for brightening eyes after I put makeup on. Or you can use it before makeup as a primer to even skin tone. Its perfect for people who use powder foundation too. This way you cover up anything but don&#x27;t have to cover your face in a thick liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I have dark undereye circles and reddness around my eyes.  I dab this on above and below the eyes, than after it warms up I blend it in.  Next I follow with my foundation.  When I apply my eyeliner and mascara, it just seems to make my eyes pop.  It does crease in the eye lids and I have to reblend at least once in the first few hours, but it is a small trade off for not looking so tired.  Nothing worse than someone telling you how tired you look and you had 10 hours of sleep and was feeling great.  I naturally lie and say, \\&quot;I hardly slept all night\\&quot;.  Vanity stops me from admitting the terrible truth.  I will certainly repurchase this again.  Oh, and it appears it will last a long time as you use such a small amount each time.</li>
    <li> I love almost all of Benefit&#x27;s makeup, but Lemon-ade was horrible for me. It was too dry to apply nicely and so I dabbed it carefully and thinly.Within a couple of hours I had swelling and redness under my eyes that was very noticeable. It took several days to calm down. I waited a week or two, and then decided to try it again, thinking I might have been reacting to something else. Within an hour it looked as though I had been hit under my eyes....with marked swelling and a deep reddishness. Normally I do NOT have sensitive skin and am a medium light olive complexion. Too bad, the idea was great. Obviously it works for some people. Just be cautious at first.</li>
    <li> This product, by far, is the best on the market. After years of working in the beauty industry as well as using this product personally for 11 years, nothing tops it! It&#x27;s light, brightening, and always the perfect pick-me-up. I never leave home without it. People wonder why my skin always shines brightly around my eyes-this is my best kept secret :)</li>
    <li> How refreshing to find a product that actually does what it claims to do!!  Goes on smoothly, not yellowish-in-color when applied and blended and no, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product for use.  Used on lids and under-eye...works very well on both areas.  Would recommend product!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy and excited to try this out after seeing it suggested in several make up tutorial videos, but it seems this product does a vanishing act on my super pale skin...&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so... I get this stuff in the mail, now, I was warned in one of the videos that it was VERY thick and hard to work with so I stuck it under my leg for a few minutes until the compact was warm and the product melted some and was easier to work with. (trust me this helps) So I put a little on my fingertip and patted some on my right eyelid, nothing, I look in my magnified mirror, still nothing. I put a little more on my fingertip then on my eyelid, still nothing. Now I know there&#x27;s product on my eyelid as I can feel it AND when I blinked I saw a faint yellow crease across my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt; I figured ok maybe the product needs time to dry so I try the same method on my other eye, only this time I didn&#x27;t blink, I left my eye closed for a few seconds then blinked, nope, still saw the same faint yellow crease and it didn&#x27;t cover up any of the redness on either of my eyelids, it just seemed to disappear on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I got better results just using a little bit of my regular (and less expensive)concealer on my eyelids, Shadow Insurance as a primer and some white eyeshadow on top of that, covered up the redness and made my eyes look much better then this waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love love love this yellow concealer.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought, and it&#x27;s amazing for red or purple zits.  It also works well for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and the bruised color the skin holds for months after a zit heals.    I also use it under my eyes if I look like I lost sleep.  The creamy texture is easy to blend and stays where you put it.    Great product all around.</li>
    <li> This lightweight concealer works well on under-eye dark shadows, and is also a fine, subtle highlighter under foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real magic is for anyone dealing with reddish discoloration from rosacea, scarring, bruising, broken veins, acne, or other irritation. The yellow tint of this concealer is very effective in camouflaging red and purple tones of such flaws. Works much better than even the heaviest flesh-tinted concealers. Put this down first, then dust on mineral based powder foundation, and you&#x27;ll get far better coverage than with traditional foundations and covers.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique Touch Base for the Eyes for many years and was happy with it.  I have fair skin and my eyelids have always been \\&quot;splotchy\\&quot; looking.  And, if I don&#x27;t wear a base on them, I will break out from many eye shadow products.  That said, Benefit&#x27;s Lemon Aid is far superior to the Touch Base.  There is more product, it covers better, and it doesn&#x27;t settle in creases.  It also brightens my eyes - which is a must for a busy teacher and mom of four!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works differently for different people, but for me it was like putting yellow vaseline on my eyelid.  Don&#x27;t even try putting eyeshadow over this because it looks heavy and makes it difficult to blend.  It&#x27;s also kind of greasy and if you have Asian eyelids, it will leave an oily crease on your eyelid line.  I used it for one week and I really wish I could return.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of purchasing this product for the first time, I have really dark circles under my eyes. When it was shipped I was a little disappointed about the size. I imagined it a little bigger but it&#x27;s basically the size of the picture. But it has lasted a really long time. It definitely paid off. It covers my dark circles and brightens my eyes. It&#x27;s also great from eye shadow primer. I recommend everyone to give it a try!</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoys this product. And I know I do too. Her makeup lasts long and she looks damn good!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in error since I thought it was for something else.  However, I really like it.  It is a primer that goes on your eye lid and it covers up shadows and evens out your skin tone for application of shadow or just to wear alone. It also brightens up your eye lid if you wear it alone, which is nice. It is creamy and applies easily with your fingertip.  It is a little pricey, but I would buy it again since you only use a little dab so it lasts a long time.  It is in a nice, secure case as well.</li>
    <li> Been wanting to try this and saw it on Amazon at a good price.  I do like it and it works better than I thought at brightening your eye area.</li>
    <li> Ok...I have puffy eye pouches which look worse in the AM if I ate salty food the day before. I was seriously considering getting them surgically removed, but then I started using Lemon Aid, and I am not thinking surgery anymore. Honestly, I am pretty much all thumbs when it comes to most makeup, but I can really work with this stuff and see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a few tips to best use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dip your brush into some type of thick creamy moisturizer(I use Nivea), then into the Lemon Aid. It just glides on, and is very easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;2. To best cover the awful pouches, tilt your head slightly down while looking into the mirror. See those dark rings at the bottom of the pouches? Put the concealer on just those dark rings...not on the pouches themselves. I learned that the pouches cause shadows that form the dark ring, so if you can make those shadows go away....voila... you can no longer see the pouches...amazing but true. Gently blend in...and you are 10 years younger, and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I love stuff that works this well..</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE THE FORMULA HAS BEEN CHANGED OR POSSIBLY THE PRODUCT WAS FLAWED IN SOME WAY. HAS  A GREASY TEXTURE INSTEAD OF A CREAMY TEXTURE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for quite some time to find an eye shadow primer that actually works. They all work *sort of*. This one makes eye shadow brighter and eliminated the awful creases for me! I was surprised at how it really does brighten the eye area- I had no problem with sticky or difficult to manage product (as a couple of other reviews suggest), but I did rub it for just a moment to make it creamy just in case. I LOVE this stuff. I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton on makeup products, but this one is a new staple and welllll worth the cost.</li>
    <li> While it does color correct, it creases within a couple of hours, taking your shadow or concealer with it so that you have only a couple of yellow lines where you used to have a wash of color. I returned it within a week.</li>
    <li> I will never give this product up.  I have deep set eyes and by applying Lemon Aid it just really brightens the eye lid - when I add eye shadow it sticks and doesn&#x27;t cake.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, certainly does exactly as described and easily to apply to eye area, the best buy I made for my discolorations around my eye area, I have seen it but never purchased till now, I will be back again when I run out of it, I totally advise people to buy and recommend it greatly!!</li>
    <li> maybe i just have really greasy eyelids, but this stuff rubs off and forms yellow lines in the creases of my eyelids within 10 minutes. So before im even done doing my makeup it already starts coming off. That really sucks because i LOVE how it looks when i first put it on, but it just doesn&#x27;t stay on! How can it be used as a primer if it wont stick? Next time i think i&#x27;ll just be buying a soft yellow eyeshadow and wear primer under it, at least that way it will last more than 10 minutes!!</li>
    <li> Great primer as well as concealer !!! Stays put!!! I&#x27;ve been a user of this product for years, would recommend</li>
    <li> It wasnt as creamy as I though, it looked kinda hard but...once I used my finger to apply product on top of the lids and under eyes, miracle! It looked light and natural and not heavy and creamy. Apply lightly using ur finger, dont use brush. Product warms with heat of the finger and a little bit is all u need.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this primer! I put it on my eyelids up to my eyebrows and then just add a dark brown eyeshadow on the corner of my lids.... So easy and it looks like I know what I&#x27;m doing! Seriously, this is a good buy :)</li>
    <li> I am a lover of benefit lemon aid.  If you are a woman of color and you are wanting your eyeshadow to be vivid this Item is an excellent Item to have. Especially when some colors are not as pigmented as others. It is easy to apply eyeshadow does not crease a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great for lids and covering other red areas.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little to spread without tugging at eyes. A concealer brush helps.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I start with this stuff to minimize the dark circles I sometimes get.  I follow up with a light concealer.  Last a long time.  Very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> this is meant for eyelids i think, but some of the other reviewers said they used it under their eyes for under eye circles. i tried that &amp; it looked, well, yellow and weird. i had to wash it all off. i was disappointed because i wanted something for underneath my eyes, but it still gets 4 stars because it works well on the eyelids as it&#x27;s intended.</li>
    <li> clumpy and flaky. terrible.</li>
    <li> This arrived promptly. It is a bit TOO LIGHT for my skin color....I need to COVER it with a darker foundation.</li>
    <li> I recently had eyelid surgery.  Lemon Aid was recommended to me by a friend who had the same surgery previously.  It is a great and safe cover up for the redness and irritation that remains around the eye for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this concealer. I typically use a soft brush to apply and it stays put. A little goes a long way. I think if I applied it without a brush it might be more difficult to spread, so I have stuck with the brush. It&#x27;s not dry but it&#x27;s not wet either. It will last a long time and I&#x27;m glad to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I have sallow skin and dark circles under my eyes. I have tried many concealers and found this one to be the best lid primers; it brightens my lid and inner eye area and has doe not wear off. For my eye lids, it can be used alone or under eye make-up. I also use a dab below the bridge of my nose. I would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but when I tried patting this onto my cheeks, the drying effect was immediate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect on the eyelids themselves were pretty good. It does open up the eyes. But putting it just *under* my eyes doesn&#x27;t look so well. Anywhere outside the eyelids, it&#x27;s cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it hoping it would be more versatile for the price rather than a one-trick pony, but instead I&#x27;ll need to just keep it for the eyelids only and advise anyone over 30 (or with drying skin) to consider something else to combat redness on your cheeks.</li>
    <li> This product is just \\&quot;pretty good\\&quot;. I would agree with a previous review that without powder this product can look very greasy ( I believe the previous review used the term \\&quot;like vaseline\\&quot;)when used as an under eye concealer. Instead, I like to use it has a spot concealer on red blemishes or on the small broken capillaries around my nose-the yellow tone aids in covering these red areas. Final thoughts-I purchased this for a steal ($10 including shipping),especially considering the Benefit brand is fairly reputable, but most likely will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok....so it&#x27;s an eyelid primer...but I use it under my eyes as well....I have really dark circles under my eyes as well as naturally dark lids ....Ever seen &amp;#34;The Adams Family&amp;#34;? Uncle Fester style circles right here ladies, not kidding lol! It takes very little of this to cover my lid and under eye area....I use it EVERYDAY and one compact last me about 6-7months...it covers perfectly, lasts all day,doesn&#x27;t look cakey, REALLY brightens my eyes and makes my eyeshadow last all day as well....I apply it with a small brush....it&#x27;s my favorite thing in my bag of beauty tricks!!!</li>
    <li> This is okay but a little pricey and I don&#x27;t see that it makes a big difference. I have worn it a few times and I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
    <li> A big help for my old eyes.</li>
    <li> However, I find that even the warmth if my finger isn&#x27;t enough to make this baby creamy. I like the product, but it&#x27;s just too dry for me to use it well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this ...and many others for that clean blank canvas on the eyelid.  This is by far the best I ever used!  It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, never gets runny or messy.  This prepares your lid area perfectly for whatever look you plan to create.  A little goes a long way...so this lasts for months!  Won&#x27;t be without it !</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have semi-sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive about reviews I had seen regarding irritation. However, I was pleased to find that this product caused me no irritation whatsoever. It is a very nice, light yellow that really does wonders brightening up tired eyes! It also goes on very easily with a concealer brush. My only qualm is that, even with powder, I have a hard time preventing it from moving into the creases of my lid as the day progresses, but I just got the product, so I have time to work with that. All in all, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t get it.  I applied as directed and honestly, did not see any results.  The product seems very thick, dry and cakey.  I gave it two stars simply because it&#x27;s nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> GREAT!  this is the best cover up for redness, blueness, and any discolorations.  I can&#x27;t live without this!!  Does great under eyes, around nose, under eyebrows as a highlighter, inside corner of eyes too</li>
    <li> From the reviews, I took this item to work well as somewhat of a concealer for around the eyes.  It was very promising.  I thought the color would work very well and you get a good amount of product for what you pay for, considering you should use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am returning this item.  I expected the formula to be fairly creamy to make blending it easy, however it was pretty dry and was very difficult to spread.  I used my fingers, a brush, a makeup sponge wedge and nothing worked very well.  I tried adding some eye cream as recommended, but it didn&#x27;t blend well at all.  Instead, it went on really cakey-like and made deep creases in the fine lines around my eyes.  I also tried heating it up a bit with my hands, but that didn&#x27;t soften it any.  I tried using it just on my eyelids, but again, that cakey look was all I could achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch, and I usually try to use products even if I don&#x27;t love them, but I found this to be pretty much unusable for my needs.  There are a ton of fans of Lemon Aid, but unfortunately, I am not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because it had potential, it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on a sidenote, I ordered this on Thursday AM (10/4/12) with an estimated delivery date of 10/6 (Saturday).  Friday evening (10/5) I got an email from Amazon saying shipping had been delayed, but that the product would ship soon.  Sunday (10/7) I found it had been delivered the day before as expected, then Monday (10/8) I received an email from Amazon saying it had shipped.  Not sure why there was the confusion and I wouldn&#x27;t rate the seller down for that because I think it was a fluke, but it was kinda confusing.  Just keep that in mind if it happens to you.  I have Prime and it arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and it did not do as promised.  I applied a little to under eye and it barely covered the dark circles; instead, it seemed to enhance it.  This is my personal experience.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Nothing misleading about this it goes on smooth and does quite well at hiding dark circles. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do love this product and I will order again, but the packaging that the product comes in has a defect. It&#x27;s very difficult to open, I have to use a pen to Jimmy it open every morning .:-( other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product that I have been wearing for years. Definitely worth the price. Stays on all day &amp; brightens up my eyes. Love that I can buy it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Using this for many years. Love the coverage.</li>
    <li> My wife says it is a miracle concealer and would have given it a 10/10 if possible!</li>
    <li> Got it really fast.  Was exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product as directed, but it didn&#x27;t work. It creased terribly, and made my very fine lines appear gigantic. I then tried it on top of a variety of products, including a primer that normally makes everything stick and not budge, but this just kept settling into lines and creasing when I smiled. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product and I knew that I really liked it.  This product hides the color variations of the eyelid and gives a smooth surface to apply eye shadow on or leave eyelids as is.  It is one of the few beauty products that does exactly what it claims to.  Although I have not tried the new container, (saving it for a long upcoming trip) it looks and feels just like the old one and so I expect it to be just great!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to please!!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Lemon Aid at a local cosmetic retailer where I was given a small sample with purchase of something else.  I have used every conceivable type of concealer and I keep coming back to this stuff.  It really helps with the dark circles under my eyes and I use it on my upper lids when I want to wear a pale eyeshadow.  It really brightens my eyes and makes me look rested and healthy.  Which I am not.  I don&#x27;t really care for their other concealers (Boing and Erase Paste), but this one is perfect.  I have a very pale complexion with yellowish/greenish undertones.  It also works well to counteract the redness of my mild rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the retailer to get a full size of Lemon Aid and they didn&#x27;t have it and talked me into a traditional flesh colored concealer that was okay, but not great.  I used it for a few weeks and decided to go back to Lemon Aid.  I am so happy I can buy it on Amazon.  :-)</li>
    <li> I like to use this product over my eyelids and around the sunken areas around my eye to give them a lift. I apply it like any concealer. I found it helpful to moisturize beforehand, to avoid the creased, cakey-look. I read that others have used a makeup sponge to mitigate creasing and cakeyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like this concealer is the yellow tint truly does conceal dark circles and balance uneven skin tones, giving them a youthful lift. However, if not applied with care, it can be aging. Another review indicated it works great for concealing leg veins - I didn&#x27;t find that true for me since I felt it sort of &#x27;highlighted&#x27; the area being the concealer is so much lighter than my own skin tone. I will stick to using around my eyes and on eyelids. Also, don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive here -- up to ten or twenty times what it costs elsewhere. Definitely price shop before you buy this product. Sometimes you can get the best price here and sometimes it&#x27;s drastically more.</li>
