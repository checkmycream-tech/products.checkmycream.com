      <li>If you like to do your own nails at home, this is a nice indulgence.</li>
      <li>Actually, I liked them until yesterday when they quit working after about four months.</li>
      <li>They are really the best out there.. and would order them again if I needed another pair.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and it has been a great experience.  </li>
      <li>Just plug them in, choose your heat setting, add your favorite moisturizer, put your hands in plastic (I use fold top plastic sandwich bags), and relax!</li>
      <li>Although they are promoted as skin conditioners for the hands, and they certainly function well for that purpose, I bought them to help with arthritis pain in my hands, and they worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>The mitts are very good at speeding up the mosturizing process and leave my hands feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>Great item and works really well.  </li>
      <li>Love these mitts.  </li>
      <li>I love to crochet and this product helps me to continue to do what I love.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that the heat selection wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it and use it repeatedly throughout the day.</li>
      <li>They work great, I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Product should have some type of terry cloth covering like most heating devices have.</li>
      <li>Will purchase more from this company.  </li>
      <li>I put on hand lotion,dip my hands in paraffin, wrap with plastic, then put them in the mitts, and my hands are relieved of arthritis pain and are so smooth (even if just temporarily!  </li>
      <li>Good heat level control and a finish that will be easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Put a cotton ball dipped in remover on top of your nail then wrap nail with aluminin foil.</li>
      <li>I received this as a gift from a friend and love it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and store.  </li>
      <li>Not as hot as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy these things so much when I go for a manicure that I had to have my own set.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for something simple and relaxing this is a great find.</li>
      <li>and it is absolute luxury in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
      <li>the lowest setting is comfortable for a sitting.  </li>
      <li>He wears light cotton gloves to keep his hands away from the plastic.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for removing jell polish without the harsh drill they use at the salon.</li>
      <li>Worth it to pay a bit more and get a pair of mitts that are covered in terry and truly adjustable.</li>
      <li>meanwhile, your hands are worth pampering!</li>
      <li>These heated mitts are exactly like the type used at most nail salons.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and the temperature was just right.</li>
      <li>addition, the entire peace is plastic and not cloth, which does not give good heating feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>The temperature is as expected - very warm but comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they did arrive quickly and well packed.</li>
      <li>I fits snug which is the way it should for adequate heat buildup.</li>
      <li>They work very well and warm the whole hand,not just the palm</li>
      <li>It Works adequately but needs to be get warmer.  </li>
      <li>They have some that are more meant for longer heat therapy, such as with arthritis, but I wanted something that I could keep very clean since I would be using it with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected these</li>
      <li>The swelling has gone down and the pain is greatly lessened.</li>
      <li>These spa gloves make it possible to continue doing all the things you love to do!</li>
      <li>The warming mittens worked as advertised and are well worth their price.  </li>
      <li>and I spent a good amount of time researching them.</li>
      <li>I applied my favorite hand lotion before using the gloves and received the bonus of moisturized, soft hands and cuticles.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that it isn&#x27;t very environmentally friendly to just keep tossing wads of petroleum derived wax in the trash every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Jell polish comes right off</li>
      <li>I only wish they came with a cover, lucky for me I sew and was able to make a cover for them.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hands nice and toasty, and will use these mitts for a long time.</li>
      <li>they heat up quickly and keep heat very well.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done I rub in the remaining lotion or wipe it off and voila, very soft and smooth</li>
      <li>For the past 20 years or more, I&#x27;ve been getting my hands moisturized and when dunked in hot wax to make it absorb more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, as there are 3 heat settings, it is logical that they are usable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The lowest setting was more than enough for me.</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found these really helped my arthritis in my thumbs!  </li>
      <li>and that is pretty much</li>
      <li>They heat up really quickly, and there is a discernable difference between low - medium - high, which I find important.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t fine these helpful at all, so I sent them back.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing.</li>
      <li>and now I really can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
      <li>They really help to relieve the pain of my arthritic hands.</li>
      <li>therefore they dry out easily.</li>
      <li>Then, on an impulse, I used them to warm my freezing as usual feet.</li>
      <li>The older model which eventually burned out got a lot warmer.</li>
      <li>mitts are NOT big enough to do most feet, but they weren&#x27;t meant to, I don&#x27;t think.</li>
      <li>I find them more comfortable with a thin pair of cotton gloves on; the interior of the heated mitts is plastic.</li>
      <li>The hot is so hot it is a potential issue for burning.</li>
      <li>They heat up quickly, have multiple heat settings and I would recommend them.</li>
      <li>They are very professional, just like at my nail salon!</li>
      <li>A word of caution: the inside plastic can get very hot even on the low setting.  </li>
      <li>When trying to use them on my feet, my heels were near the edge of the mitts and did not get much heat.  </li>
      <li>The heat seems to be spotty in the glove meaning that they don&#x27;t heat evenly top to bottom or side to side, they are also kind of big which makes it awkward to use them and get too hot to use without liner gloves as there is no liner built in.</li>
      <li>other than that, they&#x27;re fine.  </li>
      <li>I sent them back, very large and cumbersome.  </li>
      <li>I cannot advise anyone else to try this, but, if you have feet small enough to fit inside comfortably without placing strain on the plastic, you might consider it.</li>
      <li>I use these twice a day on high heat for 15 minutes and for the first time in a long time, I don&#x27;t have to take NSAIDS for the pain.</li>
      <li>The high and medium settings are a bit too much, so I use the low setting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> Really like these for soothing tired hands and wrists, especially now that cold weather is here.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and good quality</li>
    <li> These spa gloves make it possible to continue doing all the things you love to do! I use them immediately after gardening, doing art, cleaning, cooking. In my 60s, the arrival of arthritis was concerning -- but happily now, not limiting; I&#x27;ve learned to pace myself and proceed. I use ratchet-type pruners for roses, cleaning tools with handles, pens with a comfort grip (or just plain larger barrels) and still make bread and decorate cookies - just smaller quantities. All things considered, it&#x27;s no wonder our hands get tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After activity, just plug in the spa gloves and sit quietly while your hands are renewed. (About 20 minutes). The instructions suggest wearing plastic gloves (the inside and outside are a heavy plastic, so you have to wear something to protect your skin). I&#x27;ve found that ski glove liners (thin fabric) work nicely. The effect of these gloves is reminiscent of hot wax baths but without the mess. I&#x27;d like the inside, at least, to be soft fleece, so maybe next time . . . meanwhile, your hands are worth pampering!</li>
    <li> Not as hot as I would have liked.  other than that, they&#x27;re fine.  Maybe I just need more expensive ones to get and stay hotter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my sister.  She sometimes suffers intense pain in her hands from overuse and some early arthritis.  She loves it and uses it often!  It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Wow this is just like in the salons</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try and help with my arthritis.  The product is excellent, I use it when I&#x27;m watching TV.  I was concerned that the heat selection wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.  It arrived quickly and it has been a great experience.  I recommend this for anyone who needs wartmth in their hands.</li>
    <li> I sent them back, very large and cumbersome.  Not what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a timely manner as described. They work perfectly for my needs, which is for my arthritic hands. I find them more comfortable with a thin pair of cotton gloves on; the interior of the heated mitts is plastic. They really help to relieve the pain of my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> the sell did a great job I love them</li>
    <li> These are great for a manicure, just like the ones they use in the nail salon. They heat up quickly, have multiple heat settings and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine product and does a great job of warming the hands.  Good heat level control and a finish that will be easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These mitts were just what i was looking for. I had a set of them before and they lasted for several years before one mitt stopped heating.  Glad to have found an identical set!</li>
    <li> These are incredible.  I used to go get a spa manicure that would use these on my hands (my cuticles are crazy dry all the time.) but the cost of the manicure every two weeks was draining.  I use these a few times a week and it is absolute luxury in the comfort of my own home.  And my cuticles always look great for a couple days after!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m plagued by freezing hands in the winter. I was looking for something that would relieve this condition and had never seen a product like this. I LOVE it and use it repeatedly throughout the day. It heats up qucikly and warms my hands within minutes. The high and medium settings are a bit too much, so I use the low setting.</li>
    <li> These are very good quality, better than my nail tech&#x27;s.  They heat up really quickly, and there is a discernable difference between low - medium - high, which I find important.  I put on hand lotion,dip my hands in paraffin, wrap with plastic, then put them in the mitts, and my hands are relieved of arthritis pain and are so smooth (even if just temporarily!  Love them!</li>
    <li> These are essentially small heating pads folded over and sealed along 3 edges. Although they are promoted as skin conditioners for the hands, and they certainly function well for that purpose, I bought them to help with arthritis pain in my hands, and they worked beautifully. Then, on an impulse, I used them to warm my freezing as usual feet. Heaven! I cannot advise anyone else to try this, but, if you have feet small enough to fit inside comfortably without placing strain on the plastic, you might consider it. Just remember to use some type of liner. I left my socks on.</li>
    <li> These are great. they heat up quickly and keep heat very well. They are really the best out there.. and would order them again if I needed another pair.</li>
    <li> It Works adequately but needs to be get warmer.  The older model which eventually burned out got a lot warmer.</li>
    <li> These are an awesome addition to your home manicure kit! Just plug them in, choose your heat setting, add your favorite moisturizer, put your hands in plastic (I use fold top plastic sandwich bags), and relax!</li>
    <li> Love these mitts.  Helps with the arthritis in my hands.</li>
    <li> They work very well and warm the whole hand,not just the palm</li>
    <li> This works great. I use it with cotton coin gloves and the heat does wonders for the arthritis in my fingers. This material cleans well also. I recommend the thin coin gloves for comfort though. I fits snug which is the way it should for adequate heat buildup. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product was sent back immediately. Made of hard plastic and in my opinion not very practical or easy for an elderly person to attempt to put on their hands. I was afraid that there was a very good chance that my mother could burn her hands if not careful. Product should have some type of terry cloth covering like most heating devices have.</li>
    <li> These mitts are wonderful.  I wash my hands a lot daily therefore they dry out easily. One treatment with these and my hands were moisturized.  They make a great gift too!  I only wish they came with a cover, lucky for me I sew and was able to make a cover for them.</li>
    <li> Yes, they function.... exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as there are 3 heat settings, it is logical that they are usable.  The hot is so hot it is a potential issue for burning. It is that hot.&lt;br /&gt;Only the lowest setting is comfortable for a sitting.  The plastic is very stiff and the interior feels sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to pro models I have used, with a terry cover, etc these are simply inferior. Worth it to pay a bit more and get a pair of mitts that are covered in terry and truly adjustable.</li>
    <li> My husband complains of cold hands all the time.  He loves this product.  A word of caution: the inside plastic can get very hot even on the low setting.  He wears light cotton gloves to keep his hands away from the plastic.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for removing jell polish without the harsh drill they use at the salon. Put a cotton ball dipped in remover on top of your nail then wrap nail with aluminin foil. Do this for all 10 nails. Put hands in a clear plastic sandwhich bag. Then put in mitts. Wait 30. Jell polish comes right off</li>
    <li> These heated mitts are exactly like the type used at most nail salons. They have adjustable heat settings and work as described. If you like to do your own nails at home, this is a nice indulgence.</li>
    <li> I got these because I have arthritis in my hands. I use these twice a day on high heat for 15 minutes and for the first time in a long time, I don&#x27;t have to take NSAIDS for the pain. The swelling has gone down and the pain is greatly lessened.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t fine these helpful at all, so I sent them back. It just seems like a totally unnecessary item.</li>
    <li> Nice quality product and delivery was great!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from a friend and love it.  I got my dad one for Christmas so he can warm his arthritic hands!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate.  The mitts are very good at speeding up the mosturizing process and leave my hands feeling soft.  I&#x27;m using them with a thick mosturizing cream and plastic liners.  The temperature is as expected - very warm but comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not quite large enough for my size 8 1/2 feet.  When trying to use them on my feet, my heels were near the edge of the mitts and did not get much heat.  Of course, my heels are the driest part of my feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the good results for my hands, I am noticing that I find them somewhat inconvenient to use and am wondering how long I will continue to be motivated to do so.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry in the winter. 30 minutes with these mitts solves my problem.&lt;br /&gt;I found the heat to be just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The warming mittens worked as advertised and are well worth their price.  They provided welcome relief to my aching arthritic fingers and hands.  I applied my favorite hand lotion before using the gloves and received the bonus of moisturized, soft hands and cuticles. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> So I read through several reviews of this product and similar product prior to purchasing- I was looking for a heated mitt that I could use weekly.  I found that this brand was just what I was looking for- both quality and price.  If you are looking for something simple and relaxing this is a great find.</li>
    <li> Feels just like going to the spa - without the expense!  Easy to use and store.  Perfect gift for any lady.</li>
    <li> I found these really helped my arthritis in my thumbs!  Easy to use and the temperature was just right. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> pure junk lasted 1,5 months, we handled them with due care ,and we noted that one seemed to be less warm that the other then 2 days later one turned brown and both stopped will be sending back to manufacturer my self,as these people were no help</li>
    <li> I enjoy these things so much when I go for a manicure that I had to have my own set.  I slather my hands with lotion or petroleum jelly, put socks or cheap, thin plastic gloves on and then put these mitts on and just relax.  It does wonders for the skin on my hands!  Be careful, the hottest setting is REALLY hot.</li>
    <li> Both hand pockets are heated with the same control.&lt;br /&gt;So, if I put my hand in one the other gets to hot because heat is not absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had two separate controls one for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the entire peace is plastic and not cloth, which does not give good heating feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Many times it was about to burn my hand when I inserted it after I started the heat switch.</li>
    <li> Actually, I liked them until yesterday when they quit working after about four months.</li>
    <li> I bought these mitts to help relieve painful joints in my hands, to that end they go only part way. The heat seems to be spotty in the glove meaning that they don&#x27;t heat evenly top to bottom or side to side, they are also kind of big which makes it awkward to use them and get too hot to use without liner gloves as there is no liner built in.</li>
    <li> For the past 20 years or more, I&#x27;ve been getting my hands moisturized and when dunked in hot wax to make it absorb more. It&#x27;s a great way to overcome the many damaging things we do to the skin of our hands. BUT, over the last few years I&#x27;ve become increasingly sensitive to the wax and now I really can&#x27;t use it at all. Not to mention that it isn&#x27;t very environmentally friendly to just keep tossing wads of petroleum derived wax in the trash every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitts were recommended to me and I spent a good amount of time researching them. They have some that are more meant for longer heat therapy, such as with arthritis, but I wanted something that I could keep very clean since I would be using it with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected these and they did arrive quickly and well packed. There was no instruction packet with it, which I found odd, but they are pretty self explanatory. There are three heat settings as well as an off setting and that is pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lowest setting was more than enough for me. I just globbed on a bunch of lotion, put my hands in baggies and then stuck them in the mitts for 15 minutes. When I&#x27;m done I rub in the remaining lotion or wipe it off and voila, very soft and smooth hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitts are NOT big enough to do most feet, but they weren&#x27;t meant to, I don&#x27;t think. Those are usually foot shaped. If I could ask for anything, it would be that the pockets were large enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as a better, and far less messy, replacement for the hot wax moisturing treatment for hands.</li>
    <li> My hands ache a lot during the winter and before it rains. I love to crochet and this product helps me to continue to do what I love. It also makes your hands look younger and your nails stronger.</li>
    <li> Great item and works really well.  Will purchase more from this company.  Keeps my hands nice and toasty, and will use these mitts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, you have to apply a moisturizer and then cover your hands before you can use these.  After reading the instructions, I returned them.</li>
    <li> The mitts did not work properly they never did heat up. On the outside they lived up to expection however they just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed.  Works great</li>
    <li> Jilbere Heated Spa Mitts are as advertised! They are very professional, just like at my nail salon! They work great, I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Such a treat during the never ending winter... RELAX !!</li>
