### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And the price makes it almost perfect!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Jack Frost, and Danny Phantom cosplays, and it looks absolutely GORGEOUS for all of them!</li>
      <li>it fought me lol.</li>
      <li>Good work.</li>
      <li>but is good and i will get some of it cut to my liking.</li>
      <li>color was unreal  very very in satisfied.</li>
      <li>I got issues solved and even got cosplay wig advice on how to wash my wig.i love this and wear it a lot.</li>
      <li>More of a fem look.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s obviously not going to be the best quality, but for it&#x27;s price</li>
      <li>ok i got it and it came on the day that they said it would.</li>
      <li>Plus if it doesn&#x27;t look okay</li>
      <li>And for the price it&#x27;s cheaper and better than having it done at my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>I guess wigs with more color works well with my skin type.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much with the low price, but it came out beautiful!</li>
      <li>The wig was a bit longer than expected but it turned out great!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s done just fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to style, was short like I needed it to be, which was really great.</li>
      <li>THe wig is cheap</li>
      <li>Very nice and low maintenance</li>
      <li>It came very fast and I love how it looks.</li>
      <li>The wig is great, but seems to be a tighter fit than a black haired version I also bought.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;shed&#x27; (that I&#x27;ve noticed), easy to style and no bald/thin spots!</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s one of my favourite wigs I own!</li>
      <li>So unless you have a larger head, this should fit pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>The wig cap was a nice extra as well.</li>
      <li>It came with a wig cap, which is nice because I constantly lose mine.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to other cosplayers for the surprising quality despite the price.</li>
      <li>It is just the right length too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, you get what you pay for, really.</li>
      <li>In the pictures it&#x27;s a lovely silver white.</li>
      <li>the top side head was to big or poofy.</li>
      <li>Good for cosplay, I used mine to cosplay a humanized Lord Monochromicorn from Adventure time, as well as a few times just for the sake of fashion.</li>
      <li>Fit well and looked okay with a little work and shifting.</li>
      <li>For the price is was better than expected.</li>
      <li>This wig I had high hopes for.</li>
      <li>It was a little bit thinner than I expected, and fairly shiny.</li>
      <li>The picture showed a short wig and the description stated &amp;#34;Short&amp;#34; but when I got it it was very very long-like a Lady Godiva wig-  </li>
      <li>The color is pure white.</li>
      <li>They marked it as shipped on the day after i placed the order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for halloween or something, but not for serious cosplay in my opinion.</li>
      <li>That being said, once you wash and style it, it looks very nice (albiet not realistic because of the stark white color, of course) I&#x27;ve worn it several times and its never tangled, and I&#x27;ve even used a low heat setting on it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely thin (you can see the netting very easily) and if you try and brush it out, a lot of it comes out.</li>
      <li>Came to me super long and choppy.</li>
      <li>Luckily, my costume had a hood, so it covered the back where it was harder to conceal some of the black.</li>
      <li>I could see the wefts , it&#x27;s not at all thick but would do well for a quick Halloween wig.</li>

<li> I could see the wefts , it&#x27;s not at all thick but would do well for a quick Halloween wig.</li>
<li> I bought a men&#x27;s wig thinking it&#x27;d be big enough to fit my head, but I was wrong.</li>
<li> There is nothing wrong with the wig its perfectly fine for my homestuck cosplay.</li>
<li> and the bangs are kinda to long.</li>
<li> But the expected delivery date is 20 to 40 days later.</li>
<li> If you want to cut down on the shine further, use any white or transparent powder by putting it on your hands and running your powdered fingers through the wefts.</li>
<li> When I first opened the wig and tried it on it was small and you could see some of the black underneath.</li>
<li> Plus, it came /weeks/ earlier than expected!</li>
<li> It did come with what I think was supposed to be a hair net, but it was worn out and not useful?</li>
<li> The fall out is minimal.</li>
<li> I bought this wig in white a few years ago for my Cecil Baldwin (WTNV) cosplay</li>
<li> I expected something silkier; theres no sheen to it</li>
<li> You can clearly see the netting of the wig , the hair is very thin and also shorter in the back than in the pictures posted.</li>
<li> Just based on that, i have to score it down.</li>
<li> I mean it gets the job done, but I would have rather it actually looked like what they were showing.</li>
<li> As you should with every wig, I would suggest a wearing a wig cap underneath the wig seeing as the forehead area of the hairline is slightly itchy.</li>
<li> When I opened the package immediately there were strands of hair falling out , and a lot of it compared to other wigs I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
<li> While the wig looks flat in the picture, the wig I received is VERY thick with LOTS of volume and requires little to no product, just a bit of styling with your hands</li>
<li> Needless to say if you are looking for a short wig, don&#x27;t buy this unless you plan to cut and style it.</li>
<li> , its so thin you can see the black wig webbing underneath.</li>
<li> The wefts are also very thin and the wig was long.</li>
<li> Way too late to use on Halloween.</li>
<li> Hardly had to do any cutting.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> The shine isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> i was disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m cutting and styling it and using it for a Jack Frost cosplay, so it meets my needs!</li>
<li> looked very artificial  </li>
<li> This is one of the worst wigs I have purchased.</li>

    <li> It was a little bit thinner than I expected, and fairly shiny. That being said, once you wash and style it, it looks very nice (albiet not realistic because of the stark white color, of course) I&#x27;ve worn it several times and its never tangled, and I&#x27;ve even used a low heat setting on it and it&#x27;s done just fine. It came with a wig cap, which is nice because I constantly lose mine. If you want to cut down on the shine further, use any white or transparent powder by putting it on your hands and running your powdered fingers through the wefts. Good for cosplay, I used mine to cosplay a humanized Lord Monochromicorn from Adventure time, as well as a few times just for the sake of fashion.</li>
    <li> THe wig is cheap so it&#x27;s obviously not going to be the best quality, but for it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s pretty good. The shine isn&#x27;t bad. The fall out is minimal. The color is pure white. It did come with what I think was supposed to be a hair net, but it was worn out and not useful? I&#x27;m cutting and styling it and using it for a Jack Frost cosplay, so it meets my needs!</li>

    <li> Very nice and low maintenance</li>
    <li> so after talking to the company.who are a lot nicer tan I thought. I got issues solved and even got cosplay wig advice on how to wash my wig.i love this and wear it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig in white a few years ago for my Cecil Baldwin (WTNV) cosplay and I have since also used it for Calsprite (homestuck). Jack Frost, and Danny Phantom cosplays, and it looks absolutely GORGEOUS for all of them! While the wig looks flat in the picture, the wig I received is VERY thick with LOTS of volume and requires little to no product, just a bit of styling with your hands and you&#x27;re good to go! As you should with every wig, I would suggest a wearing a wig cap underneath the wig seeing as the forehead area of the hairline is slightly itchy. Other than that, it&#x27;s one of my favourite wigs I own!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s actually like a bob, chin length. I could see the wefts , it&#x27;s not at all thick but would do well for a quick Halloween wig. Took a month to get to me too.</li>
    <li> It came very fast and I love how it looks.</li>
    <li> I guess wigs with more color works well with my skin type. it fought me lol. so no white isn&#x27;t gonna work for my tone. perhaps someone else but not me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst wigs I have purchased. When I opened the package immediately there were strands of hair falling out , and a lot of it compared to other wigs I&#x27;ve bought in the past. You can clearly see the netting of the wig , the hair is very thin and also shorter in the back than in the pictures posted.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, you get what you pay for, really. When I first opened the wig and tried it on it was small and you could see some of the black underneath. Luckily, my costume had a hood, so it covered the back where it was harder to conceal some of the black. I bought a men&#x27;s wig thinking it&#x27;d be big enough to fit my head, but I was wrong. However on the plus side, the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out when you take care of it, and if you bobby pin it correctly, it&#x27;ll stay put.</li>
    <li> I admit, i haven&#x27;t seen this thing yet. They marked it as shipped on the day after i placed the order. But the expected delivery date is 20 to 40 days later. Way too late to use on Halloween. Just based on that, i have to score it down. Unless you want to spend 22 dollars on expedited shipping, don&#x27;t order this for this year&#x27;s Halloween.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for my son&#x27;s Halloween costume. It got the job done. The adjustable strap helped since he is younger and has a smaller head. The wig cap was a nice extra as well. Good work.</li>
    <li> The wig is great, but seems to be a tighter fit than a black haired version I also bought. So unless you have a larger head, this should fit pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> The picture showed a short wig and the description stated &amp;#34;Short&amp;#34; but when I got it it was very very long-like a Lady Godiva wig-  It has to be cut, which i have to pay extra to do because i don&#x27;t know how to cut it to look just like the picture. i was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My friend ask me to buy this for one of his girls and she like it and has ask to buy some others with her money. She and a 25.00 credit card to buy them with</li>
    <li> Easy to style, was short like I needed it to be, which was really great. Hardly had to do any cutting. Would recommend to other cosplayers for the surprising quality despite the price.</li>
    <li> Did not look like the picture at all. The wefts are also very thin and the wig was long. Luckily enough i can style wigs so i can make do with it. Needless to say if you are looking for a short wig, don&#x27;t buy this unless you plan to cut and style it.</li>
    <li> looked very artificial  don&#x27;t recommend. color was unreal  very very in satisfied. I guess it will keep until Christmas for a mrs Santa wig</li>
    <li> This wig I had high hopes for. In the pictures it&#x27;s a lovely silver white. Which is why I ordered it. The wig I recieved was yellow blond and nothing like the picture. I had intended to use this wig in an upcoming convention and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely thin (you can see the netting very easily) and if you try and brush it out, a lot of it comes out. It&#x27;s okay for halloween or something, but not for serious cosplay in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This wig arrived on time and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I just wondered what my hair would look like this colour and style. And for the price it&#x27;s cheaper and better than having it done at my hairdresser. Plus if it doesn&#x27;t look okay I can just take it off. It could be used for fancy dress or given to charity.</li>
    <li> ok i got it and it came on the day that they said it would. for me i kinda like it the top side head was to big or poofy. and the bangs are kinda to long. but is good and i will get some of it cut to my liking. so the shipping was five stars the color was five stars and some of the hair spots three stars.</li>
    <li> The wig was a bit longer than expected but it turned out great!</li>
    <li> The wig hair falls out when I brush it, its so thin you can see the black wig webbing underneath. Came to me super long and choppy. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what it looks like in the picture. I expected something silkier; theres no sheen to it like there is in the picture. I mean it gets the job done, but I would have rather it actually looked like what they were showing.</li>
