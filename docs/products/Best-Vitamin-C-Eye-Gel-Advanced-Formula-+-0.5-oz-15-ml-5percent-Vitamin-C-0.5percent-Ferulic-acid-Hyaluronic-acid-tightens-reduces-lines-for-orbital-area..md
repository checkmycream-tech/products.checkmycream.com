      <li>When people stop and ask you what you&#x27;ve been doing differently, you know you&#x27;ve found something good!!  </li>
      <li>I am STILL in love with this product and doubt I will ever stop using.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE - April 3, 2013 - Ran out + just purchased 2 more bottles.  </li>
      <li>I love this Eye Gel combination formula and have been using this eye treatment for many years every morning and night.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am now in love with this product.  </li>
      <li>I find the Skin Ceutical brand a bit better than these products.  </li>
      <li>You can substitute a product of the value/cost if you use one product more often.</li>
      <li>I love this vitamin c serum for around my eyes</li>
      <li>I am happy to have such amazing effect, I will continue to use the product.</li>
      <li>Seems to me that with so many people noting that it oxidizes easily that they would find a way to prevent this or accept returns.  </li>
      <li>It feels wonderful when dry and made my makeup go on easier in the eye area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hands down the best eye treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Takes away the puffiness and helps me look refreshed wHile diminishing fine lines.  </li>
      <li>With this Eye Gel formula it has reduced puffiness; smoothes skin texture and reduced wrinkles by firming and reducing fine lines.</li>
      <li>It seems to be doing something for the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>This eye gel moisturizes as well as tones fine lines.</li>
      <li>Skin under eyes is softer and the fine lines have all but disappeared.  </li>
      <li>Goes on really easily and smoothly</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m smooth</li>
      <li>The hydrating ingredients make this product effective but gentle.</li>
      <li>so far good results, If you have any questions there</li>
      <li>Sinks right into skin, perfect under concealer.  </li>
      <li>The gel is pleasant, non-irritating and unlike some firming products, does not dry out fine orbital area.</li>
      <li>I originally used this product at night and woke up with swollen eyes.  </li>
      <li>Why spend your money on skinceuticals, when this product is as good, or better in many cases at half the price!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m lucky to get two weeks before it&#x27;s quite orange.  </li>
      <li>I found it on Amazon after trying many high priced items from Dr. Office recommendations to department store eye products without the results I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Its very effective for dark spots and firming the skin</li>
      <li>and I noticed great results within just a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>skin has never been so luminous and fresh.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a bit too pricey for what you get, but I&#x27;ve also paid a lot more for other products that didn&#x27;t do any more than this one.</li>
      <li>They should make the situation right.</li>
      <li>I read good reviews about this product, but was cautious because I kept reading about oxidation which is indicated when the product goes from clear to yellow.  </li>
      <li>Very, very hydrating.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t see hyluronic acid in the first three ingredients, don&#x27;t purchase the product.  </li>
      <li>and I hope it lasts for the rest of my life with this stuff ;)</li>
      <li>This was the first time I tried a gel</li>
      <li>Fine lines around my eyes are definitely softer.  </li>
      <li>The face serum was a very light yellow (barely noticeable) while the eye gel turned yellow very quickly, which means it&#x27;s oxidized and less effective.</li>
      <li>It is very hydrating as well, the foundation on my lid won&#x27;t fade away now.</li>
      <li>but I find it too much.</li>
      <li>And really, the effect is seen immediately.</li>
      <li>I used this as an inexpensive alternative to the very overpriced spa version vitamin c gels.</li>
      <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
      <li>Its very slimy feeling.</li>
      <li>The skin is now much smoother.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>SO SO SO FAST.  </li>
      <li>Being a former Esthetician, I&#x27;ve used many medical grade products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these serum products.</li>
      <li>In just a few minutes my eyes look soooo much better.</li>
      <li>I live in Germany</li>
      <li>I can live without this.</li>
      <li>I swear it helps improve those fine under eye lines with just a few uses.</li>
      <li>I took extra precautions to keep it tightly closed, away from light -- I even stored it in the box</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear when I get it (or nearly)</li>
      <li>I am 23 years old and just wanted a preventative eye formula.</li>
      <li>I even kept it completely out of sunlight and stored it in complete darkness.</li>
      <li>I store it in a cool, dry location in a closed drawer with absolutely no exposure to light.  </li>
      <li>It goes on clear with no mess.  </li>
      <li>The next day I woke up, my everlasting dark circle look lighter and the fine line is softer.</li>
      <li>And after the first few weeks I REALLY noticed diminished lines and puffiness around my eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now, I like it, and how it goes on and dries.  I will continue to use it and reorder it because I feel there is improvement.  Give me another month and I will rate it again.  Miracles don&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
    <li> You have to use it often to maintain the lift these serum provides but it definitely works to an extent. I use it often.</li>
    <li> Using twice per day.  It&#x27;s got a good feel and seems to hydrate well.</li>
    <li> This eye gel with vitamin C is the best. I love it. The gel makes it stay under the eyes better than liquid. I think Vitamin C is the greatest skin care ever. I use it under my eyes along with Vitamin C serum for the rest of my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Name:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Victoria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/10/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Adds moisture and improves dark circles. All without making my eye makeup run.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on my skin.  Goes on really easily and smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Ill buy it again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Good price too</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye gel, and essentially the same face serum from a different brand. I received them at virtually the same time and they were both clear upon arrival. I used them both daily and kept them refrigerated when not in use. The face serum started oxidizing (turning yellow) as did the eye gel, which is expected of a product like this, of course, but the eye gel oxidized at a much faster rate. The face serum was a very light yellow (barely noticeable) while the eye gel turned yellow very quickly, which means it&#x27;s oxidized and less effective. I don&#x27;t work for either company! I&#x27;m simply a disappointed customer who has seen first hand that this product is obviously of lesser quality as evidenced by how quickly it oxidizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: I contacted customer service about this and I have had zero response. I&#x27;m not a bitter consumer trying to cause problems, I simply want an explanation as to why their product failed miserably OR a replacement. They should make the situation right. Vitamin C serum should not turn yellow that quickly, especially when taking precautions to prevent oxidation!</li>
    <li> Since I have learned to expect less than promised from a variety of eye-firming lotions, potions and gels, after a month of use I am pleasantly surprised with the results.  Bags under my eyes do look tighter.  Upper lids, not so.  Nevertheless, this being the allergy season, I do not sport my usual sad-puppy look. The gel is pleasant, non-irritating and unlike some firming products, does not dry out fine orbital area. The product delivers what it promises. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I switched over the Cosmetic Skin Solutions over a year ago and love the products. My favorite is the eye gel. I noticed results within days and was very satisfied. I highly recommend these serum products. I used to have dry ages skin but now its turning around and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Its very effective for dark spots and firming the skin</li>
    <li> All my product s that I got from this line... Works get with no problems, I get a lot of compliant and was told I look 26 yes of age and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x60;s..so I&#x27;m happy happy joy joy:-)</li>
    <li> I find the Skin Ceutical brand a bit better than these products.  If you don&#x27;t see hyluronic acid in the first three ingredients, don&#x27;t purchase the product.  hyluronic acid hold 1000 times it&#x27;s weight in water, which is why you look hydrated.  C does wonderful things for the skin.  Ferulic and pholorectin are excellent if you are a sun worshiper.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews about this product, but was cautious because I kept reading about oxidation which is indicated when the product goes from clear to yellow.  I took extra precautions to keep it tightly closed, away from light -- I even stored it in the box it came in -- but it still turned yellow the other day.  Now I find out that I can&#x27;t return it through Amazon because it&#x27;s been more than 30 days.  Seems to me that with so many people noting that it oxidizes easily that they would find a way to prevent this or accept returns.  I have almost an entire bottle that is now useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice -- find something else or a company that will accept returns for a defective product and packaging.</li>
    <li> I am bottle number two and have seem great results.  Skin under eyes is softer and the fine lines have all but disappeared.  It does oxidize quickly, which is rather frustrating.  Will keep repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 1/4/2014 - I have now purchased five of these and I&#x27;m afraid I will not repurchase.  The product works....better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to date (admittedly not much, since I found this and stopped looking).  The problem is that it oxidizes SO SO SO FAST.  It&#x27;s clear when I get it (or nearly) and I&#x27;m lucky to get two weeks before it&#x27;s quite orange.  I store it in a cool, dry location in a closed drawer with absolutely no exposure to light.  I simply cannot justify continuing to purchase something that I only use 1/3 of before it goes bad.  For those that don&#x27;t know, once it&#x27;s orange, the vitamin c is basically gone from the product.  I am now purchasing other products to replace this.</li>
    <li> I use all the Cosmetic Skin Solutions products. I initially bought the sampler kit and since then buy the products in combo packs. You can substitute a product of the value/cost if you use one product more often. I love this vitamin c serum for around my eyes and I put an extra dab on areas where I have applied the other vitamin c product such as my forehead or neck and on areas like forearms where you want vitamin c that isn&#x27;t as strong. The hydrating ingredients make this product effective but gentle.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Gel combination formula and have been using this eye treatment for many years every morning and night. I found it on Amazon after trying many high priced items from Dr. Office recommendations to department store eye products without the results I was looking for. With this Eye Gel formula it has reduced puffiness; smoothes skin texture and reduced wrinkles by firming and reducing fine lines. I highly recommend this product from years of using with results also excellent customer service I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye gel. It is nice to have a product that contains Vitamin C that you can use around your eyes. I have noticed a difference in the texture of the skin under my eye. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year, and I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite CCS product. Very, very hydrating. My last bottle lasted about 6 months, although (I kept it in the fridge). I highly recommend trying this. It&#x27;s hands down the best eye treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of under eye creams, gels, serums, lotions, roll-ons, etc.  Most just tended to mask issues or not work at all.  This Serum has been great and I noticed great results within just a few weeks.  It goes on clear with no mess.  Very easy to use.  And after the first few weeks I REALLY noticed diminished lines and puffiness around my eyes.  I bought this to help battle crows feet and puffiness, hoping it would just help on or the other, but it&#x27;s definitely helped both!</li>
    <li> I used this as an inexpensive alternative to the very overpriced spa version vitamin c gels. The product worked great for about 2 months. Then the product turned that dreaded orange/yellow color. And everyone knows that once it changes color it is no longer active. I even kept it completely out of sunlight and stored it in complete darkness. However, ounce for ounce it is STILL cheaper to continue to purchase this gel as opposed to the spa version. Even if it means having to order it every other month. I will defiantly be reordering. It has helped with under eye circles and brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> it works as expected, firming my eyes and solve my puff problems. it is a great product. I will highly recommend if you have tired eyes.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this gel because I&#x27;m always up late and have to get up early in the morning. Needless to say...that makes for puffy eyes along with dark circles. The directions say use 2 to 3 drops but I find it too much. I only use one drop and that&#x27;s enough for both eyes. In just a few minutes my eyes look soooo much better. I am very happy that I decided to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have use other expensive brands before and this one is a keeper. My second bottle. I found the perfect eye cream at great value.</li>
    <li> My friend, PeggyKK has given the comment for the above item.  I started using the eye gel around one month, in addition to feel moisture, I noticed that the skin of my eyelid are tighten and more elastic. My friend also noticed the difference although he didn&#x27;t know I use this product. He told me that compare with the past, my eyes look more brighter and bigger. I am happy to have such amazing effect, I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> It does not work on me. After I use this product for over one month, I wake up with puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased and relieve, I&#x27;m over 50 and all of you in my age bracket knows what I&#x27;m talking about, My husband laughs at me with all the face &amp; eye creams I have around the house... I finally found one that works for me...(my husband is also relieved) I do use it at night and in the morning, some use it only in the morning... I do both it go&#x27;s on nicely... a little go&#x27;s a long ways &amp;#34;DONT&amp;#34; over do it, it would be just a waste...I also use  Vitamin C+E  Serum,  Hydra B5 Gel Resurfacing Serum.. so far good results, If you have any questions there 800 number you call you DO get a person that answers most of the time..That&#x27;s big in my book... I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some of their other products.. Hope this helps...</li>
    <li> It is Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow... Can&#x27;t believe that you can see the immediate effect even you have used it ONE time. It is unbelievable, nut it is. The next day I woke up, my everlasting dark circle look lighter and the fine line is softer. It is very hydrating as well, the foundation on my lid won&#x27;t fade away now.</li>
    <li> I was using Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion for wrinkles, everything was perfect until star to use this one, gave me terrible wrinkles, reddened dark circles and sensitive skin. Worn only three and I will never use again. I can live without this. DONT waste your money.</li>
    <li> Being a former Esthetician, I&#x27;ve used many medical grade products. I did not like the actual consistency of this product. Its very slimy feeling. I found my results to be only so-so.</li>
    <li> este gel é específico para a área dos olhos , para prevenir linhas de expressão , usa-se apenas uma gota .</li>
    <li> Keeps me with my eye lids. Takes away the puffiness and helps me look refreshed wHile diminishing fine lines.  Crow feet almost gone.</li>
    <li> Love this line. I compare all ingredients to Skinceuticals and they are identical. This eye gel moisturizes as well as tones fine lines. You can feel it tighten as your skin absorbs it. Over delivers for the price.</li>
    <li> This serum is thicker than the one I use for my face.  I keep this one in my fridge also and it only take 1 drop to use for both eyes. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have just started using the eye gel. It feels wonderful when dry and made my makeup go on easier in the eye area. I swear it helps improve those fine under eye lines with just a few uses. I will definitely add this to my routine. I have loved all products I use from CSS &amp; their customer service is great should you ever need it. They stand behind their products &amp; I can see why...everything is wonderful.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!  Sinks right into skin, perfect under concealer.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with firming eye creams - too heavy for my skin.  This was the first time I tried a gel and it&#x27;s become part of my daily/nightly routine.  Fine lines around my eyes are definitely softer.  Cap it tightly to prevent discoloration.  I don&#x27;t think it effects the product though it may look a little funny!</li>
    <li> Why spend your money on skinceuticals, when this product is as good, or better in many cases at half the price!</li>
    <li> I originally used this product at night and woke up with swollen eyes.  So I called Customer Service and they explained that it should be used only in the morning.  Wanting to give it another chance, I took their advice and used it the following morning.  I am now in love with this product.  This product gives dehydrated skin the moisture it needs and softens crow&#x27;s feet and under eye wrinkles.  This company makes a phenomenal product and has the best Customer Service Department I have ever dealt with.  Thanks Jonathan!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - April 3, 2013 - Ran out + just purchased 2 more bottles.  I am STILL in love with this product and doubt I will ever stop using.  When people stop and ask you what you&#x27;ve been doing differently, you know you&#x27;ve found something good!!  Also, a little goes a very LONG way with all of their products...</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing something for the fine lines around my eyes.  Not a miracle, but what product is?  I have ordered a second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a bit too pricey for what you get, but I&#x27;ve also paid a lot more for other products that didn&#x27;t do any more than this one.</li>
    <li> I am 23 years old and just wanted a preventative eye formula. I originally had little tiny wrinkles but now I&#x27;m smooth and I hope it lasts for the rest of my life with this stuff ;)</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product..</li>
    <li> I have been using it in the last year and should say that this product is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been so luminous and fresh. People say may age is at least five years less.&lt;br /&gt;I will sure continue using it!</li>
    <li> I live in Germany and I get Firming Eye Gel from Sacramento from CSS. After cleaning my face in the morning I have small dry wrinkles under the eyes. Then I distribute a drop of eye gel under each eye and pat it on. And really, the effect is seen immediately. The skin is now much smoother. Above all, it is unlikely economical in use. I come out for months with a bottle. I would never give up it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet in terms of wrinkles and firming.</li>
    <li> This stuff make me brake out so bad My experience only, but well you guys just be careful</li>
