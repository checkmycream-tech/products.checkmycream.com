    <li> The Revlon lipstick ordered is a shade (Apple Polish) that is extremely hard to find.  The two lipsticks arrived in perfect condition, color I ordered and packaged so there was no damage.  Excellent business/buying transaction.</li>
    <li> My favorite color!  Don&#x27;t know why Revlon discontinued it!  hope that I can continue to order more.</li>
    <li> My mother (who is 80) has been wearing this shade for a long time.  I ordered it for her, as they are no longer making it and it is hard to find.  She loves the color and will continue to wear it as long as I can find it for her!</li>
    <li> I love this shade. It is perfect for me. I have worn it for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the usual stores. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon had some in stock.</li>
    <li> Wish Revlon would make this color again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a gift, was as expected. Hard to find item escalates the cost.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product ordered, and  that I received.  I would order again as the need arises.</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34; that you could supply Apple Polish.  I have used that color foreverThank you, Thank you.  jan</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to find my favorite color.</li>

    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T FIND THIS LIPSTICK COLOR ANYWHERE AND I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M HAPPY I COULD FIND IT.</li>
    <li> Price was great and I did not have to travel from store to store looking for a color I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this color and product for a very long time.  Was disappointed when Revlon discontinued it.  I am happy I found it online, although, the tip of one the lipsticks/in the tube/was slightly mashed.  The tube was sealed so don&#x27;t know how it happened.  That&#x27;s why I gave it a 4-star.  Great color....</li>
    <li> Too much $ but love the color</li>
    <li> Great lipstick and color.  It is a shame that this color is discontinued.  I get so many compliments on it.  The vendor sent my order right away, and it arrived even before I expected it. I am so glad that Amazon had vendors that were able to supply the lipstick for at least awhile longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lipstick for my mother who was having a hard time finding this lipstick shade at her local drug store.  She gets compliments on the shade from her friends.  So, I looked on Amazon and found exactly what she needed.  She is very happy with her purchase and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great Colors!  I have been wearing apple polish and poppysilk red since their inception, I forget how many years ago!  I know I have been wearing Revlon lipstick since I was in High School, I am 76 years old!</li>
    <li> Revlon has discontinued this color &amp;#34;Apple Polish&amp;#34;.  Other colors are either too orange or too deep red.  I&lt;br /&gt;have worn this color, with a layer of Beige on top to wear with browns and tans.  So happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> This is a super moist lipstick and this color gets many compliments when I wear it.  The ordering process was simple and I&#x27;m glad I can still buy my favorite lip color.</li>
    <li> Great Lipstick and must be very popular! Can&#x27;t find my color Apple Frost in any of the stores. Revlon Moon Drops is the only lipstick I can wear that keeps my lips moist.  Others dry my lips out.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
