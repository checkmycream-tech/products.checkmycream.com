      <li>Love Love Love this smell.</li>
      <li>:) :) :)</li>
      <li>Much better buy than going to Macy&#x27;s or to the mall for it for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>This allows the scent to be more pronounced.</li>
      <li>its okay</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance however I&#x27;ve had it since April 2014</li>
      <li>(if you love musk type perfume).</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more pricey...</li>
      <li>I do not like a strong overwhelming cologne or perfume</li>
      <li>and it was strong for a couple of minute</li>
      <li>Fast good service&lt;br /&gt;balance sheet value of the goods-mail with an increase in purchases&lt;br /&gt;good sound packaging in which goods&lt;br /&gt;comes</li>
      <li>Smells fabulous... but the fragrance wears off very quickly.</li>
      <li>but a body spray be more cost effective considering how much you have to spray throughout the day of this pretty scent!</li>
      <li>It has a great scent and I apply the cream by the same name.  </li>
      <li>smell is not as the original.</li>
      <li>When I saw this parfum on line, I was really excited, and ordered it immediately...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance at Macy&#x27;s, and paid a whole lot more for it.</li>
      <li>This has such a nice, clean fragrance about it.  </li>
      <li>This eau de parfum has a nice scent but it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  </li>
      <li>however I felt the smell was warn off pretty quick</li>
      <li>I have worn this exact perfume from department stores and it has lasted days on my clothes.</li>
      <li>I love this scent however I have to spray often as the scent does not last  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny that I got this survey tonight because just tonight my husband and I were going out to dinner</li>
      <li>Was initially concerned whether this was authentic or not, bought a 50 ml rather than 100 ml for this reason.</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>What I liked about the other was you put it on</li>
      <li>I got this order pretty reasonably timed.  </li>
      <li>This is not the real Narciso Rodriguez</li>
      <li>For some reason this bottle is not as strong as the other.</li>
      <li>It is my new &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;  for the year</li>
      <li>So when it came time to order new cologne I decided to go on line and order it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to use, and the smell last all day.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>But, after wearing it for the first time, I was very displeased; because the scent didn&#x27;t stay on me long at all, and I KNOW, from buying this same fragrance at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and it already smell like its old..</li>
      <li>It was not the right perfume, and when I tried to inquire about the exchange and shipping back the product no one had gotten back to me.</li>
      <li>It came on the exact date expected..</li>
      <li>Ignore all other positive reviews unless you want to purchase alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So now, I&#x27;m curious if this is the real stuff...</li>
      <li>Kinda soft and is similar to the softness of baby powder/lotion smell.</li>
      <li>and then you smelled a faint smell of cologne which I always liked.</li>
      <li>Main concern i have is Fragrance does not last long.  </li>
      <li>the fragrance had almost no smell, and did not last even half an hour in the body, it evaporates very fast</li>

    <li> Perfume poor and seller has never credited my return of it</li>
    <li> This is not the real Narciso Rodriguez .The smell is not as the original. I really disappointed with Amazon because I doesn&#x27;t allow me to return it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my most favorite perfume! The smell is subtle yet very much there.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people who have gone out and purchased it and agree that it&#x27;s a perfect every day or even an occasion perfume.</li>
    <li> Fragrance does not last very long and smells weak.</li>
    <li> I love this scent however I have to spray often as the scent does not last  - I still like it but a body spray be more cost effective considering how much you have to spray throughout the day of this pretty scent!</li>
    <li> Overall satisfied with the product. Main concern i have is Fragrance does not last long.  It fades of by a matter of 1-2 hours</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous... but the fragrance wears off very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this however I felt the smell was warn off pretty quick I do recommend the store bought one. If you trying to save money its okay but expect what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance however I&#x27;ve had it since April 2014 and it already smell like its old..I knew I shld hv purchased it fr a dept store</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I got this order pretty reasonably timed.  It smells great. I would order again.  Great price also.  Much better buy than going to Macy&#x27;s or to the mall for it for sure.</li>
    <li> great product and great seller just as advertised!!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved scent from a mag ad. Ordered and received through AP in two days. Best perfume purchase ever! The scent is perfect, light floral not over powering!</li>
    <li> I was using the MUSC OIL but it was replaced with this version. I was skeptical due to the MUSC oil is absolutely fabulous. The explanation regarding the MUSC oil was it will only be sold in the european market place. I must admit this scent is wonderful!!!!! (if you love musk type perfume).</li>
    <li> Fast good service&lt;br /&gt;balance sheet value of the goods-mail with an increase in purchases&lt;br /&gt;good sound packaging in which goods&lt;br /&gt;comes to the buyer unharmed&lt;br /&gt;ambulance dispatch&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> It was not the right perfume, and when I tried to inquire about the exchange and shipping back the product no one had gotten back to me.</li>
    <li> When I saw this parfum on line, I was really excited, and ordered it immediately... I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance at Macy&#x27;s, and paid a whole lot more for it. So, upon seeing the price It was going for on Amazon... I couldn&#x27;t pass it up... It came on the exact date expected.. But, after wearing it for the first time, I was very displeased; because the scent didn&#x27;t stay on me long at all, and I KNOW, from buying this same fragrance at Macy&#x27;s. It doesn&#x27;t take much to use, and the smell last all day. So now, I&#x27;m curious if this is the real stuff... I&#x27;m not to happy about this at all, but will continue to wear it. But next time I will buy it from Macy&#x27;s again. They&#x27;re more pricey... But, at least I KNOW, that I&#x27;m getting the real deal!</li>
    <li> the fragrance had almost no smell, and did not last even half an hour in the body, it evaporates very fast</li>
    <li> This eau de parfum has a nice scent but it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  Some reviews rave and some are in agreement with me.  It&#x27;s kind of a gamble; a gamble I took and lost.  I intend to try this at the Macy&#x27;s counter and walk around the mall with it on to see if there is a difference - hopefully the one on Amazon is not a counterfeit....maybe it&#x27;s just me!</li>
    <li> I have been using CK1 for years and always loved it. Got Narciso Rodriguez from my daughter in law and liked it a lot. So when it came time to order new cologne I decided to go on line and order it. It&#x27;s funny that I got this survey tonight because just tonight my husband and I were going out to dinner and I ask him if he can smell my cologne and he said no! For some reason this bottle is not as strong as the other. What I liked about the other was you put it on and it was strong for a couple of minute and then you smelled a faint smell of cologne which I always liked. I do not like a strong overwhelming cologne or perfume, This one doesn&#x27;t have that. I may try CK1 again after this bottle.</li>
    <li> Tried to find out what &amp;#34;Musc Collection&amp;#34; meant and was unsuccessful, but ordered it anyway. Now I have to return because it&#x27;s not the same as regular &amp;#34;For Her&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Thank you I  love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery !!! THANK-YOU so much!!!!would order again!  :) :) :)</li>
    <li> This is the best price, I used to pay $76 for this size.  The scent lasts and is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Was initially concerned whether this was authentic or not, bought a 50 ml rather than 100 ml for this reason. Will purchase larger bottle next time!</li>
    <li> I want the Egyptian musc type</li>
    <li> Wife states that smell not lasting</li>
    <li> signature scent. best of all feminine musks. recommended</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this smell. I bought it for my for her birthday BUT its mines now lol</li>
    <li> This has such a nice, clean fragrance about it.  It is my new &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;  for the year and I am looking for lotion and bath gel as well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice musk smell. Kinda soft and is similar to the softness of baby powder/lotion smell. It lasts a long while!</li>
    <li> I have worn this exact perfume from department stores and it has lasted days on my clothes. Whatever product was s5ent to me did not last a hour on my skin. I will do whatever I can to return it. Do not waste your money. Ignore all other positive reviews unless you want to purchase alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never order from this company again! You can not return an item like perfume-FYI.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent and I apply the cream by the same name.  This allows the scent to be more pronounced.</li>
