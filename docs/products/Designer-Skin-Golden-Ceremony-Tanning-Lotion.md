      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Worked better than I thought and the price compared to the salon price</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you rub it in evenly otherwise you could end up looking streaky from the bronzer.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great if you need color FAST.</li>
      <li>Great product, though it does not deliver as much on-the-spot colour as I&#x27;d have hoped.  </li>
      <li>I love love love this tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>I originally wanted a nice tan for my wedding</li>
      <li>My lotion was not runny at all, had a nice citrus lemon/lime smell and gave me a pretty nice bronze after one use.</li>
      <li>This was one of my favorites so far, had great texture, had a slinky silky feeling.</li>
      <li>bronzed look!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft</li>
      <li>The service was very quick.</li>
      <li>Even though I tan easily.</li>
      <li>If you apply it evenly, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin a beautiful color at a faster rate than most other lotions....</li>
      <li>Actually, it&#x27;s so effective that by the time you leave the salon and drive home, you will have a gorgeous tan that looks like you spent a week at the beach.  </li>
      <li>It is great, lasts long, and gives you a great overall color.</li>
      <li>This makes it a great choice when you want immediate results for an event, such as a wedding or special night out.  </li>
      <li>Helps with the golden glow!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick acting, and it gives me a beautiful golden color.</li>
      <li>I have used many lotions and I really like this one for indoor and outdoor tanning.</li>
      <li>Tanning salons charge far too much for all their products, so the price on Amazon is a pleasant surprise, not to mention safer than buying from Ebay, where you run the risk of purchasing a knockoff product.  </li>
      <li>It will give you a nice golden glow pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Great value and was shipped super fast with Blue Marble.</li>
      <li>Golden Ceremony gives me good facial color and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause acne.    </li>
      <li>I can quickly apply it without worrying about it streaking.</li>
      <li>plus it smells super pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I get a nice tan and my skin does not dry out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how much darker I can get with this product!</li>
      <li>Price and quality exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and always leaves my skin feeling sleek and smooth, but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Favorite tanning lotion by far.</li>
      <li>Designer Skin Golden Ceremony Tanning Lotion]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Item shipped quickly and appeared exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>This particular one says for special ocation bronzing</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant scent, almost reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum, but a little lighter.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend it and love the price too.</li>
      <li>It has bronzer, which provides instant natural golden color to give you immediate gratification, while developing a beautiful overall tan once the bronzer has worn off.  </li>
      <li>so I was only able to purchase it once then they quit selling it all</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the bottle is so small, and the smell isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>First time I ordered a tanning lotion online.</li>
      <li>So the price online is completely better, obviously.</li>
      <li>First, I did pay $40 for the bottle and it was supposedly on sale.</li>
      <li>but none of them have provided as much satisfaction as Golden Ceremony.  </li>
      <li>It was the first lotion I ever bought when I started indoor tanning 3years ago.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend wants to buy me several more when he gets paid.</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a more long term lotion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one because after using it for about 6-8 sessions, it started to make me look orange.</li>
      <li>*(If you are looking for a great lotion that gets you that deep dark tan, try Paint</li>
      <li>It goes on evenly with no streaking whatsoever, no odd color and no unpleasant after tan smell.  </li>
      <li>This shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>I got darker fast with this lotion by going three times.</li>
      <li>The lotion works really well.</li>
      <li>I have been tanning for several years and this became one of my favorite bronzers not long after I started tanning.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like how the product works on my face.</li>
      <li>Looks more natural than a lot of other brands.</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t get wow&#x27;d at.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend Golden Ceremony enough.</li>
      <li>so I limited my use of it to special occasions.  </li>
      <li>The price was outragious and i&#x27;m new to buying lotions.</li>
      <li>Natural looking bronzer for tan.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin a natural bronze/ sun-kissed.</li>
      <li>Makes you super dark</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is that I wish it came in a bigger size; however, I was well aware of the size when I bought it, so no complaints.</li>
      <li>The only thing you have to be careful with, is if you use it too much you can get that &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for everyday use, but when is combination with other lotions it can make you look fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many other brands and other products by Designer Skin (Black, Spellbound, etc.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although I&#x27;ve never bought this lotion from online. I did buy it at an LA Tan. The price was outragious and i&#x27;m new to buying lotions. i&#x27;d always just buy the $5 packets. So I took it up a notch and bought the bottle.     First, I did pay $40 for the bottle and it was supposedly on sale. So the price online is completely better, obviously. The smell is good. Smells citrus. And it does work!     Even though I tan easily. I got darker fast with this lotion by going three times. I think with this price you got nothing to lose. And there are none of those nonsense streaks that people claim lotions cause. If you apply it evenly, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Makes my skin a beautiful color at a faster rate than most other lotions....plus it smells super pretty!</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this lotion before I purchased it. I was expecting it to be a great lotion, but come to find out it wasn&#x27;t all I had intended it to be. It feels good and smells great when you put it on, but it makes you a tad bit orange. I used it for a week and it started to resemble a sunless tanner rather than a dark tanning lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the product is bad to use, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. ***(If you are looking for a great lotion that gets you that deep dark tan, try Paint It Black X60. It is great, lasts long, and gives you a great overall color. Plus, you can find it on here for $16!!! Great price!) Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for two years. I used to buy it at my tanning salon for over $40. The lotion works really well. I get a nice tan and my skin does not dry out. The smell isn&#x27;t great but it int bad either. Be sure you wash your hand after you use it. It has a bronzer or self tanner in it that will stain your hands.</li>
    <li> Favorite tanning lotion by far. It was the first lotion I ever bought when I started indoor tanning 3years ago. I still purchase this kind. Definitely recommend it and love the price too.</li>
    <li> Great product, though it does not deliver as much on-the-spot colour as I&#x27;d have hoped.  It smell great and is great for moisture.  Also a great price!</li>
    <li> Natural looking bronzer for tan. Love it</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You don&#x27;t have to use a tanning bed to get results and absolutely no streaking or orange coloring.  I use it to even out my skin tone on my arms and legs once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Best color of any tanning bronzer that I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many. It leaves your skin a natural bronze/ sun-kissed. I can quickly apply it without worrying about it streaking. I like that it&#x27;s not a loud/smelly fragrance.  I leave off a star b/c it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001LGM6NG Designer Skin Golden Ceremony Tanning Lotion]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this!! It smells yummy &amp; it keeps your skin so moisturized &amp; it has a bronzer in it that makes your skin look like you have a Florida tan!! This is all I use!!</li>
    <li> Price and quality exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
    <li> I originally wanted a nice tan for my wedding and this did the job. All other tanning lotions I had used previously did not work as quickly as this one did. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Designer Skin&#x27;s Golden Ceremony lotion is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has bronzer, which provides instant natural golden color to give you immediate gratification, while developing a beautiful overall tan once the bronzer has worn off.  This makes it a great choice when you want immediate results for an event, such as a wedding or special night out.  It goes on evenly with no streaking whatsoever, no odd color and no unpleasant after tan smell.  It is very moisturizing and always leaves my skin feeling sleek and smooth, but not greasy.  It has a very pleasant scent, almost reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum, but a little lighter. Other brands left me running for the shower to get them off my skin as soon as possible because they felt nasty and smell bad, often causing me to miss out on the bronzing they provided because I couldn&#x27;t stand to leave them on long enough for them to fully develop.  The great scent and moisturizing properties of Golden Ceremony make it a pleasure to leave on until the bronzer has done its work.  Actually, it&#x27;s so effective that by the time you leave the salon and drive home, you will have a gorgeous tan that looks like you spent a week at the beach.  I particularly like how the product works on my face. Other products (especially Designer Skin Black) caused me to break out and didn&#x27;t tan my face.  Golden Ceremony gives me good facial color and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause acne.    I&#x27;ve used many other brands and other products by Designer Skin (Black, Spellbound, etc.) but none of them have provided as much satisfaction as Golden Ceremony.  Tanning salons charge far too much for all their products, so the price on Amazon is a pleasant surprise, not to mention safer than buying from Ebay, where you run the risk of purchasing a knockoff product.  I can&#x27;t recommend Golden Ceremony enough.</li>
    <li> I returned an email to this company due to the fact i never received their product.   This is back in october when rhe item was purchased.  I have not received an email or phone call from them since about this product.  I would still like to get my product or my money back.  I would really like to use the product because I heard it was very good.   Guess I&#x27;ll probly never know.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to tan for an event in a relatively short time (3-4 sessions), then this lotion is perfect! It will give you a nice golden glow pretty fast. It smells pretty good and feels good as well. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a more long term lotion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one because after using it for about 6-8 sessions, it started to make me look orange. Also, make sure you rub it in evenly otherwise you could end up looking streaky from the bronzer.</li>
    <li> This was one of my favorites so far, had great texture, had a slinky silky feeling. Was cheap and had great bronzer in it. LOVED IT.</li>
    <li> Definitely a Bronzer! Looks more natural than a lot of other brands. A+</li>
    <li> My lotion was not runny at all, had a nice citrus lemon/lime smell and gave me a pretty nice bronze after one use. I&#x27;m excited to see how much darker I can get with this product! Great value and was shipped super fast with Blue Marble.</li>
    <li> I love love love this tanning lotion. It&#x27;s my new favorite. It&#x27;s quick acting, and it gives me a beautiful golden color. I would recommend this to anyone. This shipping was incredibly fast. The only thing I would say is that I wish it came in a bigger size; however, I was well aware of the size when I bought it, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> Helps with the golden glow!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, worth the price magnificent results.  Worked better than I thought and the price compared to the salon price was AMAZING.  Item shipped quickly and appeared exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> It actually is a &amp;#34;special occasion bronzer&amp;#34; basically just an overpriced self tanner. It was supposed to be citrus scented...it is not. I thought it was supposed to be a tanning accelerator, but it is not. I do not like it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great if you need color FAST. The only thing you have to be careful with, is if you use it too much you can get that &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; color. Its perfect if you have a special occasion coming up, and you want to boost your color right before. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the bottle is so small, and the smell isn&#x27;t the best. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lotion when I need to get color. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for everyday use, but when is combination with other lotions it can make you look fantastic.</li>
    <li> Makes you super dark so you only have to tan a couple times to get that bronzed look!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for several years and this became one of my favorite bronzers not long after I started tanning.  I love the smell and it works wonderfully. However, I would have to pay at least $40.00 dollars a bottle and that was when my tanning facility would have a half off sale so I was only able to purchase it once then they quit selling it all together so I limited my use of it to special occasions.  I reluctantly looked on here for it and took a chance hoping I did not get some watered down version and and quite pleased to say I purchased exactly what they were selling at at my tanning bed place an outrageous price.  My boyfriend wants to buy me several more when he gets paid. I am very happy to have my favorite bronzer at an affordable price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product was perfect just as they said. The service was very quick. They were excellent to work with too. I&#x27;d recommend them to anybody!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never get the nasty orange or streaks with the designer skin line. This particular one says for special ocation bronzing but I really didn&#x27;t get wow&#x27;d at. I&#x27;d purchase again because it is nice. Just no immediately bronzing.</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions and I really like this one for indoor and outdoor tanning. Great smell and doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
    <li> Love this product. First time I ordered a tanning lotion online. Great price. Seems to mkae you tan quickly and best part, I love the smell!</li>
