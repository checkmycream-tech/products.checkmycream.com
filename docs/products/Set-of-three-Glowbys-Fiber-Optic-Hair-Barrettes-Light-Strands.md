      <li>Otherwise they are great!</li>
      <li>Best use would seem to be for a one-time \\&quot;fling\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>but all looked AWESOME!!!!</li>
      <li>The ones that are rainbow colored are the best!!!!</li>
      <li>These made excellent fireworks for our tree topper!  </li>
      <li>I felt they would be perfect in some floral displays I was making.  </li>
      <li>i was also very happy with the one rainbow</li>
      <li>They loved them!</li>
      <li>The girls loved them!</li>
      <li>Great Price, and it was as advertised and arrived on a timely manner.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Turn it on and leave it on - and it works great.</li>
      <li>They would be great at a disco.  </li>
      <li>LOL    </li>
      <li>Great addition to an up-do.</li>
      <li>my daughter and niece really loved them made them happy so that  makes me happy</li>
      <li>They are bright and look great on the hair.</li>
      <li>All worked great, had good batteries.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d still recommend buying the light strands since they look so awesome</li>
      <li>A friend of mine had a rave themed birthday party for a friend and there were tons of glow sticks and glow jewelry that you see fairly often.</li>
      <li>I really liked them.they worked great on Halloween.they</li>
      <li>Your guess is as good as mine.</li>
      <li>have no problem keeping the barrettes in my hair - they seem fairly sturdy</li>
      <li>Egads, getting these ouf of the pack, sorting the colors for fashion appropriateness, turning these on, accessorizing their hair, playing with them and dancing around kept a pack of girls happy for the 1.5 hours wait on a warm summer evening waiting for a dinner table.  </li>
      <li>WITH MANY PEOPLE WANTING THEM AND GOOD BUY!</li>
      <li>The light strands looked awesome on their own but none of them would stay in my hair --</li>
      <li>but I would love them, too!</li>
      <li>and I will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>Worked great, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Will they outlast the kids loving them?</li>
      <li>Nice purchase although there&#x27;re cheaper alternatives here</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can replace the batteries too.</li>
      <li>This hair barrett worked well, but to turn it off you have to remove the battery; kind of a hassel.  </li>
      <li>:) this is a good company to order from, i cant wait to order again. :)</li>
      <li>She was even more thrilled when I showed her how she could clip them in her hair</li>
      <li>Great fun for nighttime events.  </li>
      <li>The lights were easy to use!</li>
      <li>It is adorable.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding.</li>
      <li>you have a light show on their head@!</li>
      <li>But overall, VERY happy!</li>
      <li>I love these barrettes and have received lots of compliments when I wear them at night.  </li>
      <li>These are fantastic for a variety of occasions!</li>
      <li>They were a big hit and the girls looked fabulous!!!!!  </li>
      <li>I love turning the strands on at night - lovely effect.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m in love with the colors they sent me as well.</li>
      <li>Daughters love it and provided some to their friends as gifts..</li>
      <li>Kids love them.</li>
      <li>You just have to be sure where you put the sprays as you need to access the bottom to turn battery on.</li>
      <li>Loved that I got a variety of colors and they shipped on time and for the right price.</li>
      <li>Very fun!  </li>
      <li>were bright enough so you could be seen but not to bright</li>
      <li>They are surprisingly bright, but I would recommend getting two or more since they aren&#x27;t very</li>
      <li>The other two worked perfectly, they just wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  </li>
      <li>A fun addition to any evening out! :)</li>
      <li>They clip into hair easily and stay well.</li>
      <li>If they hadn&#x27;t been ruined in packaging they would have served their purpose as the colors and fiber optics on the product are more than adequate.  </li>
      <li>I bet there are tips available somewhere for how to keep the barrettes in place</li>
      <li>The light strands have started falling out after 1 year.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old niece loved this gift.</li>
      <li>My friends and I are having fun with these as we sparkle in the night!  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more very soon!</li>
      <li>My 6 year old daughter loved them:)Delivery was very fast too!</li>
      <li>Every female (kids and adults alike) LOVED them.</li>
      <li>One of them the battery wore out pretty quickly but the others were fine.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really fun for dances, parties, or raves.</li>
      <li>Still fun to wear though.</li>
      <li>These are pure fun!</li>
      <li>The product description says Gloybys, but I received a different brand which simply wasn&#x27;t as good!</li>
      <li>small and light the light up very well and the best pat is they can be cut down to ant hair length ...</li>
      <li>I bought these for my daughter and a neighbor to wear during a mostly adult party to help give them something special and fun to do.</li>
      <li>First, they don&#x27;t have an on/off switch</li>
      <li>These look really pretty when lit.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for a Glow Run and they worked really well!  </li>
      <li>one of the three light strands malfunctioned early on and wouldn&#x27;t glow even after the batteries were changed.  </li>
      <li>I have contacted the seller and I&#x27;m pleased to say they were very quick with a response, within 24hrs,  and have told me that my two missing items are in the mail.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>They seem pretty durable and shine bright but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Only thing is that the clips are really big, but with a good head of hair it works.</li>
      <li>once they&#x27;re in, I just wouldn&#x27;t grow too attached to them since they fall out pretty easily with the current barrette structure.</li>
      <li>I GET POSITIVE FEEDBACK</li>
      <li>What would make it ideal would be if they came in different lengths, or if the clasp that attaches to your hair had a different design, like a regular hairclip, rather than what it is.</li>
      <li>this shows they really care about their customers and are willing to take care of them.</li>
      <li>Kids love them, for how long I don&#x27;t know....</li>
      <li>They have lasted a bit less than the 8-10 hours discussed in information---but no one seemed to care and the ability to recharge them with new batteries meant they were good to go again...</li>
      <li>This is fun to wear during a party for New Year&#x27;s or the 4th of July.</li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>These strands, once bent cannot be straightened so they were really ruined.  </li>
      <li>In fact, we created a disturbance because other kids (and women) wanted to touch them, see them and memorably \\&quot;Daddy</li>
      <li>Quick bit of instant gratification followed by consignment to the closet/bin....Toy Story anyone?</li>
      <li>These are decent barrettes.</li>
      <li>Putting aside any particular drug culture references (uh, rave accessory?)</li>
      <li>It would also be nice if the clasp was smaller and less noticeable.</li>
      <li>so you have to open the back cover to turn them off, which means the batteries or cover can be lost easily.  </li>
      <li>These however are seen less frequently and so attract more attention.</li>
      <li>I will write a new review after I test them out.</li>
      <li>DRESS THE HAIR UP FOR NEW YEAR&#x27;S EVE.  </li>
      <li>These light up nicely and have lots of potential uses, but the barrette fastener was useless to me.</li>
      <li>Ordering more now for the next dreaded moment of teen total boredom.      </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are fantastic for a variety of occasions! They&#x27;re really fun for dances, parties, or raves. They clip into hair easily and stay well. A friend of mine had a rave themed birthday party for a friend and there were tons of glow sticks and glow jewelry that you see fairly often. These however are seen less frequently and so attract more attention.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and a neighbor to wear during a mostly adult party to help give them something special and fun to do. They loved them! One of them the battery wore out pretty quickly but the others were fine. (I bought some others also from another listing). They stuck out a little and didn&#x27;t quite lay flat on their hair but they didn&#x27;t care. Very fun!  My other neighbor (12 yrs old) also seemed to enloy them. It takes a few mins to figure out how to slide them open to turn them off, but nothing critical. It&#x27;s nice that you can replace the batteries too.</li>
    <li> I bought these to decorate a Christmas Tree.  Our theme was &amp;#34;All American Christmas&amp;#34; and we went the patriotic route.  These made excellent fireworks for our tree topper!  Worked great, easy to use.  No issues with turning on/off; although we did lose one battery, it didn&#x27;t keep it from working.</li>
    <li> I ordered these fir EDC Vegas. Loved that I got a variety of colors and they shipped on time and for the right price.</li>
    <li> Not very often do I get a chance to be this hip...Putting aside any particular drug culture references (uh, rave accessory?), I bought these knowing that during a recent family trip with friends there would come a dreaded moment when boredom would strike the girls who were traveling with us and my kids.  Egads, getting these ouf of the pack, sorting the colors for fashion appropriateness, turning these on, accessorizing their hair, playing with them and dancing around kept a pack of girls happy for the 1.5 hours wait on a warm summer evening waiting for a dinner table.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.  Not a single whine.  In fact, we created a disturbance because other kids (and women) wanted to touch them, see them and memorably \\&quot;Daddy, I want one, buy me one, get me one\\&quot; \\&quot;They&#x27;re not for sale\\&quot; as someone else&#x27;s child was dragged away wailing...Would have given them one, but the wives even dove into the package.  Of course, I ended up wearing one too...    Ordering more now for the next dreaded moment of teen total boredom.      BTW, all the boys wanted to do was play videogames on Ipods...LOL    They have lasted a bit less than the 8-10 hours discussed in information---but no one seemed to care and the ability to recharge them with new batteries meant they were good to go again...</li>
    <li> The product description says Gloybys, but I received a different brand which simply wasn&#x27;t as good!</li>
    <li> This hair barrett worked well, but to turn it off you have to remove the battery; kind of a hassel.  They say you can just lossen the cover to turn it off but the battery then falls out.  Turn it on and leave it on - and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is fun to wear during a party for New Year&#x27;s or the 4th of July. It works well and looks alright. The &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; switch is a bit weird; you have to make sure you keep the thing somewhere where the battery won&#x27;t fall out and get lost. What would make it ideal would be if they came in different lengths, or if the clasp that attaches to your hair had a different design, like a regular hairclip, rather than what it is. It would also be nice if the clasp was smaller and less noticeable. Other than that, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> I order these about twice a year for my girlfriends and I. We use them on our girls nights out. They are awsome and I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> My friends and I are having fun with these as we sparkle in the night!  A fun addition to any evening out! :)</li>
    <li> DRESS THE HAIR UP FOR NEW YEAR&#x27;S EVE.  I GET POSITIVE FEEDBACK WITH MANY PEOPLE WANTING THEM AND GOOD BUY!</li>
    <li> My 5 year old niece loved this gift. She was even more thrilled when I showed her how she could clip them in her hair lol. They seem pretty durable and shine bright but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my package, it came on time and neatly packed, however when I opened it I was sad to see only ONE hair clip. I paid for THREE. I have contacted the seller and I&#x27;m pleased to say they were very quick with a response, within 24hrs,  and have told me that my two missing items are in the mail. i was also very happy with the one rainbow one i did get. Update: i received the rest of my order with an extra thrown in and a key chain! this shows they really care about their customers and are willing to take care of them. i&#x27;m in love with the colors they sent me as well. it is always a surprise. :) this is a good company to order from, i cant wait to order again. :)</li>
    <li> i got two and the clips arent covered the way they are depicted in the pictures. the clips are clear which makes it so that you can see the lights glowing on your head - and not necessarily just in the fiber optic strands. they also came folded which folded the plastic and left a big bend in the FO strands. wouldnt purchase again</li>
    <li> small and light the light up very well and the best pat is they can be cut down to ant hair length ... my daughter and niece really loved them made them happy so that  makes me happy</li>
    <li> Grandaughter likes them.  dont like the fact that there is no shut off switch.  They show all these colors, all we got was one green and two white.  really?</li>
    <li> Kids love them. Wish I could have chosen the colors. Recd one each blue, white &amp; rainbow. All worked great, had good batteries.</li>
    <li> Great fun for nighttime events.  I&#x27;m giving some to my niece for Prom next year.  Great addition to an up-do.</li>
    <li> These are pure fun! Our school is hosting a dance, and we cannot wait to wear these. I only wish they were consistant with colors. I ordered 5 packages. Of the 5 packages, I had 2 that were flashy, most were white and green, and 2 purple.</li>
    <li> While these are very pretty in the hair, the barrette clasps were extremely difficult to open and close and were substantially larger than expected.  Once the battery was activated, it was hard to turn it off.  While the method is not to close the back of the barrette all the way, the slightest movement caused the \\&quot;light\\&quot; to come back on, I think the batteries would get used up quickly.  Also hard to store.  Best use would seem to be for a one-time \\&quot;fling\\&quot;.  They would be great at a disco.  These were returned, which was done with no problem.</li>
    <li> Great Price, and it was as advertised and arrived on a timely manner. I recommend if this is what u were looking for. I bought for my Girlfriend and her friend and they wore these in a glow run.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old niece loves them but I would love them, too! I will be buying more very soon!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really use these since they were sent to me in a small envelope folded in half.  These strands, once bent cannot be straightened so they were really ruined.  If they hadn&#x27;t been ruined in packaging they would have served their purpose as the colors and fiber optics on the product are more than adequate.  Thse should not be folded in half when shipped.  They must lie flat in the envelope or box people.</li>
    <li> Daughters love it and provided some to their friends as gifts.. Nice purchase although there&#x27;re cheaper alternatives here.. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> These are decent barrettes. I have owned mine for about a year and wear them to various parties.  The light strands have started falling out after 1 year. I also thought based on the picture that the colors would stream down to the fiber optic tips.  This is not so.  The actual barrette lights up as well as the tips, but in between there is a  foot of no light.  This is not a big deal, just not what I had pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem keeping the barrettes in my hair - they seem fairly sturdy</li>
    <li> I really liked them.they worked great on Halloween.they were bright enough so you could be seen but not to bright so you couldn&#x27;t see</li>
    <li> These light up nicely and have lots of potential uses, but the barrette fastener was useless to me. If you have short or thin hair (or have some alternative use in mind), be aware that the fastener is a bit bulky, doesn&#x27;t fit tightly and is difficult to fasten.</li>
    <li> only giving this 3 stars until I test them out. I will write a new review after I test them out.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a Glow Run and they worked really well!  My only co,plaint is you have to be REALLY careful how far you open it (which is the on/off swutch) because if you go too far, the batteries fall out.  But overall, VERY happy!</li>
    <li> I like to think outside of the box.  When I saw the Glowbys Barrette I felt they would be perfect in some floral displays I was making.  Outstanding. Battery operated so it can be used over and over again.  You just have to be sure where you put the sprays as you need to access the bottom to turn battery on. I love turning the strands on at night - lovely effect.</li>
    <li> These look really pretty when lit.  Some of the batteries were dead when we got them but no big deal.  The girls loved them!</li>
    <li> I got this for my weddign party. Every female (kids and adults alike) LOVED them. They are bright and look great on the hair. Everyone used them differently up/down/sided but all looked AWESOME!!!! They last long. You can turn it on and off and make them last longer. My guests used them the following days during day and night!. I totally recommend this product. The only con was I thought they were going to be of different colors but only got the blue ones. Still, they were a hit!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a nine-year olds slumber party.  They were a big hit and the girls looked fabulous!!!!!  The ones that are rainbow colored are the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these barrettes and have received lots of compliments when I wear them at night.  They are surprisingly bright, but I would recommend getting two or more since they aren&#x27;t very large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons I didn&#x27;t give these five stars.  First, they don&#x27;t have an on/off switch so you have to open the back cover to turn them off, which means the batteries or cover can be lost easily.  Second, they use small 3V CR1220 batteries, which I have not been able to find at any local stores.  I would recommend purchasing a pack of them online when you purchase these.  Otherwise they are great!</li>
    <li> It is adorable.  I got these for 9 year old. Only thing is that the clips are really big, but with a good head of hair it works.</li>
    <li> The lights were easy to use! just clip it into the hair and then just switch it to on and presto you have a light show on their head@! My 6 year old daughter loved them:)Delivery was very fast too!</li>
    <li> Got 1 rainbow and 2 \\&quot;plain\\&quot; colors. Kids love them, for how long I don&#x27;t know....kids! Will they outlast the kids loving them? Your guess is as good as mine. Quick bit of instant gratification followed by consignment to the closet/bin....Toy Story anyone?</li>
    <li> Look cool but not bright unless it&#x27;s really dark in the room you are at.  Still fun to wear though.</li>
    <li> The light strands looked awesome on their own but none of them would stay in my hair -- one of the three light strands malfunctioned early on and wouldn&#x27;t glow even after the batteries were changed.  The other two worked perfectly, they just wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  I bet there are tips available somewhere for how to keep the barrettes in place, I thought bobby pins would do the trick but unfortunately they did not.  I&#x27;d still recommend buying the light strands since they look so awesome once they&#x27;re in, I just wouldn&#x27;t grow too attached to them since they fall out pretty easily with the current barrette structure.</li>
