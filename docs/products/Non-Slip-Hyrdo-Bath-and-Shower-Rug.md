      <li>Good Buy!!</li>
      <li>awesome hydro bath and shower rug</li>

      <li>The hydro rug is a great bath and shower rug.  </li>
      <li>(FOR ONCE LOL).</li>
      <li>Feels great on the feet.  </li>
      <li>Good traction and good feel to it.</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful to your feet and keeps them smooth.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>would be a really good mat if the suction cups would adhere to a smooth surface as advertised.</li>
      <li>Not overly non-slip (The matt will slip) but better than the one it replaced.</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>Better then the one advertised &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; that we had before.</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>Wonderful feel, but does slip slightly.</li>
      <li>We use it in our shower and if stays secure and doesn&#x27;t slip.  </li>
      <li>Love it -works very well in our shower - no slip - six suction cups - same material and easy on the feet!!</li>
      <li>The reason I gave 4 stars rather than five is that it catches some hair and that bothers me, but it is pretty easy to rinse off.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to stand on and it is very helpful the water drips out at through the bottom.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S SOFT TO THE FEET, WILL NOT SKID AND EASY &amp;#34;CLEANING&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Great product for shower, much better than vinyl mats, only negative is that the suction cups do not stick very well.</li>
      <li>Water goes straight through.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t stick to a smooth wall surface to dry either.</li>
      <li>FIT IT DIRECTLY OVER THE DRAIN, THIS CATCHES HAIR AND OTHER SMALL PIECES</li>

    <li> Works well  Didn&#x27;t slip</li>
    <li> It is comfortable to stand on and it is very helpful the water drips out at through the bottom.</li>
    <li> My wife has a 12 wks surgery recovery to reattach a hamstring to her pelvis. I don&#x27;t worry when she&#x27;s showering w/this and some other suction handles I bought. Nice.</li>
    <li> Love them.  They feel padded.  I love them.  I got 2 and would buy them again1</li>
    <li> I dislike bath mats but this one has way fewer suction cups that was what is was looking for plus the water runs through, much less soap scum build up.</li>
    <li> Terrible . Doesn&#x27;t stick to bottom of tub!!!</li>
    <li> would be a really good mat if the suction cups would adhere to a smooth surface as advertised. It won&#x27;t stick to a smooth wall surface to dry either.</li>
    <li> Completely different take on bathmat. Feels great on the feet.  Water goes straight through.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful feel, but does slip slightly.</li>
    <li> Great product for shower, much better than vinyl mats, only negative is that the suction cups do not stick very well.</li>
    <li> awesome hydro bath and shower rug</li>

    <li> Not overly non-slip (The matt will slip) but better than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> Works as expected for slippage, but is uncomfortable on the feet.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like with this product is it traps hair and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;high maintenance&amp;#34; for a shower rug.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL, JUSY WONDERFUL! MY BROTHER RECOMMENDED THIS AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I LISTENED TO HIM (FOR ONCE LOL). IT&#x27;S SOFT TO THE FEET, WILL NOT SKID AND EASY &amp;#34;CLEANING&amp;#34;. FIT IT DIRECTLY OVER THE DRAIN, THIS CATCHES HAIR AND OTHER SMALL PIECES ONE MAY FIND ON THE SKIN. RINSE IT, PICK OFF HAIR AND OTHER DEBRIS, LET IT DRY, THAT&#x27;S ALL. IT STATES IT LASTS &amp;#34;FOREVER&amp;#34; I CAN SEE IT. MY BROTHER HAS HIS FOR 4 YEARS NOW.</li>
    <li> The hydro rug is a great bath and shower rug.  We use it in our shower and if stays secure and doesn&#x27;t slip.  It feels wonderful to your feet and keeps them smooth.  The reason I gave 4 stars rather than five is that it catches some hair and that bothers me, but it is pretty easy to rinse off.  I will keep buying these for our shower.</li>
    <li> Better then the one advertised &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; that we had before. Love it -works very well in our shower - no slip - six suction cups - same material and easy on the feet!! Good Buy!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best shower rug I have purchased!</li>
    <li> Great safety feature for the shower</li>
