      <li>Great shave, reasonably priced, and comes with plenty of refills.</li>

      <li>Myght not as fancy as gilet, give you much better shave</li>
      <li>I love the idea of marketing this as a \\&quot;hybrid\\&quot; disposable system, but I wish Bic would add a couple more ounces to the handle.</li>
      <li>You would expect that a 3-bladed razor would offer a better pig-shaving experience than cheaper, 2-bladed affairs.</li>
      <li>Would of had better luck with a carrot</li>
      <li>You cannot buy more refills.  </li>
      <li>It would be better to use a rotary saw instead of this razor.</li>
      <li>I love this razor</li>
      <li>The way the blade/cartridge is designed the top orange part is too \\&quot;tall\\</li>
      <li>Just okay.</li>
      <li>Better than using cheap razers</li>
      <li>Excited that I found these razors on sale on this lovely website, I said, &#x27;Why not?&#x27; and ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>good value, good sharp razors.</li>
      <li>But for the price it has worked out fine.</li>
      <li>razor is light and feels wimpy, like it is going to break in my strong man hands, forcing the blades into my flesh.  </li>
      <li>Have to shave twice to get a perfect shave since I shave every few days or so.</li>
      <li>great for price, blades seem to last longer than others</li>
      <li>far the Bic Hybrid three-blade system has worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>It might not be the best shaving razor, but for price and quality, it wins hands down in my book.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The product may be unique in that it is both a refillable and disposable razor.  </li>
      <li>Quaity wasn&#x27;t as good as what I expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Only thing good about this is it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re good enough.</li>
      <li>Heck, why not just go all the way and make it a true cartridge system with a metal handle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Targeted at men, the design lacks some of touches that BIC typically provides for their shavers intended for women, like a fancy ergonomically designed handle, bright colors, and rubber strips for better grip when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After picking up the razor for the first time, inserting the blade cartridge, and holding the blades to my face there was a ping of doubt that this unimpressive set-up didn&#x27;t have the force available to cut through my stubble.  </li>
      <li>It makes for a pretty good shave overall.</li>
      <li>Never before have I not even made it through the first one!</li>
      <li>They do not work if you have remotely coarse hair…or basically more than one day growth!</li>
      <li>My old mach 3 razor still gives a better shave than these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ved used every type of razor, but these are one of two that do not cause any kind of facial irritation.</li>
      <li>I started to shave and noticed right away</li>
      <li>This product is barely ditinguishable from the much more highly priced national branded products of a similar kind.</li>
      <li>Thanks for nothing!</li>
      <li>The only way this razor could be better would be if they added some weight to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sticking with higher end shavers now on.</li>
      <li>If you are not a picky shaver or just can&#x27;t afford a higher end shaver</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Unless you trim it with clippers first.</li>
      <li>The package will hold eight refills, and this was the way the product was first sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The set comes with a lot of blades to keep me shaving for a few good months.  </li>
      <li>The disposable triple-blade cartridges are sharp, providing smooth &amp; closer shave, and easy to be replaced.</li>
      <li>My fault most likely for thinking it would work (considering the price), but it really butchered my skin when shaving.</li>
      <li>In other words, you won&#x27;t be able to get to the hairs right under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month, and am using the fourth BiC Easy cartridge.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>does not irritate my skin and very affordable.</li>
      <li>Very.</li>
      <li>that I have to purchase the whole package</li>
      <li>Thanks Bic.</li>
      <li>Never have I had so much blood after a shave.  </li>
      <li>With these you get the same great shave and because of how they are constructed you avoid the little nicks and cuts that often occur with thesingle blade fixed head throw aways.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the top strip on these blades is supposed to do, but it definitely does NOT provide extra lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The triple blade head usually slides smoothly across the skin, but doesn&#x27;t always do an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it did arrive very fast and there was nothing else wrong other than it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
      <li>That weight is important when it comes to the level of drag a razor produces.</li>
      <li>I normally use Gillette Mach 3 blades, but decided to try these.</li>
      <li>If you want a shaver that does a passable job, and should last for a while, the Hybrid Advance 3 might be worth a look.</li>
      <li>On most modern razor blades there is a strip that provides extra lubrication when it gets wet.  </li>
      <li>You normally get six refills, and then you throw the handle away and buy a new set of refills and a handle.  </li>
      <li>Blades are sharp and makes for a smooth cut.</li>
      <li>I used to use cheap CVS/Target razors (razor burn and all), then I used more expensive razors.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of razors and usually use the Mach 3 razors, but I was looking for the most cost efficient razor.</li>
      <li>The blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough and the lotion pad on top doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>Blades do not even seem remotely sharp and they clog quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, pigs of all breeds are naturally bristly creatures</li>
      <li>/&gt;Several months ago I switched to BIC Shaver combined with an oatmeal based sensitive shaving cream</li>
      <li>I also found that if you want to extend the life of the blade just sharpen on an old pair of levis to add 50% to the life of the blade.</li>
      <li>Decent razers only.</li>
      <li>The price is certainly right when compared to other razor/shaving systems .</li>
      <li>But the main reason why I am only crediting 3 stars is because while the item has 2 day shipping (prime), it actually took 6 days (I live in Phoenix AZ).</li>
      <li>I can shave with one refill for an entire month, with usually no nicks.  </li>
      <li>I have used these a long time and found they last as good as expensive ones.  </li>
      <li>But after several nicks, cuts, and loud, piercing squeals, I finally had to call it quits lest the neighbors complain.</li>
      <li>The blades are spaced far enough apart so that they do not get clogged with cut facial</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I also don&#x27;t need to point out that, despite his relatively small size, it is typically a multi-razor job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month, and am using the fourth BiC Easy cartridge. The curved &amp; textured handle is made of plastic - feels sturdy, yet it is light-weight, and ergonomically designed. But it is not slip-proof design. The disposable triple-blade cartridges are sharp, providing smooth &amp; closer shave, and easy to be replaced. But if you have sensitive skin, expect skin irritation after a few days of shaving. With $2.00 off manufacture&#x27;s coupon, I paid less than $5.00 for this item at the local supermarket. Comes with 1 handle + 6 cartridges in the packaging. Note: Razor holder is NOT included. Made in Greece.</li>
    <li> The quality of the item is alright.  But the main reason why I am only crediting 3 stars is because while the item has 2 day shipping (prime), it actually took 6 days (I live in Phoenix AZ).</li>
    <li> great for price, blades seem to last longer than others</li>
    <li> The good:  Price can&#x27;t be beaten, lightweight, blade remain semi-sharp for a good number of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: difficult to clean the stubble after use, and there is no microtrimming blade for edging and touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok product- another example of &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;.</li>
    <li> The BIC Hybrid Advance 3 is an economy grade shaver, with a replaceable three blade head.  Targeted at men, the design lacks some of touches that BIC typically provides for their shavers intended for women, like a fancy ergonomically designed handle, bright colors, and rubber strips for better grip when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With rather plain looks, a heavily ribbed handle, and a rather dull gray and orange color scheme, the Advance 3 probably won&#x27;t score many points for style.  The triple blade head usually slides smoothly across the skin, but doesn&#x27;t always do an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing cartridges is simple, as the locking mechanism on the handle isn&#x27;t complicated.  A total of six cartridges are included in this set.  If you want a shaver that does a passable job, and should last for a while, the Hybrid Advance 3 might be worth a look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blade exclusively for at least three years now.  It might not be the best shaving razor, but for price and quality, it wins hands down in my book.  I can shave with one refill for an entire month, with usually no nicks.  This is twice as long as any other blade or razor I&#x27;ve ever shaved with.  The only way this razor could be better would be if they added some weight to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may be unique in that it is both a refillable and disposable razor.  You normally get six refills, and then you throw the handle away and buy a new set of refills and a handle.  By then, the handle usually has hard water deposits built up on it, and needs to be trashed.  Occasionally, you can find it with eight refills.  The package will hold eight refills, and this was the way the product was first sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have barbed wire for a beard, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> These are good quality for the price. This is the nicest disposable razer I&#x27;ve ever used. My husband bought one for himself. He made me try his and now I buy them for myself too! Very happy with the price and quality of this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ved used every type of razor, but these are one of two that do not cause any kind of facial irritation. As long as they make these I will buy them.</li>
    <li> It makes for a pretty good shave overall. The set comes with a lot of blades to keep me shaving for a few good months.  Blades are sharp and makes for a smooth cut.</li>
    <li> I love this razor it is a cheaper alternative to the other razors I&#x27;ve bought. It gives me a nice clean shave for a good price. Keep in mind I dont have very thick hair. I only shave my side burns and the sparse hair that grows on my chin and above my lip. If you have a thick beard i would not recomend this poduct. Unless you trim it with clippers first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Bic razors in the past but could never find one that was forgiving enough. That&#x27;s how Gillette gets you -- by making a razor so forgiving to the face that you can&#x27;t help but buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But consider this: A new Gillette ProGlide razor and handle sell (on average) around $7.99. That&#x27;s one handle and one cartridge. This set from Bic includes one handle and six cartridges, yet retails around a dollar less. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t like choosing between buying Gillette cartridges or buying groceries for the week. OK, maybe it&#x27;s not that bad, but it&#x27;s not far from the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the Bic Hybrid three-blade system has worked fairly well. It appears Bic has made a play to reduce the aggressiveness of these razors by adding a comically-enlarged orange guard strip above the blades. The product description says the strip includes aloe and vitamin E -- meh. That thing is there to keep the blades from destroying your skin. And it works. Bravo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically get around four shaves per blade, and it all depends on my shave prep. Gotta shower up and use some good-quality shave cream. Give this razor the Cinderella treatment -- glass slippers, fancy ball gown, giant horse-drawn pumpkin. Treat your face like you care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside is the handle. It&#x27;s kind of short and curved, and worst of all, it&#x27;s one of the lightest handles I&#x27;ve ever used. That weight is important when it comes to the level of drag a razor produces. I love the idea of marketing this as a \\&quot;hybrid\\&quot; disposable system, but I wish Bic would add a couple more ounces to the handle. Heck, why not just go all the way and make it a true cartridge system with a metal handle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, the shortcomings of this razor are a moot point because look at that price tag! A handle and six cartridges for less than you&#x27;d pay for one ProGlide? And it doesn&#x27;t tear up my face? Sign me up.</li>
    <li> Cross between disposable and the expensive ones.  comes with 7 3 blade cartridges.  I have used these a long time and found they last as good as expensive ones.  You cannot buy more refills.  It only comes in this package</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you have fairly coarse facial hair, then this won&#x27;t work well for you. My fault most likely for thinking it would work (considering the price), but it really butchered my skin when shaving. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone like me.</li>
    <li> Excited that I found these razors on sale on this lovely website, I said, &#x27;Why not?&#x27; and ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they mean by &#x27;hybrid&#x27;, it&#x27;s just a razor with a bunch of blades on it.  I found it weird that I couldn&#x27;t buy just the refill blades, that I have to purchase the whole package again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is light and feels wimpy, like it is going to break in my strong man hands, forcing the blades into my flesh.  After picking up the razor for the first time, inserting the blade cartridge, and holding the blades to my face there was a ping of doubt that this unimpressive set-up didn&#x27;t have the force available to cut through my stubble.  I had flashbacks to the other bic razors I have tried in the past, throwing away razor after razor during one shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started to shave and noticed right away there is this weird rubber part on the blade that&#x27;s after the blade.  I would imagine that the rubber part would be before the blades, in order to pick up my stubble and prepare those bastards for cutting.  Not so with this system, you get a weird rubber pulling feeling after you complete a stroke.  The blades are spaced far enough apart so that they do not get clogged with cut facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Myght not as fancy as gilet, give you much better shave</li>
    <li> I used to use cheap CVS/Target razors (razor burn and all), then I used more expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I switched to BIC Shaver combined with an oatmeal based sensitive shaving cream and I have never looked back. I have not had cuts, burns, or any other issues with this combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE+QUALITY&#x3D;VALUE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of razors and usually use the Mach 3 razors, but I was looking for the most cost efficient razor. After shaving with a few different blades the effect was the same, a bad shave. I dry shave in the shower and have never had such a rough shave. The blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough and the lotion pad on top doesn&#x27;t do anything. I even try using shaving cream and I still end up with razor burn and bleeding. My old mach 3 razor still gives a better shave than these. Very disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> Why should I buy another razor? Often the razor or razors are still good. It seems to me that BIC should give you a choose or buying only the cartridges alone instead of having to buy another razor with cartridges!</li>
    <li> Good product, nice shave</li>
    <li> These are some of the best razors on the market.  Repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Only thing good about this is it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Looks Premium&lt;br /&gt;--Shape of razor&lt;br /&gt;--Nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Cuts your face all up&lt;br /&gt;--Was shaving and it snagged on my face cheek and put a nice cut on my face (never ever have I had this happen)&lt;br /&gt;--Rubber strip on the razor does nothing&lt;br /&gt;--Unable to shave under nose (razor to big)&lt;br /&gt;--Snags a lot&lt;br /&gt;--Bic does not pay for return shipping if you don&#x27;t like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my face is an isolated incident.  Never have I had so much blood after a shave.  Bad timing as I have a interview panel I am sitting on next day.  Picked this shaver because I wanted a close shave.  Would of had better luck with a carrot peeler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero Stars.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It would be better to use a rotary saw instead of this razor. So. Very. Bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a local grocery store.  I will never buy this junk again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not a close shave.  This was surprising because I can&#x27;t recall ever not getting a close shave with a disposable razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The way the blade/cartridge is designed the top orange part is too \\&quot;tall\\&quot; so it is impossible to get all the way up close to your nose.  In other words, you won&#x27;t be able to get to the hairs right under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. On most modern razor blades there is a strip that provides extra lubrication when it gets wet.  I don&#x27;t know what the top strip on these blades is supposed to do, but it definitely does NOT provide extra lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be this good. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> good value, good sharp razors. occasionally get a dull one.</li>
    <li> Just okay. I get a week of shaves from each cartridge. They don&#x27;t cut closely (they also don&#x27;t nick, scratch, or irritate my skin) but they also don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as other disposable heads.</li>
    <li> the best shaver out there</li>
    <li> Decent razers only. Better than using cheap razers but the shave is a disappointment. Have to shave twice to get a perfect shave since I shave every few days or so. does not irritate my skin and very affordable. If you are not a picky shaver or just can&#x27;t afford a higher end shaver these are good. They do last long. I am sticking with higher end shavers now on.</li>
    <li> I normally use Gillette Mach 3 blades, but decided to try these. Was disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and the blades wear down quickly. Would only buy out of desperation.</li>
    <li> Quaity wasn&#x27;t as good as what I expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 packs of these from a natl chain store on sale. Bad mitake... this is the worst disposable I have ever used. After just a couple shaves I changed blades with no improvement youll wear your face out trying to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says it&#x27;s the best razor she&#x27;s used. The price is certainly right when compared to other razor/shaving systems . I was disappointed that &amp;#34; 6 count&amp;#34; means six blades and not 6 razors. Shipping was very slow. Her armpit hair was half way to her hips by the time the razor arrived.</li>
    <li> This product is barely ditinguishable from the much more highly priced national branded products of a similar kind. Not as heavy and perhaps not as many blades and certainly less sturdy than the well advertised competition, but after decades of shaving it&#x27;s clear to me that those added qualities are both entirely unecessary and highly expensive for shaving gear. With these you get the same great shave and because of how they are constructed you avoid the little nicks and cuts that often occur with thesingle blade fixed head throw aways. I also found that if you want to extend the life of the blade just sharpen on an old pair of levis to add 50% to the life of the blade.</li>
    <li> these razors aren&#x27;t good. trust me, they aren&#x27;t. stick with Mach 3!!</li>
    <li> Bought these because they were on sale. They do not cut worth a crap. Nick city! How can a triple blade razor cause nicks? That is absolutely ridiculous! They do not work if you have remotely coarse hair…or basically more than one day growth! Blades do not even seem remotely sharp and they clog quickly. Useless! I know I would never buy these again.</li>
    <li> I liked this because of the Disposable System.  This is great if you go camping.</li>
    <li> While this wasn&#x27;t the worst shave he&#x27;s ever had, my pot-bellied pig, Judge Robert Pork, did not care for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not. One. Bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, pigs of all breeds are naturally bristly creatures but no more so than my Viking ancestors. You would expect that a 3-bladed razor would offer a better pig-shaving experience than cheaper, 2-bladed affairs. But after several nicks, cuts, and loud, piercing squeals, I finally had to call it quits lest the neighbors complain. Again. Poor guy. It was quite the chore applying the styptic to him, I don&#x27;t mind telling you! I&#x27;m sure I also don&#x27;t need to point out that, despite his relatively small size, it is typically a multi-razor job. Never before have I not even made it through the first one! Thanks Bic. Thanks for nothing! Me and the honorable Judge Pork will be taking our shaving business elsewhere in future.</li>
    <li> love these razors and it is a great value for the quality.  I like others still unsure why replacement blades unavailble</li>
    <li> My go-to razor - just bought a second one for keeping at my partner&#x27;s house!! Great shave, reasonably priced, and comes with plenty of refills.</li>
    <li> Ehh... Not what I expected. But for the price it has worked out fine.</li>
    <li> I desperately needed razors, because of a short supply. I like Bic Hybrid because you can refill razors using the same razor.</li>
    <li> I guess the blades are always cutting my boyfriend.... But it did arrive very fast and there was nothing else wrong other than it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
    <li> These work well. I would not say they&#x27;re perfect but they&#x27;re good enough.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few years now and find there&#x27;s not much difference between this and Gillette or Schick except price.</li>
