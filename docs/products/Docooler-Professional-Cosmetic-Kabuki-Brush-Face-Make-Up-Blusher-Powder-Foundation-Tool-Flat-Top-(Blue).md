      <li>/&gt;It took 4 weeks to arrive and it&#x27;s not very dense at all not is it very good at blending makeup, applying foundation or smoothing already applied makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was great 😍 i lovee this brush</li>
    <li> This is a great make up brush. I thought that the bristles would fall out over time and it has not fallen out or became damaged what so ever. I love it.</li>
    <li> Everything i expected, soft and looks very professional!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, the quality so far is excellent. It took a very long time to arrive. It comes from China and I guess it got held up in customs because it took longer then shown.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this brush! It is extremely soft and feels great on the skin, whilst still distributes my foundation evenly. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Great make up brush. Its soft and applies make up well.</li>
    <li> Great brush and for the price even more amazing ! Took a while to arrive but so worth it! Use it everyday for my liquid foundation and I get a flawless finish every time</li>
    <li> Love it ! No loose hairs works like a professional brush &amp; price was inexpensive</li>
    <li> i love this brush gets the color in the right places . the brissles feel great. very soft.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I used every single day , perfect for me :)&lt;br /&gt;I recomend 100%</li>
    <li> Not good. It got sticky when there is foundation on it.</li>
    <li> quick and easy to put on foundation plus no streak marks</li>
    <li> Nice soft little brush good for the price hope it does start shedding like others but so far ok</li>
    <li> Hold onto powder very well</li>
    <li> works great and the hairs do not shed</li>
    <li> I like this brush,it seems to be a dupe of the brushes REAL TECHNIQUES.and thats what i like about it. also when i got mine it was shedding but thts with most brushes because the chemicals in the process of making it are still on there,but after i washed it,it was fine i like how they come in different colors like, pink,purple,blue. oppose to the real techniques only come in two basic boring colors. It is soo soft and i like tht its softer then the real techniques brushes but the docooler is not as firm as id like them then real techniques but is sturdy enough and has its own unique qualities.Something i would love to see if docooler decides to make a new collection is the name on the brush.But overall i am pleased with docoolers brush and will be buying from them again soon!You make wonderful products.-Customerforlife :)</li>
    <li> Love it so much blends in my foundation perfectly!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried however I have taken it out feels different than all the other brushes I owned.  Sticky silky yet isn&#x27;t hair brush.  Pretty wings that carry the wind of color to where you need it at without an mess.</li>
    <li> Loved this brush so much I bought a second and use them every single day!</li>
    <li> ****update*****brush now leaves hairs all over my face every time I use it. Even after washing it several times it sheds like crazy  I love this brush.  I use it for my foundation and it gives me a very airbrushed affect whether I use Mac or my drugstore foundation</li>
    <li> The black end of the brush broke of while I was using it for the first time. I had to hot glue it back on but it is a good brush.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite brushes. I didn&#x27;t pay a lot but love this brush. It&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love.. Presses powder into face amazingly!😏👌🏼</li>
    <li> It is soooooo soft! Even after i wash the bristles its still soft and it doesnt shed!</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and makes applying foundation really easy.  Make up looks very natural when using this brush.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I am really bummed about this brush. I waited several weeks for it and I finally got it today, I opened it up and noticed some stray brush hairs so I gently brushed them away and then there were more, I had chunks of brush hair in my hand!  My brand new brush is practically bald and I haven&#x27;t even used it once! It&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t secured in the brush very well.... I am pretty disappointed. All of the reviews were pretty good, the price was great.... I guess I just got a faulty brush.</li>
    <li> works great! make sure to wash after every couple uses! it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use with my bare minerals!</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup brush, very soft, high quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really very soft.</li>
    <li> Does not work that well.</li>
    <li> Extremely s​oft to the touch but sturdy enough to do its job without any issues. I am thrilled that I found this company. I&#x27;ll buy more! Highly recommended brush line!!! ++++++++++</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! It is made very durable. The hairs are so soft and dense it blends my foundation to a flawless finish!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Works wonders for me and makes my foundation look flawless and equally distributed without streakyness. Its very soft and totaly worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I was kind of saddened at first when I saw that it would take a month to receive. But, it took so much less than that, about 2 weeks. My foundation goes on so smoothly on my face with this brush. I have ZERO complaints. Definitely a must have!!</li>
    <li> Very good at blending and putting on foundation evenly! It&#x27;s a very good brush for a brush on the cheaper side</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this brush, I have had it for about a month now. I have tried this brush out with expensive and inexpensive foundation and it works the same. It gives a flawless finish and is super easy to clean! I figured for the cheap price the bristles would be plastic or they would fall out but that it not the case. LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing and worth it for the price. I don&#x27;t really wear make up but I do use this to apply those BB creams and prefer the flat brushes over the more rounded ones. This one has very soft bristles and is very comfortable to hold. also gives even coverage and doesn&#x27;t get all cakey with makeup. The black handle part came loose but I just hot glued it back up in the blue part. other than that no complaints here.</li>
    <li> This brush leaves streaks. Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly at all. My fingers do a better job</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles are uneven and fell out when I washed it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfectly soft and long enough for my power foundation but I&#x27;m sure it would also be perfect for liquid if desired! Prob gonna get another one lol</li>
    <li> Is really soft and gets the job done. Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> A little over priced but great for gifts</li>
    <li> This came in the mail way sooner and I was so exited I used it right away,it&#x27;s so soft and there&#x27;s absolutely NO SHEDDING!!! I love it</li>
    <li> THE BLACK HANDLE BROKE OFF THREE DAYS LATER AFTER RECEIVED IN THE MAIL.  IT WORKS GOOD FOR BLENDING THOUGH.</li>
    <li> it is a really nice dense brush! i would recommend this for everyone. this blends out my foundation flawlessly!! love it</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s so soft and good on the skin. I recommend 100%. It&#x27;s good quality, and it&#x27;s probably a dupe of the Real Techinques flat top brush. Get it. Now.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!!!! It&#x27;s so soft and came super fast! I&#x27;m so happy!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! A little darker blue then the picture shows, which is even better! Soft as a bunny!! I would say that this is the softest brush I own! Defiantly recommend, once I Try this brush out with my foundation I will write another review!</li>
    <li> Great as a back up brush. Perfect for stippling on foundation with a dense head of sturdy yet soft bristles. Shipping took a very long time but worth it to supplement your brush collection.</li>
    <li> Soft brush. It works great and washes up great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for about 2 months to buff in my liquid foundation. I have to say it is AMAZING! it is super soft, it is sturdy, it is an absolute dupe for the Real Techniques brushes, which I also love! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it takes a long time to dry after washing it, like a full 24 hours of hanging upside down. That&#x27;s the only downfall I have found so far. It has minimal shedding, like really maybe a couple hairs but that is expected with any brush. I would definitely purchase this again and others like it!</li>
    <li> IVE SEARCHED LONG FOR A GOOD BRUSH TO USE WITH MY LIQUID FOUNDATION AND AT LAST HAVE FOUND ONE I LIKE VERY MUCH.. DOESNT SHED, AND EVENLY DISTRIBUTES MY FOUNDATION FOR  A FLAWLESS COVER. AWESOME PLUS TO MY MAKE UP KIT</li>
    <li> This brush blends soooo well.  I use it on liquid and powder bronzing.  I would repurchase if needed. Thank You</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this brush. It&#x27;s sturdy and seems like it will last a long time and I&#x27;m glad because it&#x27;s such a great add on to my collection. There are actually many uses for a brush like this. My favorite is to buff all the makeup and make it blend just right. This brush leaves my makeup blended and flawless.</li>
    <li> Just buy the sigma F80&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 4 weeks to arrive and it&#x27;s not very dense at all not is it very good at blending makeup, applying foundation or smoothing already applied makeup. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! I really like it! Shipping was fast, and my brush arrived way before I expected it.</li>
    <li> arrived very fast!!! I never thought a brush sssooo soft could the job done beautifully!!!!</li>
    <li> Not very thick, or soft, doesn&#x27;t apply well</li>
    <li> Love the handle fits in my hand perfectly. The bristles are really soft. And really cheap would def buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this brush despite the bad reviews I&#x27;d read about it I went ahead and bought it cause I needed a new brush and I&#x27;m in love with it arrived a few days earlier than expected so overall great service will definitely buy again once I&#x27;ve worn this one out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this for foundation application. Soft, affordable, and it has yet to come apart (been using for a few months now).</li>
    <li> It is smaller than the picture makes it look, but I fell in love with this brush! It glides on my foundation and for such an incredible price. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush. Makes blending easy</li>
