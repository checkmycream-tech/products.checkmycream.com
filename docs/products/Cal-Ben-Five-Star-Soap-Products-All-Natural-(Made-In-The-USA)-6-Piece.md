      <li>Love it</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I believe you&#x27;ll find, like our family, that you love the product line and will feel good about buying a product that is made here in the good ol&#x27; US of A.ying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best</li>
      <li>Nicely  lathers and scent is mild, smells to me like marzipan.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin and shaving!</li>
      <li>I ordered the sample pack from cal ben many years ago, I don&#x27;t really like the scent it reminds me of my great grandparents closet full of moth balls.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice lather but the almond scent is too sweet and strong.  </li>
      <li>There is a very nice modest smell of almond.</li>
      <li>Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time to make my own soap, but I don&#x27;t need to with Pure Soap.</li>
      <li>I suggested he change the list of ingredients advertised to accurately reflect the ingredients of this soap.  </li>
      <li>Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes.</li>
      <li>Its a great smell it just need to last longer</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel great, with no residue left on your skin.</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasant smell and does not dry my skin or irritate it.  </li>
      <li>Not sure why this soap is so awesome.</li>
      <li>There is no soapy residue, and your skin feels clean.</li>
      <li>and it leaves me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Feels great on skin and does not leave skin dry.</li>
      <li>Washes well and rinses clean without drying your skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s pure and that I&#x27;m not rubbing toxins all over.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a very pure soap, but when I opened the box I was hit with a strong scent.</li>
      <li>I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal.</li>
      <li>Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well.</li>
      <li>The soap is extremely strong with almond &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, which is not from the pure almond oil.  </li>
      <li>Personally, i would think most all will enjoy the clean feeling when you come out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I wish it were in the grocery stores for easy purchase--I would buy it over anything else readily</li>
      <li>She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder.</li>
      <li>Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop.</li>
      <li>Worth the pain of ordering online.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>of the other reviewers have decided to mentioned that the soap offered here is being sold at a good price.</li>
      <li>, it does not wash the worldly stink off my mortal coil), the almond oil fragrance is just the right amount</li>
      <li>good soap but not worth the price</li>
      <li>The only caveat is don&#x27;t buy more than you can use in a year.</li>
      <li>Just soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I have severe sensitivities and generally order a different kind of soap, but I saw a review for this and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the \\&quot;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;® Collection\\&quot; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo.</li>
      <li>Beauty Pure Soap Bar&lt;br /&gt;20%</li>
      <li>I use pure almond oil in my practice and it does not smell like &amp;#34;almonds&amp;#34;, it is a neutral smell.  </li>
      <li>It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling.</li>
      <li>This is so far the best soap of all I&#x27;ve tried, can&#x27;t help but feel clean, it lathers very well, and rinses and is gone as soon as your under the shower head,,,, the bar is small, but hard enough to last for a good while.</li>
      <li>It is much nicer soap than anything in the supermarket.</li>
      <li>soap is so gentle.</li>
      <li>This soap really soothes the skin and does not leave any residue.</li>
      <li>#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34; when it is really coconut oil..</li>
      <li>It cleans very well</li>
      <li>/&gt;We had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could.</li>
      <li>I really like this soap.</li>
      <li>It lathers up really well</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.  </li>
      <li>Plain and simple great bath soap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s septic safe plus lasts longer than other bars.</li>
      <li>You will be left with a clean rubbery feel.</li>
      <li>But that is most likely due to materials and what makes it so special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller (which on Amazon can change abruptly)or Amazon itself.</li>
      <li>This soap is natural and therefore it is good at least in my thinking..</li>
      <li>both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, \\&quot;felt\\&quot; better mentally.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with any allergies/sensitivities.</li>
      <li>Near the end, they weren&#x27;t lathering very well.</li>
      <li>I am quite surprised at how much I like this soap.</li>
      <li>I will buy more to use instead of the soaps with all of the harsh additives.</li>
      <li>, the lather is very creamy not bubbly, the bar fits in the hand very well, and it lasts a lot longer than you would expect given the size (also as it wears it retains its shape so you can use all of it and not throw the last bit away).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best smelling soap ever.  Feels great on skin and does not leave skin dry. Plus its all natural with no chemicals added.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and shaving!</li>
    <li> This is so far the best soap of all I&#x27;ve tried, can&#x27;t help but feel clean, it lathers very well, and rinses and is gone as soon as your under the shower head,,,, the bar is small, but hard enough to last for a good while. Personally, i would think most all will enjoy the clean feeling when you come out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Cal Ben makes every shower 5-star.  It&#x27;s septic safe plus lasts longer than other bars. The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used and it smells like candy.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to almost all fragrance, chemicals, parabens etc so that always sends me in search of alternative soaps and cleansers. I have been very happy with this bar soap. I wash my face with it (having both rosacea and eczema) and it doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle one bit. I also use a bar for hand soap and it leaves your hands feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s pure and that I&#x27;m not rubbing toxins all over. It is small but hard milled so it doesn&#x27;t waste away. But the hype is just that. I don&#x27;t feel any better. I&#x27;m not glowing. I see no difference in acne prone areas. I&#x27;ll buy it again for the above-stated reasons, but the great benefits touted are, for me, hyperbole. I did, however, come back and add another star for its being made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice lather but the almond scent is too sweet and strong.  I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.  It&#x27;s hand washing soap now.</li>
    <li> I have severe sensitivities and generally order a different kind of soap, but I saw a review for this and decided to try it. It&#x27;s supposed to be a very pure soap, but when I opened the box I was hit with a strong scent. I decided to try it anyway but found that I reacted to it in personal areas. It caused a burning sensation. However, this may not be a problem for anyone else. I do have a LOT of sensitivities. But I will be giving the remaining bars of soap to family or friends.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these soaps. This soap really soothes the skin and does not leave any residue. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> This soap smells very nice. It lathers up really well even though our watet is hard.  You will be left with a clean rubbery feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. The only caveat is don&#x27;t buy more than you can use in a year. I bought a box of 100 which lasted a number of years. The soap tends to dry out over time and lose its fragrance. Near the end, they weren&#x27;t lathering very well. I just bought some more and they&#x27;re as good as I remembered.</li>
    <li> Nicely  lathers and scent is mild, smells to me like marzipan. Thought the price was good too. I would order  this again.</li>
    <li> Not as published but I guess ok...maybe a one time buy?</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed.  Info said only pure oils used -- cocoa butter, coconut oil and almond oil.  The soap is extremely strong with almond &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, which is not from the pure almond oil.  I use pure almond oil in my practice and it does not smell like &amp;#34;almonds&amp;#34;, it is a neutral smell.  The one negative review mentioned the same problem -- I must not have read it before I ordered the soap -- definitely would not have purchased it.  She contacted the company who told her that almond essential oil &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; is used.  This is not mentioned in the info.  &amp;#34;Essence&amp;#34; is not the same as true essential oil.  &amp;#34;Essence&amp;#34; is a term concocted by manufacturers to dupe the public into thinking only pure ingredients are used.  Manufacturers are allowed to use terms such as &amp;#34;natural flavors&amp;#34; &amp;#34;essence of . . . &amp;#34;, etc., but these are not non-chemical ingredients.  Just another way consumers are flim-flammed by big business and the government.</li>
    <li> So. Not sure why this soap is so awesome. But it is. I only use it for my body, but it works. And this is a bargain for soaps. My only beef is it seems to melt easier than other soaps. But that is most likely due to materials and what makes it so special. Not a big enough deal to lower my rating nor make me use another soap ever again. I will travel with this. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for probably two decades. I&#x27;m very happy to now have it available through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is so gentle. My husband had some itchy spots on his face that the doctor gave him a prescription for. It did no good and they continued to itch and spread. I had him use the Calben, and within a day the spots began to diminish. They were gone within a week, never to return. He uses the soap exclusively now.</li>
    <li> You will not buy commercial soap ever again once you discover organic soap. There is no soapy residue, and your skin feels clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered the sample pack from cal ben many years ago, I don&#x27;t really like the scent it reminds me of my great grandparents closet full of moth balls.  I wrote to them back then for an ingredient list, I received the same list shown by a previous commenter here and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with their level of disclosure.  They don&#x27;t tell you from which plants various ingredients originate.  I went back and forth with then a few times trying to play guessing games about what the soaps are made of to no avail.  Apparently they keep it a trade secret, which is fine, but I don&#x27;t care to risk lathering up with gmo soy beans and chinese gutter oil so I decided to take my business elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for a product that appears to work well and not leave soapy residues but poor disclosure and customer service.</li>
    <li> Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop. I&#x27;ve never been one to worry about coming into contact with chemicals. Back in the old days a lot of backyard mechanics like myself used to wash greasy parts and our hands in gasoline, diesel, turpentine, kerosene etc. (hey it worked great and was cheap). I know guys who still do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could. One of the things we did was to order a sample pack of Cal Ben&#x27;s more popular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, \\&quot;felt\\&quot; better mentally. It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling. I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal. I didn&#x27;t expect or even want the stuff to be any different from my Dial soap, because ordering bar soap on-line seemed like it would be a hassle. I couldn&#x27;t deny that the soap got my skin as clean as any other soap I&#x27;ve used (if not cleaner) and did it with all natural ingredients. We immediately placed an order for a four year bundled supply of all the Cal Ben 5 Star Soap products. Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line. Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes. She&#x27;s never been able to find a laundry detergent that didn&#x27;t cause her some pain and rash, and could never even think about using a laundry powder. Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well. I tried for three years to get her to try Cal Ben. Last year she finally agreed to let us give her some of the laundry powder, bar soap, shampoo and dish soap. She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder. A week later, she called and wanted to know if we could sell her some of our personal supply. Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right). We ended up placing a big order with Cal Ben and dividing the product between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviewers have decided to mentioned that the soap offered here is being sold at a good price. Amazon prices fluctuate wildly at times so I will leave that matter up to the shopper to decide. I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller (which on Amazon can change abruptly)or Amazon itself. We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the \\&quot;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;® Collection\\&quot; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo. Cleaning products are very heavy, so ordering in bulk really cuts down on shipping costs and makes it convenient to not have to keep a close eye on our supply. This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance. I believe you&#x27;ll find, like our family, that you love the product line and will feel good about buying a product that is made here in the good ol&#x27; US of A.ying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance.

    <li> This is wonderful soap!  It&#x27;s the best formula, all natural and excellent for sensitive skin.  I also use it in my home made laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap and have been using it for more than 20 years. It is much nicer soap than anything in the supermarket. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> My family Loves this soap! It makes your skin feel great, with no residue left on your skin. Just soft and clean. The small bar lasts as long as some bigger bar soaps, so do not let that fool you. A great soap. We switched to this from Dove, as to avoid chemicals on our skin. We want a Natural Soap. And this seems to be the house favorite.</li>
    <li> I am quite surprised at how much I like this soap. I wish it were in the grocery stores for easy purchase--I would buy it over anything else readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big manly man, but I like soap. When I unwrapped the package I thought there was no way this was going to make me happy happy in the shower. The bar is on the small side, like the size your wife might use as a facial soap. The fragance is almondine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My assumptions were wrong. It cleans very well (I hate weak soap, it does not wash the worldly stink off my mortal coil), the almond oil fragrance is just the right amount and I didn&#x27;t get sick of it after one or two bars like soaps that have a too strong or unpleasant fragrance, the lather is very creamy not bubbly, the bar fits in the hand very well, and it lasts a lot longer than you would expect given the size (also as it wears it retains its shape so you can use all of it and not throw the last bit away). I found it treats the skin very nicely, is not stinging and could easily be used with small children in the tub at bathtime seems to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressive. May be cheaper at the company&#x27;s website depending on what sale price they might be running at any given time. Worth the pain of ordering online.</li>
    <li> This soap is NOT made with cocoa butter.  It is made with coconut oil instead, which I am allergic to.  Below is the list of ingredients sent to me by  CalBenPureSoap.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complexion Beauty Pure Soap Bar&lt;br /&gt;20% Cocoa Butter (Extra Virgin Copra Cocoanut Oil) U.S.P. Grade. 80% Vegetable Fat (Highest Grade Tallow Oil) A few drops Pure Almond Essential Oil Extract for essence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having various physical problems including swelling of my face, because I believed in the accuracy of this product&#x27;s description on Amazon.  I have no idea why they would advertise &amp;#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34; when it is really coconut oil..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called CalBenSoap company and the guy I spoke with was not at all apologetic; he acted annoyed with me.  He refused to return my money and said I would have to go through Amazon to get a refund, which I will do.  I told him this was false advertising, to which he had nothing to say.  I suggested he change the list of ingredients advertised to accurately reflect the ingredients of this soap.  Again, he had nothing to say and just wanted to hang up.</li>
    <li> No chemicals, just soap.  Most excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for a recipe to make laundry soap. I will buy more to use instead of the soaps with all of the harsh additives. I don&#x27;t have time to make my own soap, but I don&#x27;t need to with Pure Soap.</li>
    <li> good soap but not worth the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m very sensitive. Couldn&#x27;t use it. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Its a great smell it just need to last longer</li>
    <li> Smells nice and not too strong.  Washes well and rinses clean without drying your skin.  Plain and simple great bath soap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past 5 years. My husband had heard about it and thought we should give it a try since I have so many allergies. I absolutely love this soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and I never feel itchy like I used to from the standard soaps at the store. I can&#x27;t stand the store soaps, they all smell and feel too chemically too me now. I highly recommend this to anyone with any allergies/sensitivities. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Expensive but worth it. Only soap I&#x27;ve found that is truly natural(even without glycerin, which dries out your skin). Use it to wash my hair with also and my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever tried.  If you have sensitive skin like I do, this is the one to buy.  It has a light, pleasant smell and does not dry my skin or irritate it.  Try this soap and you will like it.  Another bonus is that it is made in the USA&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. It lathers up really well and it leaves me feeling clean. There is a very nice modest smell of almond. the delivery was very, very quick and I am happy to have found a product that is good for my skin. The company delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> This soap is natural and therefore it is good at least in my thinking.. I don&#x27;t know what else to say except it works!</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so soft. I had little bumps on my upper arms that went away after using this for a few days. The dishwashing soap is wonderful too!!!</li>
    <li> My hands are no longer cracked and dried&lt;br /&gt;My wife no longer has acne on her back or dried skin&lt;br /&gt;Never going back.  Buy this soap if you want to feel clean w/o dried skin.  Love it</li>
