      <li>Bought it for the wife, so if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>great scent …not fond of madonna brought this as a cheaper alternative to a fave fragrance fracas…not quite like it---but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no fan of Madonna&#x27;s, but the perfume sold under her name &amp;#34;Truth or Dare&amp;#34; is really very nice.</li>

      <li>This fragrance is ok just not for my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>Made me nauseous!&lt;br /&gt;Expected better from Madonna.</li>
      <li>So i decide to buy some more...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update:  I think this scent works better on me in winter.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume..</li>
      <li>I also get many many compliments on it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad she does because I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume.  </li>
      <li>but after so many compliments I LOVE IT.....</li>
      <li>Wasnt too sure if it would go with my body chemisty</li>
      <li>I love  this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>like many fans are - I was prepared to dislike this perfume.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This won&#x27;t become my favorite scent</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and get a lot of compliments when I have it on.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume even though for some reason I am not fan of celebrity perfumes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
      <li>But i still love this perfume because it has my favorite flower in it &amp;#34;Jasmine&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>ok enuf said.</li>
      <li>This parfum is very rare, noble,  and tempting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The vanilla does not stand out as a note of its own (typically true vanilla is more like Tonka-</li>
      <li>So very glad she took her time to put out her first fragrance because she out did herself!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very clean smell.</li>
      <li>I first smelled this in a magazine and it smelled really good.</li>
      <li>Smell is intense, bold and beautiful.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better for men, but ladies will feel its too sickly strong and cheap smelling.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to pinpoint  the familiar smell.</li>
      <li>Firstly the truth, this perfume smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>The bottle is cool and I love Madonna as a performer.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it hasn&#x27;t faded away quickly like some do.  </li>
      <li>my two daughters (20&#x27;s) love my Truth or Dare so much, that they use my stash up!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Madonna fan.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my girlfriend, who&#x27;s a huge Madonna stan, for her birthday</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so cheap.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled the vanilla straight away and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>So, put this on with a light hand.</li>
      <li>Great smell different!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely incredible!  This parfum is very rare, noble,  and tempting.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I bought it here because I had a tough time finding it in the stores.  I love the fragrance and get a lot of compliments when I have it on.  I also love that it actually last all day.  When I get home from work in the afternoon, my husband still notices it.</li>
    <li> I looked forward to receiving this fragrance since I am a Madonna fan dating back to the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;My anticipation turned into gross disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fragrance snob, but I do not like &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;musty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; old lady&amp;#34; ...... This has an overwhelming gardenia or even worse &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; smell to it, like maybe there was a batch left over from the 70&#x27;s and they re bottled it under Madonna&#x27;s name? Okay not to be a total basher, the packaging and bottle were nice.&lt;br /&gt;If this sickly sweet flowery type of fragrance appeals to you, my advice would be to spray it ONCE into the air and walk into it. Anymore than that is way too overwhelming, and you&#x27;ll have small children running from you in the street!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Madonna......can you say &amp;#34; loser &amp;#34;? I can&#x27;t believe Madonna would even wear this stuff....ok enuf said.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this scent on me!</li>
    <li> good smell until dawn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Madonna fan.  I&#x27;ve seen her seven times in concert.  I wear this all the time and I&#x27;m a guy.  It&#x27;s sweet and you smell flowers.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume..everyone comments on it every day...it&#x27;s very soft and pretty</li>
    <li> i have this perfume and it smells delicious! i also bought it for my therapists and she really loves it</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase and have been waiting for years for Madonna to have a perfume line, its fantastic, smells like lilies</li>
    <li> Overpowering!! Smells like something an old lady would wear!! Very disappointed!! Too too much floral! Made me nauseous!&lt;br /&gt;Expected better from Madonna.</li>
    <li> After years with Liz and her lucky earrings I&#x27;ve tosseed them into the game for the last time. Madge&#x27;s new Truth or Dare (by Coty) is floral enough for fems and earthy enough for bears...IMHO. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features for me is the tactile response of the atomizer..so ooohh la la!!! Very stylish bottle but easily tipped over on the counter if bumped. Cap is very nice and fits leak-proof. Very French..very sexy...and very Madonna!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ordering again as my first bottle is nearly gone now after a year&#x27;s use. I&#x27;m a man and wear it daily. I just tell others it is uni-sex. I get many compliments on this fragrance, particularly my very closest and most intimate friends. SO..I say to skeptics.. \\&quot;Truth OR Dare?\\&quot; Strike a pose Vogue!</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend, who&#x27;s a huge Madonna stan, for her birthday and she loves it! Smells great, too! Came when the seller said it would and in pristine condition!!</li>
    <li> Not a Madonna fan&lt;br /&gt;and not a fan of buying very expensive (celebrity) perfume (unless it&#x27;s designer perfume Dior, Versace, etc).... But I just had to have it once I smelled it! I love the bottle and the smell! I couldn&#x27;t resist paying regular price for it and I even got a cute little Madonna bag with it!</li>
    <li> I expected better. This stuff smells so cheap. A few whiffs make you feel like you&#x27;ve been smothered with gardenias. Reminds me of the uber-cheap Gloria Vanderbilt perfume sets from the 80s. An ex gave me a set for Christmas one year (because it was under $20 for the whole set) and it was SO sweet it almost put me into insulin shock. I&#x27;m sorry I thought Madonna would TRY something seductive. This is an epic fail.</li>
    <li> I love  this fragrance.  I  actually spray it on flowers in the rooms... it gives a  smell to your home.  I  don&#x27;t use it as a perfume because  it&#x27;s very strong and I  have asthma... but I  do enjoy the smell in the air.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for mothers day (saying it was from her kids) but when we got it it was a.day late and it has no smell to it, truly disappointing since it&#x27;s her favorite and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at a fair price. You will be a hit with the significant other if you purchase this parum spray. This is our second purchase of this product and my wife loves it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Nice frgrance that stays all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy perfume very often because I have allergies, and they can often bother me.  After reading many reviews about this, and having listened to Madonna&#x27;s music since I was a kid, I was curious how it smelled.  When the price got low on Amazon, I decided to buy a bottle without having sampled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled the vanilla straight away and really liked it.  But that quickly changed to the flowers, then a somewhat fruity smell.  Someone mentioned bitter grapefruit.  I&#x27;m not noticing that, thankfully, but definitely fruity, and not very sweet.  The flowers are potent, the vanilla is faint.  I really like the vanilla and wish it were stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having it on for a couple of hours, it is still noticeable.  I&#x27;m glad it hasn&#x27;t faded away quickly like some do.  I did get a bit of a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the perfume, and will probably wear it from time to time.  It isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet, nor bitter.  It&#x27;s in the middle for me.  If the vanilla note was a bit stronger and lasted longer, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars.  Just one spray lasted throughout the day.  There were times when I was sniffing my wrists and still got the vanilla.  The flower scent hasn&#x27;t disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I think this scent works better on me in winter.  I tried it again in December on a cold day, and it wasn&#x27;t as strong as on the hotter days.  It also dried down to a nice warm, buttery, slightly sweet vanilla scent with the florals still present, somewhat faintly.  I liked it a lot.  I prefer this as a winter scent.</li>
    <li> Usually, tuberose and neroli are two of the worst notes on my skin, so I tried this perfume expecting to hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my skin I get tuberose which is sweetened up by the amber and musk. This is a scent which has to be on the skin for awhile before all the base notes really mix well with the potent tuberose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sillage of this perfume is high and lingering. So, put this on with a light hand. The lasting power of this EDP is amazing. It lasts all day long with only one spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This EDP reminds me very much of Versace&#x27;s Blonde and Guerlain&#x27;s Mahora, yet it&#x27;s just a bit different than both of them with the more creamy, ambery base. It&#x27;s basically a tuberose gourmand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see Madonna&#x27;s Italian roots when I smell this perfume. I can just picture Venice and Tuscany when I smell this. I think Madonna did a good job on this one. I don&#x27;t care who&#x27;s name is on a perfume if you like it wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t become my favorite scent but, I can see myself growing very fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth or Dare fragrance notes: The scent is both a light and dark, opening with notes of gardenia, creamy tuberose and neroli. The heart consists of jasmine, benzoin and white lily, based on vanilla absolute, caramelized amber and sensual musk.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  It arrived quickly, along with another bottle, and though I was slightly concerned when I opened the box as the bubble packaging was only on top of the bottles, they weren&#x27;t broken.  It was an exceptional price and smell just like the sample and the other bottle smells just like the 5 bottles I&#x27;ve bought at Sephora &amp; Khols.  Glad I found this place! I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
    <li> Best woman&#x27;s fragrance available.  My my mother left TOVA for this. It&#x27;s clean and sexy at the same time.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid collector of perfumes and my nose for this one is AWESOME!!! Wasnt too sure if it would go with my body chemisty but after so many compliments I LOVE IT.....</li>
    <li> Smell is intense, bold and beautiful. What would you expect from Madonna. It&#x27;s a very clean smell. Last all day long</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume.  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever wear anything by Madonna but this is so sweet its almost like honey suckle.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on my scent. This is always nice, but when they ask the name I find myself offering a disclaimer. I&#x27;m no fan of Madonna&#x27;s, but the perfume sold under her name &amp;#34;Truth or Dare&amp;#34; is really very nice. Men and women like it. It is a clean, light fragrance. It comes in sets, spray and purse dispenser. It is sometimes hard to purchase from department stores, so I buy it online when available and keep it in the refrigerator to prolong its life.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent!!! I am not a huge Madonna fan (I&#x27;m a bit older than her average fan), but she sure knows how to pick a scent!!! I am constantly being asked by strangers what scent I am wearing!! AND the kicker is.......my two daughters (20&#x27;s) love my Truth or Dare so much, that they use my stash up!! I just ordered 3 bottles so we each have our own!! I also love the flat design of the bottle (very smart because it travels very well)!!</li>
    <li> I got it for some one as a gift and they loved it. I recommend it to any one. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife, so if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is ok just not for my body chemistry. It reminds me of another fragrance but I wasn&#x27;t able to pinpoint  the familiar smell.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume it last all day.i got it fast too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume (and the amazon price can&#x27;t be beat)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first fell in love with this after spraying it on me with a tester at Macy&#x27;s.  I spent the rest of the day/evening wishing I had purchased it.  I was later surprised with it as a gift from my mother.  It became my go to scent.  I am not a big scent wearer, but I find Truth or Dare to be light, elegant, and very feminine.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance without even smelling it at first! I have never done that before, I just went by the reviews on here, so glad I did! When I  received it I opened it up and saw the most stylish bottle ever it&#x27;s a white bottle with a gold crown top so cute. And then I  sprayed it ( one spray goes a long way) so pleasantly surprised the gardenia note on this one is delightful! So very glad she took her time to put out her first fragrance because she out did herself! It&#x27;s the smell of class and sophistication that most of us would expect from her and most of all my husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> Great perfume worth the money I get compliments all the time when I wear it plus its cheaper on here than in stores :-)</li>
    <li> Another flop in the celeb perfume arena. The bottle is cool and I love Madonna as a performer. The smell is strong and cheap. I hate it because it&#x27;s way too flowery and overpriced. I wish it was subtle and sexy. I expected more. Smell this one before buying it. Maybe it&#x27;s better for men, but ladies will feel its too sickly strong and cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> Her and Lady Gaga did have their bad times! I dont like Madonna as a person but love her products and Music! This perfume is a great way to show off your Madonna pride, if you are a Madonna fan! I have gotten a few, NOT A LOT of comment saying &amp;#34;you smell like a maid&amp;#34; because of the flora scents in the perfume which resemble cleaning chemicals! But i still love this perfume because it has my favorite flower in it &amp;#34;Jasmine&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this perfume even though for some reason I am not fan of celebrity perfumes. Without overpowering you smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> great scent …not fond of madonna brought this as a cheaper alternative to a fave fragrance fracas…not quite like it---but very nice--similar base---will buy again!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this in a magazine and it smelled really good. So therefore I order it from Amazon. However when I received it, it smelled like cedar wood. Now if you like the smell of cedar wood as a perfume, then purchase it, but it not then don&#x27;t waste your money. I gave it to my aunt who seems to really like it and I&#x27;m glad she does because I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great Delivery!</li>
    <li> people used to stop me saying that the smell was soooo good. the previous ones i used were bought in Europe. So i decide to buy some more... the perfume vanish in no time. The delivery was excellent.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of Truth or Dare for a gift and love it, so bought this bottle for a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great smell different!</li>
    <li> Madonna totally surprised me with this fragrance. It is one of my favorites. It is a play off of Fracas with caramel and vanilla notes  It doesn&#x27;t have the woodiness of Fracas. I wear it instead of Fracas when I want to smells more sweet and romantic.  It is a very feminine and flirty scent. It does have a slight sophistication to it, so it is not too girly.  I get a ton of compliments when I wear it in the Spring while eating in outdoor cafes.</li>
    <li> to me this was very strong perfume, It will remind you of your grandmother, not for me. The scent also lasts very long and have me a headache.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and so does anyone who notices it..and I&#x27;m a guy!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Good deal for women too.</li>
    <li> Just as described A++</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first too, I mean, perfume... by Madonna? BUT IT SMELLS FANTASTIC! It has a very light fragrance that is floral but doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;manufactured&amp;#34;. I also get many many compliments on it often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the mall and get a small sample, then come back to Amazon for a great price!</li>
    <li> I had no idea that Madonna had even created her own perfume. I was in a store and I saw a display and I decided to squirt a large amount onto my arm because I figured, hey, it is Madonna, what can go wrong. Well, it smelled like a Grandma, I was very shocked. It has a beautiful bottle, but the contents are just not good. I was expecting something a little lighter and less cheap, if you will. I mean for the price I am not expecting No. 5 or anything, but this was just, gross. I had my GAY best friend with me and we both hated it. SO it goes to prove that just because someone is gay will not mean they automatically love it. If you ever walk past a really old woman and notice her perfume, well this is exactly what this smells like.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and great price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. You only need one spray and it lasts all day. It could be a little less sweet smelling but overall I like it and I&#x27;m happy with it. Plus, Madonna rocks!</li>
    <li> Though I think that I&#x27;m fairly neutral on this scent (I got it for dirt cheap and won&#x27;t be wearing it often, but I won&#x27;t be donating it to the local thrift store either...), I really think that this one is either \\&quot;love it\\&quot; or \\&quot;hate it.\\&quot; Truth or Dare is a very mature scent, but there&#x27;s something nostalgic and emotionally evoking about it. It&#x27;s not quite \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or moth balls, but I can definitely see how younger buyers will not exactly be enticed or excited about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla does not stand out as a note of its own (typically true vanilla is more like Tonka- it&#x27;s earthy and does not add overt sweetness to a blend), but FOR some reason, contributes to Truth or Dare&#x27;s overtly sweet quality. Let&#x27;s talk about the sweetness: this perfume is not only sweet, but cloyingly (CLOYINGLY) sweet. It&#x27;s like candy and is almost foodie in its quality. Gardenia on its own tends to lend to the sugary side smell wise, so the combination is sugary city. This is a good thing or a bad thing depending on your scent preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this scent to be okay (it smells okay enough...for me, casually), but I would not recommend it AT ALL if you do not care for gardenia. Gardenia and sweetness&#x3D; this scent in a nutshell. It&#x27;s fairly simple and straightforward. Those expecting this perfume to evolve on the skin will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Truth or Dare&#x27;s audience will be 30+ (and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, I&#x27;m pretty sure that Madonna had a certain age demographic in mind when she concocted this...and it was not meant for teens and tweens). By all means, teens can wear this if they wish, but I just don&#x27;t see them liking it as it lacks the fruity, tart, light, fun feel that many \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; scents offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s just okay. I can see gardenia lovers loving this; I can also see the floral hater HATING this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best advice is to get a sample before you buy a bottle. Though, I must say the bottle is very attractive!!! It&#x27;s fitting for a Madonna scent, as it has a church quality to it; very ornamental and beautiful for display.itting for a Madonna scent, as it has a church quality to it; very ornamental and beautiful for display.</li>
    <li> Based on feedback from my daughter, its great.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume !!!</li>
    <li> Firstly the truth, this perfume smells AMAZING. I feel sinful just smelling it. Imagine tuberose ice cream and you&#x27;ve got \\&quot;Truth or Dare\\&quot;. Luscious blend of tuberose, jasmine, and caramel. This doesn&#x27;t smell like anything else out there right now. Secondly, I will disclaim I am a huge Madonna nut BUT I am not enslaved to her like many fans are - I was prepared to dislike this perfume. I don&#x27;t dislike it. I LOVE IT...and I have already blown thru two bottles of this masterpiece. Every time I wear it, I get compliments from friends and strangers alike. I dare you not to like this! Brava Ciccone!</li>
