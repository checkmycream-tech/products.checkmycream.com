<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this product,excellent product, this product is excellent  for the skin;works perfectly for the wrinkle........</li>
    <li> I really like the discount I caught it&#x27;s a big bottle I&#x27;m halfway through with it I&#x27;m really enjoying it I can tell the effects of it after its done I will buy another and it&#x27;s nice that got it for such good discount</li>
    <li> Product for review: This is a great product. I like the way it feels on my face during and after. This product helps with wrinkles and dark spots on your face. Do not expect this product to work in one week. With any product, continued and consistent use will help with results :) I would highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT ABSORBS INTO SKIN QUICKLY SO I CAN WEAR IT UNDER MY MAKEUP AND MOISTURIZER.  MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE DIMINISHING.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fdd181a693c40b0e2412f54c1fd6516e]]I dont love it and I dont hate it..I can, however say I LIKE it. I&#x27;m more in the middle, on the fence.  First off, My product was different that what is pictured here. My bottle has the dropper only and not the cap and it wont stay tightened. Second it&#x27;s more of a liquid than that what I would consider a serum. It is a cloudy liquid that has a mild scent- nothing bad, just thought it would have ore of a citrus scent being Vitamin C. It goes on light and absorbs quickly with no pasty or sticky feel so that was a huge plus for me. I did notice after less than a weeks time it did &#x27;soften&#x27; my fine lines but nothing dramatic. Overall it &#x27;helped&#x27;. And any help is good! Glad I was able to test it out for myself. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #LL</li>
    <li> The packaging and label are different from what I got: I got a dark brown bottle with an orange label.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this product since it said &amp;#34;Brightens skin for a natural glow&amp;#34;. And as a full-time college student I don&#x27;t get as much beauty sleep as much as I should be getting and I can tell my skin is getting a bit dull and more prone to break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I apply after I wash my face. I did say I could apply moisturizer after, making it penetrate deeper than without the serum.  And my face does seem a bit more supple. I can&#x27;t tell if my skin is brighter since it is my second day, but I account for the hydration claim!&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a bit watery so i applied with a cotton ball, it has a very similar scent to a Mexican drink called Horchata (cold drink made from ground tiger nuts, water and sugar) and I really liked that!&lt;br /&gt;*I got this product at a very low price in order to honestly review it.*</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It makes my face feel really soft and hydrated. I like the packaging too, it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
    <li> This serum comes in 1oz small glass bottel with dropper, This is the best serum, i liked it, it makes my skin so smooth and supple! It has organic ingrediants which makes this serum awesome, it observe in the skin quickly, it does reduce sun spots, it also helps in removing tan making skin brighter. my skin is super dry and also i have uneven skin tone but the serum made my skin even, now my skin look perfect, bright and radiant!!  In a week i started finding diffrence, but for better result use twice a day!  *** i got this product at discount price to review, but the opinion is my own, nothing to do with the promotion***</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product and the thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s very easy to apply, not messy, and in a few seconds I get to apply on my make up! I love it because it moisturizes my skin naturally. I hope that in time my skin will be firmer and lighten up. The best thing is that I was able to get this product for free, all I have to do is send a review!</li>
    <li> I was very leery of this at first glance because I have such sensitive skin but after about a week of use, I have noticed subtle changes like, I don&#x27;t look as tired and beaten half to death after a long week of school and work. So that&#x27;s a plus. I had no reactions to this although I will say, put this on BEFORE you put any kind of moisturizer on your face so that your skin has the chance to soak up the vitamin C before the moisturizer. I give it an A+ and I&#x27;m very glad I had the opportunity to sample it.</li>
    <li> It is a bit interesting.  I guess I was expecting something a little more greasy in nature and was not ready for the milky substance.  It might be one of them things I would have to use for an extended period to get a full on opinion and this discounted sample for a review just isn&#x27;t enough time.  I will come back later and update further.  That being said it has a ok smell and non greasy feel.  I would combine with my natural lotion.  I have used other products that gave me more immediate feeling off youthful skin but its possible overtime this product is far more superior.  For the discounted price this was a no brainer to try so if you get a chance to pick this up at a low price I would recommend a try.</li>
    <li> This is a really good serum, it makes my skin feel really soft and refreshed. I also use this product to remove my makeup and it does a really good job.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum, it seems my skin is looking better, and fine lines are less noticeable. Will buy again. Soaks right into the skin. Would like to see a larger size made.</li>
    <li> Rigjt when you apply this serum you see the big difference. Yoi skin feels more plump, soft and glowy. Its very lightweight, great consistency. You can use it day or night, under your make up to avoid dry patches. Contains many ingredients i look for in a product and is not tested on animals. Really like this brand and will continue to purchase from them. This is my honest opinion for receiving this product.</li>
    <li> Love my product!!! Received a promo code for a review!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! My face looks so good and feels amazing! The product is odorless which I love! Definitely will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Being sceptical but curious I ordered this product not expecting much. Surprise, surprise, it really delivers what it promises! After about half an hour after the first use the skin around my eyes as well as the rest of my facial skin had tightened, the pores where refined and the skin looked very smooth. I used it again the next day and discovered that the annoying shine on my skin was gone, replaced by a wonderful silky feel and satin glow. The skin feels wonderful smooth to the touch. The liquid is quite watery which means to me that no unnecessary consistency builders, that could clog pores and cause blackheads, have been added.  My skin being very sensitive to commercial skin products, usually breaking out in a rash, loves this product and literally absorbs it as soon as I apply it. This is a very good buy. I would pay twice to price to get this great skin care product!</li>
    <li> Compare to the OZ natural vitamin C serum this is more like a watery drop but good absorbance</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly. After just one use, I had noticed smoother more even looking skin.  I have dry, blotchy patches on my cheeks that I have struggled with for years.  Now, after a few days, those areas are hydrated and smooth.  My skin is much firmer too!  Very noticeable around my eyes.  I was surprised the product is virtually sent free.  There are no harsh fumes.  It is very calming on the skin and gentle around my eyes.  The labeling is a little hard to read, as it is white print, yellow background. It is not greasy at all, and dries very quickly.Makeup goes on flawless!  It is a very thin liquid, which makes applying a little tricky.  I think this is a great serum that produces immediate results!</li>
    <li> USE IT FOR 2 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I USE COUPON TO BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;MY HONEST REVIEW  IS I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY MOM.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 days since I received on the back of my hands as they look like they are wrinkly.  I so far havent seen a difference in 3 days but I will continue to use it. I bought it at a promo discount price.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, I thought it was a little sticky..but maybe that is the nature of the product? I did not like it on my face, but it was good on my hands and my elbows. it smells nice and feels like a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced rate to test and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> received this product for a helpful honestnreview , I have purchased many brands of vitamin c serum and this is by far right up there with some of the best brands, after using it my skin felt extremely soft, now my son is using it and I can diffently see results</li>
    <li> I find that this is very good Vitamin C Serum for my face, it has many many uses.</li>
    <li> I got this serum thinking it was strictly Vitamin C serum, with the intention to add to my homemade face creams, and lotions. However, this is a &amp;#34;Anti-Aging Serum&amp;#34; and the bottle I received looks different than the one pictured and contains many other ingredients, with Vitamin C as one of the ingredients.  Unfortunately, it is not what I expected. I did try it on my face alone, as the directions indicate, but my face broke out later that evening. I&#x27;m very particular about the products that I use (I make my own moisturizers, creams, etc.) and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs in over a year since I started a holistic skin regimen. I did use it on my neck and upper chest, and my skin is very smooth and soft to the touch, without any of the break outs I experienced on my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product can generate almost 400 positive reviews between August 17 and August 23, 2015.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and appearance. Labeling on bottle is a bit hard to read. Product has no odor but was drying to my sensitive skin but would probably work great for oily or normal skin. It did not break me out though. I provided this review in return for a free product.</li>
    <li> As I reach my mid 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help me fight the aging process.  I was able to get Art Naturals  Anti- Aging Serum for a free trial in return for an honest opinion.  I one negative I found is that the directions are in a small font, making it difficult to read.  Other than that I found the product great.  I simply wash my face with my normal face wash, dry and apply the serum using the dropper.  Then, I apply my moisturizer as normal.  I LOVE it.  I can already see where it is working on my fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> I never tried before any of the wonderful products of ArtNaturals and I&#x27;m very glad I Received this Excellent product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion because I really love the natural ingredients used as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Aloe, Vitamin A and others that makes this serum an amazing product to give me a complete facial treatment and a marked difference in the condition of my skin, reduced signs of aging, dark circles and keep my skin hydrated. This product is very nice. Only takes a couple small drops to leaves my skin feeling clean, bright and smooth providing a good base on which to moisturize. I have been using this serum twice a day, in the mornings and nights and also before makeup. I Love how my skin feels (not oily) very hydrated. BTW! Comes very well packed showing the expiration day. I highly recommend this great serum. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several artnaturals products and have found that I have liked everyone of them.  This vitamin c serum  absorbs quickly into your skin, is non greasy and makes my face feel great!  It has helped with my eye puffiness and dark cirles, dry patches on my face and the dark spots. I use this at night before I go to bed and I have noticed the brightening of my face in the morning. I purhased this product at a reduced price to review and give an honest opinion.  I would purchase this serum again and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>

This protect your skin against environmental stressors.

    <li> What a wonderful addition to my skin care regimen!  I purchased the Enhanced Vitamin C Serum for a reduced price in order to review.  Truth be told, the word &amp;#34;Serum&amp;#34; always worries me because it makes me think of thick products that will feel heavy on the skin.  Wow was I surprised!  This product is incredibly light, smells lovely, and it light and smooth on the skin.  I also believe it will last a long time because one small drop covers a lot of skin.  I had never thought of getting a product that would enhance my skin&#x27;s ability to take in my moisturizer but I&#x27;m glad I found this.  Execellent!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is excellent, I can feel it starting to work the minute it goes on my skin.  My face looks very smooth and bright.  I recommend this to anyone, male or female that wants a glowing look, and a product that you know is getting to the underlayers of your skin.  Review for amztrader.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels softer and firmer</li>
    <li> I ve always heard vitamin C is good for dark spots pigmentation, but I never did try it. When I seen this I thought I had to give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dark spots pigmentation. I get them from acne leaving it mark and my skin just naturally easily gets pigmentated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has works wonders so far. I havent used it for long, but I can see an increase of smooth complexion thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ve tried everything under the sun, and I am really hoping this will have lasting effects. I know vitamen c is a natural lightner, so I know it has an effective ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really fast, came in 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good size amount, nothing to make you feel like your paying for a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my finger crossed, hoping I ll have clearer skin in a year!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Comes packaged nicely and will make a great gift for my mother. Will update review when she uses it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Makes my face smooth and vibrant. Does not leave face oily nor does it feel like it&#x27;s clogging your pours. I received a discount for my review.</li>
    <li> I could feel a different, after the 1st time i used it, My skin is so soft, bright and smooth!</li>
    <li> what made this best serum for my skin is the smoothness and made my skin lighter, it takes time for my skin to heals from scars. but Art naturals serum made it finer and smoother. Without greasy feeling and wont clog my pores, i am using it too as my under make up and never got into any look cake face of my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am applying Art naturals serum twice a day, as my daily routine. after cleaning face on warm water and facial wash cleanser, toner then art natural serum then my make up. for my long day at work i don&#x27;t feel greasy, my old me usually wash my face during lunch break and re apply make up because of my greasy feeling. For night application, i am using art natural best Eye Wrinkle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Art naturals serum on a discount price in exchange of my reviews.</li>
    <li> 1st of all let me tell you I love the fact that this is made in the USA and Cruelty free, both big pluses for me. I love that it is all natural products that meets the highest standard of quality, I do not like putting things on my face that are not. I love how the formulation is blended to reduce signs of aging, eliminate sun spots and damage, restore youthful glow, and minimizing existing wrinkles while preventing new wrinkle formation. Heck what woman would not want help in all those departments. I love how it leaves my skin plump, hydrated and younger-looking without feeling heavy or greasy! I definitely felt it delivered an all day moisture, evened out my skin tone and shows off my skins natural beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review</li>
