      <li>BUT as i said if u put more than needed ... so dont</li>
      <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care for the smell, and I&#x27;ve used better products for thickening.</li>
      <li>but I have also paid a lot more for products that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Thicket as it is much better for adding fullness.</li>
      <li>In love with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found this product.</li>
      <li>I have used better</li>
      <li>It makes your hair softer, and fuller, and combats winter static.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and highly recommend it to others in need of a thickening boost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best if you blow your hair dry, it doesn&#x27;t have to be immediately after application</li>
      <li>; what it does is  make it very very full.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on my hair and this product is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>so I ordered from amazon and got it very quickly.</li>
      <li>but I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I got free samples of \\&quot;Living Proof Full Thickening Cream\\&quot; from Sephora, much much better than this.</li>
      <li>I have fine</li>
      <li>For fine thinning hair, this product does make the hair look thicker and fuller.  </li>
      <li>I have a ton of hair, but because it&#x27;s so fine</li>
      <li>the first time I tried this product my hair has been left thickened and magnificent.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so fine that even with LOTS of hairspray they end up in my face before the day is over.</li>
      <li>Gives my hair volume, shine, help with frizz, smells great, my hair is super soft and bouncy</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t damage it, but the cream makes a huge difference anyway.</li>
      <li>product, fantastic price and eligible for free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I ALSO LOVE THIS ,ONCE YOU LEARN THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO USE FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
      <li>Really works well! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products for it, from cheap drugstore creams to $25+ professional ones, and  this one is the best so far.</li>
      <li>looks like I actually have a good head of hair.</li>
      <li>Seriously full.  </li>
      <li>It gives me a bouncy full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Its not bad</li>
      <li>Has a fragrance that I can&#x27;t place; not bad;</li>
      <li>It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue, and makes my hair feel full and smooth (no more static!)</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing, definitely am going to order another one.</li>
      <li>If you check out this independent lab&#x27;s evaluation, you&#x27;ll find this product has seriously hazardous chemicals:  </li>
      <li>think it was well worth it--and I&#x27;ve tried a</li>
      <li>I did that the first time and my hair ended up being super sticky</li>
      <li>I really like that my hair still feels clean, not coated.</li>
      <li>Many many products just weigh my hair down, make it look sticky.</li>
      <li>For those of us cursed with thin, fine hair this is the best answer I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>A few months back I started using their shampoo/conditioner and mousse (with great effect!)</li>
      <li>Fairly good; maybe a little too greasy for my hair</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>But this is the first product that I don&#x27;t want to put my hair in a bun with.</li>
      <li>but after using this product gives the impression I have so much hair!</li>
      <li>things first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, not for thickening, but just as an extra styling ingrediant to hold hair without thinning it or making it feel stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is medium fine, it used to be super flat</li>
      <li>Aside from using the hair dryer immediately when applying, I do find it works better in very warm climates than in cold climates, but it does help.</li>
      <li>Most thickeners feel dry and sticky, not this.</li>
      <li>This cream makes my hair full, fluffy and gives the appearance I have tons more than I really do.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is blonde fine and thin. Getting thinner, not happy about that. But this is the first product that I don&#x27;t want to put my hair in a bun with. I can actually leave it down and feel like I have hair on my head. The only complaint I have, which is minor, is I have to use quite a bit more then recommended to make the volume happen. Like a quarter sized amount. But hey I&#x27;m not complaining, I feel like I have hair!!! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Marc Anthony products before.  this Canadian hairdresser has been featured on television and his thickening products are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I tried this product my hair has been left thickened and magnificent.  I&#x27;m not terribly keen on the fragrance, but if you read my other reviews I&#x27;m not a big fan of any fragrance.  I&#x27;d like all products to smell like vanilla like my daily essential oil.  But the fragrance from this product is not offensive to me.  It&#x27;s best if you blow your hair dry, it doesn&#x27;t have to be immediately after application but the heat does help activate the product.&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t use the product I notice thinner hair.  And let me tell you as you get older (I&#x27;m pushing the second half century here folks!) thick hair makes you feel younger and full of hope.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, fantastic price and eligible for free shipping.  I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It tends to work really well; as the instructions state, it reacts well with heat.  Aside from using the hair dryer immediately when applying, I do find it works better in very warm climates than in cold climates, but it does help.</li>
    <li> Used for awhile, couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going to happen and when</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair glide.  You never have to worry about sticky, icky hair and hair that feels weighted down.  Marc Anthony products are consistently good and this one is no exception.  You will be delighted at how your hair glides!</li>
    <li> I run this through my wet hair before I blow dry, it actually does thicken my hair. I have very fine hair, and this&lt;br /&gt;gives it the fullness I am looking for after its blow dried.  This is the 4th or 5th time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I recommend it&lt;br /&gt;to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  I can wash my hair either at night or during the day and it still comes out thick.  I follow the directions and apply it at the roots.  Then I blow dry.  At night, I blow dry slightly then go to bed.  My hair is noticably thick.  This product has become a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, fine, and limp. I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products for it, from cheap drugstore creams to $25+ professional ones, and  this one is the best so far. It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue, and makes my hair feel full and smooth (no more static!) for days. One tube has lasted me for months so I&#x27;m definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this product (in bulk) and it works fabulously. For those of us cursed with thin, fine hair this is the best answer I&#x27;ve found so far. And not only do I use it but my husband does too, so we need a good stock. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry, thin, static hair, this is the stuff for you!  This is the best thickener I ever bought. Most thickeners feel dry and sticky, not this. It makes your hair softer, and fuller, and combats winter static.</li>
    <li> For fine thinning hair, this product does make the hair look thicker and fuller.  I tried it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this product. My hair is a bit thin, really straight and long so it has the tendency to lack volume. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance with this product! I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on my hair and this product is so easy to use. After washing my hair, I dry it a bit until it&#x27;s damp, use my fingers to apply some of the cream to roots, blow dry just a bit, then put huge velcro rollers on for 10 mins while I study/eat. Later I just pull out the rollers and, ahh, volume! I love the cream. I&#x27;ve used it without the rollers as well and it also does a good job thickening and adding texture to my hair. Anddd...it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all or make it greasy! The mousse doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly. I usually buy the product from duane reade.</li>
    <li> I have fine soft hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for long and has no volume.  This product makes my hair so much more manageable, helps hold my curls and adds great volume.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I finally found something for my fine baby thin hair. It gives my hair volume without weighing it down. Plus it leaves your hair soft. This thing is amazing, definitely am going to order another one.</li>
    <li> I have fine and slightly thinning hair.  I love this product.  It gives me a bouncy full head of hair.  I have used this for a long time without any problems.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helps my thinning hair! I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> have used this for years - hard to find especially this year - the ONLY product that works for my fine aging hair!&lt;br /&gt;Please do not discontinue</li>
    <li> Works well on my short hair.  I have to be very careful not to use too much, and that seems to be a very fine line.  Too much and it really weighs my hair down.</li>
    <li> This product really does thicken the hair. I use a quarter sized dollop on my wet hair before blow drying &amp; it gives me thicker, fuller hair whether I use a flat iron or wear my hair curly. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely effective for thin hair such as mine. I put small amount on towel dried hair and it works its majic.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, a fair amount of it though. I&#x27;ve tried every, and I mean every &amp;#34;lightweight, voluminizing conditioner for even the finest hair&amp;#34; on the market and NONE of them worked. Marc Anthony is not a conditioner but it works fairly well adding volume to my hair. Of course, first time the humidity gets high or my head sweats, my hair goes back to flat. I probably will purchase another container.</li>
    <li> This thickening cream is amazing! A lot of products I use tend to weigh my hair down, make it less touchable, and don&#x27;t give me the movement that I want. This product leaves your my completely natural looking and shiny! I love it! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best product I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s ok.  It didn&#x27;t cost too much so that&#x27;s a good thing.  I have used better but I have also paid a lot more for products that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Marc Anthony Instantly Thick Hair Thickening Cream has added body, shine, and thickening to my rather thin, limp hair. The effect lasts most of the day for me, even if conditions such as high humidity (which usually contributes to my limp-hair condition) set in. My one concern was that the thickening cream might strip out my hair coloring, I&#x27;m a redhead, and red hair color normally fades very quickly. But the thickening cream has not shortened hair color hold in any way that I can see. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and highly recommend it to others in need of a thickening boost. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have tried many thickening creams before this one but THIS is the best I have ever tried, I gave one to my sister who loves it and I am ordering two more for other sisters.......thanks so much for making this possible</li>
    <li> Fairly good; maybe a little too greasy for my hair but I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> works very well leaves a bit of a tacky feeling to your hair but it does work well for volume.</li>
    <li> In love with this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Greasy and heavy.  You really need mousses or something to give your hair some life.  Blow dring a must with this product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Made my greasy, no matter how little I used.  This product really had no other effect.</li>
    <li> This is the best after shampoo rinse really soaks in they work well together.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell, and I&#x27;ve used better products for thickening.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast! That&#x27;s about the only thing I like with this purchase.    It did give my hair \\&quot;some\\&quot; volume but only lasted about an hour. I&#x27;m not very impressed! It doesn&#x27;t do bad things to my hair either. Hair feels thicker but doesn&#x27;t look fuller, if that makes sense!! I got free samples of \\&quot;Living Proof Full Thickening Cream\\&quot; from Sephora, much much better than this. I would recommend using Living Proof but not Marc Anthony.    FYI, I have thin straight Asian hair</li>
    <li> Its not bad but if u go over using it will wiegh ur hair down and makes it sticky and untouchable it suck BUT as i said if u put more than needed ... so dont but much .. and dont use it on dry hair it will makes ur hair sticky and uncombable ever ...  its good if u just put a pea size of it and on wet hair i used it on a very rainy day and what i have noticed that it works as anti-humidity cream i wasnt expected that i was thinking that oooh my hair on a rainy day will go curly like crazy but i was shocked it didnt because of this cream so thanks THICK for this job :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. My hair is not thin, however, it is thinning out in the front with each passing year. I only use a small amount, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, and yet it definitely makes my thinning hair look fuller. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants their hair to look a bit fuller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this one for some reason the consistency is different then all the others I have used. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to master the art of blow drying you&#x27;re going to need this! Gives my hair volume, shine, help with frizz, smells great, my hair is super soft and bouncy I just love it!!! Be careful not to use very much, instructions say to apply from roots to ends I did that the first time and my hair ended up being super sticky I almost returned it back but I gave it another try and  this time I just applied it to my ends and some in the middle. I have to say I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t return this! My hair is medium fine, it used to be super flat but after using this product gives the impression I have so much hair! I love it love it love it! 100% recommend it</li>
    <li> Works great and is not greasy. I even dilute it a bit with another hair creme to make it sink in better. Works well with hair dryers also.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I have fine, stick straight hair, that is thinner than I would like. ( genetic). This doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on your hands or in your hair. I wash my hair, towel dry, and spread some of this into my palms before running them thru my hair. I blow dry it with either a round or paddle brush and my short, fine hair looks like I actually have a good head of hair. I really like that my hair still feels clean, not coated. Many many products just weigh my hair down, make it look sticky.</li>
    <li> After so many years of searching I finally found the one product that makes a real difference on thin hair that I can actually afford!</li>
    <li> Noticed only minor effects on my hair. Gives it a bit more volume but not as much as a good quality volumizing conditioner. Does not thicken very much, 10% thicker at best. OK products leaves hair looking a bit dull.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have baby fine hair and this product gives me very manageable body without weighing down which a lot of volume products do. I only need about a nickel size amount to make a difference in volume. The creamy consistency also helps smooth my hair and tame flyaways. I was only able to find it at one local rite aid but they no longer carry it so I ordered from amazon and got it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 or 7 years now and I love it!  I have very long, fine, blonde hair that is poker straight. I have a ton of hair, but because it&#x27;s so fine it&#x27;s usually very flat. This product is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve found so far that gives me volume without weighing my hair down or making it sticky. I towel dry my hair and apply a small amount of the cream all over. I never blow dry my hair so I don&#x27;t damage it, but the cream makes a huge difference anyway. I will continue to buy this product until I can&#x27;t find it anymore! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a volume boost!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the hair cream as it does not seem to be the same cream as was in the tube I bought at Wal Mart.  The texture and color were different and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I doubt if I order it over the internet again and will try to call the company to see what they have to say about it.</li>
    <li> I ALSO LOVE THIS ,ONCE YOU LEARN THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO USE FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Found it in a drugstore a while back and just had to reorder!  Really works well! :)</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine, layered hair.  I watched the video on their website how to use the product and did as they instructed and it gave me more volume.  I use volumizing shampoo and conditioner.  I apply this when hair has air dryed for 15 minutes.  A pearl or lima bean size amount is sufficient, massaged through hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not tell my husband I bought a new product and he walked in the room and said &amp;#34; Wow, you hair is really full.&amp;#34;  So, it is quite evident the additional fullness you can achieve activating the creme with a hair dryer.  Although I use volumizing products, this makes it appear thicker and fuller than the shampoo and conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years. It is a great product. Not heavy or sticky I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately for me, I must research everything I buy. I initially had high hopes for this product but alas, it seems that snake oil is alive and well in this day and age. If you check out this independent lab&#x27;s evaluation, you&#x27;ll find this product has seriously hazardous chemicals:  [...]    Please read for yourself and make  up your own mind.    Shame on Marc Anthony products for pushing this.    Good Luck, All.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product but am disappointed.  It&#x27;s mediocre at best. Smells decent and when applied to wet hair it makes combing easier. But building thickness...didn&#x27;t do it for my baby-fine short hair.  I&#x27;ll stick with Thicket as it is much better for adding fullness. I will keep searching tho for the best possible product for my hair.</li>
    <li> If your hair need a plump up this stuff works&lt;br /&gt;I think it was well worth it--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot&lt;br /&gt;of things first</li>
    <li> Maybe it works well, but I used a Living Proof sample before this. I wish I would have just bought Living Proof. It thickened but felt sorta weird.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and keep bangs. My hair is so fine that even with LOTS of hairspray they end up in my face before the day is over. A few months back I started using their shampoo/conditioner and mousse (with great effect!) but my bangs were still unmanagable so I tried this, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the majority of my hair but it makes a world of difference for my bangs, I run a generous amount of this stuff through them and then use hairspray to form them where I want. I run a brush through before I leave in the morning to soften the hairspray and with this stuff they keep enough body to stay where I want them. I wish it was more all purpose for my hair but it&#x27;s managed to address a major pet peeve of mine (bangs in my eyes!) so I&#x27;m still pretty happy</li>
    <li> Adds volume, but makes my hair look greasy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this at Amazon but will do so when my current tube runs out.  This is a product that is amazing.  I occasionally have a problem with hair falling out.  It comes back, but for a while there are thin spots and that bugs me.  So I tried this and it makes the hair so full of volume that I was impressed.  It&#x27;s an odd product, though.  Has a fragrance that I can&#x27;t place; not bad; just odd.  Also, you have to use it with heat and when you do that, it&#x27;s like poofs of product come off your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem; it&#x27;s just another odd thing.  But it doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my hair; what it does is  make it very very full.  Seriously full.  My hair is fairly short - not super short - but in long layers - so I don&#x27;t know how it works on long hair but I would suspect it would make that fuller, too.  So this is my go-to product when the hair falls out and before it grows back in.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, not for thickening, but just as an extra styling ingrediant to hold hair without thinning it or making it feel stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gives you a lot of floppy volume and hold, without feeling like wax/putty, which will thin your hair or a spray, which feels very unnatural.  I mix this 50/50 with a anti-curl creme, let it dry and I&#x27;ve got a great crazy artist look.  I dont know about the hair thickening properties, but if you want a great styling ingredient, its pretty great!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, thin and short.  This cream makes my hair full, fluffy and gives the appearance I have tons more than I really do.  I highly recommend it and just wish I could find it in drugstores like I used to.</li>
