      <li>This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter who loves this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little trashy but in a fun flirty girly way.</li>

<li> I thought this product would be a fake since it was priced so low.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ordered several and have never been disappointed and never pay over 10 bucks!</li>
