    <li> It came super fast. Perfect size not to big not to small. Worth it will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> My bag is falling apart the the straps are coming off... I expected better and kind of regret this purchase</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for in this case, it&#x27;s a little cheap. No where close to leather, but I&#x27;m carrying it. Nice size, but the edges are wearing already, I&#x27;ve only had it for two months.</li>
    <li> Very Thin Purse But Can Cary A Good Amount Of Stuff With All The Pockets! Shiny Finish. Good Delivery Time And Service!</li>
    <li> The bag gave me problems with the zippers and already seperation by the handle</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I placed my order for this purse. But when I got the purse in the mail and started putting it together so I could use it, I realized that the metal hook on the shoulder strap was broken it made me sad because this was one of the main reasons why I bought this purse. Not only that but in less than a month the zipper to open the purse broke completly off the purse where I could no longer use the purse. I was really dissapointed. I tried contacting the seller but never got a response back.</li>
    <li> HATE IT!!! Its way too thin and the inside fabric feels like paper!! The zippers are rough to open, i seriously hate it!! Not what i expected at all.</li>
    <li> Take my advice and don&#x27;t buy this piece of crap, it&#x27;s a waste of money, made of cheap material, it smells, it looks very fake. It should&#x27;ve been 5 dollars instead of 17. I asked to return it but instead she kept messaging me back and forth to the point where I got tired and got rid of the back. Big disappointment, big thumbs down!</li>
    <li> This bag is Rubbish! don&#x27;t spend your money on it Rubbish! They made me put a star because I could not submit my review without putting a star but it does not deserve a star it&#x27;s rubbish!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best but not the worst. I just wanted a cute black bag to carry my school stuff in and it does that. Not as big as it looks in the pictures but it&#x27;s big enough to hold my notebooks and folders. Cheap leather but hey it doesn&#x27;t look bad. Be careful with the zippers, they&#x27;re pretty cheap but as long as you don&#x27;t pull on them or zip them hella fast, they&#x27;ll be okay.  Overall it&#x27;s a good bag for the price and where it comes from. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
    <li> Was really excited to get this bag but as soon as I walked out the door with it the strap broke on me!  All my stuff came tumbling out!  Also my inside zipper pocket became detached already :(  it is A good price but I&#x27;ve had better purses for the same price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a strange texture, and it&#x27;s super big. (For my taste).&lt;br /&gt;It is really cute though, all of the zippers work, and I&#x27;ll get used to the texture and size, I&#x27;m sure of it!</li>
    <li> I loved it at first, but it can&#x27;t handle weight for such a big bag. I carried two full plastic water bottles in it and the strap broke off and it wasn&#x27;t fixable. I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I love the looks, but within two weeks the sewing on the shoulder strap separated and I has to take it to be repaired.</li>
    <li> Ive been waiting over a month.. still awaiting the arrival my bag that i needed on Sept. 4th im very dissapointed that its still not here. This bag better be worth it, ill change review when my bag arrives.</li>
    <li> This clutch looks so cheap, it is very light in weight and looks ugly. I am sorry I wasted my money on this one.</li>
