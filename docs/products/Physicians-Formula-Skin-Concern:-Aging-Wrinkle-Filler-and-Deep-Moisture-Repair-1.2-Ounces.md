### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great cream!</li>
      <li>but this brand of moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>Best antiwrinkle cream I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>My quest for the perfect face cream continues...</li>
      <li>The price was the best I’ve found.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a great find.</li>
      <li>Really good moisterizer</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Just love it !</li>
      <li>Superior wrinkle filler - This cream is not at all greasy and a perfect choice for normal or oily skin.</li>
      <li>THIS ONE MORE EFFECTIVE ON WRINKLES!----&lt;br /&gt;&amp; CRUELTY</li>
      <li>She looks better too, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I have used Estée lauder products but wanted to see if there was s cheaper and compare able product out there.</li>
      <li>FREE!</li>
      <li>When I received this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, the jar had one of those protectors just laying on the top of it, not sealed on it.</li>
      <li>fantastic love, love this product</li>
      <li>It has reduced the fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.  </li>
      <li>It feels amazing, it made my skin really soft and literally immediately the wrinkles on my forehead were more shallow/less noticeable.</li>
      <li>However, please note that when I put some of the product on the tops of my hands; I saw an instant smoothing and dewey moist look in addition to a softness that was not there before which gave me great hope as to the effects it would have on my face</li>
      <li>No side effects, but nothing special either.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the money.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff, this is my third jar , I would buy it more often but can&#x27;t alway  afford it,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Use daily and love it!</li>
      <li>Not as great for me as Arnaud products but helpful none the less!</li>
      <li>recommend you try , I have seen softness, and a difference in my fine lines , it makes my skin so soft !  </li>
      <li>does exactly what I was looking for it to do.</li>
      <li>but more so on the initial experience of the product itself.</li>
      <li>I use it at night and feel it really helps my frown lines!</li>
      <li>When I apply it I feel a tingle but no dramatic improvement in skin.</li>
      <li>Beauty products have an opened shelf life &amp; I&#x27;m certain this has been exceeded.</li>
      <li>and it really does make my skin plump up</li>
      <li>This product hasn&#x27;t done much but moisturize for me.</li>
      <li>Very greasy.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I do find it refreshing on my skin as we live in a very dry climate.  </li>
      <li>Looking forward to see final results after two weeks or till the full jar is used.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>I did so this morning and despite using a high end foundation (Estee Lauder) and face powder my face looked and felt greasy all day.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time last night and this morning saw noticeable results!</li>
      <li>In all fairness I just purchased this product yesterday using it for the first time last night so my comments are not to the RESULTS of the product as that has yet to be determined</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like others too.</li>
      <li>how it makes my skin feel - not too heavy or light.</li>
      <li>but none comes near to its results.</li>
      <li>I put it on quite early in the evening so that it has plenty of time to soak into my skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a reasonably priced product but not a high performer on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, it does what it says and I have used much expensive creams</li>
      <li>I could barely see out of my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have tried several anti wrinkle moisturizers out of fear and ended up purchasing this one just yesterday after running out of my other because of its affordability and high percentages of ingredients essential for defeating wrinkles.</li>

<li> I have tried several anti wrinkle moisturizers out of fear and ended up purchasing this one just yesterday after running out of my other because of its affordability and high percentages of ingredients essential for defeating wrinkles.</li>
<li> Did not fill in my deep winkles and it was greasy and not really to much of a moisture.  </li>
<li> Which means that this has been sitting on a shelf not sealed up for who knows how long.</li>
<li> Just started using it, so I don&#x27;t know long term results.</li>
<li> My skin is extreemly dry</li>
<li> my skin is dry, and this cream is working</li>
<li> My only complaint is if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to completely dry and accidentally touch the area where the cream was applied, it produces shavings which are kind of annoying.</li>
<li> I am not sure if I will continue using it or not simply based on the smell and feel of it.</li>
<li> Makes my face feel tight.</li>
<li> and this is slightly too heavy for me</li>
<li> so my lines by my eyes diminish a little.</li>
<li> Please be warned this is a very thick product that not only leaves your face feeling heavy and greasy</li>
<li> It did not do what I needed it to do, the wrinkles on my chin only got worse.</li>
<li> I am only 20 and unfortunately already have noticeable wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed in this purchase.</li>
<li> but at this point the smell and heaviness of the product makes it very difficult to live with at night while trying to sleep and forget about trying to apply it under your foundation.</li>
<li> , it smells terrible which is not apparent when/if you briefly check the scent while still in the store.</li>
<li> I just get tired of putting the stuff on.  </li>
<li> Sorry to say</li>
<li> I am sorry to say.</li>
<li> I&#x27;M 68, USED EXPENSIVE CREAMS FOR YEARS, &amp; FIND</li>
<li> It was a relief to remove it when I got home so with all that being said if you can stand the feel of it and the terrible smell of it, perhaps it will over time improve the look and feel of your skin.</li>

    <li> Use daily and love it!</li>
    <li> I will not be purchasing the cream again I am sorry to say. It did not do what I needed it to do, the wrinkles on my chin only got worse. Sorry to say but I did not see any improvement. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried! I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like others too.</li>
    <li> Not as great for me as Arnaud products but helpful none the less!</li>
    <li> Superior wrinkle filler - This cream is not at all greasy and a perfect choice for normal or oily skin. My skin is extreemly dry and I use this along with the Day&amp; Night cream for additional moisture.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  It has reduced the fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I received this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, the jar had one of those protectors just laying on the top of it, not sealed on it. There was a manufacturer coupon on the box that expired in 2014!  Which means that this has been sitting on a shelf not sealed up for who knows how long. Pretty disappointed in this purchase. Beauty products have an opened shelf life &amp; I&#x27;m certain this has been exceeded.</li>
    <li> Best antiwrinkle cream I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is slightly too heavy for me but this brand of moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Great cream! I use it at night and feel it really helps my frown lines!</li>
    <li> I started out using this product during my morning routine.  But I noticed that if I talked on the phone, there was a flaky residue sticking to the phone.  It took me a while and some trial and error to discover the culprit.  I now know that this wrinkle filler is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I only use it in the evening.  I put it on quite early in the evening so that it has plenty of time to soak into my skin.  Otherwise I would be having the sticky flakes on my bedding.  I do find it refreshing on my skin as we live in a very dry climate.  So anything that will add moisture and softness to my skin is a plus.  But, in my opinion, this product would not work under makeup or a sunscreen for that matter.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money.  It does help with wrinkles some what.  I just get tired of putting the stuff on.  Very greasy.</li>
    <li> I am only 20 and unfortunately already have noticeable wrinkles on my forehead. I have tried several anti wrinkle moisturizers out of fear and ended up purchasing this one just yesterday after running out of my other because of its affordability and high percentages of ingredients essential for defeating wrinkles. It feels amazing, it made my skin really soft and literally immediately the wrinkles on my forehead were more shallow/less noticeable. I also use this on my neck and lines I didn&#x27;t even know were removable, disappeared!! My only complaint is if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to completely dry and accidentally touch the area where the cream was applied, it produces shavings which are kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> I have used Estée lauder products but wanted to see if there was s cheaper and compare able product out there. This product hasn&#x27;t done much but moisturize for me. When I apply it I feel a tingle but no dramatic improvement in skin. Will continue to use bc I bought it and winter coming need moisture.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and this morning saw noticeable results! It&#x27;s amazing, it does what it says and I have used much expensive creams but none comes near to its results. Looking forward to see final results after two weeks or till the full jar is used. Will definitely buy again and will also introduce to F&amp;F.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, this is my third jar , I would buy it more often but can&#x27;t alway  afford it,&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you try , I have seen softness, and a difference in my fine lines , it makes my skin so soft !  Just love it !</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced product but not a high performer on my face. My quest for the perfect face cream continues...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed that big of a change.  I&#x27;m 51</li>
    <li> Really good moisterizer</li>
    <li> This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what I was looking for it to do.</li>
    <li> Did not fill in my deep winkles and it was greasy and not really to much of a moisture.  Wouldn&#x27;t not buy it again. Wish I could get my money back but that is the chance I get for believeing all these words of wisdom for their sales department.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M 68, USED EXPENSIVE CREAMS FOR YEARS, &amp; FIND THIS ONE MORE EFFECTIVE ON WRINKLES!----&lt;br /&gt;&amp; CRUELTY FREE! AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;WINDY</li>
    <li> I bought this threesome costmetics for my friend, and she raves about all of it.  So, I&#x27;mm taking her word for it.  She looks better too, in my opinion.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> fantastic love, love this product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it has reversed the signs of aging, but I like the scent and how it makes my skin feel - not too heavy or light.</li>
    <li> In all fairness I just purchased this product yesterday using it for the first time last night so my comments are not to the RESULTS of the product as that has yet to be determined but more so on the initial experience of the product itself. Please be warned this is a very thick product that not only leaves your face feeling heavy and greasy, it smells terrible which is not apparent when/if you briefly check the scent while still in the store. However, please note that when I put some of the product on the tops of my hands; I saw an instant smoothing and dewey moist look in addition to a softness that was not there before which gave me great hope as to the effects it would have on my face but at this point the smell and heaviness of the product makes it very difficult to live with at night while trying to sleep and forget about trying to apply it under your foundation.

I am not sure if I will continue using it or not simply based on the smell and feel of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 my skin is dry, and this cream is working</li>
    <li> No side effects, but nothing special either.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel tight. Just started using it, so I don&#x27;t know long term results.</li>
    <li> I finally got to use this product yesterday and I ended up in the Emergency room with severe reaction to this product. My face is blistered swollen with hives. I could barely see out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week and it really does make my skin plump up so my lines by my eyes diminish a little. I would recommend this to anyone. I love it!</li>
