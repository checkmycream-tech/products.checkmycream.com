      <li>I have fine hair like a baby.</li>
      <li>positive thing I can say, however, is that Maple Holistics&#x27; customer service is kind and understanding -</li>
      <li>This gel has a light hold.</li>
      <li>It made my hair look so smooth looking.</li>
      <li>and I felt comfortable with the turnout.</li>
      <li>hair gel&amp;#34; and homeopathic solution when it is filled with chemicals.</li>

      <li>I am always looking for natural and sulfate-free options of beauty products to buy and this seemed to be a good fit.</li>
      <li>This is a nice gel will definitely be getting more.</li>
      <li>What I really like about this gel is that it&#x27;s really easy to wash out of your hair and easy to wash off your hands after applying.</li>
      <li>I would say not to use to much at once and use it on the tips mostly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true that the ingredients list has chemicals in it, it seems the naturals are the ones that come through for my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty strong gel.</li>
      <li>Thanks Maple Holistics for making such a great product.</li>
      <li>Signature Mild Hair Gel, Ginseng Root Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Citrus bergamia (</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this gel because I have had great success with other products from Maple Holistics.</li>
      <li>However, I can vouch for teh fact that it works well and gives my hair a good hold without making it too dry or too gloopy.</li>
      <li>setting my natural hair,  and the end results was lovely.  </li>
      <li>This has a nice, light lemoney scent and the gel is very light, watery, and thin.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a higher quality hair gel that didn&#x27;t have tons of chemicals and additives.</li>
      <li>so much so, that if you don&#x27;t like one of their products, they will not only refund your money but send you complimentary ones on top of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was unsure of this at first</li>
      <li>Was also pleased at how long the bottle content has lasted.</li>
      <li>I have fairly brittle hair which had been weakened by trying subpar gels and greases in the past.</li>
      <li>The hold isn&#x27;t very strong, but it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my curls looking good and not looking stringy, hard, or weighed down.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and soft, not stiff or greasy.  </li>
      <li>The hair gel works really well with my hair.</li>
      <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I really like the product</li>
      <li>She does not like to put too much product on</li>
      <li>This is ironic because it contains sage.</li>
      <li>My head is drier than a cactus and VERY itchy throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I really liked this gel because it does not have the heavy perfume content of others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I love this gel because it makes my thin hair light and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and i can set my hair as i want with some new looks and style ......</li>
      <li>I will purchase again, but I am also looking for a new gel.</li>
      <li>I am new to this product line</li>
      <li>The bottle is great at first since the gel is just going to slide out, but when you get down to the last of the product, it&#x27;s not easy to squeeze.</li>
      <li>Much better than the regular hair gel products and doesn&#x27;t create a mess.</li>
      <li>We both have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavey-curly hair.</li>
      <li>It is not as natural as it portrays.</li>
      <li>Complete wastage of money.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels.</li>
      <li>Also, the next morning my hair still feels soft yet it still has style; I really wouldn&#x27;t have to wash and style it again, differently,  if I didn&#x27;t have time.  </li>
      <li>Great Company - Bad Gel.</li>
      <li>Not only that, but that night when I washed my hair, my hair was as soft as I could ever remember it being.</li>
      <li>I found Assuage Natural Hair Gel by accident as I surfed through various gels.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It left me feeling good about myself and it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell like some other hair gels out there.</li>
      <li>Just a little bit will last me the whole day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect gel to keep your hair in place, but not stiff.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavey-curly hair. My color treated hair tends to frizzy. When I normally used products on my hair it weighs my hair down. This product is wonderful!!! I love It! It smells great and best of all it doesn&#x27;t weigh my down. I absolutely am in love with this product. I am new to this product line and I have loved every item that I have tried so far. I will be a returning customer. No I wasn&#x27;t paid for my comment.</li>
    <li> Holds hair extremely well with matte finish, looks like you didn&#x27;t put anything in. Holds up pretty good in rain too. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have thin,fine, curly(3a/3b) hair and this gel is perfect for it. First off, the ingredients are great. There are no alcohols in it and it contains some great natural ingredients that I love. The bottle is great at first since the gel is just going to slide out, but when you get down to the last of the product, it&#x27;s not easy to squeeze. They could make the bottle a little less hard. This has a nice, light lemoney scent and the gel is very light, watery, and thin. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and It applies onto my curls very smoothly. I use a little bit of this on wet hair everyday and it causes no buildup until about 4 or 5 days after wash day. The hold isn&#x27;t very strong, but it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my curls looking good and not looking stringy, hard, or weighed down. I would recommend this to anyone with thin/fine curls.</li>
    <li> I love this gel because it makes my thin hair light and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I also happy with another product of Maple Holistics - Shampoo and Conditioner Set, Winter Blend Shampoo + Natural Conditioner Set with 5 Mint Varieties - for its silky feeling.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this gel. Complete wastage of money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Shiny hair, that isn&#x27;t weighted down. I can use it to straighten or for curls, and the smell is divine!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have very good holding power-smells good.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  My hair is smooth and soft, not stiff or greasy.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I found Assuage Natural Hair Gel by accident as I surfed through various gels.  Based on its description, I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s been almost a month now that I&#x27;ve used it every day, so I am basing my comments on past experience.  Usually I shy away from gels as they tend to be too stiff, but this one leaves my short, wavy/ curly hair defined, yet soft and shiny.  Alrhough it&#x27;s true that the ingredients list has chemicals in it, it seems the naturals are the ones that come through for my hair.  Also, the next morning my hair still feels soft yet it still has style; I really wouldn&#x27;t have to wash and style it again, differently,  if I didn&#x27;t have time.  My only disappointment is that I don&#x27;t experience any aroma at all from the bergamot oil. But, having said that, I intend to continue using this product as it&#x27;s the best one I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I was unsure of this at first but now it seems to be working for me.  I use it as my sealant after my leave in and moisturizer.  Day 1 hair shrinks bad, day 2 it falls as expected.  3b/3c hair. Also, hair does not keep its shine, I may have to use more oil. I will purchase again, but I am also looking for a new gel.</li>
    <li> This product has PVP and other harmful chemicals/plastics. It is not as natural as it portrays. The hold is very light. AND Last but not least, it gave me flakes like crazy - heavy dandruff. This is ironic because it contains sage. My head is drier than a cactus and VERY itchy throughout the day. I did not have this problem with my previous gel from organic science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive thing I can say, however, is that Maple Holistics&#x27; customer service is kind and understanding - so much so, that if you don&#x27;t like one of their products, they will not only refund your money but send you complimentary ones on top of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion? Great Company - Bad Gel.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that the &amp;#34;details&amp;#34; listed on Amazon did not divulge the first and largest ingredient being vp va copolymer, with polysorbate 20 next in line followed with many other chemicals dispersed around those you do claim to be in the product with the final bergamia oil accented in your description as the last ingredient thus the smallest amount.  It appears false advertisement as a &amp;#34;natural hair gel&amp;#34; and homeopathic solution when it is filled with chemicals. Better than many, but not as it was advertised.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair like a baby. I expected this stuff to provide some body....it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is a pretty strong gel. Just a little bit will last me the whole day. The same product  is sold at the local hair salon for at least double the price!</li>
    <li> I returned the product because the ingredients on the actual product included several chemicals that I do not use as part of my health and beauty regimen. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients on the Amazon order site are currently stated as follows: INGREDIENTS: Signature Mild Hair Gel, Ginseng Root Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Citrus bergamia (Bergamot) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients stated on the actual product: Water, VP/VA copolymer, PVP, Polysorbate 20, Ginseng Root Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (jojoba oil), Propylene Glycol, Acrylates (clo 30 crosspolymer), Tetrasodium EDTA, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Citrus Bergamia Oil (bergamot).</li>
    <li> It smells great! I believe the smell comes from the bergamot oil. This gel has a light hold. It won&#x27;t keep your hair in a position that would require a hard hold. It does make your hair shiny and less dull though. What I really like about this gel is that it&#x27;s really easy to wash out of your hair and easy to wash off your hands after applying. Do make note of the other review that includes the actual list of ingredients on the bottle as opposed to the one listed in the product description.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair styling gel a while back and I must say I was pretty impressed. It left me feeling good about myself and it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell like some other hair gels out there. After styling my hair, I felt sure that the gel would hold and I felt comfortable with the turnout. Not only that, but that night when I washed my hair, my hair was as soft as I could ever remember it being. It just made me feel like the gel wasn&#x27;t damaging my hair like my other gel felt. I&#x27;ve decided to go with this gel from now on, and it&#x27;s cheaper too!</li>
    <li> this was OK, nothing amazing, but it does work fine for my hair</li>
    <li> This hair gel is really good for curly hair. Curly girls listen up!! It made my hair look so smooth looking. I mostly like it because of the natural ingredients and usually when I buy natural products they smell off or bad but this gel actually smells okay. I would say not to use to much at once and use it on the tips mostly. This is a nice gel will definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use hair gels, they make my hair stiff or flaky. I wanted to try this gel because I have had great success with other products from Maple Holistics. I am so glad I did. My curls stay defined for days. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels. I now have beautiful Touchable Curls and no frizz. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This gel was lovely for my hair.  I used it while roller  setting my natural hair,  and the end results was lovely.  The curl remained defined without being sticky or dull, nor did it leave a flaky residue.  I am really impressed with this product  from Maple Holistics, and will definitely buy more.  I  will also try their shampoo and  Silk 18 conditioner.  It never occurred to me that Homeopathy included products for hair....  so happy to discover this and happy that it does.  Thanks Maple Holistics for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was looking for a higher quality hair gel that didn&#x27;t have tons of chemicals and additives. This was a little expensive for me considering how small the bottle is but I wanted to try it so I splurged. I was so happy I did as the bergamont oil smells like my favorite Earl Grey tea and makes me happy when I use the gel in the morning. Despite the small bottle size, this gel lasts a long time. I put a little on my palms and add a little water and then scrunch through my wavy hair. Helps take away the frizziness of my hair and defines my waves more. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. But I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything to actually hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> The hair gel works really well with my hair. I am always looking for natural and sulfate-free options of beauty products to buy and this seemed to be a good fit.However, on receiving the product, the ingredeint list seems to be different from the ones mentioned on the Amazon site :( However, I can vouch for teh fact that it works well and gives my hair a good hold without making it too dry or too gloopy.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! Promotes beautiful healthy strong hair, this is my 3rd order I LOVE IT!!! It also keeps hair extremely moisturized</li>
    <li> I really liked this gel because it does not have the heavy perfume content of others I&#x27;ve tried.  I keep my hair trimmed fairly short, 1-2 inches, and this gel holds the style I brush all day. Was also pleased at how long the bottle content has lasted.</li>
    <li> Much better than the regular hair gel products and doesn&#x27;t create a mess. Love it</li>
    <li> This works pretty good for my daughter. We both have naturally curly hair. She does not like to put too much product on so it is perfect for her.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, I really like the product and it helps me keep my hair curled up and styled! I am very impressed by all the products Maple Holistics has!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit now and I have to say its working. I have fairly brittle hair which had been weakened by trying subpar gels and greases in the past. The past few weeks I&#x27;ve been using the Maple Holistics brand I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct change in the texture and strength of my hair, and my barber&#x27;s noticed too. Not only has it strengthened my hair the radiant sheen I notice in the mirror is an added benefit. I plan to use this product for the long term, and I definitely recommend it for anyone else!</li>
    <li> Smells awsome and i can set my hair as i want with some new looks and style ......simply superb product</li>
