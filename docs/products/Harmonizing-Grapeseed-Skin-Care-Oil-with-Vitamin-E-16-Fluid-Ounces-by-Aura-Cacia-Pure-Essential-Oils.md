      <li>(long day, laid a towel on my pillow and was out like a light)</li>

      <li>I collected a large amount of sweetgrass, which grows wild where I live, and placed it in a large canning jar to the brim.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this oil.  Really helps with skin roughness.</li>
    <li> Nice essential skin care oil!</li>
    <li> The lid was broken and the product was all over the box.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific in or out of the shower body oil. It is a good price for the size and the amt you get goes a long way. I personally use it as a base to an oil mix I use on my skin. Grapeseed oil absorbs well and leaves just enough sheen to give a &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; look and feel to my skin. I live in the desert southwest and replenishing my skin from inside-to-out is a must year round. Remember a little goes a long way. If applying in the shower remember when drying off to blot skin with towel not rub or wipe down, air drying is best.</li>
    <li> Good product - - - excellent value!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Helps to keep naturally oily skin under control. A few drops in my moisturizer in the morning did the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as my daytime moisturizer. It works wonderfully on my oily and acne prone skin to keep it moisturized without making me too oily! I was buying the smaller size (4 oz) but the 16 Oz was such a better deal and lasts me about 6-8 months!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a skin product and decided to try it on my very curly, frizzy hair.  This works wonders and will no longer buy the All Nutrient that I was using.  All Nutrient is a great product but the Grapeseed oil works better.</li>
    <li> Using for shaving and works great!</li>
    <li> This is a super oil.  Very peaceful and feels very natural. It&#x27;s nice to find something that seems pure and well working. Thank you for a great, solid product.</li>
    <li> I use this with my moisturizer, both facial and body.  I have received loads of compliments on how my skin both looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for skincare! Not oily yet provides adequate moisture. My adult skin is also acne prone and this oil used with oil cleansing method and as moisturizer has made a noticeable difference in my skin. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and was in great condition. I love this and I use it at night to moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> I read about grapeseed oil being good for your skin and decided to try it.  I put some in a little bottle by my bathroom sink, and put it on daily before I go out.  I use maybe a dime or nickel sized amount in my palm after I wash.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out, but does keep it very soft and it&#x27;s also got some sunblocking qualities I&#x27;ve heard.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided how much to use exactly, because it does feel greasy if you use too much. It seems to kind of sit on top of the skin, but soak in gradually.  I have very oily skin and have fought it with rubbing alcohol, toner, etc.  I didn&#x27;t think oilly skin needed any moisturizer. After puberty, every afternoon I used to have greasy spots on my cheeks, chin and forehead.  I lived with fighting and being embarrassed by that all my life.  I thought it was just part of something I had to accept having oily skin. That has gone away with use of this.  I can tell the difference when I skip a day using this: my skin feels almost like it&#x27;s dying of thirst.  It&#x27;s lovely and supple when I&#x27;m using this though.  I only use it on my face and neck, uppper chest area, but would probably use it all over if I got lots.  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is this stuff stings like crazy if it gets in my eyes!!  That would be the only thing I hate about it! It does have an underlying scent, but it&#x27;s never bothered me, it&#x27;s not strong at all.  I have been using it for going on almost a year and will continue to do so. The big bottle is not even 1/2 way gone!  I am 44 years old and have been looking into natural ways to do things to get away from chemicals. This is the cheapest and best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used!  I would recommend it; see what you think.</li>
    <li> It works very well.  I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover ever. Not greasy. My dermatologist recommended this for eye makeup remover. Not greasy and very effective. And moisturizes without clogging pores. My mom is hooked now, too. She uses it also.</li>
    <li> I use grapeseed oil on my natural hair and on my face at night. Works and is very delicate and not extra oily.</li>
    <li> I use for 3days only because I verly get it but I like it I am happy whit this thanks you</li>
    <li> Makes a great massage oil that you can add essential oils to for a lot of slippery fun.  Probably good for cooking too.</li>
    <li> Love this! No odor! I love mixing it with essential oils for aromatherapy massage!!!! Very light oil leaves the skin moisturized but not greasy!</li>
    <li> This is a good oil at a great price. Its thick and dark which is a sign of quality.</li>
    <li> Best skin care change I have ever made.  I was worried--adding oil to skin is good??!!  YES.  My skin has never been clearer.</li>
    <li> Excellent bottle a squeeze puts a quarter size amount of oil in your palm, excellent skin care oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and use this oil for my client who is allergic to Jojoba oil.  The bottle came well packaged, too.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday in my body</li>
    <li> The product itself may be wonderful. I don&#x27;t know. Because when I saw that the Post Office had wrapped the box in a plastic bag I knew that what I would find inside would be very bad. And it was. The bottle had a seal on it when I removed the cap, but there was a small area where the seal did not attach to the bottle. Oil was everywhere as a result.  I will now have to find a local source. No more shipping for me! This is really a bummer, because getting stuff from Amazon is usually so convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years and it keeps my hair and skin well moisturized.  It&#x27;s not heavy like most oils, which I like.  During the summer months it helps protect my hair from the sun, chlorine from the pool, and keeps the frizzies at bay.  During the winter months, I mix a little with my regular lotion for the knees, hands, elbows and feet.  Those areas stay smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends and family and they all have enjoyed using this product.</li>
    <li> Most essential oils need to have a carrier oil to dilute them. Get a good book on the proper amounts for each oil you are using. This is the best carrier oil I like to use! Can use for cooking as well but I use it for it&#x27;s purity in diluting my essentials!</li>
    <li> Great light weight oil. No fragrance. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Grape Seed Oil form Aura Cacia for years. It is a part of my evening routine, I mix it with my regular moisturizer and apply it on my face - in the morning my skin looks like I had a facial done. It is also great to use for skin on your body, especially if you apply it in the evening and let it work overnight - skin feels completely renewed, silky, and smooth. I am over 40 and I am often told I look 10 years younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used hundreds of face and body products over the years; from expensive ones (over $200 for a jar) to drugstore brands - but  nothing compares to this. I am not sure if it is just my skin type that reacts so well to this oil, or something else - but trying it won&#x27;t break your bank.</li>
    <li> I use it for cosmetic purposes especially around my eyes for fine wrinkles.  It also helps to remove make-up and make many of my natural cosmetic products. .</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Keeps your skin nice and smooth under your favorite bath and bodyworks lotion.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent value for such a large size.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I am using it regularly now in place of lotion.  It absorbs into the skin quickly.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I use Aura Cacia  essential oils and knew this product would be a good one.</li>
    <li> I have already been using this oil in my private practice but always ended up buying it in the store here in Hawaii. But they cost so much. So when I found this online it was such a bargain in a bigger bottle. Thanks seller for providing the product in much reasonable cost. Aloha!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer for my face.</li>
    <li> Grapeseed oil is one of the most fantastic products a woman can her arsenal.  You can use it all over your body.  I put it on my hair, my face and body.  My skin is never dry, my face hardly breaks out and my hair gets super soft.  My skin use to flake all winter.  That never happen anymore.  People can never tell my age.  They are always saying that I am decade younger.  Gotta take care of your skin and grapeseed oil is a great start.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel softer</li>
    <li> I mix my essential oil with this. I even bought spray bottles so I could spray them on like perfume. This oil sprays well.</li>
    <li> good quality good price</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this grapeseed oil over almond oil based on previous reviews that let me know that grapeseed is a lighter oil than almond.  I am using it to make an infusion of sweetgrass oil to put in my hair and on my skin.  I collected a large amount of sweetgrass, which grows wild where I live, and placed it in a large canning jar to the brim.  I then poured the grapeseed oil in (enough to cover the sweetgrass), placed the lid on tightly, and I&#x27;ll let that sit and steep for several months, turning the glass jar upside down in weekly intervals after which I&#x27;ll strain out the sweetgrass.  I couldn&#x27;t find sweetgrass oil so I thought I&#x27;d try to make my own.  Hope it all works out well!</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that a woman had used this type of oil in her hair after she washed it and her hair was soft and voluminous. I have bleached hair and the ends are almost like straw from constantly processing it. I used a small about, about a dime size drop on my towel dried hair. I combed it through and fell asleep with it wet. (long day, laid a towel on my pillow and was out like a light) I woke up with my hair curly! LOL I haven&#x27;t had wavy/curly hair in a long time. My hair feels softer, fuller and more manageable than it has in a long time. I have only used this twice now. I wash my hair every three or four days, so I hope there won&#x27;t be any build up of the oil. Give it a try if you have dry hair like me.</li>
    <li> It gives the advantage of moisturizing with oils but is light and absorbs quickly instead of sitting on skin which can get rather messy. Also did not clog pores; no breakouts on the face, thankfully which happens rather easily with my complexion. Found it particularly useful when going out in the cold wind - it seems to prevent some of the windburn. Almost no smell - would recommend mixing a tiny bit of your favorite scented oil with it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and helps my relaxers to last longer.  I no longer use product in my hair.  This is all I need.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Ordered it to use as massage oil, and have been very impressed with it. Much better deal than buying massage oil. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It suits a variety of purposes and it glides onto the skin.  I actually add a little bit to my current lotions to make them easier to apply and to last longer.  It has no scent and used alone or with another product....it just makes sense.</li>
    <li> Love grapeseed oil for years but harder to find&lt;br /&gt;in this amount at such a good price. Try it, you&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be happy you did. My skin feels like satin. I use this oil&lt;br /&gt;everyday after showering and before bed (sparingly).&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly into skin and leaves little residue.</li>
    <li> Good skin softener and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This oil really works, I mix it in with my regular everyday lotion and my skin feels healthier and smoother. It has only been 3 days and I see a change in my hands. They used to be cracked and scaly, now they look close to normal. BUY IT !</li>
    <li> My wife uses this as a facial massage oil.  She likes it and uses it often.</li>
    <li> I needed to buy a carrier oil to put a few  drops of essential oils into. My skin loves this grapeseed oil. Blends well with any of my essential oils, but my favorite is 3 drops of tea tree oil to nine drops of  grapeseed carrier oil. Makes my face and hands  feel wonderful. I use this in the morning , after exercising, and at night before bed. Works better for me than any of that expensive stuff sold at the cosmetics counter. Best investment I ever made in my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> I still tend to break out more with this product if I use it as my sole washing method. If I use it to clean my pores then use regular ance products it seems to work well, and it is really good at removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Works fine for what  I need it for.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but so far I am happy with it.  It had a nice soft scent to it!</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly.  The bottle was larger than the picture indicated which was wonderful.  This is a great carrier oil for any essential oils you might have.  I also use it alone on my hands face and wherever I need extra moisture.  It is not irritating and has no odor of its own.  I would definitely recommend this oil.</li>
