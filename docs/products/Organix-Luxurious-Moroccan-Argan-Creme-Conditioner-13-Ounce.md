### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed!</li>
      <li>Great smell!  </li>
      <li>so it works perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I have even started using it in my kids hair, they are bi-racial and it works great on their hair too!</li>
      <li>This product has great slip.</li>
      <li>my hair smells so great</li>
      <li>I love  it !!</li>
      <li>The products worked fair</li>
      <li>110% completely satisfied!</li>
      <li>Works nicely though</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m towards the end of my &#x27;mermaid&#x27; length hair journey (my hair is about 2 inches below my waistline) and, as a result, require a very strong conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product that  I have run across for the price.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, too.</li>
      <li>I love my perfumes and I don&#x27;t like the clash between my hair and perfume, hence the 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would work better for fine hair (mine is curly)</li>
      <li>This conditioner works great and leaves my hair feeling really soft, but it smells like an elderly lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fantastic to</li>
      <li>words cannot express how highly I recommend this product..!!!!</li>
      <li>I cowashed my hair with this conditioner for the first time today and I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
      <li>This product has great slip which made it easy to detangle my hair in a few minutes.</li>
      <li>- you have to wash your hair often or it gets oily quick.</li>
      <li>It is so hydrated and less frizziness and fly aways.</li>
      <li>(The deep conditioner, on the other hand, it wonderful).  </li>
      <li>I love this brand but this particular scent is very masculine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has to be said: The scent is VERY strong, much, much stronger than the regular Moroccan oil shampoo/conditioner from Organix.</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair perfectly soft and smooth without any heaviness.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Organix!</li>
      <li>Pros - leaves hair feeling super soft, moisturizes hair and scalp&lt;</li>
      <li>Not a fan of the fragrance, and it did not moisturize as much as the OGX Keritin Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
      <li>The regular type&#x27;s scent faded fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair that needs a lot of moisture, however, I don&#x27;t feel like this offers that much moisture.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thick in consistency</li>
      <li>It has been a long journey to say the least, in finding a great hair product.</li>
      <li>I got tired of paying the amount of money I was spending and tried something cheaper that had a good review.</li>
      <li>If, however, your hair is super dry and/or damaged...pick up a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottom four inches is usually drier than the top and sides.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I was spending at least $12/pc for my hair products and way more as well.</li>
      <li>The previous reviewer is right; this is a heavy-duty conditioner and, if your hair is oily or normal, will over-condition to the point of greasiness.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money looking for a product that works, including the &#x27;normal&#x27; Moroccan oil conditioner from Organix, and had nothing work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this one and would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many hair products and spent so much money on morrocan oil and shampoo and conditioner that it is ridiculous.</li>
      <li>Strong scent and over moisturizes for my thick medium length hair.</li>
      <li>and I live in a dry climate (Colorado)</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m towards the end of my &#x27;mermaid&#x27; length hair journey (my hair is about 2 inches below my waistline) and, as a result, require a very strong conditioner. I have spent so much money looking for a product that works, including the &#x27;normal&#x27; Moroccan oil conditioner from Organix, and had nothing work. I was getting fed up to the point of cutting off all of my hair (yucky, dry, scraggly hair is DISGUSTING). I picked this up on a whim and...I LOVE THIS. The previous reviewer is right; this is a heavy-duty conditioner and, if your hair is oily or normal, will over-condition to the point of greasiness. If, however, your hair is super dry and/or damaged...pick up a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be said: The scent is VERY strong, much, much stronger than the regular Moroccan oil shampoo/conditioner from Organix. The regular type&#x27;s scent faded fairly quickly. This one&#x27;s scent lasts at least a day and a half.

    <li> Not a fan of the fragrance, and it did not moisturize as much as the OGX Keritin Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this brand but this particular scent is very masculine. I gave it to my husband. Works nicely though</li>
    <li> O.M.G!!! This is by far the best hair product that  I have run across for the price. I am super addicted. It has been a long journey to say the least, in finding a great hair product. I have long hair almost to the waist and its the worst! I have dry white people hair and it is so time consuming brushing it. I have tried so many hair products and spent so much money on morrocan oil and shampoo and conditioner that it is ridiculous. I was spending at least $12/pc for my hair products and way more as well. The products worked fair i figured at the time and i hated washing my hair because it always took me about 20-30 min just to brush my hair out after washing it and i had to keep on adding oil to my hair throughout brushing it. I got tired of paying the amount of money I was spending and tried something cheaper that had a good review. WOW! my hair smells so great and it doesnt even take me five minutes to brush through my hair after washing it. It is so hydrated and less frizziness and fly aways. My hair is so shiny and luxiorious. Anyone that doesnt think this is the hair product of the century for the price has some serious issues. You just cant please them all. If this hairline  is ever discontinued I will be totally devastated. I love  it !! I have even started using it in my kids hair, they are bi-racial and it works great on their hair too! Who wouldve known. I have finally come to the end of my hair enlightened journey. 110% completely satisfied! words cannot express how highly I recommend this product..!!!!</li>
    <li> I cowashed my hair with this conditioner for the first time today and I love it. This product has great slip which made it easy to detangle my hair in a few minutes. This product has great slip. My hair is very dry and I live in a dry climate (Colorado) so it works perfect for me. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Great smell!  Works very well in getting the tangles out of my thick, curly hair.  It does not weigh it down though I do have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> so it&#x27;s fantastic to me.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of my hairs don&#x27;t disappear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this shampoo ever since it hit the market, but I&#x27;ve had other Argan oil shampoos to use up. I finally bought some, and tried it tonight. I have long hair, and I color my hair every 8 weeks or so. The bottom four inches is usually drier than the top and sides. I sued this shampoo and my hair feels like silk, even the ends. I&#x27;m so impressed! I love the smell, too. I don&#x27;t like fruity shampoos, and Organix has plenty of those, but this one smells wonderfully subtle. Thanks Organix!</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner after trying the deep conditioner of this product line and was sorely disappointed.  It just didn&#x27;t leave my hair moisturized.  After using this, my hair felt dry and straw-like and the frizz was terrible!  (The deep conditioner, on the other hand, it wonderful).  Maybe it would work better for fine hair (mine is curly) but it&#x27;s a disaster for thirsty hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize enough for me.</li>
    <li> Pros - leaves hair feeling super soft, moisturizes hair and scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - you have to wash your hair often or it gets oily quick.</li>
    <li> Yes...it works wonder for my hair unlike other conditioners I used before this.  Hair is no more fizzy but manageable.  Of course I also applied Argan oil after the hair wash.  The combination of the two products have solved my hair problem.</li>
    <li> I got this based off of the reviews on Amazon and how it performed on curly hair.  I have very curly hair that needs a lot of moisture, however, I don&#x27;t feel like this offers that much moisture.  It&#x27;s not thick in consistency and I have to use a lot of product to get my desired result. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing and I don&#x27;t suggest it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair perfectly soft and smooth without any heaviness.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this one and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders to my hair, which are normally difficult to manage due to the volume and texture. It&#x27;s much-much easier to style the hair after I use this product!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great and leaves my hair feeling really soft, but it smells like an elderly lady&#x27;s perfume. A little too fragrant for me.</li>
    <li> Strong scent and over moisturizes for my thick medium length hair. Won&#x27;t buy this one again. I&#x27;ll stick to the other products from Organix.</li>
