      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>great product that really works.  </li>
      <li>My beautician friend gifted me with the shampoo, rinse, and body mass.  </li>
      <li>Even more then the rinse this brings fullness and &amp;#34;thickness&amp;#34; to my hair.</li>
      <li>the scent is phenomenal though.</li>
      <li>The scent is just okay.  </li>
      <li>have used this product for more than six months</li>
      <li>Gives me more body.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this line for my fine hair</li>
      <li>This REALLY works and smells soooooo good,</li>
      <li>The fragrance is so strong, it lasts for days.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t even use it!</li>
      <li>It really fluffs your hair out and makes it very full with body and is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I stopped one day to try a different shampoo and while that shampoo and conditioner was a great way to condition my hair</li>
      <li>But your hair will look fabulous and can be styled.</li>
      <li>I have used the spray for months, and will continue to give it a fair try, but so far, I am seeing no difference whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I first found it while traveling in another state and searched the web when I ran out!!</li>
      <li>It has a very strong, very cologne-like smell.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly</li>
      <li>The trio is worth the $$.</li>
      <li>However, my hair salon sells this exact product for $40.00 so hence the two stars for Amazon purchase</li>
      <li>very expesinve!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for perfume type scents</li>
      <li>my hairdresser commented without me even prompting her, she said, wow, your hair looks so much fuller!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak as to whether it grows new hair or not, that I can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
      <li>But anyway I highly recommend this line.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t really see much of a difference, also hair gets really oily the next day.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely thin/fine and this has helped tremendously!</li>
      <li>If you are at all sensitive to scents, this line of products is NOT for you.</li>
      <li>Do not spend that much money on the cute bottle, because the stuff inside it is useless.</li>
      <li>Never happy or satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I have thin(ing) hair due to age, coloring and alot of chemo, so I am always trying anything I find new on the counter that guarantees root lift, volumizing, thickener, etc.  </li>

<li> By second day, my hair is flat.</li>

<li> This spray has absolutely no effect.</li>
<li> My hair is so thin because of thyroid issues and it took going to 4 different doctors before one would do the complete thyroid panel.  </li>
<li> In the morning, I just blow dry (after spraying on some Body Mass) then use the spray for spot styling with round brush and hairdryer.  </li>
<li> How can someone who creates a product with natural ingredients add so much irritating fragrance?</li>
<li> , I can wear it down without hats or headband.  </li>
<li> It is very expensive but it does last for a long time.</li>
<li> This product smells really bad, I don&#x27;t know if I can use it long enough to get results.</li>
<li> (tho usually rinse it in the shower).  </li>
<li> Product is fantastic but the shipping was horrible.</li>
<li> Just that one day I switched to the other shampoo, my hair felt oily and heavy and looked awful.  </li>
<li> Half of the product was spilled inside the box when it arrived :(</li>
<li> I see improvement in my very thin hair in 4 weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product that really works.  Improves hair texture as well.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> works great.  I read about this in a beauty blog, the blogger was raving about it.  I see why!  I&#x27;ve been using for about a month, my hair looks thicker already!  my hairdresser commented without me even prompting her, she said, wow, your hair looks so much fuller!  I will continue to use this and am considering using their shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> This works amazing and love the smell! My hair is extremely thin/fine and this has helped tremendously! The trio is worth the $$.</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic but the shipping was horrible. Half of the product was spilled inside the box when it arrived :(</li>
    <li> I have thin(ing) hair due to age, coloring and alot of chemo, so I am always trying anything I find new on the counter that guarantees root lift, volumizing, thickener, etc.  Never happy or satisfied.  My beautician friend gifted me with the shampoo, rinse, and body mass.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  I do not have oily hair, nor do I wash my hair every day (tho usually rinse it in the shower).  In the morning, I just blow dry (after spraying on some Body Mass) then use the spray for spot styling with round brush and hairdryer.  This gives me incredible body, lift and hold.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great smell.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I see improvement in my very thin hair in 4 weeks. However, my hair salon sells this exact product for $40.00 so hence the two stars for Amazon purchase</li>
    <li> This product smells really bad, I don&#x27;t know if I can use it long enough to get results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it as a root plump.  Gives me more body.</li>
    <li> very expesinve! i don&#x27;t really see much of a difference, also hair gets really oily the next day. By second day, my hair is flat. the scent is phenomenal though.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly &amp; it&#x27;s a great product - thanks!</li>
    <li> This spray has absolutely no effect. Do not spend that much money on the cute bottle, because the stuff inside it is useless. It has a very strong, very cologne-like smell. Literally smells like a product for men. I have used the spray for months, and will continue to give it a fair try, but so far, I am seeing no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker when I use this product. It is expensive,however</li>
    <li> Even more then the rinse this brings fullness and &amp;#34;thickness&amp;#34; to my hair. I first found it while traveling in another state and searched the web when I ran out!! The shampoo is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This is the hair product I&#x27;ve been looking for for years!!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  You need to play with it.  It is very expensive but it does last for a long time.</li>
    <li> This REALLY works and smells soooooo good,</li>
    <li> Once you start using this product, do you have to continue using it FOREVER, (like Rogaine)??&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for more than six months and I can&#x27;t tell any difference!</li>
    <li> Smells great...doesn&#x27;t work any better than cheaper products.  Would not spend the money again.</li>
    <li> I love this line for my fine hair</li>
    <li> This is an amazing line.  I actually did not buy it off of Amazon because the price only now just came down.  So I had to order through my local salon.  Anyway I have been using this line for 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I stopped one day to try a different shampoo and while that shampoo and conditioner was a great way to condition my hair (it had Morrocan argan oil in it) I had to immediately go back to this line.  It really fluffs your hair out and makes it very full with body and is very easy to use.  Just that one day I switched to the other shampoo, my hair felt oily and heavy and looked awful.  But with the plumping line my hair looks great, I can wear it down without hats or headband.  My hair is so thin because of thyroid issues and it took going to 4 different doctors before one would do the complete thyroid panel.  But anyway I highly recommend this line.  The scent is just okay.  I don&#x27;t really care for perfume type scents but I like the results so well I don&#x27;t mind using it anyway.  I can&#x27;t really speak as to whether it grows new hair or not, that I can&#x27;t tell.  But your hair will look fabulous and can be styled.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Don&#x27;t buy from Dream Beauty.</li>
    <li> If you are at all sensitive to scents, this line of products is NOT for you. The fragrance is so strong, it lasts for days. Days of a headache and irritated sinuses. I really wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t even use it! After paying a lot for it. How can someone who creates a product with natural ingredients add so much irritating fragrance?</li>
