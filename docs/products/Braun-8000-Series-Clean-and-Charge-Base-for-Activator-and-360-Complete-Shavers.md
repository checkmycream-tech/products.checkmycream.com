      <li>, cleaner works perfectly every time.</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>:  Works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Great product and excellent service.</li>
      <li>Was happy to find a replacement and it works great!</li>
      <li>Shaver still works great</li>
      <li>years and am very pleased with both.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice that it cleans itself, but</li>
      <li>Just like the real thing very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the razor.  </li>
      <li>I have had a Braun 8585 for more than four years now.  </li>
      <li>Shaver works good at getting pretty close.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to have a super clean razor whenever he wants it, and I love how close the shave is when he uses it.</li>
      <li>This activator is exactly what we needed and as good as the original.</li>
      <li>That arm used a spring loaded latch to secure the shaver in place.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what was needed!!</li>
      <li>does everything the original charger/cleaner station did.  </li>
      <li>Would be nice to have included a new power cord.</li>
      <li>A nice item, overall.</li>
      <li>the shaver fits will, and charges, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping</li>
      <li>It was more the latter.  </li>
      <li>I am a pretty hairy guy</li>
      <li>Just like the one which came with my razor, which is now more than a few years old, it works fine.</li>
      <li>After 2 years, it now uses up the clean-and-renu cartridges MUCH faster than it used to.</li>
      <li>Since this one arrived have not yet seen the red light letting me know cartridge replacement is needed.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I let it rest gently against the contacts to help avoid bending them.  </li>
      <li>This is no small challenge... and unfortunately, not permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Involves a judgement call in that a whole new system is around $150 (sometimes $110 at Costco)</li>
      <li>However, Braun did not make this unit with high quality in mind.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this one even though the price was a bit high.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a close shave (except for my neck), but at a high price.</li>
      <li>In all other respects, it works fine.</li>
      <li>It is constructed exactly the same way, in every detail.  </li>
      <li>If this one last as long as the original, 10+ years,</li>
      <li>Whereas the original (black) unit lasted 4+ years.</li>
      <li>(It was about 10 years old.)  </li>
      <li>And, sadly, this is the only option available as a replacement for the original cleaning device.</li>
      <li>the foil head and blades are supposed to last 18 months - I&#x27;ve had to buy three sets so far at $32.00 a piece!  </li>
      <li>Since foil/cutter is to be replaced every year and a half, the razor can perform like new much longer.</li>
      <li>This is  a bare- bones item, doesn&#x27;t come with any paperwork or even a box, just in a plastic bag, and doesn&#x27;t include the charger - that has to be bought separately.  </li>
      <li>Currently I&#x27;ve spent more replacing the charging base and cutter heads than I originally paid for the razor; but then I really like the Braun and it works.</li>
      <li>But I really would have appreciated it if Braun had devised a more robust set of contacts on the base.  </li>

<li> Braun 8000-Series Clean &amp; Charge Base</li>
<li> The clean &amp; charge base just quit on me, another $50.  </li>

<li> I feel stuck, so I am ordering a new base, hoping that will slow down the cleaner usage.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the contacts can&#x27;t be easily detached from the base to work on, without breaking the plastic.  </li>
<li> He&#x27;s had the razor for over 2 years now and the blades got really really dull.</li>
<li> This base is identical except for being a dark grey color rather than black.  </li>
<li> This base was certainly sub-standard as is Braun&#x27;s customer service.</li>
<li> However, the base seems to work only every other day!</li>
<li> But at 50 bucks for the new base - I am feeling a bit like a sucker.</li>
<li> I just ordered another charge base from them for $39.99 and a new razor head for $43.99 with shipping included.</li>
<li> With less than 1 month of infrequent use the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; aspect of this device failed (stopped working).</li>
<li> As you can see in the photo, it would touch on the two metal contacts in view on the base, eliminating the need for that long arm (which oddly made a return in the 5 series line!).  </li>
<li> What happens over time is that repeated pressing of the shaver into the base gradually bends those prongs enough to make for an intermittent connection.  </li>
<li> Got tired of replacing the cartridges every two weeks or so.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The base that came with my hubby&#x27;s razor stopped working. Was happy to find a replacement and it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this and the razor that goes with it as a gift for my fiancee back when he was still in college. He&#x27;s had the razor for over 2 years now and the blades got really really dull. Then, one day last week the charger randomly started sparking and smelling like smoke, so we just had to replace both. This charging station, however, still works like a charm. It&#x27;s great to be able to have a super clean razor whenever he wants it, and I love how close the shave is when he uses it. However, I think his shaving habits may have something to do with the product&#x27;s longevity--he only shaves maybe once or twice a week. A nice item, overall.</li>
    <li> This activator is exactly what we needed and as good as the original. If this one last as long as the original, 10+ years, well worh the money</li>
    <li> (Laura&#x27;s Husband here) I like the Shaver. I am a pretty hairy guy .. got a shadow going by the end of the day. Shaver works good at getting pretty close. However, DEFINITELY NOT Razor close - no matter what they tell you. But, my wife doesn&#x27;t complain about the prickle bushes around my lips after I use it. HERE IS THE PROBLEM. After 2 years, it now uses up the clean-and-renu cartridges MUCH faster than it used to. These are 6 bucks a pop and I am going through them in less than 2 months now. Used to last 4-5 months. No clue. Well. I feel stuck, so I am ordering a new base, hoping that will slow down the cleaner usage. But at 50 bucks for the new base - I am feeling a bit like a sucker.</li>
    <li> Purchased a replacement charging stand in Dec of &#x27;09 and I&#x27;m now having to jiggle the razor to get the charge function to work. I purchased the unit from Smallappliances.com for 29.99 + shipping. I just ordered another charge base from them for $39.99 and a new razor head for $43.99 with shipping included. Currently I&#x27;ve spent more replacing the charging base and cutter heads than I originally paid for the razor; but then I really like the Braun and it works.</li>
    <li> After three years of use, my Braun base started to act erratically--sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not. Consequently, I ordered a replacement base from Amazon. The base arrived within minimal delay--as is the case with most items that I purchase through Amazon. However, the base seems to work only every other day! I do not know whether it is a new feature of the this base because that certainly was not the case with the old one, which worked every day until it finally stopped.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was needed!!</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 8585 for more than four years now.  I love the razor.  I hated the base.  I did not have the base for very long before it quit working.  I contacted Braun, which instructed me to send it to a warranty center in Amarillo, Texas, at my cost.  I did as Braun instructed me to do and never heard from Braun or the warranty center again without me initiating all correspondence.  After contacting both Braun and the warranty center over several months, the warranty center finally sent a post card to inform me that the base was fine and that the problem must be in the charger or razor.  They instructed me to send them my razor and charger (again, at my cost) so that they could find the problem.  I considered sending these items, but thought better of it as my first experience with them proved costly (I had to send the base to them at my cost) and, ultimately, futile.  I could not get them to return the base and Braun didn&#x27;t help.  I finally gave up.  I have continued to use the razor, rinsing it in the sink after every few uses, but I am disappointed in Braun&#x27;s customer service.  This base was certainly sub-standard as is Braun&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> bought this item as a replacement for the one that came with my shaver as the one I had stopped working.  It was an exact replacement, except for the color, my base was black and the one I received was gray.  This is  a bare- bones item, doesn&#x27;t come with any paperwork or even a box, just in a plastic bag, and doesn&#x27;t include the charger - that has to be bought separately.  Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Yes, I do get a close shave and it&#x27;s nice that it cleans itself, but if I were to do it again, I would never buy this shaver.  It is too expensive to maintain.  I&#x27;ve owned my 8985 Activator model for two years: the foil head and blades are supposed to last 18 months - I&#x27;ve had to buy three sets so far at $32.00 a piece!  The clean &amp; charge base just quit on me, another $50.  Yes, it&#x27;s a close shave (except for my neck), but at a high price.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the replacement anywhere else. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Our Braun clean and charge base broke after years of use.  I ordered this one even though the price was a bit high.  I only wish it had come with a cord which it does not. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> With less than 1 month of infrequent use the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; aspect of this device failed (stopped working). Whereas the original (black) unit lasted 4+ years. Trying to get warranty repair/replacement now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed w/ Braun. This replacement unit seems to have a history (reading other reviews) of being a dog. And, sadly, this is the only option available as a replacement for the original cleaning device.</li>
    <li> The original clean &amp; charge base for my Braun shaver died recently.  (It was about 10 years old.)  This base is identical except for being a dark grey color rather than black.  Plugged it in, inserted a cleaner cartridge and my shaver was back in business.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Would be nice to have included a new power cord.</li>
    <li> When Braun first introduced the cleaning station with the 7000 series, the base had this large arm that extended upward on an angle.  It looked partly like an attempt at art and partly like a functional compromise.  It was more the latter.  The reason why Braun made that long arm is because of the connecting port on the bottom of the shaver.  That arm used a spring loaded latch to secure the shaver in place.  Over time, this latch would fail and make the cleaning base useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the 8000 series, Braun reduced the shortcomings of the 7000 cleaning station by putting two metal contacts on the back side of the shaver.  As you can see in the photo, it would touch on the two metal contacts in view on the base, eliminating the need for that long arm (which oddly made a return in the 5 series line!).  However, Braun did not make this unit with high quality in mind.  Those metal prongs don&#x27;t rely on a spring, but instead the flexible tension of the metal.  What happens over time is that repeated pressing of the shaver into the base gradually bends those prongs enough to make for an intermittent connection.  I have had to disassemble the cleaning base twice to fix this.  Unfortunately, the contacts can&#x27;t be easily detached from the base to work on, without breaking the plastic.  Thus, you have to finagle their shape while seated.  This is no small challenge... and unfortunately, not permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a spare base once my original base because too problematic to keep fixing.  It is constructed exactly the same way, in every detail.  So, I use it sparingly.  I am also very careful with putting the shaver in the base.  I let it rest gently against the contacts to help avoid bending them.  So far so good.  But I really would have appreciated it if Braun had devised a more robust set of contacts on the base.  In all other respects, it works fine.</li>
    <li> Braun touts their 500 series as a seven year razor. Since foil/cutter is to be replaced every year and a half, the razor can perform like new much longer. Not so with the cleaner/charger which can go into a cycle where the $5 cleaner cartridge needed to be replaced once or twice a week. (s/b once every month or two.)&lt;br /&gt;Involves a judgement call in that a whole new system is around $150 (sometimes $110 at Costco)</li>
    <li> does everything the original charger/cleaner station did.  no complaints!  the shaver fits will, and charges, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Perfect. It was to replace the one that I had that was not working anymore. Item as described.Rapid delivery</li>
    <li> I believe this was the third purchase of this clean &amp; Charge base. All of them didn&#x27;t last long. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Have had the shaver and cleaner station for several (5 or 6?) years and am very pleased with both. Forgot to bring along the cord on an extended (5 week) trip - battery won&#x27;t last that long! Tried to find a replacement cord without much success.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver heads last a long time in spite of my heavy beard, cleaner works perfectly every time. Discontinuing cord manufacture is not very bright, as I will need to find a new brand when it&#x27;s time to replace my 8985.</li>
    <li> this was plug and play, replaced my original broken one. different color _lighter grey-shell but who cares about the color?</li>
    <li> Just like the one which came with my razor, which is now more than a few years old, it works fine. It&#x27;s a Braun, isn&#x27;t it? The original one finally gave up the ghost when the electronics failed -- I suspect a transistor finally failed.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Timely delivery</li>
    <li> Braun 8000-Series Clean &amp; Charge Base:  Works perfectly.  It replaced one that I have used for years until it no longer stopped the cleaning process.  Got tired of replacing the cartridges every two weeks or so.  Since this one arrived have not yet seen the red light letting me know cartridge replacement is needed.  Shaver still works great and I expect to recover the purchase cost is a year or so from not having to replace those cartridges so often.</li>
