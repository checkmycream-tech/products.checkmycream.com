      <li>The gift person didn&#x27;t think it smelled or was as great as they thought it was going to be like!!</li>
      <li>I have used this perfume for years and this was the best price that I have ever seen!!!</li>

      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>and I was very happy to find it at such a great price!!!</li>
      <li>Scent was just OK, did not have a great &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor.  </li>
      <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH AMAZON SERVICE</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance!</li>
      <li>I have gotten more compliments on my perfume since I started using Incanto than any perfume before it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;She smiled and told me it is \\&quot;Incanto For Women\\&quot; by Salvatore Ferragamo, the Eau De Parfum Spray.</li>
      <li>From now on, I will always shop at Macy&#x27;s or Von Mauer, that way I will know once this scent is on my skin how it willintermingle nwith my own scent.</li>
      <li>I made a special trip to Macy&#x27;s to test the parfum and see if the fragrance smelled as good with my body chemistry as it did with hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>authentic item..</li>
      <li>I love it and it has become my favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>i love it...</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
      <li>Top notes: velvet peach, plum, jamaican pepper.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted I&#x27;m happy with my order will be ordering more, size price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, but noticeable... floral and woodsy.  </li>
      <li>The smell and its quickly fading aroma confirmed my suspicions.</li>
      <li>True story: I was in an elevator, alone.</li>
      <li>My sister paid full price for this in the store.  </li>
      <li>item was exactly as described.....</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s most definitely one of my all time favorites.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this perfume!  </li>
      <li>Smells good at first when you spray it, after a few minutes scent is gone.</li>
      <li>Apparently discontinued by Ferragamo and these are knock offs and thus cheap.</li>
      <li>WILL ALWAYS USE AMAZON  THANKS</li>
      <li>This has a lovely, softly spicy scent, and seems to last well on me.</li>
      <li>Subtle but sensational.</li>
      <li>the prospective buyer, please be aware that Ferragamo has various parfums out for women:</li>
      <li>I still had some of the real eau de parfum left and when I compared the bottle and color of the liquid, it was suspect.</li>
      <li>I ordered a small sample of Incanto to see if I liked it before I actually purchased a big bottle and let me tell you,</li>

<li> This is a light scent and although recommended for casual use, I also use it in the evening, as I do not like heavier</li>
<li> It also lasts for a long time!</li>
<li> I could small the lovely fragrance she was wearing and not being a particularly shy person, I asked her the name of her</li>
<li> This item came very late and for some reason, the perfume is not wrapped in plastic like the other 2 perfumes that I bought; so clearly, this is not authentic and probably very old or mixed with water and alcohol, although it indicated \\&quot;new\\&quot; on the ad, so spray it on you, give it 5 minutes, and the scent is gone!</li>
<li> I carefully read all the reviews about this perfume and was so stoked when it arrived.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not that the expected</li>
<li> Was not aware.</li>
<li> Scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last like the expensive &amp;#34;same thing&amp;#34; we bought at a Ferragamo store years ago.</li>
<li> Too weak; not long-lasting.  </li>
<li> The base note: amber, sandalwood, white musk.</li>
<li> So disappointed!!!</li>

    <li> True story: I was in an elevator, alone. The elevator stopped at a floor before mine and a woman entered. I could small the lovely fragrance she was wearing and not being a particularly shy person, I asked her the name of her perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She smiled and told me it is \\&quot;Incanto For Women\\&quot; by Salvatore Ferragamo, the Eau De Parfum Spray. I made a special trip to Macy&#x27;s to test the parfum and see if the fragrance smelled as good with my body chemistry as it did with hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely a match!! Incanto is an alluring floral and woody fragrance with hints of sun-repined fruit. Top notes: velvet peach, plum, jamaican pepper. The middle notes: jasmine, peony, ambrette seeds, red lily &#x27;oriental martagon&#x27;. The base note: amber, sandalwood, white musk. This is a light scent and although recommended for casual use, I also use it in the evening, as I do not like heavier perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the prospective buyer, please be aware that Ferragamo has various parfums out for women: \\&quot;Incanto Bliss,\\&quot; \\&quot;Incanto Dream,\\&quot; etc. This is NOT the same perfum. What I am reviewing is, simply, \\&quot;Incanto For Women\\&quot; by Salvatore Ferragamo, the Eau De Parfum Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this works for you. I love it and it has become my favorite fragrances. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Subtle but sensational. I have gotten more compliments on my perfume since I started using Incanto than any perfume before it! Amazing! [[ASIN:B000C1ZDS6 Incanto By Salvatore Ferragamo For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> This has a lovely, softly spicy scent, and seems to last well on me.</li>
    <li> My sister paid full price for this in the store.  Is has a great smell and I was very happy to find it at such a great price!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mom. She loves it! Since then, she constantly uses this product.</li>
    <li> This item came very late and for some reason, the perfume is not wrapped in plastic like the other 2 perfumes that I bought; so clearly, this is not authentic and probably very old or mixed with water and alcohol, although it indicated \\&quot;new\\&quot; on the ad, so spray it on you, give it 5 minutes, and the scent is gone! Yikes!!!</li>
    <li> From now on, I will always shop at Macy&#x27;s or Von Mauer, that way I will know once this scent is on my skin how it willintermingle nwith my own scent. I will have to give this one away and go get some Chanel no 5.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not that the expected</li>
    <li> Wonderfull! 100% recomended.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH AMAZON SERVICE WILL ALWAYS USE AMAZON  THANKS</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted I&#x27;m happy with my order will be ordering more, size price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> item was exactly as described..... i love it...authentic item..what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
    <li> I carefully read all the reviews about this perfume and was so stoked when it arrived. Shipping to awhile I may add. Smells good at first when you spray it, after a few minutes scent is gone. Tried to return, but realized I can&#x27;t return liquid items?? Was not aware. So disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I still had some of the real eau de parfum left and when I compared the bottle and color of the liquid, it was suspect. The smell and its quickly fading aroma confirmed my suspicions. It&#x27;s what I get for buying from the internet I guess.</li>
    <li> Scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last like the expensive &amp;#34;same thing&amp;#34; we bought at a Ferragamo store years ago. Apparently discontinued by Ferragamo and these are knock offs and thus cheap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this perfume!  It&#x27;s most definitely one of my all time favorites.  I switch between Hanae Mori Blue Butterfly and Calvin Klein Euphoria, but I was looking for another scent... something different.  I ordered a small sample of Incanto to see if I liked it before I actually purchased a big bottle and let me tell you, it&#x27;s wonderful!  I get so many compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s light, but noticeable... floral and woodsy.  It also lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years and this was the best price that I have ever seen!!!</li>
    <li> Too weak; not long-lasting.  Scent was just OK, did not have a great &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor.  Will probably give it away.</li>
    <li> The gift person didn&#x27;t think it smelled or was as great as they thought it was going to be like!!</li>
