<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. Does what it says on the tin! Stays put and never smudges.great product, why was it discontinued? Anything that&#x27;s good always seems to be discontinued</li>
    <li> Benn using this for about 2 years and would not ue anything else&lt;br /&gt;No MAC no Chanel Nope not for me This will do great for length and volume !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mascara.  What can I say?  It&#x27;s not the one I thought it was, but it&#x27;ll work.</li>
    <li> the package got here on time and all but it was the actual mascara package it comes in. the item looks old and like someone bit it and used it or something. no... horribele... dont purchase it</li>
    <li> This mascara is discontinuing and I can buy only online. I have no idea what I will do without it. With XXL mascara, my eyelashes is very sick but soft. I have tried all Maybelline mascara and ONLY XXL can give me same effect.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very fast as promised.</li>
    <li> It was good overall, but my mascara was unsealed but packaged (if that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m african American n have long eyelashes and a beginner with makeup so its good, plus it doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
    <li> Delivered timely. However, the clear plastic encasing the merchandise sits in was open. I discarded the item. I am unhappy with my purchase, therefore, I give it one star only.</li>
    <li> They really mean 24 hour hold! Great long lashes and the two sides guves you an option! Love the mascara and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I previously purchaed in different stores at different prices. I love this mascara, but can&#x27;t seem to find i anymore except &amp;#34;on line&amp;#34;.  I guess the manufacturer likes change.  I wondeer if he/she voted for Pres. Obama???</li>
    <li> It works ok, but the one I wanted to order had white cream on one side and the mascara on the other.  This one has black on both.  My fault.</li>
    <li> It looks great, this was an excellent purchase.  I would recommend this product to anyone using mascara, Maybelline products are really great.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara by far. Makes my eyelashes extra long. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> This mascara definitely creates length an volume. My eyelashes do look a lot thicker and darker. However, the mascara can get a little clumpy and chunky. Removes very easy though. I&#x27;m happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff goes on very well makes my lashes look full with out clumping I will b getting more of this it is we&#x27;ll worth the price great deal came fast</li>
    <li> Works great for me! Had to get used to the 2 sides, but I love it! Not clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have 3 maybelline mascars an i got this cuz they always do what they advertise but this one was clumpy on ends a little an didnt separate my lashes as i would have hoped i almost got spider lashes from it. So i wasmt to happy with how much i spent but oh well ill use it until its dryed out or gone but i dont think i will order another one</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Perfect look every time. Does anyone know why it is discontinued? I have to use 3 different mascara to get the same look that this one gives.</li>
    <li> this is great it does not clump or flake and it looks great as well. My teenage girls and i love this!</li>
    <li> I give this an A+ it is a great product and I recommend it to everyone who sees this it last and is definitely worth your money I love it I love it one more thing buy it Lil its amazing</li>
    <li> I love this mascara soo much! I curl my lashes, apply the base coat (1) then apply the 24hour hold (2) &amp; presto! You have beautifully full lashes! I can go throughout the whole day without it smudging &amp; no clumps! Best mascara I&#x27;ve used by far! Never run out please!!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of highlighting my eyes, which tend to disappear without makeup.  Very black, lengthening and thickening lashes.</li>
    <li> My favorite Maybelline mascara has been discontinued.  You need to buy this while you can!!!  This is a great bargain!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Thick/even/full coverage! I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascaras in my days and this one is up there! Nothing to complain about! Didn&#x27;t realize it was a double-sized tube, however, I didn&#x27;t find this to be a bad quality. Great price for a great buy! (package arrived a little mangled on the edges, but the tube itself was not damaged)</li>
    <li> I love how quick it got here. It works great. I love it! Keeps my eyelashes on point it has not fail me.</li>
    <li> Very good. The No.1 separates lashes perfectly and number 2 gives volume without creating lumps. Do not run and is long lasting</li>
    <li> Although this is slightly different then the one with the white primer,  I am still pleased. My lashes look long and lovely!</li>
    <li> the package that it came in was damaged for some reason but overall i love the mascara. although its verry dark which i like it sucks after it drys later in the day when it starts to clump up, it makes my eyelashes feel hard and i didnt even put much on.</li>
    <li> i usually use 7 mascaras to achieve my look but i only have to use this now! so happy! so if you use 3 or more mascaras to get the look you like  just get this! not clumpy not runny its just perfect! i will recommend this product to all my school mates, family and friends! thank you</li>
    <li> When it arrived, it had been opened and completely dried up. What person would sell make up for a profit that&#x27;s all used up?</li>
    <li> I Love this Version because the base is also Black like the mascara.  My eyelashes are black and I had to use 3 coats of mascara to cover the other.  This one is a breeze! One coat if Base and one Coat if Mascara!  I will never use another one now!</li>
    <li> Great mascara! I was really surprised how big and long this makes my lashes look! Great product and shipped fast. Will definitely buy more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara. It goes on so easy and dark. No clumping. Makes my lashes look so long. Wish you could still buy in stores.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. I love how the double layer really makes my eyelashes stand out. I&#x27;m sad that they don&#x27;t sell this in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Its not exactly what I thought it would be, but for mascara its fine.</li>
    <li> Good mascara,  my sister loves it.</li>
    <li> I do not get my desired look from just using this. I normally have to use 4 different mascaras to get my desired look. now I only need to use this + Benefits they&#x27;re real! mascara. I like a full , dark and long look . not clumpy though. I enjoy the brushes on this &amp; seems like it will last a while. package was kind of beat up when it arrived but no damage to the product which is why I don&#x27;t really mind and am still giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received a used one with foundation on it. I couldn&#x27;t try it.  The product itself looked ok except for its a used one.</li>
    <li> It is fine, but I was looking for the one that had the no color base and then the black on the other end, so it really didn&#x27;t suit my desires.  Good for what it is though.</li>
    <li> The product Maybelline New York XXX 24hr Bold Mascara was O.K. To me it did not give me the long or  volume lashes that it promise it would give. But as far as the product being delivered on time or before time, I have no complaints, the delivery time was great the packaging was very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara while traveling and absolutely loved it. I seared far and wide at all my local stores, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I finally reverted to my old ways of ordering online while stationed overseas, and BAM! I found it :) Sooo happy over this find!!</li>
    <li> I liked thus mascara it made my lashes look nice and full! And it didn&#x27;t flake on me! Also the color is really black so it will definitely darken your lashes :)</li>
    <li> Best department store mascara ever! Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Definitely would recommend. Hope it can be purchased in the future as there is always new but not always improved.</li>
    <li> the mascara makes my eyelashes big and beautiful, I have people comment on my eye makeup all the time. Thanks</li>
    <li> I personally dont like the mascara. It makes my eyelashes clump up.</li>
    <li> I got this for my cousin. She never complained about it. So, I assume it is good stuff. I guess so.</li>
    <li> I always go back to this mascara.Makes lashes long,fluttery &amp; voluminous.It holds up well ALL day,the most true black mascara you will find for this price.Washes easily with oil based make up remover or make your own with equal parts witch hazel &amp; extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> Works great I love it</li>
    <li> I love it nice color and was perfect for my boy room!!</li>
    <li> I orderd 2 units of this mascara and found one of the packages encasing the mascara was already opened. It then made sence why there was not alot of mascara on the wand!!!!!!!!  I immediately threw it out. Guess I will not order personal products on line ever again :(</li>
    <li> It does last 24 hours and minimal smudges and flaking.  As far as lengthening the lashes, its ok at that, not that much longer then before.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It&#x27;s DEFINITELY not waterproof, so make sure that you prime and apply properly, and stay out of the rain. But it makes my eyelashes POP, and it lasts a good long while - I usually give out long before it does.</li>
    <li> not high end quality, but pretty good and lasts a whole day without smudge/clumping.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for. I need something to lengthen and give volume. This colors lashes very well but doesn&#x27;t bring much length or volume.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> Excellent online deals and pricing.  John b box bggvbbbcxd tech. :/ B-)  Bob b. v g v. :/  Bbod. b</li>
    <li> When I saw this low price, I was so excited I ordered 2. This is the mascara I use, and have used for probably 4 years now. However, I now see why the price is so low! The mascara smelled fine and looked fine, but it went on clumpy and thick. I opened the other tube, and same thing. It had obviously been sitting around for probably years. It was too much trouble to send back, so I tossed both tubes. Usually this is great mascara. I will continue to buy it at the store, but will never order online again. At least not from this seller!</li>
    <li> love love love this mascara, works great</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting this anywhere else.  It is a Godsend to finally get it again.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I finally found a mascara that works terrifically for me! However, I believe I read somewhere that it&#x27;s soon going to be discontinued. No wonder the price has jacked up...guess I&#x27;ll be looking for a new Maybelline mascara.</li>
    <li> Work just like they said it would.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge and makes my eyelashes look great! Love that you can use just one (#1) or both (#1 &amp; #2).  Great look!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a drug store months ago and loved it. When I went back for more I could not find it anywhere, it has been discontinued. I did find it on Amazon. If I did not worry about it getting old I would go ahead and buy up all they have left. Isn&#x27;t that the way it goes? Just time you find the perfect makeup for you it gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is not what I was looking for at all.  Guess I didn&#x27;t read the pkg carefully enough.  I wanted the XXL with white conditioning mascara on one end.  Instead I got black on both ends.  It rubs off on my brow bone. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> The product was what I needed at a great price and the shipping was very quick!  I would recommend this to friends and sisters!!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> very bold. arrived sooner than expected. wish it was water proof and it starts to flake off by the end of the day but definitely worth the $.01 I spent on it!</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t agree with my eyes. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to something in the mascara. It does come off easily with water &amp; cold cream make up remover. Other wise I would have purchased another as it does make your lashes longer &amp; fuller. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara. i alwasy buy their double sided mascara. It really holds and maintain its shape. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara everyday! Too bad the price went up so high. :((</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this on amazon.</li>
    <li> Ok I like it this is the first time I bought this it has two brush it look very pretty on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Definitely going to be repurchasing.  This product is AMAZING on my lashes and really gets every last lash and lasts for the whole day.  Very buildable.  I would totally recommend, i love this product</li>
    <li> This is my daughters favorite mascara, which we all know when you finally find one you like, then they discontinue it, its horrible.&lt;br /&gt;So we stocked up&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Emma and her mom</li>
    <li> I should have known better....I paid only about $3 (and free shipping and handling) but this product sucks. The brushes are tiny, the packaging is YELLOWED, as if it&#x27;s 20 years old, and it smells funny....again, smells old. The wands are tiny and the product doesn&#x27;t apply to my lashes. I was wondering if this product was discontinued, and if so, why are they still selling it? Too much trouble to send back.</li>
    <li> Great price for mascara. Bold a and beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> The texture is garbage..clumpy and dry. Probably more than a few months (years??) old. I dunno. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this brand and particular one since it came out and i noticed stores don&#x27;t carrry it anymore. when i found this online, i was excited</li>
    <li> I was sad when I realized this was discontinued, but very happy to find it here. I ordered four to stock up!</li>
    <li> I love this because I can go out in just foundation and this....and look like a natural beauty ....score</li>
    <li> This has never happened before. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any other eye makeup. I used this mascara and my eyes burned. When I looked in the mirror, they were completely bloodshot. I thought it was allergies or perhaps something I had done. It cleared up within 2 days. Then I wore the mascara again a few days later and it happened again. I ended up tossing it out, since that was awfully painful and not worth it. Not sure why this happened, but it hasn&#x27;t happened since with any other brand.</li>
    <li> The product arrived broken. I can not take the brush out of the case. It Is broken inside</li>
    <li> This product is confusing, having 2 brushes and ends.  It didn&#x27;t tend to lengthen as well as other products, and it left dark smudges under my eyes after a few hours.  Would not buy this mascara in the future.</li>
    <li> I have always trusted Maybelline.  I have sensitive skin and allergies.  I have always thought of Maybelline as a pure and quality product.  After using XXL 24Hr Bold Mascara for a long time, I learned it was no longer in stores.  I was happy to find it on line.  It makes no sense to me why the company would stop selling this great mascara in stores.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store I tried Turbo Volume Express, by Maybelline.  Bad idea.  It has a strong chemical smell, flakes in your eyes and it is hard to apply.  Companies should show consumers the same loyalty we show them.  We will always try new products but would like to go back to the tried and true if we don&#x27;t the new products.  I hope Maybelline will put XXl 24Hr Bold back in the stores.</li>
    <li> I believe this is sold out at stores and is showing unavailable on the Maybelline website, so I was excited to find it on Amazon. I LOVE this mascara, tried others when I couldn&#x27;t find this and nothing compares, it stays on all day and night but comes off easily with eye makeup remover! It arrived a little dusty and beat up from Amazon, but the mascara was NOT lumpy or dried out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting step 1 to be a white substance similar to XXL Pro Volume which I have used in the past.  The bristles on the brush made it difficult to apply to get a natural look.  The name XXL Pro was misleading since I expected the brush and mascara itself to be similar.</li>
    <li> An easy application, the brush achieves great lengths in lashes.  Gives a full bold black look.&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens lashes easily, looks like your wearing extensions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 5 years, I love how the brushes don&#x27;t clump up my lashes. It works very well, but I think you could get much more bang for your buck ordering a mascara from Sephora or even Smashbox. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $8 for this product.</li>
    <li> Benn using this for about 2 years and would not ue anything else&lt;br /&gt;No MAC no Chanel Nope not for me This will do great for length and volume !</li>
    <li> The maybelline New York XXL 24hour Bold Mascara, very black...sucks. I don&#x27;t like it at all. The only good thing about it is, it is very black. First, the wands are tiny small second, it clumps and makes the eyelashes look really bad. Third, from looking at the container you would think it came with alot of mascara but there is very little in the tube. Did I mention that it clumps the eyelashes and really bad. It just looks awful and I DO NOT recommend it at all to anyone.</li>
    <li> Its the best of The best, hands Down.. but the price went up WAYYYYY to much. It use to be  like 9ish dollars.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years. A favorite. I now need 11 more words to finish this silly review... DONE!!</li>
