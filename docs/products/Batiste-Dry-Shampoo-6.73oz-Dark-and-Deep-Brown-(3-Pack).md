      <li>Best dry shampoo ever.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo out there!</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have tried!</li>
      <li>It easily wipes away from contact</li>
      <li>Wipes off your face easily</li>
      <li>It doesnt have a strong scent (Dove and Tresemme about choke me to death with perfume) and absorbs oil all day.</li>
      <li>well with fine hair it tends to get oily quickly!  </li>
      <li>The dry shampoo from Batist works great, I love that it has a tint to it</li>
      <li>Never shows any residue, and keeps my hair looking oil free all day</li>
      <li>Its too filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>Keep my hair looking great between actual shampoos.</li>
      <li>quick I need to buy more of this stuff right now!</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best dry shampoo out there</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to skip a day.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it when my hair is clean to sass it up.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo gives my hair great body.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you apply it before you put a nice white shirt on.</li>
      <li>this step makes your hair look more shiny and natural and 3) always wash your face or use a face wipe to make sure the brown coating is not visible in your hairline, on your ears, etc.  </li>
      <li>It blends easily and leaves my hair looking fresh.</li>
      <li>Great dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this is the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff so much, I will buy again and again.</li>
      <li>I do like the brown better than the normal spray that leaves my hair white/gray.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite by far!</li>
      <li>An absolute necessity during Arizona summers!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a tremendous amount of greys but this spray takes the color right off.</li>
      <li>Order it every month, definitely the best dry shampoo ever!</li>
      <li>It is just the right color</li>
      <li>so it blends right in.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the white film issue and it smells great, but it still leaves my hair sticky and if you&#x27;re not careful it CAN stain your hands, clothes, sheets, etc.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely continue using this brand, because I definitely haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be pretty surprised how easy it is to miss cleaning off the excess product from your neck and hairline.</li>
      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos, and this one has been my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Works very well for darker hair but strips the hair color from my roots and exposes my freshly colored greys.</li>
      <li>The brown does show up on your face, hands, etc., so you have to be aware, but that is so much better than white roots!</li>
      <li>Batiste is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
      <li>They always leave my hair with a white film and the don&#x27;t smell all that great (and let&#x27;s face it, the point of dry shampoo is to refresh hair so that it can go another day!).  </li>
      <li>This sounds high maintenance, but I do all this in a matter of minutes and it saves so much time to not shower!!  </li>
      <li>I go through a can of this stuff pretty much every week.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo, but I give it 4 stars because it does get brown stuff everywhere when you spray.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>cause you really shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway</li>
      <li>It blends in really well and really does get rid of the oil.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and when I run out I will repurchase 3 again.</li>
      <li>I have VERY oily hair</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo if you have dark hair -- does not leave white powder showing as it is colored brown.  </li>
      <li>It works really well, smells better than a lot of the other products and does not leave any sign of product in my hair because of the color.</li>
      <li>So happy I found the dark version of the batiste dry shampoo!  </li>
      <li>This stuff REALLY does absorb excess oil extremely well, and it makes my hair look fresh and clean all while smelling really good compared to some other dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the bottle next to a full size lighter to show the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t make my dark brown hair look lighter at the roots.  </li>
      <li>Just do this first, then clean face/neck with a wet wipe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; not thick &amp; heavy feeling like many similar products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Batiste dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers are correct about brown spots, but it&#x27;s so easy to wash them off with just water.</li>
      <li>Great for darker hair that goes grey when using other dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>If my hair is really oily all over, it won&#x27;t work as well, but I&#x27;ll usually just put my hair up in that case and it looks fine.</li>
      <li>we both have fine texture hair and beautician suggested we not wash our hair everyday...</li>
      <li>It also has the added bonus of making my fine hair look thicker, both by absorbing the oil and by subtly coloring my scalp in thinner areas hiding places where Ive lost hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is hands down my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>The other ones tend to leave my roots white, so this one, with a little bit of brown coloring in it, makes it so much better!</li>
      <li>But man, it is a VERY dark spray, so I would definitely NOT apply it while wearing any light clothing, and I wrap a crappy towel around my neck when applying.</li>
      <li>My hair dresser recommended that I use a dry shampoo because my hair tends to get very oily at the roots.</li>
      <li>1) go in your shower to spray it on your hair, before you have gotten dressed for the day 2) after letting it sit on your hair for a few min and absorb oil, brush through it, then take off the excess by rubbing your hair with a lightly damp towel (I keep an extra hand towel for this that I don&#x27;t mind getting</li>
      <li>Love this dry shampoo for my dark hair!!</li>
      <li>The only dry shampoo that really works!</li>
      <li>If not careful, the brown will spread.</li>
      <li>I do have to be careful not to run my hands through my hair too much on the days that I use it because the color can come off on the fingernails.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people give this crap 5 stars.  It leaves dark brown spots of residue everywhere and makes a mess of my manicure and my bathroom.  It&#x27;s hard to wash off.  My face looks like I&#x27;ve smeared dirt on it.  The color isn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; either, it just makes my dark brown hair look dull and mousy.  The only good thing about this is the smell.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> leaves a dark brown residue everywhere!</li>
    <li> The only dry shampoo that really works!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It blends easily and leaves my hair looking fresh. I buy it in packs of 3 and keep one at work and one at home.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo out there! I highly recommend  this dry shampoo! It absorbs the oil and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily, like some have in the past. It even gives my hair some texture and grip which makes styling easy!</li>
    <li> only dry shampoo that works, tint prevents ashy/white look</li>
    <li> I go through a can of this stuff pretty much every week. It comes out dark so you don&#x27;t get the white residue. Just make sure you apply it before you put a nice white shirt on.</li>
    <li> Great for darker hair so you can&#x27;t see the white residue</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Batiste dry shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands, but always come back. Keep my hair looking great between actual shampoos. Give great body and texture. This dark tinted one has the added bonus of hiding grow out if you have your hair dyed dark like mine. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo if you have dark hair -- does not leave white powder showing as it is colored brown.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have really fine, thin hair that gets extremely greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it one day. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to skip a day. Since it has the hint of brown, it doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue that either looks gray or like dandruff. It blends in really well and really does get rid of the oil. If my hair is really oily all over, it won&#x27;t work as well, but I&#x27;ll usually just put my hair up in that case and it looks fine. Other reviewers are correct about brown spots, but it&#x27;s so easy to wash them off with just water. This is hands down 100 times better than any other dry shampoo out there. It&#x27;s expensive and it goes quickly, but I always have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> both my daughter and I can not live without this product!  we both have fine texture hair and beautician suggested we not wash our hair everyday...well with fine hair it tends to get oily quickly!  but with this dry shampoo we don&#x27;t have too!  and also we wont have the white residue like the other dry shampoos have!  it&#x27;s made for dark hair!  awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much, I will buy again and again. I can&#x27;t stand any of the other dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best dry shampoo out there</li>
    <li> So happy I found the dark version of the batiste dry shampoo!  This stuff works great - much better than some of the higher priced ones i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product,  love that it has some color so it blends, and it does rub off like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great dry shampoo! Never shows any residue, and keeps my hair looking oil free all day (:</li>
    <li> Batiste is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. Their regular formula leaves my dark brown hair looking lighter at the roots, so I tried this darker color. It matches well, but it does leave a brown residue that will rub off onto my hands and clothes. I have been using a washcloth to rub off some of the color, as I worry it will transfer onto clothes. I would give this product 5 stars if they could make the color not rub off onto my hands!</li>
    <li> it was almost like mud,, dried and flaked</li>
    <li> The dry shampoo from Batist works great, I love that it has a tint to it so my brown hair never looks white, but I have a few gripes: the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, yet sometimes I still feel like there&#x27;s product left in the bottle. The color rubs off on my fingers and forehead. After about 5 minutes, it seems to stick to my hair, but before that watch out!</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s light &amp; not thick &amp; heavy feeling like many similar products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and can&#x27;t get enough of it. Great for darker hair that goes grey when using other dry shampoos. It has a darker color that comes out so if you comb your hands through it too pump up your hair and are touching your scalp with your fingers just wash your hands afterwords otherwise you may get dark blemishes on you or your lighter clothing. It easily wipes away from contact but, I mean, it comes with the territory of using a dark dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Order it every month, definitely the best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> Love love love!! Gives volume with very little!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and they always look chalky in my dark hair. This is my favorite by far! Doesn&#x27;t feel gross in your hair either. It is tinted so be careful spraying it. Wipes off your face easily</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...it covers my grey roots before I have the chance to color, it adds volume and texture and helps hair styles stay full and thick looking.  It also does it job well as a shampoo/oil remover. Transaction was great and delivery quick I need to buy more of this stuff right now!</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a dry shampoo that won&#x27;t make my hair look grey and dingy. This product definitely has the darker color I&#x27;ve been looking for! But man, it is a VERY dark spray, so I would definitely NOT apply it while wearing any light clothing, and I wrap a crappy towel around my neck when applying. I also use wet facial cleanser wipes after spraying this stuff all the way around my hairline, especially my ears, after applying. You&#x27;d be pretty surprised how easy it is to miss cleaning off the excess product from your neck and hairline. This stuff REALLY does absorb excess oil extremely well, and it makes my hair look fresh and clean all while smelling really good compared to some other dry shampoos. I have VERY oily hair and I don&#x27;t want to wash it every single day because it&#x27;s very long and very thick. I will absolutely continue using this brand, because I definitely haven&#x27;t found anything better! I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the bottle next to a full size lighter to show the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have brown hair! The other ones tend to leave my roots white, so this one, with a little bit of brown coloring in it, makes it so much better! The brown does show up on your face, hands, etc., so you have to be aware, but that is so much better than white roots!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm for the day. If not careful, the brown will spread. Luckily it rubs off skin real easily.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever. I buy this stuff in bulk.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos, and this one has been my favorite so far. The tinted one will leave a color on your hands. So make sure you wash your hands good after working the spray though your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works great on my oily hair. I usually shower every day, but if I am unable to one morning I use this and I get through the day with minimal oils. I bought this 3-pack so I could have some backups since my sisters sometimes use mine, obviously making me run out of the product quicker. Shipping was fast and when I run out I will repurchase 3 again.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo, but I give it 4 stars because it does get brown stuff everywhere when you spray.  I do like the brown better than the normal spray that leaves my hair white/gray.  So these are my tips: 1) go in your shower to spray it on your hair, before you have gotten dressed for the day 2) after letting it sit on your hair for a few min and absorb oil, brush through it, then take off the excess by rubbing your hair with a lightly damp towel (I keep an extra hand towel for this that I don&#x27;t mind getting brown)....this step makes your hair look more shiny and natural and 3) always wash your face or use a face wipe to make sure the brown coating is not visible in your hairline, on your ears, etc.  This sounds high maintenance, but I do all this in a matter of minutes and it saves so much time to not shower!!  Don&#x27;t forget your deodorant 😉</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It sucks up the oil on my head so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday, &amp; it&#x27;s brown, so you can&#x27;t see it!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried! And I have tried a bunch! It is much easier to work in then a dry shampoo that leaves a white residue. It works really well, smells better than a lot of the other products and does not leave any sign of product in my hair because of the color. This is a great price for a pack of 3! This is my go-to product for dry shampoo. An absolute necessity during Arizona summers!!</li>
    <li> The hint of color gets on everything. Also,  I spray it my bathroom and everything has a brown coating on it. Not a good product at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use the deep and dark for brown hair. It smells great and blends into my hair pretty well. It last a majority of the day but by night my hair looks greasy again. This dry shampoo gives my hair great body. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it when my hair is clean to sass it up. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 bottles and have 2 on hand. I recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo for my dark hair!! There is no white, powdery residue and it helps my hair look amazing!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and I use this product to make my hair look thicker, as well as to extend the time between Washington.  I recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Altogether, definitely much more pleased with this product that I thought I would be.  I HATE dry shampoos.  They always leave my hair with a white film and the don&#x27;t smell all that great (and let&#x27;s face it, the point of dry shampoo is to refresh hair so that it can go another day!).  This doesn&#x27;t have the white film issue and it smells great, but it still leaves my hair sticky and if you&#x27;re not careful it CAN stain your hands, clothes, sheets, etc.</li>
    <li> I love that it didn&#x27;t make my dark brown hair look lighter at the roots.  However, it made my scalp itch, and when I itched it my fingernails would come back with dark brown under them, making them look really gross and dirty and it required a fingernail brush to remove.</li>
    <li> yes, it&#x27;s messy, but my hair isn&#x27;t white like normal dry shampoos leave it. Just do this first, then clean face/neck with a wet wipe.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hands down my favorite dry shampoo. It doesnt have a strong scent (Dove and Tresemme about choke me to death with perfume) and absorbs oil all day. The dark finish makes it less noticeable when you accidentally get too much product in one spot and brushing it out after you spray makes any errors in application invisible. It also has the added bonus of making my fine hair look thicker, both by absorbing the oil and by subtly coloring my scalp in thinner areas hiding places where Ive lost hair. I cant go a day without this stuff and it can be hard to locate in brick and mortar stores. This is my holy grail hair product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for dark brown and this was nowhere near dark. This product won&#x27;t work for people with black or dark brown hair unless you want to have a stripe down the middle of your head.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair dresser recommended that I use a dry shampoo because my hair tends to get very oily at the roots. It was getting dried out though because I was washing it every day. I tried a lot of different dry shampoos but they all left a powdery/ gray color at the roots of my dark brown hair. I couldn&#x27;t stand it! Then I found this stuff...and I LOVE IT! Now I wash my hair every other day and use this religiously. It is just the right color so it blends right in. I do have to be careful not to run my hands through my hair too much on the days that I use it because the color can come off on the fingernails. I figure that is a good thing though, cause you really shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway and it is probably part of the reason for the excessive oily roots.</li>
    <li> Works very well for darker hair but strips the hair color from my roots and exposes my freshly colored greys. I don&#x27;t have a tremendous amount of greys but this spray takes the color right off. Can&#x27;t use it.  May not be the case with everyone.  My hair doesn&#x27;t take color very easily. Its too filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> This stuff does smell really great and fresh; it also works well on my hair. However, it left brown residue on EVERYTHING, including my hands, under my nails, and the collar of my shirt.</li>
