    <li> Perfect for my oil samples.  Will be getting more. Love that they come with little Ziploc bags.</li>
    <li> Came with everything and was just as described. Very pleased and received my package fast!</li>
    <li> It came with the peptides and a mall cone and plastic bags. Neat!</li>
    <li> These came with everything included. There were a couple of broken vials but there were also a few extra to make up for it. They were just what I needed to sample out my perfume.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, shipped quickly. great value.</li>
    <li> They work great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again</li>

    <li> Best purchase! I was expecting just sample bottles and instead received: sample bottles, ziploc bags, funnel, pipette, AND water resistant labels. Also shipped quicker than expected. Thiscompany exceeded expectations and I hhighly recommend purchasing from them. None were broken amd these are PERFECT for sampling essential oils. -extremely satisfied customer</li>
    <li> These were a great value, and they also added two aromatherapy necklaces as a bonus! Some have complained they can&#x27;t get the tops on. You can. Just squeeze the plastic flange below the lid if they flare out a lot, then push them in. You want a tight seal so your oils (or whatever) don&#x27;t leak out.</li>
    <li> Came on time, nothing broken . Plan on using these to give out perfume samples</li>
    <li> Nice but way too hard to open/close. My customers were complaining they couldn&#x27;t even open the bottles.</li>
    <li> Cap has a tight fit. The seller included a pipette with a smaller tip than I am used to. It came in handy when transferring perfume.</li>
    <li> you cant get the tops on ,i had to cut them ,other wise nice .</li>
    <li> Very nice package with individual baggies, glass, caps and pipettes.</li>
    <li> Items did not come with tops as described in listing</li>
