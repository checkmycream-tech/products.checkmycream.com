<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This toothpaste is great.  It does take some getting used to.  The taste is unlike your standard toothpaste, but once you get past that, it&#x27;s wonderful.  My mouth feels very clean and the freshness lasts.</li>
    <li> I was using this product back in India and wanted to continue, this is different when compared to indian product but still needed to continue. I like it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t think my teeth benefited much from it. The ingredients are great but just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to the brand name toothpastes with floride again. Wonderfull taste and my teeth feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the best toothpaste around. The taste is great, it&#x27;s not gritty at all, and that \\&quot;clean feeling\\&quot; lasts for awhile, too! It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that is allowed in our house. A bonus is that it&#x27;s green, fluoride free and eco-friendly.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all. I began my search of natural toothpaste when I learned about fluoride. I also used to have really sore and red gums from time to time. This toothpaste was recommended to me because neem is supposed to be good for your gums. At first, I was a little wary because I thought the flavour would be pomegranate but it&#x27;s actually not at all, it&#x27;s minty like regular toothpaste but better! My gums haven&#x27;t bothered me since I started using this and I even noticed my teeth are whiter and always feel super smooth after brushing. Best toothpaste ever!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste I have found on the market.  Very happy it does not contain flouride!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, simply put. I have had bad luck with my teeth and gums. by 30 i was on a water-pik and spendy fluoride rinses and paste, to no avail.expensive perio-scraping every 3 months,(painful to boot). my gum pockets kept getting (slowly) bigger. was up to a 5mm gap at my molars. switched to this stuff and it felt great! such a menthol peppermint freshness that left my tongue looking pinker than i can remember, no sugary film. even woke up with a fresh feeling 6 hours later! had a checkup after 2 months, and i have no 5mm gaps now, all 2,3, and one 4! i only brush,floss, and tongue scrape now, no fluoride or water-pik! recently added neemtreefarms (go to their site, not sold here) neem bark and xylitol (from birch bark) toothpowder and my gums actually shine! try this combo for the healthiest, freshist feeling, chemical free mouth EVER. GO NEEM!</li>
    <li> Good tasting toothpaste, also feels like it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> Well - it is Herbal..I&#x27;m not impressed with taste. It&#x27;s minty, but got weird bitter aftertaste. It feels as if you are brushing with some sort of indian balm with mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said - i wont buy again. Also it says organix on the package but only few ingredients are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like long ingredient lists - god knows what is in it...</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this toothpaste as a request from my mom who has sensitive gums. She gave me a tube to use and coincidentally, when I asked my dentist friend which toothpaste he uses, he tells me this brand. I can officially say that it has been dentist recommended. Overall, it leaves the mouth feeling fresh and has been gentle for the sensitive gums. Also, the formula is without fluoride or microbeads</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural toothpastes and Himalaya Herbal is my favorite so far by a large margin.</li>
    <li> Great taste, soothes the gums, but after about 2 weeks of use I can tell this toothpaste does not clean my teeth well. Feels like I have fur growing on my teeth!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does what is promises you to do. It supports and cleans gums very well and is considered a strong antioxidant for the gums. I love the pomegranate smell, it smells so fresh. I do not use a big amount of it, just a tad bit and it cleans my teeth very well, these toothpastes defiantly will last you awhile. The texture is really nice, not too liquidy, perfect toothpaste texture. It cleans your teeth so well they even whiten alittle bit, not much, just alittle. I would defiantly recommend this item to anyone looking for a “healthier” option of a toothpaste</li>
    <li> I have been buying this organic tooth paste for around 3 years. Great product, no fluoride.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about three months now, and love it.  I picked it up locally at a health food store when I realized that the Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste I had bought online did contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate (SLS).  I&#x27;d liked a Himlaya Herbal makeup product I&#x27;d tried before, and so thought I&#x27;d give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very refreshing, but just be prepared that it doesn&#x27;t have that minty taste to it that we often expect to find in toothpastes.  After using this, though, my mouth and teeth always feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t lather or foam a lot because it lacks SLS, but I don&#x27;t mind that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works just fine on my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited that Amazon carries this, and will be ordering it on Subscribe and Save.  It&#x27;s a good toothpaste to try if you&#x27;re looking for something more natural.</li>
    <li> My regular favorite toothpaste was out of stock, so I went hunting for a new one to try and came upon this.  I was looking for a product made with natural ingredients, fluoride free, easy on the environment, and without a lot of synthetic additives or toxins.  I decided to try this after reading the reviews here.  My husband really likes it (and that&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars instead of 3), but for me, it&#x27;s just too foamy.  Maybe I&#x27;m using too much (?)  Other than that, it leaves my mouth feeling clean, is non-abrasive, packaged well, and though I am not likely to purchase again, it&#x27;s pretty okay!</li>
    <li> loving this product. The neem is the best for cleaning teeth etc. my gyms stopped swelling ofter 4 days use of this one. DO NOT BUY TOOTH PASTE WITH FLOURIDE. it kills your pineal gland. this stuff is much better, works better and does not calcify your pineal gland. fast shipping. good price. Ill be back for more.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year, hands down it&#x27;s the best, my teeth have even whitened and no worries about my family being exposed to Fluoride!!!!!</li>
    <li> In regard to Richard D. Johnson&#x27;s  post about this toothpaste containing \\&quot;nicotene\\&quot; (sic), the following is a response to my question to the company as to whether or not nicotine is added to the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your email and your interest in Botanique by  Himalaya toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not add nicotine to our toothpaste. You may find all ingredients  of our toothpaste on our website [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this answers your questions but please let me know if there is anything you would like me to redress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Ormstein MD, PhD, CTN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for a year or so. The problem spots in my gums that used to bleed don&#x27;t bleed anymore, and my dental hygienist has been very impressed. Also, my teeth are quite sensitive, so I can&#x27;t use toothpaste that contains sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have it. It also doesn&#x27;t have flouride, which is fine with me, but it might be a concern for some people. The price may seem high, but a little of this toothpaste goes a long way--just a squirt the size of a pea is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Very good quality neem toothpaste. I told my dentist about it and he was happy that I&#x27;m using natural product.</li>
    <li> I cannot go without this toothpaste I absolutely love it. I was actually worried it would not deliver 100% results but it sure showed me! Tastes fresh and does the job, even noticing my teeth lighten or whiten. Will never go back to flouride tooth decay causing colgate and others again. I encourage everyone to make the switch and save your teeth and your health!</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  My only concern, no flouride.  I will continue to use as I alternate with toothpaste containing flouride.</li>
    <li> The best of four non-fluoride (non-toxic) tooth cleaners tested. The NEEM is a natural anti-bacterial and I can claim not one cavity in five years. Do your research now to discover the toxicity of fluoride and why fluoride cannot prevent cavities in adults.</li>
    <li> To me, this is by far the best toothpaste I had ever used so far. It not only has neem but has other useful natural products, my teeth feels very clean and healthy, even after 5-6 hours after brushing my teeth. I am glad I have found this neem based (non-flouride) toopaste.</li>
    <li> This is a great all natural product.  I only use this brand now.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I shop a lot on Amazon.com and don&#x27;t normally feel compelled to do reviews, but having a mint allergy and trying several alternative brands, I&#x27;m in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Great subtle flavor, but still feels fresh&lt;br /&gt;Can really help break away at tarr, even in tough to reach places- my dentist always compliments my teeth&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;SLS free, so no aggravating cold sores&lt;br /&gt;Even comes in a travel size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s not on sale or in a value pack, it can be pricey&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find at local stores, even the Whole Foods of the world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great buy. I switched toothpaste for a few months because this was hard to find and my new buy just didn&#x27;t cut it! I had tartar build up, my teeth felt fuzzy, just couldn&#x27;t stand it. Now that this is back in my life I&#x27;m enjoying the clean feeling again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different floride free, natural toothpastes, and this one is my favorite.  My local health food store is often sold out, I was glad to find it here on Amazon,  so I could stock up and save.</li>
    <li> love the taste and squeekly clean after brushing.  The 4 pack made the overall purchase less expensive.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> With out the scary chemicals...taste is pleasant. Texture is good.  Teeth feel clean for a long time, even till next morning</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. Your teeth feel clean and your breath feels fresh like you used a mouthwash. All the ingredients seem to be symbiotic with our bodies so I am hoping for the best. I will buy it from now on.</li>
    <li> Good  product, quality and price.</li>
    <li> Not too minty &amp; not over-powering. I was a little leary to try this product, however, after using it I have re-ordered it &amp; it will be my &#x27;brand&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works better than just about any traditional toothpaste.  It has an interesting but enjoyable flavor.  Unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes, this one feels, functions and cleans the same as traditional toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and absolutely love it. The minty taste isn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of commercial toothpastes and the ingredients are natural. Also a plus for me is that it does not contain fluoride. A tube lasts me quite awhile.The packaging is really nice, too. The only thing that could make this toothpaste better would be a flip top on the tube (it only has a cap that has to be screwed on and off). The cap is large and flat on top so I can keep the tube standing up which does help to have the toothpaste always at the opening so the tube does not have to be squeezed.</li>
    <li> Not BAD different, just different. Texture is a bit different from mainstream toothpaste as well. Overall, I really like it. I feel good knowing it&#x27;s a natural product. Before I ordered this I was using Natures Gate brand and I would say I like them both about the same. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  all natural  and the answer to a non fluoride toothpaste</li>
    <li> Leaves the mouth feeling clean but not astringent. It is light and pleasant smelling and contains no toxic stuff. Very good.  I have now used it for 6 months and it is clearly the best toothpaste I have used. The frequency of inflammation of the inside of the mouth went to zero. Previously, I would need to use hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash to deal with a monthly case of gum inflammation. I stopped using it for a couple of weeks while traveling on vacation and developed a serious inflammation on the inside gum that has required spot application of peroxide for 2 weeks to subside. I am sticking with it and will get a small one for travels. Thank you Himalaya Herbals.</li>
    <li> They say its organic, but I dont think so. Also, this is not the very best of the Organic tooth paste available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, its more air than paste in the tube. Not buying again.... I dont see any difference than the normal Corlgate toothpaste.</li>
    <li> When I was in India, I fell in love with this line of products.  It is so nice that I can now order them online - it saves a trip to India.</li>
    <li> Has a strange after taste to it, but overall I like how it cleans.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> i started having reaction to floride and found out about neem through dr oz show, picked this up at Whole Foods and have been using ever since, and now much cheaper ...because i buy on amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste exclusively for quite some time.  I like it quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use SLS-free toothpaste because some assert that it reduces the incidence of canker sores in those that suffer from them.  Put quickly, SLS - sodium laurel sulfate if I remember correctly - is the foaming agent in toothpaste, soap and many other products.  However, it is mildly destructive to mucosal tissue.  Canker sores are opportunistic and exploit this mild insult to gain a foothold in ones mouth.  The absence of SLS, then, is thought to reduce the incidence of canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t any scientific data to support these assertions, but casual observance of my own experience leads me to believe that it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are many SLS-free toothpastes on the market, most are very expensive.  Some taste bad.  Others foam so little that it&#x27;s just weird.  One I tried suffered from terrible packaging that made me angry every time I tried to pull off the too-strongly-snapped-on lid.  (I think that was Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Too bad, I like the company and I liked the toothpaste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste may take a bit of getting used to, but now when I use regular toothpaste I become annoyed at the mouth-full-of-foam feeling it creates.  This product foams a bit, but pretty minimally.  For me it&#x27;s just enough.  Taste is unoffensive.  Price is, well, better than it&#x27;s competition and competitive for SLS-free toothpaste.  Screw on lid is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice taste and seems to do the job. Don&#x27;t brush hard or with hard bristles and brush your gums away like I did so many years ago. Dentists didn&#x27;t know how to tell us how to brush and with soft bristles.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!!  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34; mess&amp;#34; my mouth up and tastes good!  Awesome customer service provided!  They went the extra mile to get me the product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever tried.  Cleans no better than other alternatives available here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste! No chalky aftertaste and my checkups have gone great!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste quickly and completely cleans your teeth.  I love it and best of all its healthy and does not contain fluoride.</li>
    <li> Tastes great, no chemicals.  It makes your teeth and mouth feel really clean.  It seems to keep that fuzzy tooth feeling at bay for most of the day.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well.  I bought 2 sets (8 tubes). Now 1 year later the price jumped 60% - not happy about that!</li>
    <li> Not bad . A little &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; tasting . Also little too expensive .I only hope this product its organic as they claim .Some reviewers said that this paste still contains some harmful chemicals (check out the ingredients)  . I did a lot of research but I was unable to find something that&#x27;s 100% organic.Out of everything I found , this product,  seems to be close to a &amp;#34;mostly organic&amp;#34; product.Do not expect to get the freshness and white/ clean feeling you get from a fluoride and detergent  loaded  name brand.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps plaque from building up on teeth.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I have ever tried.  very natural, high quality. FYI, to make it even better, add some peppermint, spearmint, and oregano oil for more menthol and antibacterial action. PRO TIP</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride and other harmful chemicals, the 4 pack should last me few months :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and it&#x27;s great! I introduced it to my family and they also love it, so from now on this will be the only toothpaste we&#x27;ll be using for years to come!</li>
    <li> First thing I like about this paste is it doesn&#x27;t have SLS/Fluoride. But, it looks like its not totally sulfate free - it does contain SCS - a sulfate pdt derived from Coconut oil. While SCS is not harmful as SLS/SLES, it is still sulfate. Ppl who are very specific about staying away from sulfate might not like it because of SCS. Its good enough for me.</li>
    <li> About 6 months ago we switched from the conventional toothpaste to Himalaya Herbal Neem &amp; Pomegranate toothpaste and we love it.  At first, after years of the overly flavored chemical ridden toothpaste, it took a little adjusting to the flavor of the toothpaste...I would say it was kind of barky flavored for the first week or so, but we quickly adjusted (have tried conventional toothpaste a couple of times since and the flavor makes us sick).  The neem toothpaste makes our teeth feel very clean and our gums feel very healthy.  We like using a product that is actually good for us, not toxic to us.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I tried so many of the fluoride free toothpastes out there, but this one is the best. We&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years and I don&#x27;t see us using anything else. Since we moved to another area of the state I either need to stock up whenever I go back to visit or buy it online. The price here on Amazon for the 4 pack costs less than the health food store back home.</li>
    <li> i was getting natures gate tooth paste, i tried this stuff and i don&#x27;t know which i liked better i&#x27;ll prob pick up more natures gate stuff after this runs out</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It leaves me feeling fresh and clean like no other product.  I have no scientific proof but my teeth just feel cleaner when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product images don&#x27;t show it but each tube comes in its own box that you can use to wrap little gifts.  When you peel the label off, you&#x27;re left with a corrugated cardboard box.  Slap a bow on it and you have a gift wrap with an all natural vibe and an interesting texture to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging and super fresh product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the toothpaste very much (and the packaging is artful), but the foil seal on the tube is a pain in the arss. It is not possible to remove it completely and fragments get into the toothpaste. Please Himalaya people, you can do better than that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user, so I can&#x27;t comment on any big improvement, but my teeth feel cleaner and my gums hardly bleed anymore.</li>
    <li> best toothpaste ever! Great price,too!</li>
    <li> this is a good product</li>
    <li> My husband likes the taste and has had a big reduction in canker sore outbreaks (supposedly as this is a non SLS toothpaste)</li>
    <li> Great Toothpaste! Healthy, destroys bad breath gets rid of plaque &amp; tongue coating over time. Most importantly: No Poison Flouride or other ingredients!</li>
    <li> Nice and am stocked up but will be getting more</li>
    <li> Bought this about 2 weeks ago. I love the mild flavor. It&#x27;s not that over powered mint that burns like the common tooth pastes have. This seems like one of the purest tooth paste on the market.I don&#x27;t like chemicals I can barely pronounce in anything that goes into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I like the packaging. The cap is big and easy to twist on and off. They put alot of thought into this.</li>
    <li> We switched from our regulars (really anything on sale at the time) to this and haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s not very minty or sweet, so if you enjoy the candy-peppermint flavor of the traditional toothpaste, it may take a little getting used to. That being said, it is palatable but doesn&#x27;t taste like pomegranate at all. (Though I think that would be delicious!)&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of foreign chemicals on my gums, especially fluoride, and the 4-pack was very affordable and convenient. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. There was another toothpaste that I used for many years, and I loved it. But this toothpaste is even better!!! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the BEST toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried them all, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Desert Essence..you name it I&#x27;ve pretty much tried it.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Himalaya Herbal Toothpaste exceeded expectations, as when I brushed my teeth with it, they felt a lot cleaner that they did with traditional toothpaste; therefore, I would consider it a superior product.  In my opinion it deserves five stars, except it is a greyish color.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with all the dental health promoting ingredients such as pomegranate, neem, coconut oil as well as salt. Though it lacks in fluoride (for strong teeth) you can always use fluoride rich mouthwash to complement it.</li>
    <li> I am using this toothpaste as I have burning mouth syndrome and wanted to see if stopping using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste would help.  It has helped a little and now I like it so much that I am not using anything else.  Great Amazon price too compared to Vitamin Cottage</li>
    <li> My new toothpaste . . . and it&#x27;s without Fluoride . .&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the taste is right as well. I reorder about twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Is &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; !?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (commonly known as SLS) is a widely used and inexpensive chemical . .&lt;br /&gt;found in many mainstream personal hygiene products such as shampoos, toothpastes, mouthwashes, bodywash, and detergents . .&lt;br /&gt;. . along with Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) and Ammonium Laurel Sulfate (ALS).&amp;#34; ([...]) . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill B Toothie . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural toothpastes (XyliWhite, PerioBrite, Tom&#x27;s) in search of something that helped with my dry mouth.  I don&#x27;t have severe dry mouth but I do feel my tea fiendish ways cause my above average dry mouth issues.  I picked this toothpaste up from the store on a whim.  I liked the packaging (:)) , was curious about neem and especially love xylitol gum...so I thought why not try it in a toothpaste?  I had tried all the other limited natural toothpastes your standard generic grocery store offers as well, so I was not expecting much.  Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and happy with Himalaya&#x27;s toothpaste!  I like the taste (the neem?) first of all!  It&#x27;s a fresh taste that I can&#x27;t quite compare to anything else.  The packaging is good (not that it matters, but as someone who appreciates good design, it only adds to the experience), and, most importantly, this stuff seems to help with my dry mouth!  Win, win, win!</li>
    <li> Wow amazing service and great product</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of different toothpastes before finding this one... I wanted to avoid fluoride, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, chemical derived glycerins, and as many preservatives/artificial sweeteners as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes great, while still meeting all my criteria, plus it does a good job cleaning teeth! Neem is great, and Xylitol has actually been shown to promote healthy gums. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Great optional product for those of us who do not like to brush our teeth with regular toothpaste. This is a natural option that is worth considering.</li>
    <li> I am loving it and price was just right as I bought four.would definitely buy again from here.Himalayan products have always been nice to use except shampoo</li>
    <li> Love the uniqueness of this box and the green squeeze tube it comes in. Starts out soothing when you start and grows into a tingle. The taste I can&#x27;t place but it has a unique flavor, it&#x27;s not bad. Plan on keeping g this set on my prime save and subscription. Won&#x27;t use another brand anymore. They seem too harsh.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this toothpaste. So far so good. It really whitened my teeth, so I hope it&#x27;s not abrasive, but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem to be. The taste isn&#x27;t like toothpastes I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m fine with it. I drink tea and red wine ... so I wasn&#x27;t expected this to be a tooth whitener. I bought it because I was looking for something new as far as oral care.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I have tried other organic toothpastes in the past and was looking for one I used to use.  Came across this one and decided to try a 3-pack.  I love it, the best toothpaste I have tried ever.  My teeth and mouth feel so clean after using this. I will definitely be a return customer.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to find a toothpaste that does not contain fluoride, DONT get this one. It is the most vile tasting stuff I think I&#x27;ve ever had. Since they label it as pomegranate flavor, I assumed it would be something fruity. Instead is is reminiscent of ipecac. The flavor is so gross and so intense, chewing a half a pack of gum wont get rid of it. Not sure if the product developers tried this out before they put it on the market, but, they should have to brush with it every hour and endure their own torture! Really nasty.</li>
    <li> I had to change toothpaste after being diagnosed with perioral dermatitis (no whitening or tartar control)... and this was definitely pricey... but it actually tastes sooo good...unlike Tom&#x27;s. And my skin prob has cleared up! :)</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It is a bit sweet, but the kids like that and it motivates them to brush more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for natural alternatives to any product and this toothpaste does not disappoint. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now. My teeth feel clean, the taste is nice, and my gums feel good. I think I converted my boyfriend into using it, too - he swore by Tom&#x27;s, which I am not a big fan of.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy reading the ingredients and not feeling like I&#x27;m part of some scientific experiment.  My teethe and gums feel great.  I&#x27;m always looking for a better product so if you think you know a better toothpaste then please let me know!</li>
    <li> I do like the toothpaste, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I would prefer more of a minty taste.  I think it cleans well and my gums feel healthy. I normally have some bleeding of my gums occasionally  I have not seen that since I started using natural toothpaste. I do like the way it cleans my teeth, they feel smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural toothpaste for 2 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything you can imagine. My 3 kids and husband refuse to use anything that isn&#x27;t like the conventional toothpaste they are used to. I slipped this stuff into the bathrooms and no one ever made a peep about it! Mama&#x27;s happy!! Clean teeth, fresh breath, closest to conventional paste that I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
    <li> This healthy toothpaste has a great distinctive taste without the negative additives.  Leaves my and teeth mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. This is a pretty good price for it too! All ingredients are natural and it has a lovely taste</li>
    <li> I would buy this toothpaste again.  It has pretty good ingredients and the price was right!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with Himalaya Toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Never going back to another variety. Great flavor, gentle on gums. The toothpaste makes me feel like I am taking great care of my teeth.</li>
    <li> We really like this toothpaste! Cleans the teeth well, and freshens the breath! Also, you get a lot more for your money with this one than other natural toothpastes we have used in the past. This brand is our &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other toothpaste since I found this brand.</li>
    <li> I switched our whole family over to this toothpaste at the beginning of the year and have had excellent results!  It took a little while for all of us to get used to the stronger and slightly strange taste, but now even the kids have no problems with using it.  The proof is in the dental chair and I had an excellent check up.  The dentist asked what I had been using and when I told him, he said &amp;#34;well, keep it up!&amp;#34;  I definitely will.</li>
    <li> Its good quality but like Baba Ramdev&#x27;s product more than this. Wish you sell Baba Ramdev&#x27;s product with same price.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste!  Nothing harmful which is refreshing in itself, plus the flavor is refreshing.  My family loves it, and I appreciate the good price.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my mouth for years. I wanted to find a perfect, natural toothpaste to help with all my problems. After ONE week of using this?? I&#x27;m in shock. No more dry mouth, irritated gums.. the list goes on and on. Thank you so much for selling this product! I have since threw out ALL my fluoride toothpaste and vow to never go back to OTC junk.</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s healty and holistic and leaves your mouth more than fresh.  We&#x27;ve known for a long time that East Indians know how to stop bad breath from the herbs and spices in their food.  Takes care of odors left over from any foods you eat with a lot of pizazz and exotic flavors.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use something without floride or SLS, so I ordered this item.  It taste great and only a little amount is needed per brushing.  My mouth feels fresh and my teeth are clean.  Make sure you continue to brush at least twice a day using a good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I searched for a toothpaste that would not affect my sensitive mouth with a sort or &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; each time I used it. When I found this and saw that it was sls free, I tried it. I&#x27;m on my fourth 4-pack order now and I&#x27;m still very satisfied. I will probably use it for the rest of my life,</li>
    <li> I kept hearing that neem toothpaste was so good for the teeth and the gums, and decided to give it a try. I liked the ingredients in the Himalaya Herbal formula the best, so I chose that brand. I am so glad that I did. It is the best toothpaste that I have ever used. My teeth and gums feel really clean after using it, and my teeth look whiter. I even canceled my regularly scheduled dental cleaning because my mouth felt so good and the tartar is so much less now. It keeps it from building up. On my next visit to the dentist, I hope that they see the same improvement that I do.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste, after trying dozens of natural ones over time. This one has pure ingredients and actually freshens my breath and whitens my teeth far better than conventional toothpastes. I have had a couple comments on my teeth being white after I had been using it for a couple weeks. Husband and I both love it and will order again!</li>
    <li> GREAT herbal toothpaste. Your teeth won&#x27;t be as white as the top of the line brands that put bleach in them but it does clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had herbal toothpaste so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other brands, however I must say this is a very good toothpaste. The main ingredient in this is Xylitol which has been proven to keep teeth strong. Pomegranate is also one of the main ingredients and I must say my gums are no longer bleeding since using this toothpaste. I can tell the herbs and minerals are helping. My gums are no longer swollen and my teeth fell strong. While I&#x27;m not sure if I had any cavities before using this, I do know since using it about two years now I&#x27;ve had no cavities. The taste is very refreshing, and you can fell safe if swallowing any by accident since it&#x27;s all natural stuff. Cost wise is not to bad, you get four tubs for $21.00 which is about the same as if you were to buy four tubs of regular toothpaste with all the chemicals. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for herbal toothpaste. It&#x27;s very refreshing, good for your mouth and safe.</li>
    <li> I found out the hard way that Aspartame and Sorbitol give me massive headaches... headaches after brushing teeth; headaches after chewing some brands of gum; headaches after drinking certain drinks. We finally realized that my headaches were occurring after using and/or consuming products with these artificial sweeteners, and the stronger headaches were from Sorbitol which I read is in the Crest Complete we were using; once we focused on avoiding those chemicals, the headaches did not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These artificial sweeteners are pervasive in the toothpaste marketplace. A few weeks ago, as we were buying vitamins in our local VitaminShoppe, the store sales person said that she had the same issue and used Himalaya toothpaste to avoid the side effects of artificial sweeteners in other toothpastes. I decided to give Himalaya a try, and have had no ill effects from the Xylitol at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor of this toothpaste is very clean and crisp, and it does a great job of getting my teeth squeaky clean. We are on our second tube now, and the next purchase will come from here on Amazon as, given the deal in this particular listing for four tubes, it comes to about one buck less per tube including delivery.  We like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable, works well, tastes good and headache free, at least for me. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have experienced issues similar to what I have described, then I would recommend trying Himalaya toothpaste based on my experience with it. In the end, only you can tell if its OK for you, or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> Good taste and good for the gum. As it is labeled no chemical and all natural. I would recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> love that it&#x27;s organic with no junk, smells and tastes really good. My kids love it too, they call is &amp;#34;spicy,&amp;#34; I guess it is, comparing to the sweet kids toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Have been buying this toothpaste for a year or more. Could not find it, any longer in a few stores, took the chance that Amazon might have it. The product is refreshing, my teeth feel clean but I like the the it contain natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought one tube, then ordered 4 more. A very refreshing toothpaste with zero harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot as an alternative toothpaste to use instead of my usual Crest or whatever other mainstream brand.  The taste is very mild, kind of tingly, but overall very good for a herbal toothpaste, in my opinion.  The consistency is also fine, and I love the packaging.  Very sturdy and clean tube.  My only gripe about this, and why I took off 1 star is because it doesn&#x27;t completely feel effective sometimes.  For example, I&#x27;d use it to brush my teeth at night, but then in the morning, my breath is RANCID.  UGH.  So sometimes, I&#x27;d rather just use this in the mornings, and then Crest at night.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense, or if others have this experience.  But just something minor that I noticed.  Otherwise though, it is a really great product and I recommend to try it at least once.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after reviewing more than 20, was very happy to learn from all specs that this is SLS free, Propylene Glycol free, Fluoride free and was completely organic BUT what a great surprise when I received the product in my hand.  I saw Sodium Coco Sulphate, which is just another name of the old devil SLS.  I have 3 unopened packed and one opened for trying but what a waste of all the efforts.  I did not expect this from such reputed company who makes quality products in India.  I would recommend clients to look elsewhere and better check each and every word on the ingredient, and Google to know more about it before buying.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this toothpaste at our local health food store and then found it on Amazon for a much better price.  I love, love, love this toothpaste.  It makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean and keeps my breath fresh for hours.  I ran out recently and used my husband&#x27;s whitening toothpaste and it burned my mouth and gums.....his teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter than mine either.  There just isn&#x27;t any need for all those chemicals found in commercial toothpastes.  When I went to have my teeth cleaned I had less plaque than my husband did.  This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have that bright blue-white appearance or stripes of color that commercial toothpastes have, but it most definitely cleans, brightens and freshens my mouth as good, or better, than my husband&#x27;s toothpaste does.  I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone trying to reduce the amount of chemicals and synthetic materials  they put into their bodies.  Remember, toothpaste goes into your mouth, the same place that some medicines are given sublingually to absorb into your body.  Even though you spit out toothpaste and rinse your mouth you are still absorbing some of it every time you brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! The only way I know to describe the taste and the quality of this toothpaste. Teeth feel clean and mouth feels fresh. I like the fact that the ingredients are as natural as they are will continue to order..</li>
    <li> I should have looked at the labeling closer instead of the bold description of Neem and Pomegranate.  I can not use mint and this contains mint.  However, my family loves it and I think it has made a great difference in their teeth.</li>
    <li> I want to find out if anyone has had an allergic reaction to this product. Both my husband and I did. The symptoms weren&#x27;t severe at first, but within a few weeks of using this we noticed issues with our hearts: mine beating faster and his slower. Pretty severe allergic reaction. We have stopped using it, but was curious if anyone else had issues with this natural product.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste we have been using for the past 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste...and gluten free!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 4 years since i stopped using chemical toothpastes &amp; switched over to the natural ones.  So far this one is my favorite, because of the minty cooling affect, not so bad taste &amp; best of all it soothes my sensitive, sometimes irritated gums.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel fresh &amp; clean after brushing. Just a small drop on the Sonicare (bought it here on Amazon) and my entire mouth feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I like the 4 pack &amp; these tubes are not small like I get in the health food store either.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is my absolute favorite. I love it. You wouldn&#x27;t think a toothpaste is something you could be passionate about, but this one is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to stay away from conventional products. If you&#x27;re looking at purchasing this, I doubt I have to tell you why to pursue a more natural toothpaste. That being said, I&#x27;ve tried a few other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpastes, and found them unsatisfactory. The worst was when I made the mistake of buying Tom&#x27;s of Maine (from a brick-and-mortar store) once, when I ran out of this. I thought the Tom&#x27;s was safe and non-irritating. How wrong I was. Despite the one I picked up being free of flouride (which it clearly stated on the front of the box) it was not free of other junk. I failed to turn the box over and see it contained SLS. I don&#x27;t put that stuff in my hair, why would I put it in my mouth? It quickly began turning my gums red, sore, and they even started sagging and bleeding in places! Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally found this in my local Vitamin Shoppe, but hadn&#x27;t gone back because I moved further from the store. After my experiment with Tom&#x27;s went horribly wrong, I promptly got on Amazon and ordered more Himalaya! What a life (and mouth) saver this stuff is. My mouth went back to normal in just a few days! The irritation went away, the bleeding stopped and healed, and my gums are back to being firmly against my teeth like they should be. My teeth and gums are clean, feel good, and that \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; teeth feeling stays away soooo much longer with this stuff than with anything else. I assume that is because of all the xylitol preventing the growth of so much bacteria! Not to mention, no more gross taste with the other brands! Shipping was quick, they were packaged well, and subscribe and save is worth it for me, as I don&#x27;t want to run out again and have to pick up something else! I have noticed, however, that the name of the line went from \\&quot;Organique\\&quot; when I originally bought it, to \\&quot;Botanique\\&quot;. I can only assume that isbecause it can&#x27;t be considered completely organic, and they don&#x27;t want a lawsuit on their hands. Regardless, the formula seems the same, the ingredients are great and many are organic, and it&#x27;s still the absolute BEST toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. Try it!</li>
    <li> My daughter got me to try this toothpaste about two years ago. I love it. No fluoride, all natural. No tongue residue like with some toothpastes. Best of all, NO nasty chemicals in my mouth! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was sceptical to try, because Neem is very bitter.. but this one has no pronounced neem flavour at all.. it is very minty and feels real fresh after brushing.. many people may not adjust to the texture at first..(its not chalky or gel like) its more creamy very similar to sensodyne toothpaste. but it creates a good froth (like any other toothpaste) And cures bad breath and tooth sensitivities (hot or cold) upon first usage.. I have not been to a dentist with a cavity or toothache problem in the last 1 year (ever since I started using it).</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!  I get the best checkups!!</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste for those who have gluten allergy or sensitivity to regular toothpastes. Was skeptical at first after developing oral lesions (melanoacanchantoma) due to reaction to Crest toothpaste.  Lesions started clearing within a week of switching to this toothpaste. Will never use regular toothpastes again - TOO MANY CHEMICALS.  Wish I knew about this toothpaste long ago, but glad I found it, and very glad Amazon sells it!</li>
    <li> Its one awesome toothpaste. You can feel the freshness right after its use, I purchased it as a replacement to another paste and I have continually used this since then. It is natural and Ayurvedic, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I first found it at a local health store together with couple other brands. This one stood test with time and became my favorite with mild taste and teeth feel clean the whole day after cleaning, unlike other toothpaste I bought. Highly recommend! Neem is known for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year.  Like the taste, like the texture and really like that it does not have anything artificial in it.</li>
    <li> My kids love it now.  At first they were turned off by the taste, but now they all love it.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I do NOT recommend this product at all. I bought several packs of these, enough to last 1 year. Well, 1 year later I have multiple cavities. Sure, I&#x27;ve had cavities in the past, but it&#x27;s been several years (probably more than 5) since my last cavity. Suddenly I have more than 2! The only thing I changed in my daily teeth cleaning routine was using this product. I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old toothpaste and throwing the rest of these in the garbage!</li>
    <li> I love this company&#x27;s products. I have been using their toothpaste for some time and am very happy with it. It is great to find a company that uses healthy ingredients without the additives found in most big brand products.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has interesting ingredients. However, in the product info they don&#x27;t say that it is good for your&lt;br /&gt;teeth only that it is good for your gums. I am careful not to brush too hard or too long because it might be too&lt;br /&gt;abrasive. But I do enjoy using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I really thought I would never find a healthier toothpaste that actually worked since I just learned that Tom&#x27;s just sold out to P&amp;G, but I did and it&#x27;s even better! This has a great taste and my mouth feels so clean and fresh. I recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> After searching for a non-fluoridated toothpaste for sometime, I came across this product. I liked the taste, it was subtle and not over powering and allowed me to eat or drink shortly after without that awful taste fluoridated toothpastes usually give. My teeth felt incredibly clean without using a lot of paste on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after about a weeks use, my gums started receding! Most recession happened around a crown I have, and a small amount of dentine is showing, making the tooth and gums around it a little more sensitive than usual. I&#x27;ve since switched back to a fluoridated toothpaste and the sensitivity is going away.&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s non-fluoridated toothpaste with no problems and am switching back since my dental hygienist recommends that brand (for non-fluoridated toothpaste, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a non-fluoridated toothpaste, Tom&#x27;s is the best I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
    <li> Just have to agree with the reviews- this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It keeps my mouth distinctly fresh for a long time.  It has calcium carbonate also.  The only negative is that the thickness of the paste will create sort of a mess around the cap.  But this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy it. Googled and found out it has Carrageenan in it. Carrageenan has been found to cause cancer tumors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I like how it leaves your mouth feeling fresh.  However, I bought it because I&#x27;m having problems with my gums, and I was told that this toothpaste could help you with that.  I&#x27;ve been waiting to see how it works. I think that the bleeding from the gums has improved, but I really won&#x27;t know if it really works until I use it for a longer time.  They delivered the toothpaste ahead of time, which was great.</li>
    <li> No fillers and fairly good tasting.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes great and seems to have quality ingredients.  I am hoping it helps with my reseeding gums, will try to remember to update later :)</li>
    <li> I say David Wolfe on youtube mentioning Neem for teeth and gums. So I went out after some neem based toothpaste. I tell you my gums are doing better than with fluoride based tooth paste. Neem kills off what causes tooth decay. and is an anti-inflammatory. So neem brings down the swelling of irritated gums, namely mine are nicely no longer swelled up. I recommend this tooth paste and the capsule form of Neem for it&#x27;s medicinal use. This toothpaste does do the job and more as my teeth feel great, my gum are not irritated like they were before when I made the decision to try this more natural form of tooth care. Try it, you will benefit and you&#x27;ll recommend it to others. :)</li>
    <li> Best non-fluoride toothpaste I&#x27;ve used! Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product since it is made from organic materials and is great for anyone, even my 5-year old. It cleans perfectly and the freshness lasts a long time. Overall, I am happy since I can feel that I have healthy teeth and gums now.</li>
    <li> Been using this toothpaste for several years and love it.</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived in good shape and as advertised.  Vendor was quick and needed no prodding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product based on a guest on the Doctor Oz show, who practices a variety of herbal medicine.  I was interested in long-range dental care, as well as long-range skin care.  I have been using this toothpaste for two weeks now, and have been able to suspend my use of Sensodyne.  this may or may not last, but so far, it is great.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting more Neem products.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I will use!  Keeps your mouth feeling fresh, even after eating.</li>
    <li> I discovered a couple of years ago that the cause of my canker sores is the sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpastes. I switched to sls free and I stopped getting them. I bought this brand and took it with me when I went away for work for 5 months and I started getting them every few weeks again. Not fun. I thought maybe I was  wrong about sls being the cause but when I switched over to the Kiss My Face brand during a 3 month trip to Asia I didn&#x27;t get one canker sore the entire time. Coming home I used the Himalaya brand again and within a week I had 2 canker sores! This stuff definitly has it in it, I think just under a different chemical name. Another reviewer commented the same. Pretty disappointed and annoyed with this company.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste</li>
    <li> forget senosodyne, that stuff is crap and still not enough for my sensitive teeth- neem toothpastes work great &amp; this has been my favorite of the ones i&#x27;ve tried. took me a bit to try this one because i didn&#x27;t want a fruity toothpaste as the pomegranate suggested, but it&#x27;s not at all- just your standard mint flavor!</li>
    <li> I was so upset because we took a trip and I used all my toothpaste.  When I got back, I went to the only store that I know that carries it and they were all out.  I got on Amazon and found this and quickly ordered it!!!  It was here in two days.  Thank goodness.  I love this toothpaste and it does not do me good to go one minute without it.  I got four boxes!!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I bought one to try it out. I ended up buying a four pack to give some away, and keep the others as back up.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I always come back to these. these are the best. Gives a fresh feeling mouth, and no gum irritation after prolonged use of this product. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works better that any big brand and is cheaper. I used to have bloody gums after brushing. Not after using this toothpaste. this is definetly a winner in my book. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s some indication that Himalaya \\&quot;may\\&quot; contain nicotene.  Google is your friend in this case.  There&#x27;s a recent study that indicates some low levels of nicotene in Himalaya toothpaste along with some other Indian based brands.  You be the judge.</li>
    <li> Learning that the flouride in water and toothpaste is typically in the wrong form and, in fact, damaging to teeth, I tried this product and have never looked back. It greatly reduced the bleeding when I brushed my teeth, and whitened my teeth as a bonus - more than any other toothpaste short of those with the texture of sand. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic toothpaste that contains neem, which is supposed to rebuild and/or strengthen tooth enamel.  No fluoride!  Also, it tastes clean and fresh and leaves my mouth feeling wonderful.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this toothpaste for a few years now. I didn&#x27;t want anymore toothpaste with bad ingredients, especially fluoride. At first the flavor is unique when you&#x27;re coming from the artificially flavored name brands, but now it&#x27;s all we know.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love that this is SLS-free, and that it tastes great too. It isn&#x27;t overpoweringly minty which I don&#x27;t care for. It has a nice clean taste and leaves my teeth feeling the same.</li>
