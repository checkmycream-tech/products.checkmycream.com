      <li>Bought for the men of the family I was thrilled to find so many bottles for such a nice price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for me i have fine hair and prell</li>
      <li>Though the hair stylists at the salon where my wife gets her hair done trash-talk it, Prell has been fine on my hair.</li>
      <li>I color my hair and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>They dry beautifully and spot free (no squeegee or drying required).</li>
      <li>I love using it because the fragrance washes right out (I dislike odors) which indicates to me that it is cleaning.  </li>
      <li>They are mild and easy on the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>The original.</li>
      <li>That is the first thing someone thinks about when they hear about Prell, but there is so much more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Original Prell since I was a kid.</li>
      <li>I like my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>This is one shampoo that I have used since I was very young and have always liked it.  </li>
      <li>For a hard working man it&#x27;s the best shampoo for removing dirt and oils, Even works as a prebody wash,.</li>
      <li>The smell is a plus, it a good smell but not to &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for a teenage boy to use.</li>
      <li>This 5 Special Pack of Prell&#x27;s Shampoo (Classic Green)was for my lovely Maribeth(I&#x27;m bald).</li>
      <li>You want fresh, clean hair and skin?</li>
      <li>We were leaving on vacation and needed it quickly.  </li>
      <li>For me personally, I found it better to use this more as a clarifying shampoo…</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those classic products that has been around forever -- what more can I add?</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly - well packaged.</li>
      <li>I love this old style shampoo!</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
      <li>I love the smell but personally would never use it, as it is way too strong.</li>
      <li>It is the only shampoo, even ones made for oily hair, that keeps his hair looking and feeling great and soft.</li>
      <li>It is just great plain shampoo.</li>
      <li>I returned to prell right away.</li>
      <li>If you liked it back then, you will be so happy to get some and have the wonderful aroma that is missing from all these expensive brands we are coaxed onto buying now.  </li>
      <li>I checked Amazon and there it was, and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It cleans very, very well</li>
      <li>It is thick and lathers up great.</li>
      <li>So many other products are full of smells that I just don&#x27;t want from my shampoo.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s got long hair that he grows out to donate to Locks of Love.</li>
      <li>Original Green Prell is always safe for me to use.</li>
      <li>This is old fashioned and super high octane, a classic first manufactured after WW II.</li>
      <li>I have had a fear of head lice my whole life</li>
      <li>This and the concentrate are my absolute, unwaivering favorites in the whole world.</li>
      <li>Yes, it does remove dye really well.</li>
      <li>This product is much cheaper in bulk and lasted for well over two years.  </li>
      <li>Mission accomplished.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Product. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> The original. The best. The ONLY shampoo worth using....PRELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quote the great Jerry Seinfeld;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo if you can find it in stores!  We get it here on amazon since it&#x27;s difficult to find locally.  It&#x27;s one of the few shampoos that does not leave scalp dried out or leave a residue that looks like dandruff.  Clean rinsing shampoo!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m a granny who has always liked to play with my hair. I am the one who would experiment with wild cuts and crazy colors. To maintain my mane, I had to use a lot of products for both conditioning and freezing styles. The shampoos these days are great for hair that isn&#x27;t abused. They are mild and easy on the hair shaft. However, they aren&#x27;t as good at removing built up products as my old favorite, Prell. When I finally found a bottle at a local drug store, I used it and was amazed at how squeaky clean my hair felt. I bought all that they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did run out again, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So, I came to Amazon where I usually look for special things. And, to my delight, I discovered Prell in 5 packs! I must say, I felt I had hit the lottery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this for a daily shampoo for color treated hair, for it will fade the color faster. However, I use it once a week and use milder shampoos during the week. I also use it every time I swim in my pool. So far, I haven&#x27;t had the green/gray end of season color problems that I had in the past with pool chemicals building up on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a lot of gels, hairspray or other similar stiffening products, you really should keep some Prell on hand. It cleans very, very well and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo made: enough said.</li>
    <li> I am grateful to be able to still find this product. So many other products are full of smells that I just don&#x27;t want from my shampoo. All I want is clean and Prell does that extremely well,</li>
    <li> I retrieved the product box and it clearly states \\&quot;6 - 13.5 oz bottles.  Item # PR43013\\&quot;.  The listing on Amazon, states a 5 pack.  It would seem Medtech is advertising one thing, but selling another.  We received a shampoo bottle with a  damaged lid which leaked half a bottle of shampoo in and outside the product and shipping box, I believe the company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good price. Quite a few months of hair washing. Eleven more words required. Eleven more words required. Eleven more ......</li>
    <li> Its green and smells nice.  That is the first thing someone thinks about when they hear about Prell, but there is so much more.  I have had a fear of head lice my whole life, I have never had it but the fear is there.  Every other shampoo had me a little concerned, but not Prell.  With Prell I now can put this fear behind me, my confidence has skyrocketed, I even started swimming in public pools and at the beach.  People have stopped me to smell and touch my hair, all this attention is incredible.  If you have a doubt about Prell, forget it.  Make a move to Prell and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Original Prell since I was a kid. This just thoroughly cleans your hair. It does NOT condition, it doesn&#x27;t claim to nourish the hair. It is just great plain shampoo. I wish they would come back with original Press for OILY hair. That was the one they used to advertise to get your hair &amp;quot;Squeaky Clean&amp;quot;. Back then, they had Prell for Dry, Regular or Oily hair. This is the original Prell for REGULAR hair.</li>
    <li> Regardless of where I shop for basic household supplies, I have been unable to find Prell.  I love using it because the fragrance washes right out (I dislike odors) which indicates to me that it is cleaning.  If they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been around forever, and it remains my very favorite. I have purchased more expensive,high end salon products that do not do what this shampoo does for my hair. I have extremely sensitive skin, and trying even the all natural and organic brands, I never know how my scalp will react. Original Green Prell is always safe for me to use. I&#x27;m not sure why this is, since I&#x27;m sure there is some artificial coloring involved in its manufacturing process, but this stuff never lets me down! It became next to impossible to find on store shelves when my main source discontinued it, so I started ordering it here and it has been a breeze. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This is one shampoo that I have used since I was very young and have always liked it.  It is a great shampoo,</li>
    <li> This stuff takes care of a bad dye job like nobody&#x27;s business. The hair salon spent 3 hours trying to tone out the purple-y/red with minimal success. Left this shampoo on for 2 hours, my bad hair color is gone, and the fianc&amp;eacute; is no longer calling me Poison Ivy. Mission accomplished. That being said, definitely don&#x27;t use this stuff if you want to keep your dyed hair color as is ;)</li>
    <li> Bought for the men of the family I was thrilled to find so many bottles for such a nice price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the box it came in said &amp;#34;quantity 6&amp;#34; Which had me looking back at the listing several times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product that truly works on all hair types with a light scent.</li>
    <li> I like my hair clean.  Use with the Prell conditioner for beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo when I was in high school and thought it was long gone, but, Amazon has supplied me with this product and I intend to give each of my girlfriends who also used it a bottle.  The fragrance is just as it was in the 50&#x27;s, only thing is my hair is now gray, as are the rest of \\&quot;the girls\\&quot;.  Our hair used to shine when it was dark and we were young but what the heck maybe the gray will shine like silver. I tell you, this Amazon has amazing finds. If you liked it back then, you will be so happy to get some and have the wonderful aroma that is missing from all these expensive brands we are coaxed onto buying now.  If I can find Breck Shampoo I may have to get another case for me and \\&quot;the girls\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This and the concentrate are my absolute, unwaivering favorites in the whole world. You want fresh, clean hair and skin? Look no further. Smells great, lathers awesome, cleans better than ANY shampoo. I have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t make me itch. My hair has never been healthier. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that seemed enticing but was let down. I returned to prell right away. I hope they&#x27;re here forever. I have purchased through amazon and in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Prell for its texture and spreadability. I look forward to using it with each shower because it smells so good and cleans so well. I think it&#x27;s the best there is and is affordable and packaged for ease of use. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> My order was delivered as promised, packed well and it&#x27;s a great shampoo we&#x27;ve used for decades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Prell for years now. It has never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Low scent (nothing crazy)&lt;br /&gt;Generously sized bottle&lt;br /&gt;Great cleaning ability&lt;br /&gt;(Even better) it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or moisturizing sheen on my face or hair when done.&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch it will even make good shave cream!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever made. No fancy perfumes added, just does an awesome job of shampooing your hair, get it very squeaky clean. Can use a very small amount to make a ton of lather. These are large bottles for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this on MY hair (way too drying), but hubby uses it and it keeps his hair from getting so oily that the pillow cases need to be changed 3 times or more a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also AWESOME to wash windows!  I put about 1/4 c in a 5 gallon bucket and use a dustmop or extension brush to wash the outdoor windows (even second story), then hose them off (but don&#x27;t let the solution dry on the windows before rinsing)!  They dry beautifully and spot free (no squeegee or drying required).</li>
    <li> I always preferred how Prell made my hair feel (cleaner), but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in retail stores for quite some time.  Did the search on Amazon and to my surprise found that it was still available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I ran into was that the price was so reasonable that I had to buy a 5-pack to get the total cost high enough for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t need any more shampoo for a few years!</li>
    <li> I will be a Prell girl for a long time.  Love this product.  Cleans well and smells fantastic. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Hard to find. My local Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying it, as did RiteAid. I color my hair and it works just fine. Not harsh.</li>
    <li> I love this old style shampoo!</li>
    <li> My husband has used Prell for years and years, and swears by it.  Nice scent, squeaky clean.  It&#x27;s one of those classic products that has been around forever -- what more can I add?</li>
    <li> This is old fashioned and super high octane, a classic first manufactured after WW II. I love the smell but personally would never use it, as it is way too strong. However its perfect for my husband, who gets very dirty working in a factory, and very hard to find in local stores. It is available around here only at Walmart, but the price is quite a bit less than Amazon. We only go to Walmart a couple of times a year, so I stocked up today and probably would not repurchase here, unless we really needed it.</li>
    <li> Glad I could fine Prell again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo may be an oldie but it&#x27;s still great!  It has a great smell and washes hair well.</li>
    <li> Package leaked through shipping box.  Kind of messy.</li>
    <li> for me i have fine hair and prell just leaves it clean&amp;shiny&amp;soft when i get my hair done the hair stylest always tells me how healthy my hair is i tell her i use one of the oldest&amp; best shampoos still around!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use and he was almost out. It is not found in any of the stores where we live.  We were leaving on vacation and needed it quickly.  It arrived within a few days.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly - well packaged. good price and much easier than trying to find the few local stores that still carry this,</li>
    <li> By far the best shampoo for clarifying the hair! I have loved this shampoo since childhood! So glad to be able to get this great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for 40+ years. I have tried numerous others along the way and have always come back to Prell.</li>
    <li> Item shown is the  Prell Classic shampoo with the blue cap.  Received the Prell \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shampoo with the white cap. Product advertised is not the product I received.</li>
    <li> Basic shampoo that is no longer available locally. I have been using this stuff for about 50 years. Though the hair stylists at the salon where my wife gets her hair done trash-talk it, Prell has been fine on my hair.</li>
    <li> This 5 Special Pack of Prell&#x27;s Shampoo (Classic Green)was for my lovely Maribeth(I&#x27;m bald). She was unable to find this product in local stores(Albuquerque may be a large city--yet unless you want to live in the desert in a city with an inferiority complex forget finding some things you need). So Voila--Amazon comes through.  Amazing what you can find on Amazon at resonable prices.  This Prell product was needed to remove something or other, and it works.</li>
    <li> Classic. Just as good as it was 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> This product is much cheaper in bulk and lasted for well over two years.  Not many stores carry this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Well Prell is Prell, if you like it and have several showers this is the one for you. a bottle lasts forever. I rotate shampoos and I have always liked Prell. When I saw it here it was priced at the cost of one or two bottles. but before I got it they fixed the price LOL oh well at least at amazon you mostly can get what you need. (R Stones?)</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely cleans the hair extremely well, however, the downside is that it really drys out the hair with daily use and will cause your hair/scalp to be itchy at times and it&#x27;s quite bothersome. That is why I gave this a 3 / 5 star rating, because it cleans and lathers fine but is a bit too harsh on the hair when used daily. I like to use this product every once in a while to remove build-up in the hair from styling products, oil, etc…so I use this now 1-2 times/week…not every day anymore. Everyone has different hair types, body reactions, preferences, etc…but for me I just found it to be really harsh on the hair when used all the time. For me personally, I found it better to use this more as a clarifying shampoo…</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Prell Shampoo for decades.  For a hard working man it&#x27;s the best shampoo for removing dirt and oils, Even works as a prebody wash,. It&#x27;s really hard to find where I live in VT. Once again Amazon supplies when others cannot.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prell for many years. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo when I couldn&#x27;t find this brand in the stores. None of them were as good. This shampoo is excellent. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. Happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my son. He&#x27;s got long hair that he grows out to donate to Locks of Love. He&#x27;s hair is naturally the oily type and even though he washes it daily, by the end of the day, it looked oily. That was until we tried Prell. It is the only shampoo, even ones made for oily hair, that keeps his hair looking and feeling great and soft. I&#x27;ll never switch his shampoo again. It&#x27;s prell every time now. The smell is a plus, it a good smell but not to &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for a teenage boy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Prell since he was a kid.  For several years, it was hard to find in stores.  I checked Amazon and there it was, and at a very reasonable price.  I use it, too, along with the Prell cream rinse.  Great product!!  Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
    <li> It works. I mean, it&#x27;s shampoo. But frankly you probably are reading this review the same reason I was reading reviews before I bought it. Yes, it does remove dye really well. My roots are taking longer because I&#x27;m lazy and forget to really wash my scalp. So if you&#x27;re lazy like me, remember to get EVERYTHING. Also, it&#x27;s best if you use it as soon as possible. Maybe wait a good twelve hours after dying, but I waited a week and now it&#x27;s taking a lot longer. But yes, it will get the job done one way or another. Don&#x27;t be shy about shampooing twice in a day.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Leakage of a few bottles and one arrived cracked with half the content spilling into the box</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo for about 35 years. It is thick and lathers up great. I love the smell too. I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
