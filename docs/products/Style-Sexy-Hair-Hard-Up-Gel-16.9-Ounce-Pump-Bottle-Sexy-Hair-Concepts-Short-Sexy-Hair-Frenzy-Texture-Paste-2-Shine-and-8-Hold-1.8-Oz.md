<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This gel is the best and 1/2 the price than buying from a salon.</li>
    <li> Ideal if you want to same money when compared ounce for ounce with the squeeze tube that is sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair gel for years. It&#x27;s the best of all worlds... keeps my hair solid, even if I rub out all the shiny wet look it continues to hold the original pattern.</li>
    <li> The only hair gel I will use. This product has the perfect amount of hold without leaving my hair too crunchy. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of product residue like some other gels. I tend to prefer it in the squeezable tube, but I have enjoyed this bottle type as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It is also a great value. I would recommend it, it does leave your hair real stiff, but that is its purpose.</li>
    <li> The best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. This is an excellent product - not greasy at all and no barber shop smell.Terrific product at a very good price for the large economical container. Well worth trying if you&#x27;re the type who changes product frequently but  hasn&#x27;t found one you like well enough to keep purchasing regularly.  This may be your new favorite. I tried another reviewer&#x27;s toothpick trick and it seems to keep the nozzle from clogging.</li>
    <li> Perfect and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a gel that I was looking for for my stubborn hairs! The only down side is the aroma which is very strong and if you want to put on a perfume it would totally mask it. It was better if the company had a version without scent or slightly weaker scent. Overall, I love this product.</li>
    <li> good stuff, works well</li>
    <li> This is glue. Don&#x27;t use it on fine hair!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, holds my short hair up all day long, unless it is extremely humid, and in southern Louisiana it is always humid and don&#x27;t typically have a problem.</li>
    <li> Great price on this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great product, bad packaging.  The dispenser clogs</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Especially if you have am short hair and want to spike it or add staying power.  The holding power of this gel says 9 but I&#x27;d say more like 20 lol no flaking either</li>
    <li> Good stuff, never flakes, best deal here.</li>
    <li> This is not the real product. A watered down poor imitation of the actual product. I still had some leftover from my other container and it is not even close. It doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as well even after using twice as much as one normally uses.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair stiff all day &amp; night. Very light scent, which is what I need.</li>
    <li> My Hair dresser introduced me to this product.  Great product.  Holds and gives great shine.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Have used this product a long time - I have short, spikey hair style.  it will last a long time, also (this bottle lasts me over 9 months)</li>
    <li> Love this gel. I search all brands routinely for a good gel that holds and isn&#x27;t too shiny. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great price..Good Quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and love it.  It gives great shape to my hair and the control I want.  Highly recommend for short hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Im giving this 3 stars because the pump was broken when it arrived and some of the gel was seeping out into the bag it shipped in.  I tried getting the pump piece back on but I wasted so much gel every time I tried putting the pump back on.  So now I am stuck scooping it out.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product I have used it twice and its very thick, like cement :)  (I like that)  I bought this because they claim it does not dry or flake and after 2 uses I would agree so far no flaking.  Worked 24 hours straight and the next day my hair was still perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Still need to experiment but it looks like it goes on better if your hair is wet.  1st time i used it my hair was damp, 2nd time combed in much better with my hair a little more wet.</li>
    <li> It is the best hair gel I have used so far, it can hold your hair as you want</li>
    <li> Lives up to my expectations. I use a lot less of hair gel compare what I used before</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair product&lt;br /&gt;for the price we couldnt agree more.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever! My hair is short and need the extra stiff hold cuz its short... works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and for a spiky hairdo it is the best as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> The best goop for short hair!  I get that sassy look all day long with this stuff!  I usually put it into my hair after it&#x27;s about 75% dry, then blow dry the rest.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if I ran out!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Great price.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this gel and the pump is perfect and just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair in even extreme heat. I use this almost everyday now for a good while and there&#x27;s still plenty left.</li>
    <li> Work great, high quality, it will stay on your hair all day</li>
    <li> should saved my money. just my opinion.</li>
    <li> what can I say - it&#x27;s hair gel.  I can tell you, I always order this particular one though.  Good price, good hold, etc.</li>
    <li> Product was as desired,  shipped right away! Thank you! !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and it never lets me down, no pun intended.</li>
    <li> This product is great and keeps my hair hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No messy flaking.</li>
    <li> awesome product!!!  Once you put it on your hair, you don&#x27;t have to take a shower for 1 month because it will hold your hair forever!!</li>
    <li> Best gel you can get in my opinion.. I used lots of other hair gels for short hair and this one works and smells great!</li>
    <li> Works as described, no residue. Holds shape for a day.</li>
    <li> I just tried this gel as soon as I got it today &amp; the hold is not as strong and stiff as others claim it to be. Trust me on this. I am an asian guy with K-pop star like hair and I&#x27;ve always been obsessed with how my hair looks believing it really helps me look more handsome when I have cool looking hair style. I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products on the market including all gatsby hairwax, hair sprays by Sebastian, Bed Head, Big Sexy Hair, etc. As I was looking for a replacement for my hairspray to hold my hair in place, I came across this gel and wanted to give it a try. However, to my disappointment, this does not hold well. Definitely not to the extent the hairsprays do. It does give hold, but not strong hold. I will continue to use it though as hairsprays literally killing me with all those chemicals I inhale when I spray.</li>
    <li> Tried Crew and been using this gel for the last year upon recommendation.  If you need something firm this is for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for a mild hold choose something else.</li>
    <li> I found this a bit drying to my hair. The hold is very stiff and I didn&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling. Maybe better for short hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and the pump was fun. I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars because the product is great but not for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Hubby uses this. He has fairly short hair and this product really holds his hair up all day. He likes to spike it. This has a very strong hold. Although the product is blue, it dries clear. He loves the pump bottle as well; the only downside to the pump is that it is very difficult to get the last 1/6th of the product out. He will just remove the pump and dump the product into his hand at that point. Overall, the gel is fantastic and a great buy in this larger pump style bottle.</li>
    <li> Superior hold, excellent price!</li>
    <li> For the price the big box stores/salons charge you can&#x27;t beat the price and you get three times the amount. Shot in the dark when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual gel. Very satisfied to this point with no build up issues or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Keeps hair nice and in place all day long.</li>
    <li> Best price i can find on this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair gel for men.  It only takes a tiny bit and it holds without feeling overly stiff or sticky.  The pump clog does get gunky sometimes but if you just rinse it in hot water it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> this is great gel it held my hair in place all day and when it was time to comb it all out there was no white flakes..plus it also smells good. i will continue to buy this product from now on</li>
    <li> You will pay the same money in a salon for 1/4 the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered VERY good price</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Just wish it was easier to get the last-bit out.  I have it tipped upside down right now in my other one.</li>
    <li> Been buying this for years, only gel that works . This beauty salon quality. Smells so good too!</li>
    <li> Great hair gel - my hair dresser uses it on my hair when she is done so I decided to buy my own</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great value</li>
    <li> I have been using gels for the last 15 years, and every gel i used had some issue. Either they would become flaky and start leaving out white residue or they would not be strong enough. this gel can last a day or more, and it is not flaky at all. As well, it shapes up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the best gel i have ever used.</li>
    <li> This works great on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Best gel you can buy, a little pricey but theres nothing like it, i have thinning hsir and ot makes it look full!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair gel. Stuff is amazing. Never fails getting an order from Amazon. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great for me and have been using it for several years now;</li>
    <li> Definitely works as advertised. Dries very quickly and has a strong hold that lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes, and it washes out easily while in the shower. I usually wet my hair and apply the gel for a nice shine, haven&#x27;t tried using it on dry hair as others have, but apparently it works well also.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this...so...maybe a guy thing! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years and I love it... i love the big pump jar like this... its gel that keep your hair in place but its not noticeable really... you hair just looks kind of wet all the time... I would certainly recommend this</li>
    <li> Thanks foe such a great deal!</li>
    <li> No complaints here. Starts out as a thick gel, smooth and easy to work. Hardens after a few minutes. Solid. Invisible. Defies light rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash out: stays hard under water for a moment then dissolves.</li>
    <li> Super strong hold last all day. No flakes.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair-gel for men. My husband will not use any other kind, even more expensive kinds. It never turns white or flakes, and it always stays shiny and holds perfectly. A bottle this size, 16.9-Ounce, lasted him 6 months and he uses it about 3-4 times per week. The gel never got hard, nor did the texture change halfway through the bottle. The pump got clogged once, but that&#x27;s normal for any sticky product, including lotion. It smells good too, we love it! We only buy this size now.</li>
    <li> Really works for high mohawks</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and better price than retail</li>
    <li> The woman at the salon that cuts my hair introduced this product to me in the smaller tube which i quickly went through in about a month.  This is the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used, it gives quite a bit of hold, not too shiny or wet looking, and doesnt flake or dry out.  This is a great price per ounce and the pump works well.</li>
    <li> Last all day great product</li>
    <li> I agree with above comment..for some reason I scrolled down looking to see if this product was the same as another product I use but this had a different name. anyway I just happen to notice shipping weight says one pound. I&#x27;m like wait a second one bottle is even heavier than one pound. so I write Amazon to question before I buy thinking clearly by pic it specifically says set of 3. well Amazon writes back and says there was a mess up in the pic but in the description it was fixed to say only one bottle. she sends me a link of the\\&quot;newly relisted\\&quot; item and says it was all fixed. I click on link and nothing changed except the price rose higher. not even in the description does it state one bottle. I wrote them back upset saying that she lied cuz nothing changed abd even if the description&lt;br /&gt;did mention it only came with one bottle, which it doesn&#x27;t, how many ppl actually read the description of it&#x27;s the product they are wanting. another Amazon customer service representative wrote back again and said it was fixed and it&#x27;s NOT. AT THIS POINT I&#x27;M TEMPTED TO ORDER ABD MAKE THEM SEND ME 3 FOR FALSE ADVERTISING ABD LYING IN TWO EMAILS. THEY ARE LUCKY ONE EVEN WOULD GIVE THEM NOT ONE CHANCE BUT 2 TO MAKE THE ITEM ACCURATE.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> Glue for your hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Love the product but my pump was broken so I have to use its without it. But the product is great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, strong as h*ll, makes hair shiny.  Don&#x27;t go to barber, hairdresser  for haircut with this product in your hair or they will hate you lol.  It doesn&#x27;t sweat or melt out of your hair and it&#x27;ll take a torential downpour to ruin it&#x27;s hold but it washes out very easily with soap and water in the shower.</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing, Its very stylish and you can have your hair in any style with this gel. I bought this a couple months ago and i still have a lot left.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I was looking for. Great product, have been using it for years. Holds even in hot/steamy NY summers.</li>
    <li> I have tried every gel, pomade, fiber, spray and gimmick hair stuff on the market- and nothing compares to this stuff. Guys- if you have a thick head of hair, long or short, and you need it to stay put- without looking like complete douche- get the big bottle of Hard Up (level 9-10) and be done  with it. Not only does it keep the hair in line- all day- all night and into the next day ( if need be) NO FLAKES- no crumbs- no white hair gel dandruff all over your black shirt etc..and it washes out clean. .I could go on and on about it- but for real- it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Love this gel i bought it for many n still great</li>
    <li> Works great to spike up my hair without the flaky white residue that other &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; products leave behind...but just as strong!</li>
    <li> This gel always works great</li>
    <li> Hold well, keep my hair style for few days</li>
    <li> Best Hair gel on the market- If you dont want your hair to move. a little goes a long way and once its there it stays all day.</li>
    <li> Great product! I was skeptical about the price but this is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> works well and holds well</li>
    <li> Good quality product and good value.</li>
    <li> This review is only about a simple trick to improve dispensing it. Look at the other many positive comments for its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not use the gel everyday, you probably experience problems with the nozzle clogging. To solve that, take a round toothpick not the flat kind. When finished dispensing, take the toothpick and push it into the nozzle as far as it will go without excessive force. The next time you use it pull out the toothpick and the gel dispenses easily. Reinsert when finished. This works even if it has not been used for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the toothpick even if it&#x27;s used everyday. The gel can gradually build inside the pump. If it gets clogged the tendency is to increase the force which can damage the pump mechanism. Cleaning the pump is easy by removing it and immersing it in warm water with a touch of detergent. Pumping while under water forces water thru the mechanism, removing any gel. Clear it and reattach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 3/12:  Comment after using this second bottle. This is my second bottle and they changed both the pump mechanism and the gel. The pump appears to be less subject to clogging. The gel is watered down and flows easier. I will continue to use my toothpick but it may not be as important as with the older gel. It does take more gel than before but if you water down a product it obviously is going to take more to do the same job. It is a trade-off and maybe a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t advise when the changes were made as it has been several years since I bought the first bottle. Usually companies tell you when they make changes in a product. They make no notification on these changes.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll be a customer of this brand for ever</li>
    <li> Love that stuff, great for short hais. Also great in70 mile wind and the boat.</li>
    <li> As advertised, excellent experience.</li>
    <li> While I love the product for my boys, the packaging leaves a little to be desired.  The gel gets clogged and the pump no longer works.  However, my work around is to cut the bottle open and store the gel in a container.  I&#x27;d still purchase the product, I just do not count on the packaging to work outside of it being a vessel for delivery.</li>
    <li> Best gel ever for hot humid climates. Most gels stay sticky in hot and humid climates, like Louisiana, not this gel. Sets hard and stays that way all day long. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s hard for to fix my hair, but with this product, it&#x27;s in 1 minute done !</li>
    <li> love this stuff! great price and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Perfect...as advertised...fast shipping.  Thx</li>
    <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. The hold lasts for hours and when it wears off it does NOT flake like so many gels I&#x27;ve used. It just kind of magically disappears. My hair has been graying since I was 20 and I still don&#x27;t dye it several years later but when I put this gel on it makes my hair considerably darker, which is nice.</li>
    <li> My son is thrilled to have this gel - it works so well. And what a great price!</li>
    <li> One of the best hair gel for spike on front, just a little gel and it holds entire day. It will be at least couple of years before i will have to but it again since this is huge bottle, lol.</li>
    <li> Price can&#x27;t be beat, and the convenience of a pump container is handy.</li>
    <li> My son loves it!  It smells good and keeps his hair in place.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel ever made, been using for probably about 20 years now.</li>
    <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It holds strong with no flaking. I normally buy the tube version which is cheaper, but I like the pump dispenser better.</li>
    <li> Good deal ,fast shipped, thank you</li>
    <li> Best deal for this. Smaller bottles for much higher prices at the salon.  This holds very well and best when applied when wet.  Great for styling undercuts and slick/dapper look.</li>
    <li> best gel for strong hold that will last</li>
    <li> Both husband and son use the product with great results!</li>
    <li> This styling gel is not hard and sticky, yet it holds up all day long.  It is also odorless.  Pricing is the best around!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Have used it for years.  This is the best price I have found.  The reason I love this product is the hold is awesome and it has yet to get flaky by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair gel. It has just the right amount of firm hold without being flakey. He is pretty picky about his hair products, but he loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for 10 years and it has the best hold ever!  It&#x27;s like super glue for your hair.</li>
    <li> It is confusing, you think you will get 3 as in the picture, and you get one. In the price i had in my hairdresserstore and pass just to nuy hete.</li>
    <li> Expensive...But the best on the market. Use a nickel size worth of gel goes a long way and holds all day. Been using for a long time, but just found  out about the pump.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> when I purchased this several months ago, the picture stated that 3 were supposed to be shipped.&lt;br /&gt;the picture was very deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, the gel is good, came in a box that was bigger than it was supposed to be, but there was enough air cushions to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any problems with the gel itself but I have a problem with the way the seller advertised and shipped this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using this for about 4 years now.  It sets up my short hair quickly and it also rinses out fast.  It is defiantly cheaper to buy on amazon than in a salon.  Also has a great scent!</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair in place through almost anything.  Love it!  The price is great too for the quantity you get compared to salons.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, AND WAS DELIVERED ON TIME. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Sexy Style Hair by my sister that received a sample from the salon. I tried it during a heatwave and my hair did not budge. The next morning it was still in my hair and all I needed was to style with a little water. I was so impressed by this hair gel that I even decided to try a Mohawk one day and it stayed perfectly straight for the entire day.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gel, and this is a great price!</li>
    <li> The US Military should require all active duty soldiers to wear this in their hair because it&#x27;s bulletproof.</li>
    <li> The pump cam broken off, and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> easy to use and great producted</li>
    <li> Holds my hair up real nice. Wife loves the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cheap gels from local stores, but they always make my hair feel greasy later in the day and flake off in white fibers.  They also exacerbate my dandruff.  This gel does not have that problem.  Judging from the drippings on the top of the bottle, when dry, it feels more like rubber.  Also, I use less gel with this product than the cheap stuff that doesn&#x27;t hold well no matter how much I put in my hair.  With this gel, I can use a jelly-bean sized amount, spread it over my fingertips, and apply tiny amounts in focused areas (right where I part my hair and in the front by the hairline).  It works best right after a shower. This keeps my hair in control all day.  Did I mention that I have coarse Asian hair?  I haven&#x27;t had a gel this effective since the 1990s when I used an expensive Redken product.  This one is much better, and better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in recent years.  Another reviewer was right: you should use a toothpick or such to plug the dispenser, or else the gel will dry within it.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best hair gel I have ever used. The holding power of this gel is great. At the haircuting salons they charge $30 or more for this and to find it on amazon for half the price is awesome. When this runs out I will definitely buy again. The hold power is very strong a little bit will go a long ways.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair. I was using Gelwhip which changed its formula sometime early 2014 and is terrible now, came across this. It works great, holds your hair in any direction, but it&#x27;s really stiff when it dries. For now this is my replacement till I find something better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m 45 years old and have used this stuff for 10+ years. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I add water when it gets low to make it S-T-R-E-T-C-H and go farther. I don&#x27;t travel anywhere without this -- nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> best gel  out there for my hair. ! strong hold , sweet smell, and stays in the pool!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Pay more in drugstore for a third of the amont.</li>
    <li> Works great and so much cheaper than the little tubes. This is the best hair gel on the market and holds hair in place and gives a great shine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this product from start to finish, easy to use, easy to style, I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My 11 year old loves it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!! This will last him four months! You only need a very small amount!</li>
    <li> Great price, holds my kid&#x27;s hair up nicely!</li>
