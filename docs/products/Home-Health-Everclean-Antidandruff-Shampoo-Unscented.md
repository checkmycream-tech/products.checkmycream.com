<ol>
      <li>Very happy about this product.</li>
      <li>This product is very good for him.</li>
      <li>it works great.</li>
      <li>Great product since it is unscented</li>
      <li>For anti-dandruff it works great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>They are both great products with no scent at all.</li>
      <li>And the added bonus that is unscented (I must use all unscented products for work) makes it even better!!</li>
      <li>This product works but the feel is not as good as Head and Shoulder brand.</li>
      <li>Really good product.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is good.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance free makes it more awesome.</li>
      <li>I love that this is unscented and it works!</li>
      <li>The ingredients are also pretty great as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>I hoped for more lather.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, cleans my scalp without drying.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for products to relieve some of the many symptoms.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have dreamed of a better product.</li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every anti-dandruff shampoo out there and this works just as well, or better, than all of them.  </li>
      <li>I love the lather and the way it leaves my hair feeling</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t solve the problem but it is a lot better.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a better product.</li>
      <li>He is willing to accept that with the good results he gets.</li>
      <li>I love what it does to my hair, leaving it very clean and light feeling, not to mention taking care of the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>she has to use products that are perfume/dye free.  </li>
      <li>Just use a scent free conditioner after this product and all will be well.</li>
      <li>Another good old fashioned shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The strange thing about this shampoo is, the very first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t smell like anything, which was great.  </li>
      <li>I use it for another person with special needs that needs unscented items and has dandruff and oily hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to address the issue, but none have worked quite as good as this.</li>
      <li>An easy way to order this product, which I very much like.  </li>
      <li>I have always had issues with my scalp from dandruff to mild psoriasis</li>
      <li>The big downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>and it is not expensive!</li>
      <li>For dandruff, dry and very itchy scalp I found a great deal of relief using this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, with subsequent uses, there has been a very very strong scent---I almost want to compare it to dog treats in a way?  </li>
      <li>Really works well and no unpleasant scent.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t appreciate not being able to purchase only one bottle to try because my order wasn&#x27;t over $25.00.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s not loaded with many of the chemicals in the commercial products.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re battling dry/itchy scalp at times this can definitely do the job at releaving most of the issue.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I felt relief the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Still as a cleansing shampoo I felt my hair was clean and very silky soft, but since it didn&#x27;t solve my problem I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>but it did absolutely nothing for my aweful dandruff.  </li>
      <li>I was ready to take him to the dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I have used it for three weeks and have noticed my hair isn&#x27;t coming out as much.</li>
      <li>And fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Cleans very well and prevents dandruff.</li>
      <li>has absolutely no scent - a bit thick - but so far - she really likes it and is very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve found that leaves my hair soft rather than feeling like I washed it with lye soap circa the 1700s.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very likely i will order more in the future!</li>
      <li>I am chemically sensitive so this was invaluable.  </li>
      <li>Previously I had to wait until I had a chance to get to the rare place that sold this product - it&#x27;s not carried everywhere.</li>
      <li>Little costlier but worth the price.</li>
      <li>I was of course skeptical when I first purchased this product because it was relatively cheap</li>
      <li>Plus, it actually left my coarse, frizzy hair soft and manageable which was an unexpected bonus.</li>
      <li>I found it lathers well, and I&#x27;m sure since I have short, thin hair</li>
</ol>

<li> Due to certain shampoos I must use and the recent cold weather I had dandruff extremely bad</li>
<li> So, I&#x27;m torn, because the results are fantastic, but that smell is just terrible, and almost not worth the outcome.</li>
<li> They are so hard to get these days.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive up front</li>
<li> I use this to avoid the headaches I get with artificial scents - for that</li>
<li> but it still smells bad.   </li>
<li> Well I was using Everpure for my horrible dandruff</li>
<li> Bad idea, Amazon!!!</li>
<li> My son has terrible dandruff to the point</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> An easy way to order this product, which I very much like.  Previously I had to wait until I had a chance to get to the rare place that sold this product - it&#x27;s not carried everywhere.</li>
    <li> Really works well and no unpleasant scent. Some products say no fragrance but it still smells bad.   Really good product. And fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Another good old fashioned shampoo.  They are so hard to get these days.  Cleans very well and prevents dandruff.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  I have to buy it for her every few months.  She recommends it to all of her friends.</li>
    <li> Well I was using Everpure for my horrible dandruff but it stopped working for me for some reason, so I decided to try this.  I love the lather and the way it leaves my hair feeling but it did absolutely nothing for my aweful dandruff.  I tried letting it stay on for three minutes, I tried washing every other day rather than every third day, and it didn&#x27;t matter.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Still as a cleansing shampoo I felt my hair was clean and very silky soft, but since it didn&#x27;t solve my problem I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> ever notice how when something claims to be unscented - it&#x27;s still perfumey?!?!  not this!!!  bought this for my mom - she has to use products that are perfume/dye free.  has absolutely no scent - a bit thick - but so far - she really likes it and is very happy with it.  it&#x27;s very likely i will order more in the future!</li>
    <li> I hoped for more lather.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, cleans my scalp without drying. Want a larger size.</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve found that leaves my hair soft rather than feeling like I washed it with lye soap circa the 1700s.  Not to mention the fact that it WORKS.  Not a flake or itchy scalp since I started using it, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily between washes (a sign of over-drying).  And it&#x27;s unscented!  Oh, AND it&#x27;s cheaper than the comparable brand name salicylic acid shampoo I was using before.  I couldn&#x27;t have dreamed of a better product.</li>
    <li> this product is orange which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of putting orange stuff on my head.  Also the only active ingredient is salicylic acid and I found a shampoo that has that in it and has no scent at all that works just as well. If you have a scent allergy try dermarest or seaweed bath co. They are both great products with no scent at all.</li>
    <li> My son has terrible dandruff to the point I was ready to take him to the dermatologist. A friend brought this over and it has helped a lot. It didn&#x27;t solve the problem but it is a lot better. The big downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have a nice clean smell. He is willing to accept that with the good results he gets.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with my scalp from dandruff to mild psoriasis and I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to address the issue, but none have worked quite as good as this. I was of course skeptical when I first purchased this product because it was relatively cheap and I&#x27;ve gone through a multitude of products that are often double the price. I have to say that I felt relief the first time I used it. After a few uses it had helped stop the itch, the flakes and irritation. Plus, it actually left my coarse, frizzy hair soft and manageable which was an unexpected bonus.</li>
    <li> The strange thing about this shampoo is, the very first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t smell like anything, which was great.  I love what it does to my hair, leaving it very clean and light feeling, not to mention taking care of the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with subsequent uses, there has been a very very strong scent---I almost want to compare it to dog treats in a way?  So, I&#x27;m torn, because the results are fantastic, but that smell is just terrible, and almost not worth the outcome.</li>
    <li> I used it. It was ok. Have to use 3 days a week. Nothing different than store bought item. I was looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Works great. Fragrance free makes it more awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product since it is unscented</li>
    <li> I love this dandruff shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t smell. It works. You only have to use it a couple times per week and it is not expensive!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo before and I will buy it again. It&#x27;s a little expensive up front but it only takes a little bit each wash. I use it for another person with special needs that needs unscented items and has dandruff and oily hair.This product is very good for him.</li>
    <li> Due to certain shampoos I must use and the recent cold weather I had dandruff extremely bad but this product cleared it up within two uses!!!! And the added bonus that is unscented (I must use all unscented products for work) makes it even better!! Thank you for offering this unscented product when others dont!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used it for three weeks and have noticed my hair isn&#x27;t coming out as much. My scalp has lost that crusty feeling and my hair seems to be healthier. My husband has started to use the shampoo also and likes it because it is truly unscented. I would recommend this product for all with scalp issues.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good.  I like using it - especially that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  However, I didn&#x27;t appreciate not being able to purchase only one bottle to try because my order wasn&#x27;t over $25.00.  So, I had to buy other items.  Bad idea, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend.  My dandruff issue is gone. I got a haircut after a few days of usage and there was no dandruff on the covering they put over me.  There tends to be flakes.  Dandruff gone.</li>
    <li> Fibromyalgia syndrome changes the skin, causing dryness, and other odd things. I am always looking for products to relieve some of the many symptoms. For dandruff, dry and very itchy scalp I found a great deal of relief using this product. I found it lathers well, and I&#x27;m sure since I have short, thin hair the 8 ounch bottle will last quite awhile. I would recommend this product to everyone and especially those with scentivity to odors. I love that this is unscented and it works!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of naturals (black/african americans) don&#x27;t like shampoos for obvious reasons. Yet I happen to try the Home Health Antidandruff Shampoo, I don&#x27;t know what it is about this shampoo, but it&#x27;s different. If you&#x27;re battling dry/itchy scalp at times this can definitely do the job at releaving most of the issue. The foam lathers well without it being too overpowering.  The ingredients are also pretty great as well.  Very happy about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every anti-dandruff shampoo out there and this works just as well, or better, than all of them.  Plus it&#x27;s not loaded with many of the chemicals in the commercial products.</li>
    <li> This product does the job without the fragrance.  I am chemically sensitive so this was invaluable.  I did find the shampoo to be drying, but nothing that some unscented conditioner couldn&#x27;t ease.</li>
    <li> This product works but the feel is not as good as Head and Shoulder brand. I use this to avoid the headaches I get with artificial scents - for that it works great. For anti-dandruff it works great. Just use a scent free conditioner after this product and all will be well.</li>
    <li> I have severe dandruff/scalp irritation and this product didn&#x27;t help me--at all. I would not recommend if you have moderate to severe dandruff.</li>
    <li> It gives moisturizing wash and does not make the scalp dry. Shows improvement in few tries. Little costlier but worth the price.</li>
