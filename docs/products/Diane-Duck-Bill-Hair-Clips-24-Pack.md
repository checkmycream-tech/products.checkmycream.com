      <li>I was previously using duck bill clips that had holes in them, but these are so much better because my natural african-american coily hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the holes anymore because there are none in these clips.</li>
      <li>She uses them frequently.  </li>
      <li>Metal is A little flimsy and bends easily, but product is exactly what i expected.</li>

<li> I purchased small clips and I ended up not using them at all.</li>
<li> Packed badly.</li>

    <li> I ordered these clips a while back and I guess I ordered them used, because they had obviously been frequently used. The spots were just on the surface and came off easily. I found the clips very useful. I have lost most of them but am happy when I occationally run across one or two.</li>
    <li> These are big, but work for pin curls. What they excel at is holding sections of hair out of the way while you work on drying, curling, or otherwise styling the rest. Big, strong, and stainless, they come in 2 bags of &#x60;12 clips inside the card box, and seem like professional grade items.</li>
    <li> These are the same as clips that mom had that were at least 40 years old and she had worn them out. She had tried steel clips and they were too harsh and stiff, these were perfect for holding her &amp;#34;spit curls&amp;#34; at night so she can look her best every day.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten smaller ones too. I will be buying from Diane again. I use these for sectioning hair every day. They are very handy for hairstyles, dying hair, trimming hair, and  putting in hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Duck bill clips with no holes in the top. These are smooth and don&#x27;t pull at hair.</li>
    <li> Metal is A little flimsy and bends easily, but product is exactly what i expected. The spring mechanism seems to be sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for these.  There are plenty in the pack and work well. Clip the hair nice and tight.  She uses them frequently.  Recommended and great price.</li>
    <li> Sturdy clips, good value for the box size. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, generous quantity.  Gets the job done cheaply</li>
    <li> Worked great for the ladies</li>
    <li> I never received this product and I let then know by sending then an e-mail but nothing ever happen</li>
    <li> They are not very sturdy and breaks easily</li>
    <li> Came as expected- duck bill clips in a box.  They&#x27;re fairly sturdy for aluminum.</li>
    <li> I also needed large clips to hold my hair, while I retwisted each loc. I purchased small clips and I ended up not using them at all. They were not flexible or strong. I love these clips because they are made with aluminum which makes them sturdy, but they also have the ability to bend without breaking. For example, I can clip up to four loc pieces of hair into one duck bill clip and then slightly bend the clip forward or backwards to hold the pieces a little tighter. It has become a necessity since I started maintaining my locs myself. It is one of those things I have to have in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Loved them! And they came sooooo fast!</li>
    <li> There are no &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on these clips, which is exactly what I wanted.  The clips work very well with Conair foam rollers but you need to take the plastic clips off the Conair rollers because they will not hold the roller in place.  I really like these 60&#x27;s style aluminum duck bill roller clips!</li>
    <li> IT worked perfect with the rollers i had to hold them in place</li>
    <li> Great for keeping rollers in your hair.  I really like them.</li>
    <li> I thought it was all metal.. but or kind of plasticy</li>
    <li> great product even better price.</li>
    <li> Product ok. Packed badly. Box was open when I received it.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> hold my fine hair without too much slipping</li>
    <li> I was previously using duck bill clips that had holes in them, but these are so much better because my natural african-american coily hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the holes anymore because there are none in these clips.</li>
