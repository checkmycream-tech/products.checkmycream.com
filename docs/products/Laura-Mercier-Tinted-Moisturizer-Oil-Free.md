### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The very best tinted moisturizer out there.</li>
      <li>They are truly the best to give you a dewy, fully covered look.</li>
      <li>This tinted moisturizer is awesome.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, I noticed I would get 1 or 2 blemishes from BB creams because I do think it clogged my pores, but the Laura Mercier is great.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>Feels light and great coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Evens out skin tone nicely.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best tinted moisturizer, CC Cream, BB Cream, etc.</li>
      <li>so I probably need to apply more lotion than others who are combo/oily.  </li>
      <li>I have used before love</li>
      <li>, I have been using this product for many years</li>
      <li>Love this product -it</li>
      <li>Makes me look more awake as soon as I put it on.</li>
      <li>I feel like most products that contain SPF do this anyways</li>
      <li>Love love Laura Mercier product for all items.</li>
      <li>I use this as my foundation and have not found anything better.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>Well, I love it and will continue to order.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and the Laura Mercier is the best.</li>
      <li>so I always thought I needed a true foundation with more coverage.</li>
      <li>all while feeling light weight and hydrating my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I always love how it leaves my complexion looking dewy and fresh.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light coverage</li>
      <li>Tinted moisturizers always seemed to me to be something that you could only wear if you already had great skin and probably didn&#x27;t need foundation anyway.</li>
      <li>Both have good coverage for a tinted moisturizer while still looking natural and avoiding the \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the way it feels on my face however I do have to set it with powder bc it does tend to look oily/shiny right after it is applied.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with this oil-free version and would recommend it someone who wants a lightweight tinted moisturizer that hydrates and gives good coverage, while still looking natural.</li>
      <li>It is thinner than the Missha and Skin79 BB creams in a good way because it really looks even more like your own skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or pasty.</li>
      <li>That to me felt very comparable to a lotion while this feels more like a BB Cream.</li>
      <li>conceals, it is light weight, provides sun screen and looks great under a heavy or lighter coverage powder</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
      <li>Great product and good natural coverage, its the second time I have bought it and definitely will buy it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried and loved multiple Laura Mercier products in the past (I find her lip glaces to be so flattering, her foundation primers make your foundation glide on with ease, and the shimmer bloc is great for adding natural looking color and brightness).</li>
      <li>/&gt;As for what is consistent between versions.</li>
      <li>I recently ran out of both y SuperBB Gold and Missha No 23 cream and decided to try another brand since it had caught on and there were a lot more choices.</li>
      <li>, so you will have to gauge which is more worth it to you, but I don&#x27;t feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>I first tried the regular Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer (not oil free) and was pleasantly surprised at how well it covered and</li>
      <li>It is FOR SURE more expensive...</li>
      <li>So at least based on my experience, if you are transitioning from the regular version to oil-free, it&#x27;s worth trying it on your skin to make sure you have the right color for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the color and the coverage; I have found that I have to mix it with a little moisturizer to give it a more even distribution.  </li>
      <li>Not thick or cakey.</li>
      <li>This oil free tinted moisturizer was also a hit for me although it is a slightly different product experience than the regular version.</li>
      <li>It gives a very natural look.</li>
      <li>First, I noticed the consistency is different.</li>
      <li>It will last a long time.. worth the money!</li>
      <li>so its hard to say what its causing it, its not terrible though.</li>
      <li>Gives a natural look.</li>
      <li>Sephora offers lots of samples and whatnot so you can see if you like it.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and sensitive, and this product doesn&#x27;t make me shine like others plus no breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I have pale, sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t handle foundation very well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Absolutely amazing. Moisturizes and covers blemishes well. I use this as my foundation and have not found anything better.</li>
    <li> I have used before love it&#x27;s light coverage but this tube does seem to ball up on my face.  Never had that happen before</li>
    <li> The very best tinted moisturizer out there. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and the Laura Mercier is the best.</li>
    <li> Great product. No irritation on my skin and doesn&#x27;t block pores. Feels light and great coverage. Highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> If you do not moisturize properly before applying the tinted moisturizer, then your skin will be left feeling very dry.  I am combo/dry so I probably need to apply more lotion than others who are combo/oily.  Other than that, I have been using this product for many years and I always love how it leaves my complexion looking dewy and fresh.  The product also lasts forever since it&#x27;s in a big tube.</li>
    <li> I am korean and have been using BB creams for years. They are truly the best to give you a dewy, fully covered look. I recently ran out of both y SuperBB Gold and Missha No 23 cream and decided to try another brand since it had caught on and there were a lot more choices. This tinted moisturizer is awesome. It is thinner than the Missha and Skin79 BB creams in a good way because it really looks even more like your own skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or pasty. Sometimes, I noticed I would get 1 or 2 blemishes from BB creams because I do think it clogged my pores, but the Laura Mercier is great. It also has no smell and a little goes a long way. It is FOR SURE more expensive...$10 v $43, so you will have to gauge which is more worth it to you, but I don&#x27;t feel like it was a waste of money. I would recommend people try it out. Sephora offers lots of samples and whatnot so you can see if you like it.</li>
    <li> I like the color and the coverage; I have found that I have to mix it with a little moisturizer to give it a more even distribution.  Evens out skin tone nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and loved multiple Laura Mercier products in the past (I find her lip glaces to be so flattering, her foundation primers make your foundation glide on with ease, and the shimmer bloc is great for adding natural looking color and brightness).

Tinted moisturizers always seemed to me to be something that you could only wear if you already had great skin and probably didn&#x27;t need foundation anyway. Boy was I wrong. I first tried the regular Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer (not oil free) and was pleasantly surprised at how well it covered and all while feeling light weight and hydrating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But knowing that I would prefer to use oil-free products to keep acne at bay, I figured I would give this a try. This oil free tinted moisturizer was also a hit for me although it is a slightly different product experience than the regular version. First, I noticed the consistency is different. It doesn&#x27;t feel quite as lightweight as the regular version. That to me felt very comparable to a lotion while this feels more like a BB Cream. I still like how it feels on my face after applying, but it is a slight difference. I also found some color variation between the same shade in the oil-free and regular version when I compared them side by side on my skin in store. I&#x27;m not sure if it isolated to a particular batch but I ended up going with and preferring Blush in this oil-free version even though I was using nude in the regular version. So at least based on my experience, if you are transitioning from the regular version to oil-free, it&#x27;s worth trying it on your skin to make sure you have the right color for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what is consistent between versions. Both have good coverage for a tinted moisturizer while still looking natural and avoiding the \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look. And both leave my skin feeling hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with this oil-free version and would recommend it someone who wants a lightweight tinted moisturizer that hydrates and gives good coverage, while still looking natural.</li>
    <li> Great product and good natural coverage, its the second time I have bought it and definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the way it feels on my face however I do have to set it with powder bc it does tend to look oily/shiny right after it is applied. I feel like most products that contain SPF do this anyways so its hard to say what its causing it, its not terrible though.</li>
    <li> Love this product -it conceals, it is light weight, provides sun screen and looks great under a heavy or lighter coverage powder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff.  I have pale, sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t handle foundation very well (it&#x27;s too heavy and breaks me out).  This tinted moisturizer provides just enough coverage and DOES NOT clog my pores or cause break-outs.  Leaves my face looking polished and slightly dewy. I purchased the oil-free version, feeling a bit nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t wear as well as the regular version advertises.  Well, I love it and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.. it&#x27;s the only &#x27;foundation&#x27; I will use.  LOVE IT.  5 STARS!! It will last a long time.. worth the money!</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best tinted moisturizer, CC Cream, BB Cream, etc. that I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them!).  I have oily skin and sensitive, and this product doesn&#x27;t make me shine like others plus no breakouts.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> If I was stranded on a desert island, and can only bring one makeup item, it&#x27;s this tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, nothing beats it. There&#x27;s nothing I hate more than when you look at a girl in the sunlight and can see her foundation. It won&#x27;t happen with this-You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on! Not thick or cakey. And SPF 15! Makes me look more awake as soon as I put it on.</li>
    <li> Gives a natural look. I do not like wearing makeup/base on my face as it causes me to break out. This does not cause my skin to break out. It gives a very natural look.</li>
    <li> Love love Laura Mercier product for all items.</li>
