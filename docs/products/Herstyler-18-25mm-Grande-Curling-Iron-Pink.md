      <li>I bought a purple one at the mall and fell in love with  these wands, so when I move to Tennessee I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere decided to look online and found this one at a great price came fast in the mail</li>
      <li>I do still enjoy it though!</li>
      <li>The rod makes it easy to get the tousseled look and is easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>I am not a hair person, It is easy to use even my sister likes to use it.</li>

      <li>The waves I get with this curling iron are super cute and fun.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>This curling rod is very powerful, making curls quick and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>Not the right product.</li>
      <li>You need a lot of practice to get the right wave, still thinking of returning this model.</li>
      <li>It was delivered brand new in nice packaging, complete with glove (</li>
      <li>This definitely does what it says, super light weight and heats up in seconds!</li>
      <li>It curled my hair quickly and easily and left the curls shiny.  </li>
      <li>What I love is that I can curl my hair and it will last for two or three days!</li>
      <li>So I never leave it on my desk, haha!)</li>
      <li>It gets REALLY hot</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It heats up super fast and is ready to go in a minute.  </li>
      <li>The curls are just the right size and the hair stays curled all day even in straight hair.</li>
      <li>and that is that it&#x27;s much easier to get burned with this type of iron than a more traditional curling iron, but with practice anyone can get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>Too Hot for my hair, and it will burn your hair, unless your hair is very course.</li>
      <li>so I would definitely use it because it gets SUPER HOTTTT!</li>
      <li>If my hair looks this good after only my first try, I can only imagine how much better it will look with a little practice!</li>
      <li>which really does help when wanding).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and my daughter loves it.  </li>
      <li>the barrel of the wand was much skinnier than 18-25 mm.  </li>
      <li>haha)</li>
      <li>I really like how the curls in my hair stayed in for four days.</li>
      <li>I was REALLY UPSET</li>
      <li>I really like the curls this iron gives, although I think the one amazon sent me must have been one that was returned because the handle was scratched.</li>
      <li>Really, it takes about 10 minutes to do do your whole head.</li>
      <li>Other than that it does the job, gets super hot quick.  </li>
      <li>My hair won&#x27;t curl with normal curling irons, but this wand did wonders!</li>
      <li>Super fast shipment and would definitely recommend this product to others !</li>
      <li>But I gotta caution you that it heats up to a million degrees from the top to the black button so it could literally burn your hair like that youtube girl.</li>
      <li>Definitely gets very hot so use the glove that it comes with.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this curler.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend checking out video tutorials on You Tube.</li>
      <li>It makes spiral curls and normal curls depending on how you twist your hair around.</li>
      <li>Within a few seconds your hair is curled so do not leave it for more then 10-15 seconds.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way faster than a normal curling iron with a clamp</li>
      <li>today the shipping was so fast it only took 2 days !!!</li>
      <li>HIghly recommend to replace your current curling iron.</li>
      <li>I would normally use a flat iron to get curls, but this is even faster and easier, and does not pull my hair at all.  </li>
      <li>Not exactly like the picture the handle is pink but as long as it works - that&#x27;s ok with me</li>
      <li>I have very coarse naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I thought it would include the heat-resistant glove, but apparently it didn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
      <li>two things I don&#x27;t like are: First, only one temperature setting &amp; the gloves that comes with it does not really protect my hands from the heat</li>
      <li>It works as good as some of the really expensive curlers!  </li>
      <li>When I blow dry it straight I am forced to have it pin straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not exactly like the picture the handle is pink but as long as it works - that&#x27;s ok with me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to curling my hair, but this wand is really good. I have short thin hair that is color treated. I&#x27;ve used the curling iron with the clamp but does nothing to my hair but leave a crease. My previous curling wand was a con air with interchangeable sizes. It worked but i wasn&#x27;t convinced. I wanted to achieve beach waves or just some texture. This wand does just that. Only downside which is why I gave it 4 stars, it&#x27;s not all pink how the picture shows. The handle is pink but the curler is black. I have no problem with it but that should be a disclaimer. Also, there is no adjustable degrees.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after seeing them use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair at the mall.  It&#x27;s the same brand and same size as they used, but at a fraction of the price they wanted.  It heats up super fast and is ready to go in a minute.  It even came with the thermal glove, which wasn&#x27;t mentioned, but was included in the box.  I had watched some videos on YouTube to get an idea of how to use it, so that was helpful in starting out.  It curled my hair quickly and easily and left the curls shiny.  I would normally use a flat iron to get curls, but this is even faster and easier, and does not pull my hair at all.  I would highly recommend this curler.  I did my hair yesterday, and it still looks great today!  If my hair looks this good after only my first try, I can only imagine how much better it will look with a little practice!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! It is a great product. Definitely gets very hot so use the glove that it comes with. The waves I get with this curling iron are super cute and fun. Within a few seconds your hair is curled so do not leave it for more then 10-15 seconds. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I just got my package in the mail today the shipping was so fast it only took 2 days !!! I tried out the product and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s way faster than a normal curling iron with a clamp plus it comes with a glove so you won&#x27;t burn yourself. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase especially because the price was amazing :D</li>
    <li> I really like the curls this iron gives, although I think the one amazon sent me must have been one that was returned because the handle was scratched. This iron heats up quickly and makes a very nice smooth curl. There is one draw back and that is that it&#x27;s much easier to get burned with this type of iron than a more traditional curling iron, but with practice anyone can get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> The Herstyler 18-25mm Grande Curling Iorn makes the perfect curl. This is very easy to use! Make sure to get the glove or you will not be able to use this iron. Really, it takes about 10 minutes to do do your whole head. Quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is it does not have a ready light.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand after borrowing it from a collegue. It&#x27;s amazing. It heats up in a minute and comes with a thermal glove. It makes spiral curls and normal curls depending on how you twist your hair around. I would highly recommend checking out video tutorials on You Tube. Just type &#x27;Herstyler Grande Curling Iron&#x27; and press search. What I love is that I can curl my hair and it will last for two or three days! I get so many compliments on my hair, and I&#x27;ve recommended this wand to all my curl-loving friends. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money! (If I should mention one negative... the wand looks like it could be something else, if you know what I mean. So I never leave it on my desk, haha!)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good curling iron but it&#x27;s just hard to use because there&#x27;s a need to use gloves or else you&#x27;ll burn yourself. I gave it a 3 star because it is something that I would not use everyday because it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item because I wanted to have a different look. I have very coarse naturally curly hair. When I blow dry it straight I am forced to have it pin straight. I wanted the option to have some waves and softer curls. I was contemplating purchasing the Sultra Bombshell and found it to be a bit pricey. This definitely does what it says, super light weight and heats up in seconds! It comes with it own glove , I found it to be too big and nothing better than a winter glove to be honest. I am sure ladies we all have a random glove that is unpaired laying around the house so I would definitely use it because it gets SUPER HOTTTT! Super fast shipment and would definitely recommend this product to others !</li>
    <li> OMG ! My friend advised me that I should try purchasing a curling wand.  Most of the units i&#x27;ve been looking at are unknown brands that are expensive. No way was I going to take a chance on spending my hard earn money on a unknown brand. Anyway, majority of the reviews for this wand are great. I order it, immediatley went home to try it out. I LOVE IT !!! I plan on purchasing three more for gifts for my sister and friends. Of course I will purchase another one for myself as a back up.   The quality is unbelievable for the price. Ladies this wand is a must have. I am intrested in purchasing the curling iron and other products.</li>
    <li> This curling iron it&#x27;s really good, it won&#x27;t do any damage to your hair and the curls are just beautiful, really worth it plus it&#x27;s pink!</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought a purple one at the mall and fell in love with  these wands, so when I move to Tennessee I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere decided to look online and found this one at a great price came fast in the mail and it included the glove, and the wand heats up pretty quickly and always get great comments about my hair in love with this!!:)</li>
    <li> I ordered the pink Herstyler Curling Iron and it was supposed to be all pink, but instead I received a pink and black one. Not the right product.</li>
    <li> I am not a hair person, It is easy to use even my sister likes to use it. two things I don&#x27;t like are: First, only one temperature setting &amp; the gloves that comes with it does not really protect my hands from the heat so i deducted 1 star.</li>
    <li> This is a great product- it produces perfect waves when used right. HIghly recommend to replace your current curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling rod is very powerful, making curls quick and silky smooth. The rod makes it easy to get the tousseled look and is easy to maneuver. I thought it would include the heat-resistant glove, but apparently it didn&#x27;t come with one. I do still enjoy it though!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would come looking just like the photo...It was pink with black, kind of weird, still have to see how the product works</li>
    <li> Too Hot for my hair, and it will burn your hair, unless your hair is very course.</li>
    <li> Great product, was not the color I ordered, but works just as good. No problems with the use of the wand</li>
    <li> disappointed because I ordered this, and when it came it was the baby curls wand instead of the wand pictured, the grande.  the barrel of the wand was much skinnier than 18-25 mm.  definitely will be returning it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t pink on pink like pictured, it&#x27;s pink and black.  Other than that it does the job, gets super hot quick.  It does come with a glove even though the description doesn&#x27;t tell you that and they&#x27;ll suggest you buy one.</li>
    <li> There is no off switch on this product it heats up as soon as I plug it in. No instructions so I AM not sure if it is defective.&lt;br /&gt;There is a zero and one setting. I have to unplug it to turn it off. Must be very careful not to burn hair, hand or face. You need a lot of practice to get the right wave, still thinking of returning this model.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipping and my daughter loves it.  The curls are just the right size and the hair stays curled all day even in straight hair.</li>
    <li> I need to practice for sure. Be careful with it! It gets REALLY hot and I burnt my arm. This was my own fault though. There is a reason for that glove that is included.</li>
    <li> I really like how the curls in my hair stayed in for four days. (I shower everyday but I just wanted to test how long they lasted haha) But I gotta caution you that it heats up to a million degrees from the top to the black button so it could literally burn your hair like that youtube girl. But if you control the time that its in your hair well it&#x27;ll be fine. i think. Curls look so good the day after! I was REALLY UPSET THOUGH when I found that it didnt look like the picture they advertised!!!!what the heck! I thought the whole think would be pink but the curler part where it heats up is black and the handle is pink :....( The swivel cord is nice and the hand glove is handy too. I think the price is great too!</li>
    <li> I love it! makes the perfect curls</li>
    <li> My hair won&#x27;t curl with normal curling irons, but this wand did wonders! It was delivered brand new in nice packaging, complete with glove (which really does help when wanding). I give this experience and product an A+!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product, especially for the price.  It works as good as some of the really expensive curlers!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. Takes a while to heat up, and you have to leave it in your hair longer to get a lasting curl. Not good for your hair!</li>
