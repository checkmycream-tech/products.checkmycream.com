<ol>
      <li>it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Best vegan/natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Great organic deodorant!  </li>
      <li>All in all, this product is a wonderful alternative to aluminum containing deodorants!</li>
      <li>This is the best one for me.</li>
      <li>I may try some others as well, but WAY better than Tom&#x27;s!!!</li>
      <li>North Coast Organics&#x27; Death by Lavender had great reviews on blogs.</li>
      <li>Good efficacy and pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>so this is a good find.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant and it works!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent!  </li>
      <li>The lavender smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>but I will be honest</li>
      <li>I’m glad I decided to try this deodorant, because I love it!</li>
      <li>I have used regular anti-perspirant/deodorants, Tom&#x27;s, and made my own deodorant, and I&#x27;d say this has been the best I have used.  </li>
      <li>I got the variety pack and love them all.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t love the packaging-</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ok with the price</li>
      <li>I try to stay away from the toxic deodorants and have tried soooo many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones.</li>
      <li>The drawback is that it is probably more abrasive than you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
      <li>It smelled good and the ingredients were of high quality, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to support a local business and was extra impressed with the handwritten thank</li>
      <li>I love knowing that it is much healthier for my body, and I love that it works!</li>
      <li>A light sent.</li>
      <li>They smell great and actually work!</li>
      <li>it &#x27;s really wonderfull.it &#x27;s effective even for three days Consecutively.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly girls that will pick lavender, perhaps consider a new, more feminine logo?</li>
      <li>If it works for a prego woman, that I&#x27;m pretty sure it would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the baking soda that gives it the abrasiveness because that&#x27;s the same issue I had when I made my own deodorant, though the deodorant I made was even more abrasive.  </li>
      <li>If he was outside mostly, then he had to wash and reapply but overall he was satisfied with the results that he experienced.</li>
      <li>I use to buy it from whole foods but after moving I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere except on amazon.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good enough-</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and strong enough to control my underarm odor.</li>
      <li>Which is fine because your body should be able to sweat because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>Pretty effective for an all natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is subtle, but very pleasant.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, I love this natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Its spendy but worth it.</li>
      <li>thanks north coast organics!</li>
      <li>I would love to continue to use this product, but will likely have to take a break until the rash/irritation goes away.</li>
      <li>Thank YOU! ;)</li>
      <li>This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I found at a Marshalls near my husband and I, and since we are both trying a more holistic approach to healthcare, picked this up to try after having no luck with JASON brand natural, unscented deodorant.</li>
      <li>It really does work pretty well when I go for a run.</li>
      <li>He indicated that it keep him dry throughout most of the day.</li>
      <li>I can only speak for myself but my underarms have always smelled strong at the end of the day after applying the aluminum antiperspirants out there.  </li>
      <li>It looks kind of odd in the container and it has a grainier texture than traditional deodorants; however, it applies really smoothly to your skin with no residue.</li>
      <li>if you put on too much it will show on your clothes (but it does wash out).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was really waxy and</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
      <li>I do really like that it comes in the twist up</li>
      <li>packaging.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need as much of this either-</li>
      <li>Luckily, it was easily washable and DID NOT stain my white items yellow.  </li>
      <li>I decided to make the switch to a natural deodorant after experiencing an itchy rash associated with the high aluminum content in an extra strength antiperspirant and after learning more of the health risks of aluminum containing deodorants.</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised when this deodorant kept me dry and smelling better than my aluminum-based antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>Its pretty good- really does a nice job of neutralizing any potential (bad) scent-</li>
      <li>THIS one by far though is the most natural, non toxic deodorant that I could find and iy ACTUALLY works.</li>
      <li>Sure just to name a few.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed anything more or less special from other deodorant.</li>
      <li>I definitely rub my thumb over it a few times in the morning to warm it up and make it smoother to apply.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I was recommended this product by a friend who knows I use natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I did a lot of research about natural deodorants, and</li>
      <li>i have tried EVERY natural deodorant i could find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>But this natural one seems to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It is completely effective for me (whereas I swear Tom&#x27;s makes me smell worse).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several organic/natural deodorants and never found one that didn&#x27;t have me running for my normal chemical bomb in a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>I found that the North Coast deodorant keep me dry all day, but the real test was with my husband.</li>
      <li>Although I can&#x27;t detect any residue after applying the deodorant, I did notice some of that &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; deodorant on a black camisole at the end of the day; however it washed right out.</li>
      <li>I am in my second trimester prego and made the switch from traditional antiperspirants/deodorants to natural about 2 months ago.  </li>

<li> Last a long time as well.</li>

<li> Hands down!</li>
<li> Few ingredients.</li>
<li> Sometimes my armpits get damp, but I&#x27;ve never had sweat stains (given, it is fall, not the dead of summer)</li>
<li> am not a huge sweater</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to judge if it&#x27;s doing anything on controlling sweat, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues of going thru shirts or anything.&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not super fond of the skull in the label but the product makes up for the creepy purple Jolly Roger.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very hard to put on &amp; scraps my skin as I put it on.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried all of them from secret, Dove, Degree,</li>
<li> I had no luck with Tom&#x27;s of Maine (made me smell worse somehow)</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve never noticed a bad odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can&#x27;t leave home without this stuff it&#x27;s great!  I can only speak for myself but my underarms have always smelled strong at the end of the day after applying the aluminum antiperspirants out there.  Trust me I&#x27;ve tried all of them from secret, Dove, Degree, Sure just to name a few.  None of them worked for my funk.  But this natural one seems to do the trick.  I prefer the unscented one instead of the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Pretty effective for an all natural deodorant. By the end of the day it&#x27;s worn off though, so I do need to reapply. The lavender smell is nice and not overpowering. I had no luck with Tom&#x27;s of Maine (made me smell worse somehow) and I didn&#x27;t want to go back to antiperspirant so this is a good find.</li>
    <li> I have problems with deodorants and at the age of 50, I&#x27;ve always had to use men&#x27;s deodorants. To my surprise, I love this natural deodorant. It has a nice scent and strong enough to control my underarm odor. I won&#x27;t switch to anything else. I&#x27;m hooked on this for the rest of my life. Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this!</li>
    <li> it &#x27;s really wonderfull.it &#x27;s effective even for three days Consecutively.</li>
    <li> Their slogan needs some work. I have tried a few natural deodorants. This is the best one for me. I&#x27;m not super fond of the skull in the label but the product makes up for the creepy purple Jolly Roger.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good- really does a nice job of neutralizing any potential (bad) scent- I have used in cooler temps and now into Spring/Summer it seems to be performing nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge sweater so it&#x27;s hard to judge if it&#x27;s doing anything on controlling sweat, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues of going thru shirts or anything.&lt;br /&gt;It does soften upon warming on your skin but it is a big grainier and rougher than say Dove, but I&#x27;m picking this brand because I want to avoid the chemicals in mainstream big box brands.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ok with the price but I will be honest, I don&#x27;t love the packaging- It&#x27;s mostly girls that will pick lavender, perhaps consider a new, more feminine logo? I do really like that it comes in the twist up packaging.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need as much of this either- if you put on too much it will show on your clothes (but it does wash out).&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third purchase so it&#x27;s good enough- will I keep buying forever, it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I may try some others as well, but WAY better than Tom&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> I try to stay away from the toxic deodorants and have tried soooo many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones. THIS one by far though is the most natural, non toxic deodorant that I could find and iy ACTUALLY works. Hallelujah! I use to buy it from whole foods but after moving I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere except on amazon. Its spendy but worth it. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Love! I&#x27;ve tried several organic/natural deodorants and never found one that didn&#x27;t have me running for my normal chemical bomb in a couple of hours. I got the variety pack and love them all. They smell great and actually work! I&#x27;m happy to support a local business and was extra impressed with the handwritten thank you note. Thank YOU! ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I found at a Marshalls near my husband and I, and since we are both trying a more holistic approach to healthcare, picked this up to try after having no luck with JASON brand natural, unscented deodorant. I found that the North Coast deodorant keep me dry all day, but the real test was with my husband. He indicated that it keep him dry throughout most of the day. If he was outside mostly, then he had to wash and reapply but overall he was satisfied with the results that he experienced.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but I absolutely love it! I decided to make the switch to a natural deodorant after experiencing an itchy rash associated with the high aluminum content in an extra strength antiperspirant and after learning more of the health risks of aluminum containing deodorants. I did a lot of research about natural deodorants, and North Coast Organics&#x27; Death by Lavender had great reviews on blogs. I’m glad I decided to try this deodorant, because I love it! It looks kind of odd in the container and it has a grainier texture than traditional deodorants; however, it applies really smoothly to your skin with no residue. The deodorant in the stick almost &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and sometimes melted deodorant oozes down onto the sides of the plastic container, but I just wipe that off and put it back on top of the deodorant so as not to waste. The lavender smell is subtle, but very pleasant. The scent does seem to increase with the temperature. Although I can&#x27;t detect any residue after applying the deodorant, I did notice some of that &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; deodorant on a black camisole at the end of the day; however it washed right out. Sometimes my armpits get damp, but I&#x27;ve never had sweat stains (given, it is fall, not the dead of summer) and I&#x27;ve never noticed a bad odor. Although this product is not an antiperspirant, I do not sweat nearly as much as I expected I would (I used an extra strength deodorant in the past). All in all, this product is a wonderful alternative to aluminum containing deodorants! I love knowing that it is much healthier for my body, and I love that it works! I recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> Great organic deodorant!  I am in my second trimester prego and made the switch from traditional antiperspirants/deodorants to natural about 2 months ago.  I use a combination of the crystal and Death by Lavender.  I absolutely love the scent!  I was actually surprised when this deodorant kept me dry and smelling better than my aluminum-based antiperspirant.  If it works for a prego woman, that I&#x27;m pretty sure it would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that after 1.5 to 2 months I started to develop a rash under my arms, which I now understand is a likely reaction to the baking soda in the product, based on other reviews that I have read.  I do second another reviewer who suggested another version of this product without baking soda.  I would love to continue to use this product, but will likely have to take a break until the rash/irritation goes away.</li>
    <li> Best vegan/natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down! Few ingredients. A light sent. It really does work pretty well when I go for a run. Last a long time as well. Heads up though, it will not stop you from actually sweating necessarily, it just keeps you from stinking...basically. Which is fine because your body should be able to sweat because it&#x27;s natural. There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals. Who cares if you sweat a little. It&#x27;s natural. Get over it. Great product! Definitely will be the only one I use from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few vegan deodorants and this one actually works. I&#x27;ve been putting on a little powder (cornstarch-based) after I put this on, to act as a moisture-absorber, since this is deodorant but not anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> I have used regular anti-perspirant/deodorants, Tom&#x27;s, and made my own deodorant, and I&#x27;d say this has been the best I have used.  It is completely effective for me (whereas I swear Tom&#x27;s makes me smell worse).  The drawback is that it is probably more abrasive than you&#x27;re used to.  I definitely rub my thumb over it a few times in the morning to warm it up and make it smoother to apply.  I think it&#x27;s the baking soda that gives it the abrasiveness because that&#x27;s the same issue I had when I made my own deodorant, though the deodorant I made was even more abrasive.  All said though, it does the job well!</li>
    <li> i have tried EVERY natural deodorant i could find. this is the ONLY one which has worked for me! thanks north coast organics!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend who knows I use natural deodorant.  It smelled good and the ingredients were of high quality, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.  It was really waxy and when I sweat it turned my white tees yellow as well as leaving a waxy residue.  Luckily, it was easily washable and DID NOT stain my white items yellow.  I ended up not using it - I just didn&#x27;t like it for me.</li>
    <li> I read an online feature about htis - it&#x27;s very hard to put on &amp; scraps my skin as I put it on.  Haven&#x27;t noticed anything more or less special from other deodorant.</li>
    <li> After using for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m a fan !  Good efficacy and pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Wow! I really like this product. Works well.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant and it works! It lasts all day and keeps the funk away.</li>
