      <li>Awesome OG Diane substitute!</li>
      <li>Great for &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; brushing,</li>
      <li>Happy customer.</li>
      <li>Works great on my beard</li>
      <li>This is arguably, if not the best, one of the top 3 brushes on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Perfect for wolfing or a fresh cut.</li>
      <li>The Annie 2075 looks good, feels good, and works pretty well for the price.</li>
      <li>I love my Annie.</li>
      <li>Great brush used it for years just needed a new one</li>
      <li>Great brush, bristles don&#x27;t poke my kids scalp when I brush their natural hair.</li>
      <li>as a brush they are cheap and work well</li>
      <li>and this brush still gets through to my scalp at 1.5&#x27;&#x27; curl length (comfortable exfoliation) without any scalp irritation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a firm brush that&#x27;s ideally for &amp;#34;wolfin&#x27;&amp;#34; -- A must buy!</li>
      <li>great, time for my first amazon return&amp;#34; but after testing and patience with the brush I realized that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>brush is absolutely comfortable and feels like a super high quality brush!</li>
      <li>(thanks amazon!).</li>
      <li>and I received exactly what was pictured</li>
      <li>Great brush....not too hard not too soft!!</li>
      <li>I would say to give it a shot but definitely do some research based upon your own personal hair style needs!</li>
      <li>I currently own a double-sided ACE brush and the hard side really works for me</li>
      <li>I truly had high hopes for this purchase.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless I 100 percent love the item.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for something new and professional.</li>
      <li>Have only used it once so far so can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts long-term.</li>

<li> During that one brushing session, (1) the bristles kept falling out - not sure how normal that is, but I kept having bristles fall out of my hair as I was brushing, and also when I was done I cleaned my the strands of hair out of the brush using a comb, and that process alone removed 20-30 bristles all over my bathroom sink.</li>
<li> This brush isn&#x27;t hard or soft.</li>
<li> Its not even that expensive and its quality is undoubtedly right on Q. Medium to almost hard..</li>
<li> but instead it was a hard bristle brush</li>
<li> I thought it was going to be a hard bristle brush</li>
<li> Bristles are way TOO HARD!</li>
<li> A lot of people brag about the Crown Quality Brushes, but I don&#x27;t think an expensive brush is needed.</li>
<li> Nothing went wrong with shipping</li>
<li> Which is very expensive, but I want one.</li>

    <li> Great brush used it for years just needed a new one</li>
    <li> Great brush, bristles don&#x27;t poke my kids scalp when I brush their natural hair.</li>
    <li> Actually thought it was a diane  my mistake  I gave it away I like diane  as a brush they are cheap and work well</li>
    <li> I opened up the brush and started brushing my hair immediately....Bristles immediately started falling out ...After a while it finally stopped...</li>
    <li> Great for &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; brushing,</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t hard or soft. It&#x27;s an excellent medium brush that&#x27;s identical to the Diane 8119. I definitely would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Awesome OG Diane substitute! It&#x27;s a firm brush that&#x27;s ideally for &amp;#34;wolfin&#x27;&amp;#34; -- A must buy!</li>

    <li> Works great on my beard</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a hard bristle brush but actually its medium. The job still gets done just wish it was what I thought.</li>
    <li> Have only used it once so far so can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts long-term. During that one brushing session, (1) the bristles kept falling out - not sure how normal that is, but I kept having bristles fall out of my hair as I was brushing, and also when I was done I cleaned my the strands of hair out of the brush using a comb, and that process alone removed 20-30 bristles all over my bathroom sink. (2) The label rubbed off on my hand. Folks, I&#x27;ve only used this brush ONCE.</li>
    <li> Happy customer. Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I preferred a medium bristle brush but instead it was a hard bristle brush👎</li>
    <li> I am a 360 waver. I truly had high hopes for this purchase. I was lead to this product after thorough research on affordable quality brushes for the purpose of waves. Nothing went wrong with shipping and I received exactly what was pictured (thanks amazon!). Out of the box I noticed bristles falling out... I thought &amp;#34;Oh great, time for my first amazon return&amp;#34; but after testing and patience with the brush I realized that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is absolutely comfortable and feels like a super high quality brush! I currently own a double-sided ACE brush and the hard side really works for me so I was looking for something new and professional. This brush did not disappoint for it&#x27;s price! I have really coarse, dense curls and this brush still gets through to my scalp at 1.5&#x27;&#x27; curl length (comfortable exfoliation) without any scalp irritation. Update: Even after a 2 month wolfing session (hair at 3&amp;#34; curl length) this brush continues to do it&#x27;s job! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The Annie 2075 looks good, feels good, and works pretty well for the price. I would say to give it a shot but definitely do some research based upon your own personal hair style needs!</li>
    <li> Bristles are way TOO HARD!</li>
    <li> I love my Annie. A lot of people brag about the Crown Quality Brushes, but I don&#x27;t think an expensive brush is needed. Now I am thinking about a Kent. Which is very expensive, but I want one. ☺</li>
    <li> Great brush....not too hard not too soft!! I use it daily!!</li>
