      <li>and I love this line.</li>
      <li>This shampoo lathers great and gently cleanses</li>
      <li>It helps give my hair more body and keeps my hair smoother and makes it easier to style.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, the smell, the way it lathers and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Store brands are better than this.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get when I ordered this because some stores sell the product</li>
      <li>Product is awesome, arrived earlier then scheduled.</li>
      <li>I love using this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I used to love Nexxus...</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this product, but I do still love and recommend the Assure Replenishing Color Care Shampoo formula.</li>
      <li>:) I will go through 2 shampoo bottles for every 1 conditioner bottle.</li>
      <li>intended but now that I think about it, this shampoo is good for that too;)</li>
      <li>I think I smells great, and it makes my hair feel very soft.  </li>
      <li>plus it is very good for daily shower.</li>
      <li>We have allergies, which are particularly strong in the spring and summer.  </li>
      <li>The strong and highly sweet scent of this shampoo triggered an allergy reaction in my girlfriend while I was using it.  </li>
      <li>Works well to get your hair clean without drying it out.</li>
      <li>You do not need a lot for your hair to make it feel clean.</li>
      <li>Overall is a good product.</li>
      <li>however, I still need a great conditioner to follow because once the shampoo is rinsed out I can feel how much damage there is still left</li>
      <li>My hair is so much dryer now and tangles easily.</li>
      <li>The pump is great, fits into my shower caddy with ease and eliminates wasted product at the bottom of bottles.</li>
      <li>I really like that my hair is smooth and shiny after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The shampoo is fantastic and has really helped with my split ends.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and my hair feels so soft before I even use the conditioner</li>
      <li>but  certinally not overpoweringly so, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is lovely and far better than the smaller bottles I used to get for around $11.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants to change up and try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;Price for this at Amazon is better or comparable to most places locally and you cannot beat Amazon 2 day prime shipping</li>
      <li>I did however find most cost effective to purchase the large bottle online instead of buying the regular bottle at local stores..</li>
      <li>Aside from that it leaves my very fine, naturally blonde hair clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I definitly reccomend this product to anyone who is wondering if spending so much money on a shampoo is really worth it or not (like i was.)  </li>
      <li>The trick is to not use too much product!</li>
      <li>Nexxus&#x27;s Promend shampoo made my hair feel baby soft with the first use!  </li>
      <li>My hair is softer, my curls really come to life</li>
      <li>I have combined before with the whole kit, conditioner and leave it</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel very moisturized and protected.  </li>
      <li>I used some cheap shampoo for a week and definitely noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>I regrettably lost so much hair</li>
      <li>I feel as though I got alot of bang for my buck, more than I expected</li>
      <li>Not only is the scent overpowering while you are using the product in the bath, it stays on the hair, triggering a repeated allergic reaction in those sensitive to strong scents.</li>
      <li>Best shampoo ever for long thick hair!!</li>
      <li>Most products are harsh and drying on my hair, cause tangles etc, but I find I don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner with this stuff.</li>
      <li>Once I started using this, I noticed my hair was greasier than normal and looked at the name.  </li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this as a daily shampoo for anyone with fine hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to its claims.</li>
      <li>this is the first review I have ever written about ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and if I haven&#x27;t already said enough, I think that speaks volumes (no punn</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and have tried every product there is.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money as it is not salon quality anymore.</li>
      <li>While shampooing I can feel how soft it makes my hair feel...</li>
      <li>Everyone comments on how healthy and thick my hair is, and I am 29.</li>
      <li>I used 1 full pump of the shampoo and only a half pump of the conditioner</li>
      <li>A small amount of soap like a dime size will leave your hair feeling refreshed and clean after every use.</li>
      <li>My hair is fragile, curly, fine, frizzy and slow growing....</li>
      <li>I have dark, curly, brown hair and this shampoo cleans it very well.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my dry fizzy bangs soft and silky once again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love using this shampoo.  I think I smells great, and it makes my hair feel very soft.  have this item on auto ship</li>
    <li> i will continue use this shampoo . this is really nice shampoo, now my hair look nice and also  i will buy conditioner from this brand.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> We have allergies, which are particularly strong in the spring and summer.  The strong and highly sweet scent of this shampoo triggered an allergy reaction in my girlfriend while I was using it.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone who has or lives with anyone with allergies.  Not only is the scent overpowering while you are using the product in the bath, it stays on the hair, triggering a repeated allergic reaction in those sensitive to strong scents.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is lovely and far better than the smaller bottles I used to get for around $11. The pump is great, fits into my shower caddy with ease and eliminates wasted product at the bottom of bottles. Now all I need is conditioner!</li>
    <li> This is the second time i bought and it&#x27;s very good for my split end. I have fine oily hair in the roots but the ends are messy due the dying and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair heavy at all. It last for a few days. I have combined before with the whole kit, conditioner and leave it, it&#x27;s a plus when using the 3. But alone it does work good too.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling greasy</li>
    <li> I have hair almost to my waist and I love this line. Everyone comments on how healthy and thick my hair is, and I am 29. I used some cheap shampoo for a week and definitely noticed a difference. The bottom two inches of my hair kept looking snarly.</li>
    <li> After having a great experience with the [[ASIN:B001EO5WYU Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo, 33.8Ounce Bottle]], I tried this formula, along with the Promend Conditioner. My hair is so much dryer now and tangles easily. I cannot recommend this product, but I do still love and recommend the Assure Replenishing Color Care Shampoo formula.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever tried Pro-mend but for me its the replacement for the Humectress. I used Humectress for years, but recently they changed the ingredients and I didn&#x27;t like it as well, but Pro Mend does the trick, plus it conditions your hair so well you do not need conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo regularly because I have been trying to grow out my hair.  I usually have to get my hair cut every 3 months or so due to split ends.  I mean, I don&#x27;t have to, but I really hate split ends.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any at all and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to go 9 months or even a year without cutting it.  **Crosses fingers**</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried every product there is. This is the one that takes my curls, keeps my hair hydrated, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. The trick is to not use too much product! If you do, it will weigh it down. I used 1 full pump of the shampoo and only a half pump of the conditioner and it leaves my hair perfect. After the shower I then use a very small amount of Shu Uemura Essence Absolue Oil-In Cream to my damp hair and I am done. I let it air dry and my hair is naturally beautiful:) I will go through 2 shampoo bottles for every 1 conditioner bottle.</li>
    <li> They have changes this product.  I used to love Nexxus...Do not waste your money as it is not salon quality anymore.</li>
    <li> I never had this happen before but it tangled my hair so bad.  I will never buy this again from this vendor, my friend thinks it is counterfeit this ruined my long hair.  I ran out my other bottle from another vendor it was unavailable so I tried this. I regrettably lost so much hair I cried</li>
    <li> My hair kept on falling out and felt damged and dry after using this when it was still wet. My hair was in great condition before.</li>
    <li> I have dark, curly, brown hair and this shampoo cleans it very well. You do not need a lot for your hair to make it feel clean. A small amount of soap like a dime size will leave your hair feeling refreshed and clean after every use. My hair was damaged before I started using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome, arrived earlier then scheduled. However, shampoo leaked out during transportation, was a leaky mess. Overall is a good product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get when I ordered this because some stores sell the product but they do not have nexxus in the bottle but that was not the case with this seller.  Works well to get your hair clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling like straw and coated with paste. So mad I wasted my money. Store brands are better than this. Will never buy this brand again!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I have found that HAS NOT damaged my hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I researched the product before purchase. It didn&#x27;t live up to its claims. I went back to Therappe Shampoo and Humectress Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Best best best shampoo ever!! Enough said!!</li>
    <li> This is excellent shampoo for my hair. It helps give my hair more body and keeps my hair smoother and makes it easier to style. Some bodifying shampoos leave your hair dry, but this cleans it well without drying it. Superior product.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair but oily skin and hair this product Keeps my hair shiny and manageable.  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like candy, I wanna eat it lol. Aside from that it leaves my very fine, naturally blonde hair clean and soft. Most products are harsh and drying on my hair, cause tangles etc, but I find I don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner with this stuff. I condition every couple days. Would definitely recommend this as a daily shampoo for anyone with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and my hair feels so soft before I even use the conditioner plus it is very good for daily shower.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my dry fizzy bangs soft and silky once again. I have been using it on my processed hair for years because it surpasses all other previos products I tried.</li>
    <li> Mends my split ends.  Love it.</li>
    <li> What a difference from the cheaper brands I was using. My hair is softer, my curls really come to life and I don&#x27;t have to use it every day to keep my hair looking it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is fantastic and has really helped with my split ends. The problem I have is the dispensing spout was destroyed by the time it rolled around the box during shipment. Doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of product but definitely inconvenient.</li>
    <li> While shampooing I can feel how soft it makes my hair feel...however, I still need a great conditioner to follow because once the shampoo is rinsed out I can feel how much damage there is still left (I&#x27;ve done a lot of highlighting in the past)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and noticed a BIG difference between it and alll other cheaper brands of shampoo that I&#x27;ve used in my 27years.  My hair is fragile, curly, fine, frizzy and slow growing....I have been growing it out for years!  My hair is down to my hips now.  I haven&#x27;t trimmed my ends as I should&#x27;ve until the past year either.  This shampoo lathers great and gently cleanses (yet it does not feel like it&#x27;s stripping my hair, no squeaky feeling, just nice n&#x27; clean!)  Nexxus&#x27;s Promend shampoo made my hair feel baby soft with the first use!  In addition it defined my curls....all the way down to it&#x27;s ends! (which&#x27;ve always looked frizzy and unhealthy, untill now!)  This shampoo smells great to top it all off, like vanilla...but  certinally not overpoweringly so, it&#x27;s just right.  I definitly reccomend this product to anyone who is wondering if spending so much money on a shampoo is really worth it or not (like i was.)  I feel as though I got alot of bang for my buck, more than I expected actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. this is the first review I have ever written about ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and if I haven&#x27;t already said enough, I think that speaks volumes (no punn intended but now that I think about it, this shampoo is good for that too;)</li>
    <li> Of course I ordered this months ago on my subscribe and save and because the bottles looked identical, I failed to look.  Once I started using this, I noticed my hair was greasier than normal and looked at the name.  It was Humectress- not Promend. Unfortuantely the same goes for the conditioner I purchasd at the same time.  I also have another shampoo/conditioner from a previous sub &amp; save order.  I looked at that yesterday and noticed they sent me yet another shampoo and conditioner.  It looks like they are just getting rid of whatever they needed without regard for what was actually ordered.  So disappointed both in the seller and myself for trusting too much.  DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING YOU BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever for long thick hair!!</li>
    <li> Creat shampoo for curly hair</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair oily, even less than 24 hours after I wash</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, the smell, the way it lathers and how it makes my hair feel. I wouldn&#x27;t use alone because my hair definitely needs conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It smells great, smooths split ends, and you cannot beat this price! Works great with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Only Shampoo that I use. Hair Stylist recommended this to me a few years ago&lt;br /&gt; I really like that my hair is smooth and shiny after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to change up and try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;Price for this at Amazon is better or comparable to most places locally and you cannot beat Amazon 2 day prime shipping</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel very moisturized and protected.  I think this shampoo would be good for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the product. I did however find most cost effective to purchase the large bottle online instead of buying the regular bottle at local stores..</li>
