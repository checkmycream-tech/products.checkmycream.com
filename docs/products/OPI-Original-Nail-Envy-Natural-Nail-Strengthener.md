      <li>I put two coats on bare nails, then add an additional coat the next day.  </li>
      <li>The results of nail growth are within the first few weeks.</li>

<li> Plus it dries faster than expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2013 and this products works way better than sadly Hanson hard as nail or any other nails strengthening products.</li>
<li> would highly recommend this to anyone with weak nail issues.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but none of them compare.....</li>
<li> I have really thin brittle nails and this works great even as an base coat before polish.</li>
<li> My nails have always grown fast but because they were literally paper thin and weak, they would bend and peel so bad that I couldn&#x27;t get them past the tips of my fingers before they&#x27;d start catching and ripping.</li>
<li> My nails are thin and tear.  </li>

    <li> Fast delivery!  Love OPI products!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  This is my second bottle.  I put two coats on bare nails, then add an additional coat the next day.  Usually 3 coats will last a week or more which is more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Plus it dries faster than expected.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t find it anymore at Target so I was glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite some time.  I love that it goes on smoothly and is a great base coat, but also strengthens my brittle nails!!!</li>
    <li> To say that OPI Nail Envy has answered my nail prayers would be a gross understatement. I originally ordered the 1/8oz size to be able to test it without paying full price and then being stuck with a product that didn&#x27;t deliver the results I wanted. After the the very first application I knew I&#x27;d stumbled upon something truly wonderful. My nails have always grown fast but because they were literally paper thin and weak, they would bend and peel so bad that I couldn&#x27;t get them past the tips of my fingers before they&#x27;d start catching and ripping. After the first coat they immediately felt stronger and didn&#x27;t bend even when *trying* to bend them. Then the second and third coats - absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s been about a month since first trying the product and my nails have had to be trimmed twice - yes, TWICE!! I&#x27;ve even been able to use colored polish without feeling self conscious about how short and unhealthy they looked. Thank you OPI for such an outstanding product. I will continue to be a loyal customer and use Nail Envy religiously. I&#x27;ve been raving about it to anyone that will listen!</li>
    <li> Product is great and came in time.</li>
    <li> This product is great and works just as it says as long as you follow the instructions.  It totally met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This product is my holy gravel for my long, strong nails. I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2013 and this products works way better than sadly Hanson hard as nail or any other nails strengthening products. This product helps my nails to grow and stay nice and long. My nails are a 1 inch, from cuticle to the end of my nails. And this is the only product that I find that helps with chipping. Ever since I been using this product my nails don&#x27;t chip and many mistakes my nails for acrylic.</li>
    <li> Great product for strengthening the nails.  Use if as directed for wonderful results.</li>
    <li> In a short time, my nails have really shown improvement!</li>
    <li> I like it, sometimes it does well for my nails others it doesn&#x27;t so I guess sometimes it is just me...</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and it does not start to peel as long as you reapply every other day and once a week redo them. I feel like it strengthens my nails.</li>
    <li> awesome product that really works when used as directed</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps my nails from splitting, tearing and cracking.  I have really thin brittle nails and this works great even as an base coat before polish.</li>
    <li> My nails are thin and tear.  If I use Nail Envy EXACTLY AS DIRECTED, my nails grow and look great.  I&#x27;ve never had nails this good in my life!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail hardener.  I have tried them all. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t peel and it really works!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting</li>
    <li> It seems to dry out my nails more than usual. I used this product before and loved it. I don&#x27;t know if the  formula for it has changed or if its just my system.</li>
    <li> I am a nail biter, but this has helped me to stop. The results of nail growth are within the first few weeks.</li>
    <li> Works but not sure it&#x27;s any better than other things on the market. Can&#x27;t really justify the price.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have been using it for years it really is a strengthener.</li>
    <li> If you want strong healthy nails this is the product!! I&#x27;ve tried other products but none of them compare.....it usually takes at least 2 weeks before you notice nail growth but definitely see healthier nails the first week</li>
    <li> The nail envy that i received did not match the same nail envy that i purchased at a salon. The color is different and the smell.</li>
    <li> Started wearing OPI Nail Envy to help grow my nails. I&#x27;m a server so my hands are always in the water, which make my nails thinner. They always cracked and peeled, my nails would never grow out. Now after starting Nail Envy, I have to cut back my nails because they grow out too long.... Love the look of my hands with nails. Thank you so much for your product...</li>
    <li> Quick  service  love opi</li>
    <li> Nail Envy is great for strenghtening nails and stopping the splitting some nails do! I have used it befor and recommended to friends also!</li>
    <li> The best nail strengthener I&#x27;ve ever used!! My nails would break so easily, so I would have to keep them trimmed really short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a little more length so I decided to try this. I picked mine up at a local store. I absolutely love it!! My nails are soooooooo strong now. And I have the length I want because my nails aren&#x27;t breaking now!  I noticed a big difference after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone with weak nail issues. This can be worn alone or under polish.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I love opi nail envy!</li>
