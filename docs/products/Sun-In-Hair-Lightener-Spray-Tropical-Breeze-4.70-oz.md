<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for hair lightening. It has neer made my hair brittle, and I&#x27;ve used it often.</li>
    <li> First let me say that my natural hair color is a medium/ light brown with lots of natural highlights. I wanted to use something that would lighten my hair without getting rid of my highlights. When I first used Sun In you couldn&#x27;t tell very much but after awhile the results were clear. I understand that some people may say that \\&quot;Sun In will turn your hair orange\\&quot; this is not true for people without a red undertone. I do not so my hair did not turn orange at all! the only downside to this product is that it does dry your hair out a little bit. Many people say in other reviews that it can dry your hair out like crazy and if this is true for you I suggest that you stop using it very frequently and maybe reduce the amount of times you use it in a short period of time. Also because I did boot want my hair to dry out every week I use a deep conditioner to help revive my hair from any damage that the Sun In may have caused. Over all this is a great product I would just advise that you evaluate your hair type before using it to prevent any un wanted results! Good Luck! :)</li>
    <li> I have to disagree with some of the Reviewers that put this product down, have used Sun In Hairlightener for many years and still use it today and now it&#x27;s much improved to what it was when I first started using Sun In which is when it first came out, even though I did not purchase this from Amazon.com this time, I am currently using it to lighten my light brown to blonde hair, use to have blonde hair when I was younger but since I am a lot older now my hair turned both brown and blonde and has been that way for some years now,so far Sun In has not hurt my hair or turned it any other color except Golden Blonde which I want this color anyway, and the condition of my hair has improved alot since I have been using Sun In, I am very pleased with the results thus far, wish I did not have to go to the salon to have my hair colored to cover the gray, I would leave the Golden Blonde color it has turned with Sun In, must admit though it has taken me along time to lighten the darker hair, but is looking real nice now, I have no complaints, I would not trade Sun In for those harsh salon hair bleaches. You simply can not go wrong with a product that has been around for many many years such as Sun In products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sun-In since I was about 16 or 17 years old.  I just turned 30 last month and I&#x27;m still using it.  I naturally have very light brown hair and this stuff does an amazing job giving me awesome sun-streaked blonde highlights.  I love it!  I use it all winter with my blow dryer, which works just as well as the sun does during the summer.  I love how I don&#x27;t have to dye or bleach my hair to get the color I want because Sun-In does it for me.  All it takes is a few quick sprays when I get out of the shower, a blow dry, and that&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s so quick and easy and gives me great results.  Plus, it&#x27;s super affordable!  I also find that it really helps condition my hair as well.  Five stars here!</li>
    <li> I have used Sun-in for years. It takes one week at the beach and my hair has perfect summery highlights. I have brown hair; if you want blonde hair and you are a brunette too you have to be able to keep using this product for a few days to achieve the perfect shade. I spray in streaks to get those chunky highlight effects, not all over, that will lighten all of your hair. And yes it does go orange if you don&#x27;t lift the color enough that is just from not using the product as intended. You lift the color gradually (apply in the same spots everyday until it is light enough); it has been the same process since my mother was a teenager.</li>
    <li> I have black hair and it worked fine for me (not really turning red) as I had hoped. I just wanted to lighten my hair a little bit and this did a pretty good job!</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair that will naturally bleach in the sun already. But as I have gotten older I&#x27;ve found the process seems to take longer. With this product I can spray my hair and get the same lightening that it would take me an entire weekend out in the sun to achieve. It looks utterly natural, and in my case it may be. I am not sure how it might work on other&#x27;s hair as I&#x27;ve no way to test it. But if the sun positively effects your hair color this may be just the thing to speed up the process.</li>
    <li> I have been using SUN-IN ORIGINAL for years and now they replace it with SUN-IN Tropical Breeze!  I tried ordering the Original and instead they sent me Tropical Breeze even though the ORIGINAL is on this page.  The ORIGINAL worked great making beautiful highlights, but the Tropical Breeze does nothing and made my hair drab.  Don&#x27;t Order from AmericaRx.com or MyOTCstore.com they will only send you Topical Breeze not ORIGINAL!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really light blonde hair all my life.  When I was little it was almost snow white and I hated it because it made me stand out from the other little girls, but as I got older and it darkened just a little, it was a beautiful shade. The exception is when I spent a lot of time in the sun, then it would turn to that fake looking bleach blonde again and nobody ever believed it was natural.  Now that I&#x27;m even older, my hair has thankfully become a slightly darker blonde, and for a few years now the roots have started turning a champagne shade. Every couple of months I will spray a little Sun In and massage it into the roots for maybe 2 days in a row, then blow dry it, and that is good for a couple more months.  It lightens it enough to where it looks more like the other grown out hair, but not fake.  After spraying, the roots are a tad bit of a darker blonde, so it looks totally natural.  I use a really good leave-in conditioner so it never dries out my hair, as some people have mentioned it does to their hair.  I have read comments where people say they can&#x27;t believe they make this product anymore because the number of true blondes is decreasing, but I for one hope they always have it around for minorities like me!  Someday I&#x27;ll probably just let my hair go to it&#x27;s natural champagne shade, as my grandma&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s did, but until then, I&#x27;ll be using Sun In regularly.</li>
    <li> I love it, it lightens the hair with out those harsh chemicals.. But hard to find in stores, so if you can find it grab a few</li>
    <li> this works just how i remember it working.  it came in a matter of only a couple of days.  very pleased with it.  it was so simple to order and start using!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how the sun-in would work on my hair, but after using it for over 6 months already, I really like it. It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair at all, and it gives it a very nice gold natural-looking color. It also smells very nice, and you can notice the effects soon after using it. I believe it works better if a blow dryer is used, instead of waiting for the sun to get the effect. Very nice product overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for almost an year and my hair looks amazing.  I&#x27;m a natural blond and now my hair is even blonder and shinner.</li>
    <li> I was born a blonde but as I got older my hair color changed and now I have a dark brown hair color. My mother used sun in on my hair years ago and it worked amazing, Kept the blonde as long as it could before we gave up and said its just going to happen and I cant change it so I let the brown come in. Now 25 years later I have a beautiful little girl who is a blonde and I just know she is going to probably loose her blonde hair to but I think why not give it a shot. I will be buying this product for her. I swear by this stuff. I just cant believe the product is still going strong</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using the hair dryer method</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have jet black hair (hispanic). I took Sun In with me on vacation. I sprayed it in my hair (crown only) on my way out to the beach/pool everyday for 3-4 days and voila, it turned my hair color a warm chestnut brown. I got many compliments and everyone back at work thinks it was just due to too much sun. Looks very natural. I have to say, I only sprayed it a bit, I didn&#x27;t soak my hair.  I would give it 5 stars but have to take 1 back for the stinky scent, even still it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for others to notice.</li>
    <li> I have a natural light brown hair color and after using this product 3 times a week. After one1 month of use my hair was a dark strawberry blonde, after 2 months, my hair became a light golden blonde. Both colors were superbly shiny especially compared to my dull natural color. Since heat is what activates it, there was slight damage to my hair but nothing compared to what hair dye does after just a few color treatments. My sister who has natural dark brown hair decided to use it as well. Her hair became a shiny light brown(with a slight reddish tent). It was gorgeous. She had less visual damage than i did. But everyone&#x27;s hair is different and takes products differently. Some get more red then others and some have more damage then others. Which is why, like with hair dye, you should always do a strand test.</li>
    <li> I have golden hair color and this worked amazing.  I would spray it and use a blowdryer and it got my hair pretty light after using it just a few times. . I love how my hair looks now. i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Saw this in my local walmart, I was a bit skeptical just because it reminded me of putting peroxide in your hair... No one wants that orange/brassy look. They say not to use it on color treated hair, but I do. I&#x27;m a caramel blonde with strawberry highlights, I&#x27;m a mixed with black and have loose curls. This is heaven in a bottle for anyone wanting to touch up their faded blonde, highlights, or even wanting to go up a few shades. I even used this on BLACK hair, yes, black dyed hair and I got the prettiest brown highlights. Works perfect with a blow dryer but sitting out in the sun, going to the beach or the pool, or just enjoying your day, you&#x27;ll get SPECTACULAR results. I sprayed it in my hair only two days on my faded color treated hair, which was looking more brown than blonde. Four days later, after hitting up the pool twice, I have BRIGHT blonde hair again.... ALL OVER RESULTS! This is a miracle in a bottle. I even sprayed a little on a q-tip and brushed it on my eyebrows that had black hair growing in, theyre blonde too, with no irritation and I have sensitive skin. So don&#x27;t go and buy a whole new box of hair color just buy this! Its not damaging either, I usually do my typical co-wash, just do a deep leave in conditioner if your hair is more prone to breakage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall it won&#x27;t lighten your dark roots, but it will lighten the roots growing in on your hair line.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light brown hair. Sun In is a great way for me to go blond that is very easy. Just spray it on, and head out into the California sun. I also feel Sun In gives my hair nice body and makes it fuller. People have commented on my hair, thinking I was a natural blond.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they made a product to just do the roots of your hair. To spray from the bottle just the roots is alittle difficult.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, a very easy way to go blond with a natural look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sun In off and on for many years and I love the gentle lightening effects of this product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to lighten my hair to dye it without bleaching it, since I&#x27;m already a blonde, and because the traditional &amp;#34;lemon juice in your hair and sitting in the sun&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really work when I live in an area that gets about 1-3 hours of actual sunlight a day during the winter. This stuff works great, and it has definitely lightened my hair quite a few shades since I bought it. My only qualm is that although it works, it takes a long time for it to work--I just finished my seventh application and my hair is still only a shade or two lighter than it was before. It would be better if it worked faster.</li>
    <li> So I am 13 years old! When I started out I had strawberry-blonde hair! I have used it all summer long and it turned my hair a lovely blonde. But here is the thing! It&#x27;s not really for people with brown hair because it turns your hair to like an auburn! And btw it says that on the bottle! But for people with dirty blond hair and such this is great! But when you use it you have to spray at the roots and through the rest of your hair. And DON&#x27;T SOAK IT IN SUN IN! That will just mess up your hair! It&#x27;s a long process and it does fade a little after time but it won&#x27;t go back to your original color(well not completely anyway). Either way it&#x27;s a great product! But just remember it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I was pretty hesitant in believing this stuff would work. I had used it when I was a little kid and never put much faith in it. Now, however, I use it on the darker part of my hair to try to even out my hair color. Trying to eliminate how much I dye my hair. Sun In is doing it&#x27;s job great. Blow drying doesn&#x27;t work as well as actual sunlight, but it does help. I use it every day, for best results.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great - I used to use it quite a few years ago when going on vacation, but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere in stores.  Product arrived in a timely manner, however it was leaking a bit when I received it.  It appeared to be properly sealed, but the bottle was not completely full when I took it out of the package.  I&#x27;m not blaming this on human error - it could have just been packaged improperly.  Other than that, the Sun In worked very well and I was happy to find it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 5 years. I have dirty blonde hair and this adds blonde streaks for really cheap! I usually use this product in the winter when my hair gets darker from there being not enough sun so I just use this w/ a blow dryer and get great results everytime</li>
    <li> Did a slow phased-in look.  And no over night drastic changes.  I am happy I got what I wanted.  Great!</li>
    <li> Well i heard some good things about sun-in and other bad ones, all i can say is that it works for me and the few people i know that have used it, however i&#x27;m sure that not everyone&#x27;s hair reacts the same to it so i understand why it might have destroyed some people&#x27;s hair and i&#x27;m really sorry to hear that. I have brown hair and i started using sun-in and not really sitting out in the sun but just going out on my daily routine, i live in Florida so it is always sunny. When i started using it, it wokred immediately and everytime i washed my hair i sprayed it in, but it was working too fast nad my hair turned a bit orange so i stopped using it for about a month and now i just started using it again on my roots to get them to match the rest of my hair, now the difference betwen me and the other user on here is that when i stopped using it my hair did not continue to get lighter it got darker, so now it is a beautiful light brown and reddish tone, which looks natural, and it didn&#x27;t damage my hair like dyes do. I think that if you have a problem with it maybe you should not spend a long time in the sun and maybe not spray a lot into your hair, i&#x27;m just saying from experience, i spray a little all over and go out for a walk or something short term not even a half hour because since i live in florida i get prolonged sun exposure anyway and i don&#x27;t want to over do it, that&#x27;s my advice to you all.</li>
    <li> Works very well, is very easy to spray and apply, smells great, and gives your hair a very naturally lightened look.  It&#x27;s not going to make you platinum blonde, or give you symmetrical highlights, but it does work and acts very naturally with your hair, which keeps your hair healthy.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with any color hair.</li>
    <li> Well first of all i got to say i love sun in! it really changes your haircolor without the bleach damage.. &lt;br /&gt;i think that the people who complain about their hair turning orange its because they natural hair is dark,if you read the product information sun-in is meant to lighten light brown hair to blonde..the first stage to go from dark brown-black to blonde,even done by a proffesional with bleach,hair ALWAYS turns red-light red (orange) then different shades of blond the more you leave the bleach on the lighter it gets.. &lt;br /&gt;so if your natural hair is dark brown and you use sun-in,as it lightens color gradually of course you are gonna get red hair!,so this is only for light brown hair to blonde..unless you dont mind becoming orange and then keep using this product until your hair turns blonde...but you know if your hair is too dark just bleach it and forget about it!! &lt;br /&gt;as for people complaining about hair damage..maybe they overdo it....i do it little by little and my hair is now a beautiful shade of light blonde (my natural colour is dirty blonde) so now i have the same colour i had when i was little :&#x3D;) so its cool.</li>
    <li> Last week I used Clairol foam to dye my hair back to its natural medium golden brown from a blue streak... and it came out a dead dark auburn (not to mention the mess on my sink that&#x27;s still there). It looked AWFUL. I&#x27;d heard of Sun-In before and knew the bottle said not to use on colored hair. But a lot of people had tried it and said it was fine, so I used it on a hidden section first.     The spray is easy to use and the smell is very nice. A hairdryer later and that section was slightly lighter. If figured if it wasn&#x27;t light enough I could do it again later so I did my whole head. It looks GREAT. It took out the deadening greyish red that looks so unnatural with my skin and replaced it with my natural gold.    So yes, this product works great on at least my colored hair. But always test it first!</li>
    <li> Sun-In is the best product on the market. I have dark hair and have been using Sun-In for a good 20 years. When I first started using it my hair got copper highlights which turned to light blond streaks over time. Of course my hair is no longer dark. Sun Inn will not ruin your hair, it will give you beautiful highlights and if you soak your hair it will lighten all the hair without damaging it. What I wish Sun-In would do is to create a product that gives the same effect during winter - to be used without the sun. I have used bleach during the winter which destroyed my hair, so during the winter months I have to colour my hair brown as in Seattle the sun does not shine but 2 and a half months of the year.</li>
    <li> it did lighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;i still use it&lt;br /&gt;but since i have some dark hair, it did kind of had a reddish look&lt;br /&gt;probably because of the peroxide&lt;br /&gt;if you have even kid of dark hair, don&#x27;t use this&lt;br /&gt;unless you want to be a strawberry blonde</li>
    <li> It really lightens your hair considerably, but also damages it too. But the damage is nowhere close to other hair products or dyes. My hair is dark to medium brown and I didn&#x27;t have any of the mentioned &#x27;redness&#x27; but only lighter highlights.</li>
    <li> The seller did fantastic! Everything was exactly as stated. Came in right on time. Recommend to others to purchase things from this seller. The reason for only 4 stars is for the product itself. Because my hair turned out more reddish looking than anticipated. One of the main ingredients is hydrogen peroxide. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It works as it says...Awesome!</li>
    <li> The Sun-In hair lighter is absolutely brilliant. I have very dark, almost black hair &amp; this hair spray slowly turned my hair to a brown shade with a red undertone. I got many compliments on it. However, I did notice some dryness in my hair, but that was taken care of with Moroccan oil &amp; leave-in-conditioner. I recommend it to all hair types!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually trust products that make big promises (e.g. toothpaste that whiten teeth) but this product really works! You have to be patient with it as it works differently for everyone. However, it does change your hair color over time. My hair is naturally dark brown but currently it is ombre. I have been spraying Sun In and my roots (the dark brown part) are turning light brown and the bottom half of my hair is turning blonder. It looks super natural and nice. I also agree with its conditioning effect. My hair feels smoother and healthier. Overall, I really recommend this product as a smarter investment to lightening hair without the awful dry damages that bleaching can do to it!</li>
    <li> I have used Sun In Lemon since I was in middle school (I am now graduating from university with my bachelors). I naturally have dirty blonde hair but to keep up the golden blonde I had in my childhood, I use this product. Like the directions say, keep applying until you get to your desired shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will apply when my hair was wet, spray it in, and then leave the house and go about my business. I also will apply it onto dry hair and blow dry... works well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never gotten dry or stringy and I hardly ever get split ends. My hair is quite long and it looks silky and beautiful! I&#x27;ve actually died my hair darker and lighter with both all over color and highlights in the past. I have used Sun In Lemon in both cases and it still works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip for those of you who get a yellow or brassy tone after lightening, find a (dark) purple shampoo and use 1x every week or every other week depending on your needs. I only had to do this recently after dying my light hair dark brown and then lightening with sun in... it turned out slightly yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures attached are my natural color using Sun In to lighten the bottoms as well as all over use during summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and happy lightening!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve just achieved a slightly orangey hue which is more or less noticeable depending on the lighting. Maybe this product doesn&#x27;t work on naturally blond hair. It takes SO long to get any kind of coverage and distribution with the fine mist from the tiny nozzle; I&#x27;m going to try it again by pouring the product into a bowl and dipping a comb in it. I&#x27;ve already purchased the Wella toner and developer in order to reduce the brassy quality and bring back a more natural ashy blond. By the time I get done with multiple applications plus heat trying to get the sun-in to work and then fixing the color with toner and trying to deep condition the strawlike texture, I will absolutely have spent more money and much more time than if I&#x27;d just gone and gotten salon highlights. I think this is mostly for dark haired girls and/or teenagers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 years now and I absolutely love it! I am a natural blonde but with age (as we all probably know) my naturally bleach blonde hair turned into more of a golden/dirty blonde :( and I did not want that. Since my mom refused to let me dye my hair, I did my research and found this miracle of a product.&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY WORKS! At some point in those past 4 years I got my hair to very very very light (almost looked like it was dyed) blonde that was a beautiful color with streaks of lighter and darker highlights. And that is my favorite part about this product. If you look up close to the the hair (after you&#x27;ve been using it for a while) you will see that there is at least 10 different shades of blonde in that little bunch of hair. It doesn&#x27;t look tacky as it may seem from my description but rather it looks very beautiful and natural (just like the sun did it ;) ).&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a year because I decided I wanted darker hair and I mean it did look like growing out hair for a while but that&#x27;s because I was lazy and didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST WAY TO USE IT:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hair is damp but not too wet because you&#x27;re about to blowdry it until it&#x27;s dry. Brush your hair out so it&#x27;s not tangled, apply some heat protectant for all the heat you&#x27;re about to use on your hair and comb it through again. If you are serious about lightening your hair, I suggest you do it in layers. Section of horizontal layers from bottom to top of your hair and follow this procedure. Spray the product everywhere you&#x27;d like to see your hair lightened (I also like to take off the orange flap thing because I just find it annoying while spraying). Make sure to BRUSH YOUR HAIR THROUGH once all the product you want in that layer is in! This is very important because if you don&#x27;t do this you might end up with a solid line of roots once your hair starts to grow out and it won&#x27;t look as natural because the color is concentrated in one place.Go through the stands with a blowdryer on hot and high (it burns so take breaks if you need to). Once that layer is dry, move on to the next level until you reach top of your head. By now your hair should be fully dry. If you want you can also straighten your hair after this for the added effect concentrating the heat on the sprayed areas but just be aware of how much heat you&#x27;re putting on your hair all at once (and don&#x27;t complain later that it&#x27;s drying out your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to have more concentrations in certain areas of your head (such as face framing) then you should take a cotton ball, spray the product on it and then run the cotton ball down the strands you want most product on. I did this for the hair line around my face and it looked amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did only the top half of my hair so that the bottom is still natural and darker than the top layer because I like it and I&#x27;m too lazy to go through every hair on my head :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the bad things:&lt;br /&gt;-Just like any hair coloring product, you have to keep up with the roots if they do grow out because this lightness isn&#x27;t fading away anywhere (FYI)!&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s challenging to color all of your hair because it&#x27;s just so much effort. Ask a friend if you have to to make sure you cover all the hair you want lightened with the product. When I went crazy with making my top layers super light, I didn&#x27;t like how the layers under that were peeking through and were significantly darker than the top :/ Also, don&#x27;t forget to color the hair when you were to put it in a ponytail but that&#x27;s just my personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a WONDERFUL product and I am so glad I found it and I do not look like a box blonde. It&#x27;s looks natural and beautiful and it&#x27;s super easy and CHEAP! :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t die that much, it is not that noticeable, but it is OK.</li>
    <li> I have always had extremely healthy hair, and I&#x27;ve never had split ends before using this product, but now my hair is brittle and my ends are extremely frayed. My hair lightened considerably, though it&#x27;s a bit brassy. Proceed with caution, because I regret using this.</li>
    <li> i was super excited to receive this product only to realize it was practically empty because it spilt... everywhere. when i tried to email them it said that it failed so now i have half a bottle left and i haven&#x27;t even used it</li>
    <li> I sprayed it about 4-5/week for 2 weeks and my hair went from South Asian black to an American dark brown. Could go lighter but I&#x27;m happy where it&#x27;s at! Great product! Wish it were a bit stronger but nonetheless very effective.</li>
    <li> My hair is very weird and it doesn&#x27;t take to hair color well at all. permanent color washes out. as a blonde, naturally when the winter hits my hair gets darker. i have been using sun in to give my hair back its natural sun kissed highlights. so many people complement me and ask me who did my hair. they are often surprised when i tell them it&#x27;s just sun in! this seller got me the product wuick and it was exatcly what i ordered!</li>
    <li> Works great even on my dark brown hair.  Have been getting a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> i have dirty blond hair and this made it a naturally looking light blond.  no one suspected anything other than i had been in the sun.  obviously, like any bleaching product, it&#x27;ll dry out your hair over time.  i keep my hair short, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue.  if you have brown hair, i&#x27;m not sure what would happen.  this isn&#x27;t for brown hair.</li>
    <li> Defiantly a good buy! I use it 4 times a week. I got highlights at a salon and didn&#x27;t like them! They were so dark so I started using this product! And the before picture is from 2 weeks ago! And this is my current hair at the moment! I love it! I&#x27;m also using the shimmer lights shampoo! Both products are really helping my hair get a nicer color!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sun-In for a few years now and adore it. I have naturally medium/dark brown hair. I used it all over to really lighten my hair a few years ago. It gave it a beautiful glow and a sort of golden tint. I dyed my hair dark again a while back and realized I no longer liked the dark colors (it was a dark, deep brown). So, I pulled out my Sun-In and over the course of about two weeks gradually lightened the ends of my hair and a bit of the top, giving it a natural ombre effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because, at least in my experience, it works to lighten any shade of brown/blond in a gradual, natural way. I love that I have control over how light it gets and where. I typically use it with a blow dryer just for the sake of time and ease, but I also keep a bottle in my beach bag and spray down the last couple inches of my hair whenever I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for a while, just to help freshen up the color and give it a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting ready to dye my hair a medium-auburn, and plan to test out Sun-In on the tips to see if it helps to lighten it (couldn&#x27;t find a lighter color I loved, plus I love the ombre effect in my hair!) or if it just makes it orange. Here&#x27;s hoping it doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve had great luck with it before so I&#x27;m hoping it works well for me now. I&#x27;ll probably edit or post another review with updates on that once I have clear results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and that the product works as amazingly for you as it does for me!</li>
    <li> I am at the age where the regular brown hair is starting to show some grey, which is really horrifying and dowdy looking. I travel all the time and have never been able to keep the same hair dresser and even if I did I just can&#x27;t get in enough to have my hair dyed.  The idea of &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34;is more horrifying than dowdiness.  So I squirted some of this on my hair like we used to do when I was in my teens and going to the beach, and just a little more the day after and presto, dowdiness gone.  So easy and such a great result. My hair is still brown but with the light highlights the grey just kind of blends in and I don&#x27;t look quite so dowdy anymore. And it is so easy. The only complaint is that the little closure on the spray has cut my finger, so be careful when using it. After I shampoo, I just spray some in after towel drying my hair and go.</li>
    <li> My lifeline - I use this instead of hair dye. My hair dresser gets mad at me because I think it&#x27;s bad for me, but I prefer to never dye my hair and just stick to sun in.</li>
    <li> received than expected.</li>
    <li> Kills your hair and will leave it gross feeling until you cut it...</li>
    <li> I used to have dark blonde hair and it turned my hair the most amazing blonde, everyone complimented me on it and a few hair stylists as well until I told them I used sun in they couldnt malign it enough (but proof is in the pudding) Also maligning sun in with their bleach scorched hair lol. Later my hair got darker but I still managed to end up with lovely blonde streaks and now my hair is very dark brown but it still works! It takes a lot longer mind you but once its blonde its blonde and as the roots grow out I just spray it as it lightens its really easy and cheap.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 different Sun-Ins in different years recently &amp; I agree with some other reviewers here, Sun-In does zero! I used to buy it in the past &amp; it worked. I love to get orange brown hair. That was my old natural color. Now I have natural medium dark brown with barely there orange.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to bleach or dye it. I loved the simple easy spray in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they changed the formula because of all of the idiots that complained it turned their hair orange when the bottle clearly warned them, ruined it for people like me who actually like \\&quot;orange\\&quot; hair. Many people like auburn etc hair. I hate yellow highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many people just decided to keep repeating the lie or truth that was their fault that it turns hair orange &amp; haven&#x27;t bought a bottle in years.&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone who wants orange hair or doesn&#x27;t want it reads this &amp; realizes you will not get orange hair you just might get zero like I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it like 20 times to barely get it to  start working I can&#x27;t do that or I&#x27;ll burn my head off because I have to use a blow dryer. I am too pale to sit in the sun all day &amp; hope it works. The fast working one allowed me to be in control of the color &amp; quickly touch up roots &amp; spray lighter or darker depending on how I wanted to grow my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention I&#x27;ve bought sun in in more than 1 of their different bottles &amp; none work. I recently checked closer &amp; they all have the same ingredients...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said on other reviews it works slower maybe to be easier on hair....I used to use gobs of it I have extremely long hair &amp; it never damaged it. What isn&#x27;t easier on the hair &amp; hurts is when you have to blow dry near your scalp too long &amp; try to get it to work which I already mentioned it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> used a few times, my hair is only a little bit lighter, stuff stinks.</li>
    <li> The service was timely, the product works wonders and makes your hair look great after such  short period of time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I use this all the time. Smells great and work quickly. Easy and cheap way to lighten hair.</li>
    <li> i had to blow dry my hair like 3 times until i saw the highlights but i do see results.  its drying my hair out a little but its worth it.</li>
    <li> At first it turned my dark brown hair a lighter brown, faintly auburn. After several more trials my hair was a nice golden blonde. Be aware that I have short hair, though (Im a male) so perhaps thats why my hair didn&#x27;t appear as reddish. Also, the more you spray on your hair at a time, the lighter it will get. If you dont spray alot your hair will only look discolored (But you can fix that by using it again).</li>
    <li> Ordered for my mom. Came quick and works great.</li>
    <li> Works if you want auburn hair this is just the thing if you have blonde hair it&#x27;ll make your hair blonder</li>
    <li> My original hair color is black, it does made my hair color long different, but not much people notice that</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and have no damage to my hair. The smell is great. Most people just assume I am naturally golden blonde, but really my hair is light brown with a bit of a reddish tint. I highly recommend for inexpensive and natural looking hair lightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this particular product, Sun-In Original Hair Lightening Spray, from this seller before. My last order was wonderful. It was sent quick and the item was exactly as described. Sun-In is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve used it for many years and know others who have also used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, the order was sent super quick but, the Sun-In bottle was sent without a tamper proof plastic shrink wrap around the lid and the pull tab. I&#x27;ve let the bottle sit there questing myself if I should use it or not being that it was missing the tamper proof wrapper. I thought to myself that I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before, I&#x27;m sure that he would send a good bottle like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I had the winter blues and I thought I&#x27;d add a bit of highlight to my hair to put some pep-in-my-step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 30 years. Well, after applying this particular bottle of Sun-In to my hair and using my hands to come it through.. my hands turned white as if I poured hydrogen peroxide on them. I know what household peroxide looks and smells like when you pour it on your hands and hair. We used to  use it as kids to lighten our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular bottle was missing the tamper proof wrapper and little pull tab plus, it didn&#x27;t smell like the original product. It usually has a slight citrus smell. This bottle had a hint of fragrance and was nothing but a bit of Sun-In and peroxide mixed together. I&#x27;m sure of it. It&#x27;s probably not the seller&#x27;s fault. He/she is probably just a middle man or liquidator broker of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so disappointed in myself for using a product that was missing the wrapper (what was I thinking?!@#) and for not receiving the product that was advertised. I immediately rinsed my hair. I only hope someone who&#x27;s sensitive to peroxide didn&#x27;t get a bottle that may have harmed their scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this was a used bottle of spray and someone filled the bottle with hydrogen peroxide. I had ordered this same item from the same seller last year and I had no problems what-so-ever. I hope that this was an isolated problem. I&#x27;m going to contact the seller. I&#x27;ve put off contacting him being that I&#x27;ve waited 30 days before I actually used the product. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the product if the wrapper is missing from the lid.d ordered this same item from the same seller last year and I had no problems what-so-ever.

    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative reviews of this product and they&#x27;ve mostly made me laugh. No it may not do anything with only one application and yes your hair will become dry if you use this product everyday for weeks or months. I use it a couple times per month and my hair is beautifully highlighted. I naturally have medium brown hair and I now have golden, natural looking highlights. I&#x27;m approached often by women asking if my highlights are natural or which salon I go to. I also use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, which has seemed to counteract any drying the product does to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair lightening spray ever since I was 9 years old. The product I used to use was Clariol&#x27;s Touch of Sun Spray. It worked wonderfully, but they discontinued it and I had to find a new spray. After numerous google searches, I found Sun In. I read the reviews and noticed that dark haired people said they came out with reddish hair instead of blonde or brown hair after using the spray. These were the reviews that made me hesitant to purchase this because I am Asian and have very dark brown hair. However, based on my experience with Clariol, I decided that the spray wouldn&#x27;t turn my hair red because that has never happened to me before. Turns out that I was right. The spray colored my hair into a nice, warm brown, but I had to spray my hair with this many, many times since my hair was so dark! What I did was after washing my hair and drying it with a towel, I spray the product all over my hair and then blow dried it with a hair dryer. I did this throughout the span of a month because constantly drying my hair can damage it, so I did it about three times a week. I do not see any noticeable damage to my hair after using this. The great thing about lightening sprays is that you can really control the color of your hair. The scent of this product is not bad. I can say that it smells a lot better than Clariol&#x27;s. This product definitely worked out for me!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was about 13, and I am 35 now. I stopped using this product when I was about 18, and what a huge difference! First off, I have thick coarse hair, and it&#x27;s darker brown. I did not experience discoloration at all, it turned blond. The color was great, that gets five stars. The reason this product gets one star and no more of my business is because of the damage it did to my hair. My hair became frizzy being belief, very dry and damaged looking. This did not go away until I stopped using it, and learned to love the way my hair looks naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I would use the whole bottle by the end of the summer, and the effects would be devastating for the whole year as my hair looked terrible and damaged. I had to grow it out completely to figure out that my hair was not really damaged and dry, it was the crap I was putting in it that made it that way.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it ladies, just go to the salon and get highlights put in.</li>
    <li> Highlights were taking 2 (!) hours.  Someone at the gym told me to try this for the roots only.  I ran into my ex-colorist who is a friend and admitted I ditched her for this.  She admitted it looked great..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight dollars and five minutes versus serious time and money.  Spray on the root and blow dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sun In products since I was in middle school; I&#x27;m now in my mid-20s.  I love that I can get my hair to look \\&quot;summer\\&quot; light without the expense or hassle of constantly dying it either at home or the salon.  The Tropical Breeze scent also compliments my shampoo &amp; conditioner which means I look &amp; smell good.  I&#x27;ve never noticed any damage or issues with such prolonged use.  And it&#x27;s even more convenient now that I can get it delivered for LESS than store price.</li>
    <li> this brings out my natural highlights on my medium brown hair, I don&#x27;t use too often anymore to avoid damage but I have noticed a pretty big difference (I used it mostly on the bottom half of my hair), I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the difference between the roots and tips of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have recently gotten subtle ombre highlights added to my dark brown hair and wanted an overall lighter look so I figured I&#x27;d use this product on my hair once every 2 weeks to help the lightening process along. I don&#x27;t have great expectations from it since my hair is naturally dark and I did color it black two years ago so really I&#x27;m only using this to help lift some of that black color out so I can go lighter in the summer. I have friends with lighter hair who swears by this or the John Frieda lightening spray. The only gripe I have with this product is the weird smell - when you first spray it onto your hair after a shower, you will notice kind of an awful peroxide smell followed by a pleasant coconut one. Don&#x27;t worry - the peroxide smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after it&#x27;s dry, there will only be a very faint coconut scent. So we will see. I am a glutton for punishment after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff on occasion for several years. It definitely makes a difference, especially in the summertime when I can sit in the sun by the pool for hours on end (make sure to wear sunscreen!). As it is still winter here in Minnesota, I use my blow dryer, which works just as well. In fact, I just put some in my hair, used the blow dryer for about five minutes, and I can instantly see a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used to use it on my heavily-bleached hair and never noticed any damage. Although, my best friend used to put Sun-In in her hair and found that her naturally curly hair seemed to stop curling. Despite this, she did have the most sensationally platinum blonde hair because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that the reviews on Amazon and throughout the web are so mixed, but I guess results are very individual with this product. For me personally, it lightens my dishwater blonde hair into a nice beach blonde and makes it smell nice in the process. But if you&#x27;re concerned about damage, I&#x27;d recommend lemon juice. It&#x27;s messier (makes my hair crusty and requires an immediate washing) but you will get similar results. Sun-In works faster, though, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff off and on since I was a child. I naturally have a very dark auburn hair color and this stuff brings out the red perfectly! I use it to highlight and slightly ombré my hair. It makes it a nice copper gold color, with the occasional hint of brass (that actually looks amazing with my hair lol) it can be a bit drying but if you don&#x27;t over do it it&#x27;s not that bad.  It was even cooler looking when I Henna&#x27;d my hair. The color was so vibrant but natural all at the same time.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My hair is much lighter than it used to be, and in a very natural way! I only use it in the sun, because I didn&#x27;t got the same efect by using it only with the blowdryer. But my hair looks like a natural blonde now!</li>
    <li> I have used this every other summer or so for at least ten years.  It is reliable, smells nice, and lightly highlights. As the instructions say, if your hair is darker it will bring out red tones so don&#x27;t be surprised.  I found that continuing to use it removes them and makes my hair blonder, but I need to use an anti-brassiness treatment.  Currently, I use it occasionally on my medium brown hair specifically to introduce some warm red highlights.  I no longer want to go blonder, but I like that it takes my mousy brown hair and introduces some dimension and color.  I have very thin, straight, fine hair which is medium dull brown naturally.  This looks more natural than other types of hair color which deposit color, although others might find results vary based on hair type.  Try a test on a small section of hidden hair to see what this will do to your hair before spraying all over your head - but I love what it does for me.</li>
    <li> Rockin&#x27; that blonde hair, just like it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair lightener for years - it seems to work really well and I like the fact I can gradually lighten without damage whenever I choose!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have medium brown hair and I used it with the hairdryer for about a week and noticed my hair turning an orange color and it looks great. Also great if you want an ombre hair style by spraying it heavily on the ends and a lighter spray on the way up. I really like this and would recommend it to someone else. Just make sure not to spray more on the top of your head than the rest, otherwise you get a weird glow on top of your head.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sun-in on and off for 15 yrs.  I had bleach blonde hair as a kid, but it darkened to a dirty blonde as an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sun-In that I used 15 yrs ago worked considerably faster but seemed to be a lot harsher on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains no harmful metallic dyes (contrary to what at least 1 other review said).  It says it in plain print right on the side of the bottle.  I suspect the majority of the bad 1 star reviews come from stylists who are losing lots of money on people using this product instead of getting a salon hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I recently purchased this product before my wedding, and I had a month to get my hair to the lighter shade I wanted.  In the past, it would&#x27;ve only taken 3-4 times to get my hair to the light blonde color.  This new formula was softer and gentler on my hair, but took a lot longer to get lighter.  I used it 2-3 times a week for several weeks before I got close to the color I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-After getting out of the shower, I towel dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Then I shake the bottle and spray the product all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-I also turn my head over and spray some underneath my hair, so that base of my hair gets some too.&lt;br /&gt;-I use a brush to distribute the lightener throughout the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Then I dry my hair thoroughly with a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;This product has saved me tons of money compared to the salon.  It looks great!  Even my stylist thinks this is my natural hair color. :-)  Just be patient and don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t see results immediately.</li>
    <li> As matter of fact my wife used it several times ,,,,,,so she is kinda happy by the final out come of the product ,,, I remember her saying that one of the most important things that my hair did not become dry or got damaged because of the repeated use of this product</li>
    <li> I have brown hair and this put blonde highlights in my hair that looked natural. Highly recommend this product if you want lighter hair!</li>
    <li> I would probably curl up and die with out sun-in (I&#x27;m exaggerating of course...).  How else would I get beautiful blonde hair without spending a fortune and without damaging my hair?  Sun-in is very effective in a short amount of time.  Just an hour sitting in the sun turns my medium-brown hair into a light blonde color.  I get absolutly zero damage, which is suprising.  I mean, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;re be some downsides to using this, but there&#x27;s not!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody and everybody.</li>
    <li> sun in is just the same as it was when I was a kid, pretty nice to find things like this on the internet so easily.</li>
    <li> I have probably heard a thousand complaints about &#x27;oh, my hair turned orange&#x27; but this product is for BLONDE hair. If you have brown hair and you think that spraying in Sun In will give you pretty blonde highlights you are very wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t the product&#x27;s fault that it turns brown hair orange, i mean it is only common sense that it would do this. Seriously. And they say blondes are dumb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with brown hair. When i was younger I had beautiful baby bright blonde hair, but as i grew older it faded to an ugly and dirty blonde. Thank god they invented this product. I would always highlight my hair with bleach and then have a huge ammount of damage, and with this product i recieved the same about of beautiful bright color in one day in the sun, for only 5 bucks and with no damage at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest using this product only a few times a season, because after awhile it will dry out your hair. Therefore as long as you have natural blonde hair and want it blonder, and don&#x27;t over use the product...i would reccommend this product to you!</li>
    <li> YES, the product works. With frequent use it will gradually bring you to the lightness you desire. BUT, long term it is horrible for your hair. I used sun in product for years, and now that the hair I have applied it to is at my ends, it&#x27;s awful. My ends are brittle, damaged and split all the way up to the shaft. It will look great short term and you&#x27;ll be happy with the look, but if you care about hair length, thickness and hair follicle health then I seriously recommend paying the extra money for a salon treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before but the store I use to buy it from closed down.  Works as described, I use it in winter for a milder over all highlightening effect.  Old school but wirks on medium to light brown hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Sun-In, I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teenager. I have medium brown hair, and I spray it on damp hair on my roots and then comb it out with a blow dryer. It gives me very natural-looking highlights and doesn&#x27;t look at all orange or artificial. Using in moderation is key. After using it every other day for a week or two, I leave it alone except to touch up my roots.</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair and parts of it were pretty orangey, well I sprayed this in my hair after my shower and blowed dried it afterwards and it my orange hair much more blonde and this was only after the first use.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but it did.  Even though it warned about using it on prossesed hair, it worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The product works great. It does not cause brassiness. Do recommend to anyone with light hair. Though i do not have experience with dark one.</li>
    <li> leaked in the packaging,</li>
    <li> Came as promised.  Have not used yet</li>
    <li> I am a male with very dark brown hair. It is naturally thin and wavy, but can feel wavy and thick if it is very humid outside. I wanted to try this product because I felt like my dark brown hair had absolutely no dimension. In photographs my hair just looked like a dark brown thing of hair. My logic was if I highlighted or lightened my hair, the true nature and dimensions of my hair would be more flattering in photographs and more noticeable in person. I bought this product on a whim and the results just blew me away. I know the product says not to use it on dark brown hair, but I didn&#x27;t care I wanted to try it. Now let me tell you, my hair was very dark brown, no highlights showed up even in the sunlight. After I used sun-in my hair is noticeably lighter brown with some hazelnut highlights. I honestly think I will use this product for the rest of my life if they never discontinue it. This product makes it so simple to lighten and highlight my hair and it&#x27;s cheap as well. Prior to using this product I tried John Frieda&#x27;s Brilliant Brunette shampoo/conditioner to see if it will bring out highlights, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything except make it shiny; however, using them in conjunction with sun-in has left me very satisfied with my originally bland hair!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much this product saved me from damaged hair and hundreds and hundreds of dollars and time going to the salon. I tried getting highlights at the salon but I could barely tell and my hair was fried, brittle and fell off.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Sun-In for 10 years and it is literally incredible. I have medium brown hair that looks like pencil led. With Sun-In all throughout my hair I have golden to platinum blonde hair and have had my whole life. My hair was blonde during childhood. During adolescents it got darker. Sun-In makes my hair shiner and the day after I use it, I have a GOOD hair day. It does take time to sit and use a hair dryer but beats going to the salon and paying $70!! In the summer it is super easy when you are out at the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is my favorite product of all time THANK YOU SUN-IN</li>
    <li> My natural hair is dark blonde/ light brown, and this product makes my hair blonde.  I have friends with medium-brown hair, who have tried this product, and it looks orange on them!  So, definitely be careful.  Even on my own hair, when I first did it, it was somewhat more \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; than the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; I was going for, but I applied again, and the yellowness was gone.  Even so, I have mistakenly applied a little too much on the thinner hairs near the ears, and those look very white, so I learned my lesson.  In short, this product is great, makes the hair look natural and blonde, but it is not to be abused or used on dark hair to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product.  Have used it for over a year already, and all I have to do is touch up the roots every two weeks or so.  It takes about 10 seconds to get it done, and needless to say, it&#x27;s infinitely cheaper than going to a salon for coloring.</li>
    <li> I am a white female with dark brown thin hair. I used sun in over the weekened and I am more than happy with the results. I did notice that my hair was a little dried out, but honestly I flat iron my hair a few times a week and so I am already used to damage repair- sun-in is much milder than chemical bleaching, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my hair was dark brown, the lightened parts went straight to golden/ash blonde. I think these results really depend on your individual hair color. I was born platinum blonde and my hair slowly got darker until about age 12 when I was 100% brunette. So I think since my hair was originally blonde, using sun in brings those lighter tones out. I did not experience any orange hair, but again, if your brown hair has red tones to it then you might! I wanted some of those red tones, so I was slightly disappointed. But the bottle clearly states the product is intended to take make your hair blonder, so it did it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I purchased this item.  Makes your hair all uneven.  Bad move on my part.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it really does turn your hair a reddish tone which is exactly what I try to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have like dirty blonde hair and didn&#x27;t have much of a reddish tone in my hair but now I do a little after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> If you use this product you will never be able to dye or bleach your hair after words. This is a metallic dye, with Hydrogen Peroxide, which if you didn&#x27;t know is bleach. There is nothing natural about how this lightens your hair. If you have brown hair, it will turn orange and it cannot be fixed because you wont be able to dye your hair. If you do bleach or dye your hair with anything more then a semi permanent dye(essentially food coloring in conditioner), it will likely fry your hair. I promise you will be disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> Sun-in is my go to product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and it makes a world of a difference. Give it time, keep reapplying, and you&#x27;ll eventually get the color you want. It&#x27;s easiest when you just add it and go tan. Also, If you use a specific kind of shampoo, you can get rid of that brassiness. Go to your local beauty supply store and ask for \\&quot;Clairol -- Shimmer Lights\\&quot; in a purple bottle. After using the shampoo in combination, I have a gorgeous combination of honey-blond low-lights and baby-blonde high lights. I have long hair, and this product has NEVER damaged my hair. If you make sure to utilize a deep conditioner every so often after using Sun-in, your hair will retain luster and strength. I usually use a comb in conditioner that you leave in for a few minutes, like Tresseme&#x27;s line of moisturizing conditioners. Highly recommend this product, and I tell all my friends about it. It works best for individuals with light brown to blonde hair -- not really intended for people with black or dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> It is a great product if you would like to get 1 shade lighter.. not if you have dark hair...</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked super well yet but I haven&#x27;t been super great about using it.</li>
    <li> I love this spray. I dyed my hair black (big mistake) and of course it is so hard to get rid of black. I tried dying my hair again and it didnt work. I didn&#x27;t have money to bleach my hair and i have always been scared of that. So i found this, i would spray this all over my hair and go out in the sun it smell great too. And my hair looked lighter within days. This is heat activated to if its not sunny you can use your blowdryer and style your hair as always. If i could i would give this priduct more stars</li>
    <li> love this product! If you have med to light brown hair or even blondish hair this product will work well for bringing and adding to existing natural highlights. I find that it works best if you spray some in your hair and walk outside/run/be by a pool, just as long as your under the sun. You can also spray some into wet hair and use your blow dryer (effective as well). However, if you have dark brown hair or black hair this product will not work super well on your hair. You will need to lighten your hair first to see the highlights really well.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the 90´s and was thrilled to find it online, as I live overseas and that´s the only way of purchasing certain items. Smells nice, the new spout works fine, delivers what it promises. I´d buy it again and recommend it to my closest girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Sun-In works great on my untreated red hair. It can look natural, but I added a bit extra to give a highlighted look.</li>
    <li> I sue it every summer and it saves me a lot of money in highlights.... I have fine hair and it&lt;br /&gt;is great....</li>
    <li> As expected, used item in the past.</li>
    <li> To get my hair back to golden/brown, I used sun-in on the parts of my hair that have grown in dark every night for about a week.  I do take care to condition well prior to use and leave my hair slightly damp before use.  I then blow dry on a medium heat, with the dryer very close to my scalp, so as to get the maximum lightening at the roots.  At the end of the week, my whole head of hair is light blond, which I can leave as is or color in a week (I don&#x27;t like to color right after using sun-in, as that can lead to frizzes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t mention the name of the major pharmacy chain that retails this, though the sun-in site gives that info, but found it there for substantially less than I paid here ($4-$5).</li>
    <li> Ok first of all, I don&#x27;t know why brunettes think you can just go from dark brown to blond without bleaching. I guess I&#x27;m one of the few the actually wanted the reddish brown highlights. This product works beautifully. I spray it on, then use a flat iron over it, lightens immediately! Unlike highlights, I like that you can control how dark or light you want you highlights to be, and no pulling tiny strands through a cap or dealing with foils. LOVE IT. Oh also, it lightens quicker when it&#x27;s wet. (You don&#x27;t have to wet your hair, but let it be saturated with the product. It lightens better before it dries.)&lt;br /&gt;One con though, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good. I would describe the smell as \\&quot;chemical coconut.\\&quot; I definitely prefer the lemon one. But if you use or flat iron or blow dryer (faster) instead of sun, you can just wash it out when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> We have been waiting for spring this year so long that anything to make me feel like I&#x27;ve been in the sun feels great. I have used this product in the past and can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Goos stuff even for me with light brown hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective and lasts a long time.  I have light blond hair to begin with and use it to keep the roots light in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love sun in and I have dark brown hair with red undertones naturally. Sun in makes my hair soft and really works quickly! It didn&#x27;t turn my hair orange. Maybe it depends on frequency of use, past dye use, and other factors. I&#x27;m not sure, but it did work well for me! If I could figure out how to add a picture on mobile I would. The difference is amazing!</li>
