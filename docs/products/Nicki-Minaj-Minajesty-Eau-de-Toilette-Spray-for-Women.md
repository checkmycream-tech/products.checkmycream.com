<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments to one of my friends had me to order her one and paid  me back, is driving the men crazy , it lasts all day long not too heavy just right</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love the price</li>
    <li> Better than what i expected!!!!</li>
    <li> While I enjoyed pink Friday better, this fragrance is nice as well, I would compare it to a less fruity version of Crush by American Eagle. I ordered the 3.4 ounce bottle and let me tell you it was much bigger than expected, same size as my hand.</li>
    <li> i dont wear this but my 13 year old niece loves it</li>
    <li> A xmas present that brought joy and happiness to a teenager.</li>
    <li> I love this it smells so good and it was only like 30 bucks in the store is like 65</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells expensive...have received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells Great. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume! 😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I love it,and I get plenty of comments about the fragance</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge, it actually is very top heavy and may tip over if you are not careful.  The scent is very floral with vanilla undertones.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted!! Love the Smell!</li>
    <li> Great smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> loved it smells great and stays on</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift.  Not sure if it will be as expected by the receiver.</li>
    <li> Was ontime in brand new condition and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Smells good.. I&#x27;ve received many compliments!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter who is a teen.  She loves it!!! Its a large bottle and the smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very Nice, i like it!! Thanks Guys</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I like the exotic one better sorry.</li>
    <li> My mother complained that it was different and not as long lasting aroma compared to a smaller same version of the perfume purchased from a retail store.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for sometime now and I recently ran out so my husband just order me more today I absolutely love this perfume when I wear women chase me down to ask me what am I wearing! I will never wear anything else</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it! She says she gets compliments daily on the smell!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think my mom would like this, but she loved it. It really does smell amazing, it&#x27;s like an explosion of flowers, fruits, and vanilla, all at the same time!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Perfect daytime perfume. Nicki is my girl!!!!</li>
    <li> Omg I am in love with this pineapple scent. I get many complements. This cost $60 plus tax in store and I only paid $37. Its a must buy.. Nicki did gr8 on this 1.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume out there. It&#x27;s amazing, I had to re-order the 3 oz bottle because I love it that much.  Nicki minaj has some of the best perfume lines, hands down.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE BY THE BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED NICKI MINAJ!!!! Pink Friday was good but this one!  It&#x27;s like a warm sexual smell with a hint of brown sugar and cinnamon. Just ran out after 3 months and heavy usage (4-5 sprays a day) now I need to buy more!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Will most definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light, with what I swear is a hint of coconut (but my friends say I&#x27;m crazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like clean smelling perfumes and this one does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful, I will buy again!</li>
    <li> OMFGGGGGG IT Is Amazing And Big It Smells Great !</li>
    <li> I love this smell! I&#x27;m not big on celebrity perfumes but this is light and yummy! I don&#x27;t like the packaging but one of my favorites! Also I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the scent not lasting long! I do get lots of conversation complements on the scent as well. Definatly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it and it got to really quick</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good!  I wear it every day!  My hubby asked what I wanted for Valentines Day and I said this after sampling it in a magazine!  Great size bottle for the price.  The bottle I personally don&#x27;t like the design but the smell is great!</li>
    <li> very pleased with product and transaction</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and it&#x27;s like half the price of what it is at Ulta. I love this perfume. Not to pungent and it smells really good!!</li>
    <li> Smells good! Lasts all day! Gets lots of complements and the bottle is adorable!</li>
    <li> Just received my perfume today,and it smells so good on me,and lasted all day,got great compliments of how it smells...lucky me</li>
    <li> this perfume couldn&#x27;t be any more perfect 💜</li>
    <li> daughter went crazy for it</li>
    <li> Love love it! Very big bottle. Great shipping experience!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo, m</li>
    <li> I think the bottle I received was old. There is an overwhelming alcohol smell with a tiny bit of fragrance scent and the bottle had major blemishes and cracks on the hair part of the bottle</li>
    <li> I receive a lot of compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this perfume</li>
    <li> I bought the perfume from a department store for waayyyy more than I could have gotten it for on here. And I love the fruity smell. It lasts all day. I just smelled my arm(lol) and after 10 hours, the smell is still there.</li>
    <li> GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT. GOT A CALL TO BUY IT AGAIN BECAUSE SHE WAS ALMOST OUT.</li>
    <li> Honestly next to Paris Hilton&#x27;s Can Can perfume, this is my new found smell! Great price and smells amazing! Shipping was extremely fast too, I ordered Wednesday and it shipped to Philadelphia Saturday morning and I&#x27;m not a Prime member.</li>
    <li> Just received this and really do like the fragrance but must say I like the Nicki Minaj Pink Friday so much better.  This one is light also but just has a few different fragrant notes to it that are a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really generous size bottle and the bottle itself is a nice collectors piece.  I would love to have all her different bottles and will work on them one at a time.  I think the thing I like best about her perfume is that it lasts all day without having to touch up.  The scent just stays with you and it does attract people but not like some of the cheaper perfumes that smell like someone took a bath in them.  We need more quality perfumes like Nicki&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my mother!</li>
    <li> Omg my favorite perfume and it came quickly!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this fragrance. She adores the bottle.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because i am in love with Minajesty now... i wear it almost everyday. Its a different scent from what I&#x27;m used to wearing but i love it...</li>
    <li> This seller is fast at shipping my perfume out. You can&#x27;t beat their price! I got tired of spending  $70 at my Ulta and/or Macy&#x27;s for this perfume. This is not a knock off of the real version. I get so many compliments - even when I was recently at the emergency room 3 nurses complimented this perfume. It is not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or overly sweet smelling like most celebrities perfumes are (Britney Spears, Justin beiber, etc)</li>
    <li> I first spotted this gem whilst browsing aisle 8 in the cosmetics department at my local Walmart Superstore. The unique bottle sat there, strapped to the shelf by a security chord, in all of its majestic glory, it&#x27;s eyes lured me in, it begged to be sprayed, whiffed...indulged.   Day after day, I returned aisle 8 in cosmetics, nonchalantly browsing low end body sprays, I flashed a longing glance over at this beauty as I inched closer to that captivating fragrance, delicately suspended in it&#x27;s torso shaped vessel. Much to my dismay, my enchanting encounters with Minajesty were short lived, after roughly 2 weeks, the exotic treasure trove of musk and floral undertones that adorned the shelves of aisle 8 was empty.   After a brief stay at the Hotel Del Walmart Customer Service Desk Line, I finally approached a middle aged clerk in polyester blue smock. I glanced down at her name badge, adorned with golden foil star stickers, Her name was Rhonda and I knew she was worthy of handling the task of replacing this marvelous sampler in aisle 8. Disappointingly, I had overestimated Rhonda&#x27;s abilities, for she was a able to locate a replacement, offering a mere suggestion that I purchase my own bottle of Minajesty.   As one can see by the &amp;#34;Amazon Verified Purchase&amp;#34; flair, it was no surprise I did in fact purchase my own magnificent plastic Nicki head and torso full of the wonder and whim that is Minajesty.</li>
    <li> Smells very very similar to pink Friday, and the bottle omg!!!!! Can you get any cheaper? But I guess all in all pink Friday does smell bomb, I was just expecting different bomb, other then that it arrived very quick and its the big bottle too!!!!</li>
    <li> love it !!!!!! my fav besides halle berry</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as my last bottle.  Hmmm...</li>
    <li> I love it, but wished it stayed on longer.</li>
    <li> id just like to point out that this is a perfume, so it is a eau de parfum, not toilette. it is a strong perfume. also, i purchased minajesty at macys and am completely satisfied with my purchase because i received the free handbag i wanted, which is the black and gold with a gold chain clutch lookin bag. i currently dont use my perfume cuz i dont want it to run out, im starting to collect them. i also purchased the pink friday her first release perfume on amazon for an amazing price! plus it&#x27;s the 3.4 ounce! i also have the 1 ounce 30ml of pink friday but i use that to spray myself with. my two 3.4 ounce bottles are just to collect. i wanted to purchase a 1.7 ounce of minajesty at macys when get the chance to so i could use that for when i go out, but looking on amazon i see that they have minajesty 3.4 ounce for 40 bucks! that&#x27;s how much it is for the 1.7 ounce at macys! that you amazon!</li>
    <li> It has a very wonderful perfume . It doesn&#x27;t take long to receive . I don&#x27;t really like celebrity perfumes but I love this one ❤</li>
    <li> Super pleased and fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> OMG!  I remember when I came across a quick sample in a magazine.  I fell in love with this scent immediately.  I love the scent.  And it lasts all day.  I was surprised that after I got home from working a 12 hour day that I still smelled it.  Awesome fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it smells so good.. Received it so quick..</li>
    <li> Was a x-mas presents and my niece love it!</li>
    <li> Omg I love this perfume. This is a soft smell every time I wear this perfume I get stop .lady&#x27;s this is a must have .</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s a pleasant and unique scent. I hate musky perfumes, and this shies away from that.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves all the fragrances by Nicki Minaj but they are so expensive in the stores. The price was right. Will continue to by her products through amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter is happy.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for this perfume for the longest and I found it for a good price it smells so girly and fresh. I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance it smells better than I expected. It is totally worth the cost I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Delivered on the expected date. LOVE the scent and I&#x27;m in love with the bottle. Worth the money!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PERFUME AND IT SMELL SOOOOOO GOOD AND IT&#x27;S BIG TOO IT WILL LAST ME FOR A MIN THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
    <li> I love the scent but just wish it would last longer!</li>
    <li> Loved it... Was very satisfied with how the price for that size!!!</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely amazing. Its like a grapefruit citrus smell thats so addicting. Its almost like a candy. I have to buy a new bottle already.</li>
    <li> Cap of bottle is really heavy,perfume dmell is very strong but dies after 5 mintues. Nicki should stick to music or get poibters from Donna Karen.</li>
    <li> Smells great!!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love It!!! It smell so good and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance I have become quite a collector of her scents.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! It smells so good. I definitely got lucky buying it without smelling it beforehand. I like it better than Pink Friday but Pink Friday is great too! You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Nicki Minaj Perfume!</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived in a very short time!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it&#x27;s scent. It is good for everyday where and also good for layering with other perfumes. I purchased this item for a good price.</li>
