      <li>The tanner is a great color and not orange.</li>
      <li>Works great for applying lotion and buffing after.</li>
      <li>works great with the airbrush spray.</li>
      <li>work great</li>
      <li>This is a great product for applying any self tanner.  </li>
      <li>This one is much better!!</li>
      <li>Love these for all self tanners!!</li>
      <li>Good mitt.  </li>
      <li>Works good for the intended purpose.</li>
      <li>Does not stay on good .</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice, even application.</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash your hands immediately after, but you will still have some staining on your fingers  </li>
      <li>It might be more helpful if it was in the shape of a hand (glove-like).</li>
      <li>Way better than the first mitt I bought!!</li>
      <li>However the mitt does work well and distributes color evenly and makes it easy for me to apply my tanner.</li>
      <li>Also easy to wash and reuse.</li>
      <li>-the self tanner seeps through easily.</li>
      <li>evenly -cleans extremely easily, running water is about all you need.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply the product.</li>
      <li>I have light skin</li>
      <li>Make sure you wear some sort of latex gloves while wearing this as anything you put on the sponge side will leak right through.</li>
      <li>Have fun!</li>
      <li>Keeps your hands clean and applys the product evenly..</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t put the lotion on you but it is nice and soft..</li>
      <li>I would describe this mitt as ok, or maybe I was just expecting too much.</li>
      <li>So I guess it was true to form.</li>
      <li>For now it is good, but I feel it is a bit cheaply made and may not last much longer.</li>
      <li>It is a great glove, but I do have trouble keeping it on my hand.</li>
      <li>Be careful with what type of tanner you use with this, it absorbs alot of the product which is good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used cheaper mitts that fell apart pretty quickly .</li>
      <li>If not even for the fact it will last longer , but more because application was so much smoother!!</li>
      <li>This one is much higher quality.</li>
      <li>Perfect mit to apply fake bake system.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Try it out for yourself it didn&#x27;t fall apart like the first</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying the Fake Bake Flawless tanner.  </li>
      <li>The sponge side I use on my body and face, and then the soft brown side to smooth out the tanner on my face  CONS -it will slip off your hand immediately.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s holding up really well, much to my surprise!</li>
      <li>Easily washable for future applications.</li>
      <li>I have been using this mitt with Tanwise Dark Bronzing Mousse and so far so good.</li>
      <li>helps it not soak up as much product</li>
      <li>It does not stay on your hand very well as you apply the self tanner.</li>
      <li>I noticed a much smoother application with this mitt.</li>
      <li>I purchased these because I ordered the fake bake self-tanner (which is great)</li>
      <li>Awesome, just wish it lasted as long as a bottle of fake bake.</li>
      <li>Luckily I did wear disposable gloves with this because it it doesn&#x27;t take long for the sunless tanning product to soak through all over your hands, and I even used a mousse rather than a lotion.</li>
      <li>a natural look and NO streaks!</li>
      <li>Quality clearly depends on the supplier.</li>
      <li>This is the first self tanner mit I have ever used, so not much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>and I think I personally would prefer one that fit a little longer.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s soft and can be used for a long time if you wash after every use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This Mitt makes I difference.. I spray tan once a week and use this mitt for my tan maintainer that has a touch of dha. I noticed a much smoother application with this mitt. I&#x27;ve used cheaper mitts that fell apart pretty quickly . This one is much higher quality. I would&lt;br /&gt;definitely purchase this again. If not even for the fact it will last longer , but more because application was so much smoother!!</li>
    <li> Works great for applying lotion and buffing after. Also easy to wash and reuse.</li>
    <li> Works good for the intended purpose. It does not stay on your hand very well as you apply the self tanner. Found that is constantly had to be readjusted.</li>
    <li> Makes applying Fake Bake a breeze.</li>
    <li> I bought this mitt for my St. Tropez self tanning mousse, and have probably used it about 10 times.  PROS -spreads self tanner evenly -cleans extremely easily, running water is about all you need. Takes ~3 or 4 hours to dry -the two sides provide very different textures. The sponge side I use on my body and face, and then the soft brown side to smooth out the tanner on my face  CONS -it will slip off your hand immediately. I don&#x27;t think this is an issue they could fix, so I just pinch the mitt between my index finger and thumb while using to keep it in place -the self tanner seeps through easily. Make sure to wash your hands immediately after, but you will still have some staining on your fingers  Overall a good product. I expect to get a couple months use out of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but the mitt tends to slide around a lot when I&#x27;m applying my tanner. It might be more helpful if it was in the shape of a hand (glove-like). But it&#x27;s soft and can be used for a long time if you wash after every use.</li>
    <li> Will never apply self tanner without it ever again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a spare. It is a great glove, but I do have trouble keeping it on my hand. It spreads the color evenly.</li>
    <li> Does not protect your hands from getting color on them. Does not stay on good . Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mitt with Tanwise Dark Bronzing Mousse and so far so good. I was rinsing it out after each application but I noticed that the buffing side of the mitt is starting to pill and lose its fabric, so I stopped washing it. For now it is good, but I feel it is a bit cheaply made and may not last much longer. However the mitt does work well and distributes color evenly and makes it easy for me to apply my tanner.</li>
    <li> The mitt I received began pilling and linting after two uses. Quality clearly depends on the supplier. Mine, for the record, was GLAM ZONE.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for applying any self tanner.  Keeps your hands clean and applys the product evenly..Genius!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply the product.</li>
    <li> Works well to apply fake bake. You still need to wear a latex glove under the mitt because it does soak through.</li>
    <li> This mitt last longer than any other I&#x27;ve used.  Gives a nice, even application.</li>
    <li> best one ive bought yet!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I ordered the fake bake self-tanner (which is great) a while back and a mit came with it. After multiple uses, I needed another one. No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Make sure you wear some sort of latex gloves while wearing this as anything you put on the sponge side will leak right through. Other than that, it gets the job done at a fraction of the price that other name brand applicators charge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mitt and it works like a mitt. So I guess it was true to form. It won&#x27;t put the lotion on you but it is nice and soft.. Have fun!</li>
    <li> This is the first self tanner mit I have ever used, so not much to compare it to. I felt like the MIT kept slipping off, and getting turned around while I was using it. I have small hands, and I found that just taking your time and going slowly fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed it several times and it has not ripped or torn yet.</li>
    <li> Advise to use rubber glove</li>
    <li> Awesome, just wish it lasted as long as a bottle of fake bake.</li>
    <li> Used all of my expensive tanner. Tanner went through the mitt and my hands were colored for days! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Be careful with what type of tanner you use with this, it absorbs alot of the product which is good but you end up wasting alot of the tanner. I&#x27;ve found getting it damp before using it helps it not soak up as much product</li>
    <li> Way better than the first mitt I bought!! This one is much better!! Try it out for yourself it didn&#x27;t fall apart like the first</li>
    <li> I would describe this mitt as ok, or maybe I was just expecting too much. It is a little smaller than I thought (granted, I should have measured), it just goes down to my wrist and I think I personally would prefer one that fit a little longer. I had to grab the inside constantly to keep it from spinning around to the other side and doing that made it feel very short. Luckily I did wear disposable gloves with this because it it doesn&#x27;t take long for the sunless tanning product to soak through all over your hands, and I even used a mousse rather than a lotion. It will work for my needs, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> love it! a natural look and NO streaks!</li>
    <li> works great with the airbrush spray. helps spread it evenly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love these for all self tanners!!</li>
    <li> Good mitt.  It&#x27;s holding up really well, much to my surprise!</li>
    <li> work great I have light skin and I did have to go over a 2nd time for the tan I was wanting.</li>
    <li> Perfect mit to apply fake bake system.  Easily washable for future applications. Must have for sunless product applications!</li>
    <li> I would recommend buying the Fake Bake Flawless tanner.  It comes with the tanner and the fake bake mitt for basically the same price.  The tanner is a great color and not orange.</li>
