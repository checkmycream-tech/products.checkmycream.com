### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Hubby says the lather &amp; glide it provides is great too!</li>
      <li>This smells sooooo good!!</li>
      <li>I think the smell of this stuff is legendary.</li>
      <li>Gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>it feels good on your skin and smells great.</li>
      <li>Repeat this re-wetting step as many times as you need to to achieve the perfect lather.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>The C IC soaps smells good, goes on great, and lets your razor glide over your face.</li>
      <li>It lathers up really nicely and smells great.</li>
      <li>It does a good job softening my beard for a good shave.</li>
      <li>However, no matter what I tried, I could not get a good lather using a badger brush and mug.  </li>
      <li>Col. Conk amber soap has a very smooth lather,and a very nice aroma.</li>
      <li>It is a nice soap with a scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
      <li>Nice lather  and smell</li>
      <li>A lot of people rhapsodize about the smell, but I thought that it kind of smelled like the chemicals in a salon.</li>
      <li>, it is light and not overpowering, but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Colonel Conk&#x27;s Amber and Almond are now some of my favorite shaving soaps (I did not care for the scent of the Bay Rum at all, but to each his own).  </li>
      <li>Does a good job soften the hair but not the rich foam I like.</li>
      <li>So he may love it, sure, but I love it more!</li>
      <li>O well love the smell</li>
      <li>Love the glycerin soap.</li>
      <li>So, if he is using this soap that I got him for Christmas its not because he wants to make me happy or to avoid hurting my feelings.</li>
      <li>Just OK.</li>
      <li>but if nothing else was available I would use it (and I would choose it over anything in a can)!</li>
      <li>Can it get any better than that?</li>
      <li>Even so it produces a nice, rich lather.</li>
      <li>and I love the scent; it&#x27;s a mild, clean smelling soap with a nice  old-timey touch.</li>
      <li>When this product first came, I was initially impressed with the terrific scent.  </li>
      <li>Its cheap...</li>
      <li>my husband seems to enjoy this soap</li>
      <li>My razor glides effortlessly and my face feels silky smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like amber.</li>
      <li>and for me it worked like it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I am achieving fantastic results and could not be happier.  </li>
      <li>Shaves OK, but there are so many better soaps out there for not much money, I can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
      <li>However, the lather I do make works well, far better than anything from a can.</li>
      <li>It takes a couple of minutes of whipping your brush around to get up a lather, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
      <li>I was worried my first week because I couldn&#x27;t get the meringue-like lather I was seeing in to many guides, but after some research it seems I am not alone in having a difficult time getting great lather from this brand.</li>
      <li>After many attempts, I finally gave up.  </li>
      <li>For actually shaving it is just ok.</li>
      <li>It also left my face drier than most gelatin based soaps.</li>
      <li>He must really like it.</li>
      <li>Once your face is well-lathered, slightly re-wet the brush with hot water and lather some more.  </li>
      <li>The puck was slightly too tall for the lid on my soap bowl to fit, but this soap will easily melt into the shape of a container in about ten seconds in a microwave oven.  </li>
      <li>It lathers okay, not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
      <li>This time I skipped the mug altogether and tried the following technique: thoroughly soak badger brush with hot water, swirl brush on puck of soap for 5 - 10 seconds, apply directly to face.  </li>
      <li>Adds that touch of old style to the routine.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and evenly, and it hasn&#x27;t dried up or irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>We stock up to last the whole year.</li>
      <li>As I have tough whiskers, it cleans them off better than canned foam.</li>
      <li>But when I ran out of Taylor Of Old Bond Street almond cream, I had to pull this back out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just started treating myself to a traditional wet shave, and this was the first soap I tried.</li>
      <li>One bar seems to last for about a year, but I just reach down under the sink for the next one when it runs out, so I really haven&#x27;t paid much attention to how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>My best lather from this isn&#x27;t runny or useless, but it&#x27;s not super thick and creamy like some more expensive soaps or creams get.</li>

    <li> My husband loves this product I buy it for him every year during Christmas time. We stock up to last the whole year.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo good!! Hubby says the lather &amp; glide it provides is great too!</li>
    <li> It is a nice soap with a scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower. If you work it right, you can develop a thick, luxurious lather. I can&#x27;t hit it all the time, but when I do, I know I&#x27;m channeling my inner shaving Buddha.</li>
    <li> My fiance is not the sentimental type. So, if he is using this soap that I got him for Christmas its not because he wants to make me happy or to avoid hurting my feelings. He must really like it. It has a pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not very strong. I like that and so does he.</li>
    <li> i was looking for this soap for a long time. it feels good on your skin and smells great. i use it with a cup and a brush.</li>
    <li> The product is shown on the website as 3 3/4 oz and product delivered was half that.</li>

    <li> My husband actually goes out of his way to shave now, instead of me having to beg him to! So he may love it, sure, but I love it more!</li>

Repeat this re-wetting step as many times as you need to to achieve the perfect lather.&lt;br /&gt;What a difference this technique made!!  Colonel Conk&#x27;s Amber and Almond are now some of my favorite shaving soaps (I did not care for the scent of the Bay Rum at all, but to each his own).  I am achieving fantastic results and could not be happier.  I hope this helps.  God bless!</li>
