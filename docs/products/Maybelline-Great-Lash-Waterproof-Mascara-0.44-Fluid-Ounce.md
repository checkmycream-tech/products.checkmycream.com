### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a company in Australia that makes the best that I have found.  </li>
      <li>According to reviews, this is the very best mascara, but I have found a L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I prefer to this one.</li>
      <li>Always best mascara.</li>
      <li>Does not come off during the day and the color is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always been the best</li>
      <li>Best and inexpensive mascara around.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I have been using Great Lash Waterproof since the seventies!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
      <li>Not so good.</li>
      <li>but I looked good.</li>
      <li>but I have to warn you that you will need a good makeup remover to take it off, because it won&#x27;t go anywhere otherwise.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their liquid eyeliner surprisingly does well in competing with Lancome....</li>
      <li>this is also a good choice since it is waterproof.</li>
      <li>Reliable and a good price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good until it builds up on the brush.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I need more!</li>
      <li>Have always liked Maybeline mascara.  </li>
      <li>Nice color and length of lashes, and</li>
      <li>I also poled my Facebook Friends; they liked this product.  </li>
      <li>Awfully reasonably priced, this mascara is almost perfect.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to remove, and a good price; however, if you can afford it, I would suggest turning to Covergirl for a better quality mascara.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and the price was great.</li>
      <li>Color was perfect and it came early.</li>
      <li>It is effective and very economical!  </li>
      <li>Came as promised love it</li>
      <li>I like Cover girl better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but still smudges for a water proof mascara.  </li>
      <li>For $2 more, I would recommend the Stiletto version.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>This is however a more thickening mascara.</li>
      <li>then this is an OK product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve all seen what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
      <li>This mascara looks OK and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>I heard about it so many times before.</li>
      <li>It looked much better IMHO.  </li>
      <li>Since this stuff smudges, I take a wash cloth and blend the mascara around, and make sure none comes off when I touch my moustache.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybeline mascara for more than 50 years.  </li>
      <li>Many products make my eyes itch.</li>
      <li>Brush is thinner one, takes more effort to coat lashes sufficiently.  </li>
      <li>4 times more</li>
      <li>I keep trying this item from time to time because it shows up so often in top rated beauty lists; I am always dissatisfied and will not be trying it again.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Thirdly, the results in the mirror were excellent,</li>
      <li>I tried this mascara for several years ,its best, wont harm eyes, its wash away easily, when i apply it, my lashes look longer and more</li>
      <li>It popped into my head to try mascara and got this product, mostly because it was cheap and I was experimenting.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply; easy to remove with mineral oil.</li>
      <li>It removes easily with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I like that it does not clump and the brush easily applies mascara evenly.</li>
      <li>It matches perfectly with my dark brown hair and eyebrows.</li>
      <li>This waterproof was a fit to the tee.</li>
      <li>The Maybelline Great Lash out performed two Loreal mascaras, but still did not give me the long (8 hours) wearing time</li>
      <li>I recently purchased Maybelline Great Lash, becuase I love trying new products and was in need of some mascara.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to give me any special lash appeal (length or volume) and  leaves smudges throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty on my lashes!</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous other mascaras through the years but always return to this one, Great product that does not cause irritation and gives great and lasting coverage that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>for cheap it is ok but lashes get too wet and stick together if applying coats</li>
      <li>I tried this again after 15 years, thinking by now it would be better than when I was younger.</li>
      <li>The only way I&#x27;ve been able to get it off my lashes is with repeated smears of Vaseline, and very vigorous rubbing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 54 and have more grey in my moustache than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>and this one doesn&#x27;t create too much of an issue.</li>
      <li>Much happier with this.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So going on 40 years of usage, I can highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need that part - I need to darken mine) by much.  </li>
      <li>However, the mascara ended up being very clumpy, and as it&#x27;s \\&quot;washable\\&quot; and not waterproof, it often ends up on my face and around my eyes during the day.</li>
      <li>Love the dark brown.</li>
      <li>This mascara is definitely thinner and of a lesser quality - it easily smears during application.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>It also creates a very natural look unlike the lengthening types of mascara.</li>
      <li>and it was the mascara I first learned to use as a teen.  </li>
      <li>Even the naked eyelash look was better than the messy look from this mascara.</li>
      <li>It was not a soft smooth mascara and not full coverage.</li>
      <li>I have tried other mascaras but they just seemed more messy than this one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it irritating like I have with many others...</li>
      <li>As you get older the make-up needs to be toned down.  </li>

<li> This is my third attempt to find a reasonably priced mascara that didn&#x27;t give me dark smudges under my eyes after only a few hours.</li>

<li> No dark black eyeliner and black eyelashes for me.</li>
<li> i have used this for years----it never gets messy all day long---it is easy to use and i would be sad if they quit making it</li>
<li> It only slightly darkens under my eyes but it is not very noticeable.</li>
<li> I use this everyday and, the only mascara I would ever use..</li>
<li> I applied it to my moustache a little at a time, until I got some of the grey out, but not all.  </li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes as other mascaras have.</li>
<li> Just what I expected from Maybelline!</li>
<li> It also has a straight brush which can also be difficult to find.</li>
<li> At least not with standard eye make-up remover.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara looks OK and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Problem is, it doesn&#x27;t come off, either. At least not with standard eye make-up remover. The only way I&#x27;ve been able to get it off my lashes is with repeated smears of Vaseline, and very vigorous rubbing. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is great as goes on just the way I wanted it to.  I have been using Maybelline products for over 45 years and have never been let down. Anyone who buys it will feel the same if they know how to apply the product properly.</li>
    <li> I keep trying this item from time to time because it shows up so often in top rated beauty lists; I am always dissatisfied and will not be trying it again. It is one of the messiest mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t seem to give me any special lash appeal (length or volume) and  leaves smudges throughout the day.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that Maybelline is synonomus with mascara.  You would think, then, that given their years in the industry that they would have mascara down pat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so, as evidenced by this product.  It is not a good product because it does not do what it is suppose to do which is to make the lashes look longer, thicker, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a company in Australia that makes the best that I have found.  Then there&#x27;s Lancome which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of them are much more expensive:  4 times more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think Maybelline would improve their product and if it&#x27;s mmore expensive to do so, then do so and charge perhaps 10 bucks for a product that will end up doing what its suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their liquid eyeliner surprisingly does well in competing with Lancome....why not their mascara?</li>
    <li> Been looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, separates &amp; keeps lashes curled... FOUND IT! My eyes look fab~</li>
    <li> Love the dark brown. It matches perfectly with my dark brown hair and eyebrows. Love that it is waterproof, perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> I heard about it so many times before. Always best mascara. So wanna to try it. But it&#x27;s not seems what i thought. Not so good.</li>
    <li> I typically use the Maybelline Stiletto mascara, but I was drawn by the lower price and instead purchased this product.  This mascara is definitely thinner and of a lesser quality - it easily smears during application.  For $2 more, I would recommend the Stiletto version.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find waterproof mascara anymore at a reasonable price.  This product meets both criteria and works great.  It also has a straight brush which can also be difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes. Many products make my eyes itch. This one works well and doesn&#x27;t cause itching problems.</li>
    <li> It is long lasting; it stays on all day, but it CLUMPS! It also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; maybe because I have the &amp;#34;Brownish Black&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> Best and inexpensive mascara around. Have been buying this same one for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> Waterproof - unlikely. It does smudge - lower lashes smudge under my eyes after several hours &amp; upper lashes off-set color at the corners of my eyes. I like that it does not clump and the brush easily applies mascara evenly. I need to find something that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;run or smudge&#x27; AND doesn&#x27;t clump....back to the eternal search.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Maybelline Great Lash, becuase I love trying new products and was in need of some mascara. Lot of magazines (like Marth Stewart) had called it THE #1 mascara, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t be bad. However, the mascara ended up being very clumpy, and as it&#x27;s \\&quot;washable\\&quot; and not waterproof, it often ends up on my face and around my eyes during the day. It is very easy to remove, and a good price; however, if you can afford it, I would suggest turning to Covergirl for a better quality mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have more grey in my moustache than I&#x27;d like.  The guy who cuts my hair &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; it, and it looked so artificial, I had to shave it off.  He recommended I buy &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34;, but I knew it would give the same artificial look.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve all seen what I&#x27;m talking about.  It popped into my head to try mascara and got this product, mostly because it was cheap and I was experimenting.  I applied it to my moustache a little at a time, until I got some of the grey out, but not all.  It looked much better IMHO.  Since this stuff smudges, I take a wash cloth and blend the mascara around, and make sure none comes off when I touch my moustache.  Much happier with this.  So gals, recommend it to the men in your life.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have tested this product a number of times by crying my eyes out!  No smears.  I was sad but I looked good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty on my lashes! I put it on and it mad me feel like a different person! I need more!</li>
    <li> I have been using Great Lash Waterproof since the seventies!&lt;br /&gt;I have to curl my lashes and the waterproof formula won&#x27;t uncurl them - the washable mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;So going on 40 years of usage, I can highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Been using this brand/color of mascara for years. Love it!</li>
    <li> Waterproofing works well enough.  Brush is thinner one, takes more effort to coat lashes sufficiently.  Not lengthening (but I don&#x27;t need that part - I need to darken mine) by much.  Not clumply.  Deducted 1 star for the skimpy brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybeline mascara for more than 50 years.  It was the brand my Mom used and it was the mascara I first learned to use as a teen.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but I always come back to this old dependable product.</li>
    <li> Maybelline great lash is the best----have been using it for years... It is effective and very economical!  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes as other mascaras have.</li>
    <li> i have used this for years----it never gets messy all day long---it is easy to use and i would be sad if they quit making it</li>
    <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other mascaras through the years but always return to this one, Great product that does not cause irritation and gives great and lasting coverage that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> According to reviews, this is the very best mascara, but I have found a L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I prefer to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline mascara for what seems like over twenty years. How time flies. I have tried other mascaras but they just seemed more messy than this one. As long as you let this dry before you rub your eyes you probably won&#x27;t have a problem. This is however a more thickening mascara. It does nothing for length. I like this mascara because my hair is brown and the mascara matches my hair and eyebrows. It also creates a very natural look unlike the lengthening types of mascara. Inevitably I do rub my eyes while wearing mascara and this one doesn&#x27;t create too much of an issue. It only slightly darkens under my eyes but it is not very noticeable. If you are going to watch a sad movie while wearing mascara this is also a good choice since it is waterproof. It removes easily with [[ASIN:B000052WYL Maybelline Expert Eyes Mascara Remover, Moisturizing]]. Just also wash your face with whatever you normally use as the remover tends to be a little oily. Otherwise it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Easy to apply; easy to remove with mineral oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but still smudges for a water proof mascara.  I like Cover girl better.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara for several years ,its best, wont harm eyes, its wash away easily, when i apply it, my lashes look longer and more</li>
    <li> Always faithful with my mascara</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted.  For some reason the stores just don&#x27;t sell this in brown.  As you get older the make-up needs to be toned down.  No dark black eyeliner and black eyelashes for me.</li>
    <li> Came as promised love it but I have to warn you that you will need a good makeup remover to take it off, because it won&#x27;t go anywhere otherwise.</li>
    <li> for cheap it is ok but lashes get too wet and stick together if applying coats - I like a softer fluffy type look and this just seems too hard.</li>
    <li> This does what it is suppose to do.  It was a little thick.  Color was perfect and it came early.</li>
    <li> The only mascara I will use.  It&#x27;s always been the best and I think it always will be.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t flake under my eyes. I don&#x27;t find it irritating like I have with many others...</li>
    <li> Been using this same product for about 45 years now.  Tried others and always came back to this.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected from Maybelline! Nice color and length of lashes, and it&#x27;s waterproof. Works just as well as some more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Awfully reasonably priced, this mascara is almost perfect.  I read the reviews before ordering it.  Some reviewers felt it clumped; that problem was easily&lt;br /&gt; approachable by following the package instructions to apply second and later coats before the previous coats dried.  I also poled my Facebook Friends; they liked this product.  Thirdly, the results in the mirror were excellent, EXCEPT . . . and this problem I have not yet solved--and therefore will probably go back to my more expensive previous brand.  It is very, very hard to apply this mascara without getting bits of it on your skin where you don&#x27;t want it.  Cleaning those mars up causes smudging--a mite too smouldering a look for me.</li>
    <li> Not as waterproof as other Maybelline mascaras I have used; frequently leaves black under eyes if you wipe your eyes. Disappointing</li>
    <li> I tried this again after 15 years, thinking by now it would be better than when I was younger. NOPE. I applied coat after coat, and still it looked like nothing. To make matters worse, it also smudged and smeared. Even the naked eyelash look was better than the messy look from this mascara.</li>
    <li> Reliable and a good price.</li>
    <li> This is my third attempt to find a reasonably priced mascara that didn&#x27;t give me dark smudges under my eyes after only a few hours. The Maybelline Great Lash out performed two Loreal mascaras, but still did not give me the long (8 hours) wearing time I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind checking every few hours to dark smudges then this is an OK product. I will keep searching!</li>
    <li> Received it quicly.  I am not thrilled with this mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken. Stays  on ok. Would not reccomend.  Purchased by my wife.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and the price was great. It was an item I could not find at a local store.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Great price and great buy.  Does not come off during the day and the color is wonderful.</li>
    <li> It was not a soft smooth mascara and not full coverage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good until it builds up on the brush.</li>
    <li> Have always liked Maybeline mascara.  This waterproof was a fit to the tee.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and, the only mascara I would ever use..</li>
