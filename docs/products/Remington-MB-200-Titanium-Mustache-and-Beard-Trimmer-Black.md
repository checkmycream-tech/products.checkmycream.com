<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Straight forward design, easiest to adjust of any I&#x27;ve used. Powerful and quick. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the way this trimmer cuts! But the battery life is horrible. I have followed the instructions and charged it as long as it stated and run it down before charging. But now I get two maybe three trims per charge and by the end of a few days it&#x27;s dead wether I used it or not.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost 4 years ago and it&#x27;s just not holding a charge anymore. I can still use if I plan ahead and charge overnight and then use it in the morning. If it sits for any length of time it&#x27;ll lose that charge.  It was a good trimmer with plenty of length options and has been easy to maintain. One thing I don&#x27;t like is how if the charge is low you can&#x27;t just plug it in and go. You have to wait a long time for it to charge back up. Also, it just shows a green light when it&#x27;s charging. That light doesn&#x27;t change or go out, so you really have no idea when it&#x27;s done charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: The free replacement I ordered, while appreciated, does not hold a charge at all.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does not hold a charge. I have to anticipate using it and plug it in the night before in order to use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> No battery issues here yet after over two weeks. Great trimmer at a nice price! So far, quite satisfied!</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable. No hair pulling and easy to use</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is a piece of junk. I had an older model that lasted about 4 years. This one is 13 months old and it will hardly hold a charge. It just about makes one trim before I have to recharge it again. I would highly recommend against buy it.</li>
    <li> Lasted about 2 years, still worked fine, but battery is useless now. You would think it would work if plugged in, right? NOPE. Dead battery &#x3D; completely useless shaver</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  It must be plugged in continuously.  If you unplug it after it&#x27;s fully charged, it will be dead when you come back in the morning or later in the day. It takes about 8 hours to charge up and can then run 5 to 10 minutes.  Once the battery dies, it won&#x27;t continue to run even if plugged in.  You better be done, because you&#x27;ll have to wait hours before you can use it again.  Remington should be ashamed to offer this product to the public.</li>
    <li> Last one was great - lasted for several years with regular use. Bought a replacement last year, and it died after 10 months.    11/18 Update: After writing this review, I did email Remington to see if I could get anywhere with them on the issue. They said they are sending out a replacement unit (free of charge). After seeing how easy they were to deal with when it was clearly a defective unit, I have changed my rating from a 1 star to 4.</li>
    <li> The battery will not hold a charge for more than 1 day. It cannot be used while connected to the charger.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed when I trimmed with the first notch. Besides that, it&#x27;s a nice trimmer which make it job.</li>
    <li> This is great for shaving pubes.  Be careful or it will nick your balls.</li>
    <li> This a bead trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Not for mustaches or goatees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor advertising&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not live up to expectations or needs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item</li>
    <li> This has lasted me quite a while now and it is a smooth trim, unlike some others that can be painful.</li>
    <li> The non-replaceable battery only lasted about two years with weekly use before it can no longer hold a charge. To say the least, I was definitely disappointed with its short life-span.    I will stay clear of Remington products in the future and I suggest you do the same.    **Update**  The Remington customer service department was stellar as they were willing to work with me to replace my unit. They were able to send me a different model upon my request(the MB-4040) and I have been much happier with this product. Although I give the MB-200 two stars for poor battery life span, I would give the Remington customer service team 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Works well but Battery wears out in two week of non use</li>
    <li> Battery does not hold a charge after several months of use. Now I&#x27;m looking at having to buy another as I can&#x27;t even shave while plugged in. Go with something else.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with the performance (although it did tend to toss trimmings about in a festive manner), nice sharp blades got the job done (nicked myself a few times when using it without the guard on, so be careful).  However, after a year and four months the battery has stopped holding its charge.  Time to find a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge more than a day, even if I charge and don&#x27;t use, so I have to charge 24 hrs before each use. It&#x27;s cheap cheap cheap!</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer but the batteries will stop holding the charge after a year of use. The LED charging indicator will let you know when the device is plugged in but it will not let you know when is done charging.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed to have purchased a trimmer clearly labeled as &amp;#34;Corded/Cordless&amp;#34; on the product description page when it specifically says in the included instructions that plugging it in will not provide power to the trimmer only to charge the battery. Very misleading and disappointing. If I hadn&#x27;t destroyed the packaging before reading the manual I would return this for a product with honest accurate descriptions.</li>
    <li> The battery life is awful.  It also does not work while plugged in.  You have to charge it for few hours to recharge battery before use.</li>
    <li> does not hold charge.  must unplug it if not in use for 2 weeks.  when you return to use it, charge is depleted.  big pain.</li>
    <li> I like everything about the trimmer, and was disappointed when I had a problem with the head (couldn&#x27;t close it properly after cleaning ).&lt;br /&gt;I bought it in Jan.2012 and it had a 2 year warranty. I sent it back last week and just got a Fed Ex delivery today with a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service !!</li>
    <li> Wish i had heard of this years ago. Its a great little trimmer no fuss length adjuster, and best part is the blades are titanium so no sharpening or throwing it out after it starts pulling at the hair. Works great for cleaning and lining up the sides of your hair if you wear it short.</li>
    <li> This is my second version of this item; the first was pretty good, lasted a long time, but finally the battery would not hold a charge.  I bought another, but it didn&#x27;t hold a charge right out of the box.  Unfortunately, I waited to long to return it. But I won&#x27;t take a chance on a 3rd version.</li>
    <li> I had bought the bigger and more expensive trimmer they make, the one that is digital. All we had was troubles! It had so many glitches and we wanted to be able to turn it on and just use it! My husband uses it on his face and neck and I use it on the back of his neck during hair cuts. Fantastic for both. When we had the more expensive ones you couldn&#x27;t use it when it was plugged in, but this one will. Which is a nice feature in case you need a quick trim and forgot to charge it. The charge lasts for many many hours once it&#x27;s charged and charging isn&#x27;t that long. We took the bigger and better one back to the store, got our money back, came on here and purchased two of these instantly. The first one we ever bought lasted us around 8 years and would have gone longer but I dropped it just right (I had dropped it many times in the past with no issues) and it landed in a way that bent the hinge and it wouldn&#x27;t close anymore. But now we bought two and we should be good for many many years to come! This is the one to buy in my opinion!</li>
    <li> It does the job well, but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that it can&#x27;t run off the outlet. What I mean is that if the battery runs out, you have to charge it. You can&#x27;t just plug it into the wall and use it. I&#x27;ve tried. Considering that you can charge and use a laptop at the same time, you should easily be able to charge and use this device at the same time. But when I do, it runs out very quickly and comes to a stop even though it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m sitting here typing this, my face is half done and I have to leave for work in a few minutes, and it&#x27;s out of battery power. Pretty unhappy that there&#x27;s nothing I can do about this.</li>
    <li> Old generation nicad battery with memory problem. Battery soldered in, not meant to be changed as they want you to replace entire product. If your battery no longer holds a charge you can take it to Batteries Plus and have them install a new generation nicad battery without the memory problem.  They charge about $25.  Consult youtube for demonstration of battery replacement. Length adjuster locks into place well.  Tines don&#x27;t depress when pressure applied as bad as most other shavers that I have tried.  Have had no issues with pulling hair.  Would have given 3 stars (meaning: what you expect for what you pay) if the battery wasn&#x27;t garbage.</li>
    <li> I bought the predecessor to this beard trimmer more than three years ago, and loved it. After carelessly dropping my old one I broke it, and am back for another.     Pros:     * Scrolling wheel height adjustment.   ----&gt; A very nice feature, the height holds well, unlike some trimmers. You can use pressure against your face and it won&#x27;t retreat to a shorter height setting that creates a thin spot.   ----&gt; After only two or three times, you will know how high you want it. For example, I always trim my beard on a \\&quot;6\\&quot; and my mustache on a \\&quot;4\\&quot;     * Removable head to trim beard edges.     * Strong motor/ blades provide pain-free trim.     * Holds its charge for a long time. (I charge it full before I travel, and don&#x27;t even bother packing the charger, because I trust it to function the whole week.)     * Shaver head lifts easily to remove stray hair that gets into the motor area.     * Cordless -&gt; To avoid having to clean the bathroom after a big trim, (If I didn&#x27;t trim for a week or so) I will take it in the back yard and set it 1 setting higher (\\&quot;7\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;6\\&quot;). Then I give it a quick hit to get rid of the long hair, and then return to the bathroom to finish the detail work.       Cons:     * It will need a place to lay flat, or a pouch to hang in. It doesn&#x27;t stand on end, and the charger unit plugs into the base (at the bottom end of the demo picture).     * I did mention I broke my old one. I had removed the height guard, and was emptying the hair from under the shaver head. The pivot is plastic, and while I had it open, I dropped the shaver. It landed head down (of course) and the pivot broke. Totally user error, but it is a weak spot.       ----------     Final Thoughts:     I love this thing. It provides a quick clean trim. I would say that it usually takes no less than 3 minutes for a quick trim, maybe as long as 8-10 minutes if I am going to detail the edges after a month of quick trims.     I highlighted some cons for a fair review, but I have nothing against this razor. It trimmed well for three years, and was still holding a charge for weeks when I broke it.     (I liked it even more after trying the [[ASIN:B000BI3PYE Remington PG350 Precision Deluxe Rechargeable Personal Grooming Kit]]. I bought that quick because I needed a trim, and it confirmed how well this razor worked, and shaped my thoughts for this review. To compare to a bad item, check my review of that item.)</li>
    <li> I retract my primarily favorable review that I wrote after using the trimmer a couple of times.  In the 5th month I was unable to locate the recharger (it uses an unconventional pin that inserts into the base of the trimmer).  I finally located it, and it&#x27;s apparently been charging (i.e., the green light is on) for two days.  However, to no effect.  The unit is completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a shaver available at a number of places on the internet at prices ranging from $15 to $60.  Since I didn&#x27;t play the latter for it, I&#x27;m disinclined to go to the bother and time of having it repaired.  It was wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the Remington is more precise that the Panasonic it replaces, the Panasonic had an ingenious rechargable plug that jack-knifed open from the base, permitting the entire shaver to be inserted in the AC and ensuring against loss of AC connection.  I would look for either that feature or go with regular battery-operated (a permanently connected electrical cord is also worth considering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I got a lemon, or a bad charger.  Nevertheless, best not to spend more than $10 on these and to regard them as disposable--more potentially irritating gadgetry in our cluttered lives.</li>
    <li> Great value for a rechargeable trimmer.  Loads of functions,  several attachments and had to buy one for each son.  Thanks Remington.</li>
    <li> Works great. Lots of length options. battery life has been good.</li>
    <li> A dry cell trimmer I once had for travel was a joke, so I needed convincing.  After much research, I chose the Remington for a two week trip in Japan.  It may well replace my hardwired, motor-driven home clipper.  My current persona is hair and beard at about 1/8 inch (Remington setting #3), and the stability and solidness of the adjustment are superb.  I trim about every four days, but I have touched-up after two days and was amazed at how much infinitesimally short hair it gets:  Really reliable adjustment.  I run it, plugged in, for about ten minutes at a time, and the only oddity is fluctuation of speed toward the end:  Probably the charging cycle, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect performance.  It is easy to clean, and lubrication-free is a real plus.  This was a very sound purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the previous model of the trimmer and I loved it. This one is even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item; it is exactly what I wanted and works quite well</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job great. I use it to keep my goatee well-groomed and it does the job very well. I wish the lower number settings had finer adjustments between them, but this is a problem I have with any trimmers. Other than that, this trimmer is a great bargain. It does the job just as well as much more pricey trimmers. It is easy to clean and maintain, seems to keep cutting well over time, and gives a nice even trim. I use this to even out my facial hair and then use my razor and grooming scissors to touch up all the finer details, and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> This beard and mustache trimmer is as good as any I used over the last 30 years. It cuts very well without pulling and is quite easy to clean. It does not vacuum hair like some of the more expensive units, but for the price it does every thing as described.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AND IGNORED SOME OF THE SENSELESS REVIEWS I READ HERE.I WISH I KNEW WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR HEADS TO WRITE SUCH SENSELESS THINGS.THIS PRODUCT COULDN&#x27;T BE ANY BETTER,SIMPLE.IT&#x27;S PERFECT.WHEN REVIEWS SAYING UNTRUE THINGS A BOUT A PRODUCT ARE WRITTEN,IT MAKES EVERYONE&#x27;S BUYING EXPERIENCE MISERABLE.PLEASE MAKE SURE TO PAY ATTENTION AND BE HONEST WHEN DOING SO,OTHERWISE,STAY HOME AND WATCH T.V..............THANKS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had this Philips/Norelco beard trimmer for about 10 years and the rechargeable battery finally quit -- whey they make these things so you can&#x27;t put in a new battery is beyond me -- and it was perfect.  It had a rotatable rubberized wraparound knob below the trimmer guide with 10 numeric settings and a little window numbered 1 thru 10 with a pointer to tell you what setting you were on.  In 10 years, it never needed oiling.  The cutting top flipped open on a hinge to make it easy to brush out.  It had a great little recharging stand with a little pocket to hold the cleaning brush.    I was appalled to find out that Norelco beard trimmers have changed so much they&#x27;re unrecognizable and absent most of the features I liked. So I found this model by Remington and I&#x27;m happy to report it does everything the Norelco did. Instead of 10 settings for the trimming guide to control beard length after trimming, it has 14, but I can get used to that easily enough.  It has a little thumb wheel with numbers on it to change the height of the trimming guide -- I can get used to that, too.  It&#x27;s permanently lubricated as my old Norelco was, so it will never need oiling.    I&#x27;ve used it and it works great.  As with the Norelco, I can easily pull off the trimming guide when I want to trim the lower edge of my mustache with the metal blades themselves.    My one complaint is that it has no charging stand.  It comes with a cord that has a small \\&quot;brick\\&quot; with 2 prongs that hugs the electrical outlet instead of a small, compact 2-prong plug.  There&#x27;s a round plug on the opposite end that plugs into a hole at the base of the trimmer body and you have to lay the trimmer down flat on the countertop.  The compact charging stand the Norelco had meant the trimmer could stand upright while charging and it didn&#x27;t take up nearly as much counter space.  So I really miss that feature.    But since this has everything else and I couldn&#x27;t find anything else with a charging stand (unless it was a hugestand that held a range of accessories, such as six different trimmer guides, each of which trims at a different length, which would be worse for counter space), I am happy to have this because it does the job as well as the old one.    It fits comfortably in my hand while using it, too.</li>
    <li> really this stuff is of high quality, trusted &amp; cost-effective. Ive been using it for more than 3 yrs so far; traveling over so many countries with this faithful trimmer &amp; still working effectively. Im bearded guy; Iv used many trimmers in the past; all of them never last more than a year but this one still rocks!</li>
    <li> this is overall a good trimmer, it could be better but for $15 you really cant complain. if you want more attachments and more sturdy trimmer you are going to have to pay more money</li>
    <li> Bought this a month or two ago. I used it about two times a week, for quick trimming. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a lot flimsier than it looks, and the slider bar broke rendering the device useless as anything but an edger. The slider will not hold the guard in place any longer, as the two plastic clips on either side fall to the lowest slot regardless of the position the slider is in. It looks sleek but the components are cheap plastic. You might have better luck, but don&#x27;t be disappointed if it doesn&#x27;t last more than a month or two.</li>
    <li> I just got this beard trimmer about a week ago and I&#x27;m in love with it!  The razor is comfortable and super easy to use!  Although I&#x27;m sure this product is only supposed to be used on your beard, I have found that it trims up my side burns and eye brows incredibly well too!  I really like the simple yet extremely effective design of this product!  One of the smaller features that isn&#x27;t really mentioned is that fact that the trimmer guard is mutli-directional so you can choose to take your time and go with the direction of your facial hair growth, or if your in a hurry you can go against the grain and still get a great trim.  The only con I have found is that I personally would make use of a guard length that was a bit shorter than the smallest one offered.  Overall, amazing value for a product that far exceeds its $14 dollar price tag, and that&#x27;s including shipping!</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer for my husband when his old trimmer bit the dust. He has a full beard and mustache and says it works very well. The shape is easy to hold and the controls are user friendly. The one he had been using was quite a bit more expensive than this one, and he says he likes this one much better.    If you are looking for a great value and a good product, buy this.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. The trim guard is at the right levels, easy to adjust and provides a solid cut. The grip is great and it&#x27;s easy to clean. The only unfortunate side is that there is no charging stand but I manage. Perfect for guys with medium to thick beards who want a keep a nice trim and shape. Great for it&#x27;s value.</li>
    <li> My previous beard trimmer I paid around $50-$60 dollars for. It lasted a year.    Burned by that experience I thought I try something a bit more budget friendly, and much to my surprise this Remington actually cuts better than my previous non-Remington model. It feels solid, is simple to use, and trims more evenly and with fewer retries over the same area. This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I had my previous Remington trimmer since 2000 and loved it. A few months ago, the lever to adjust the guard busted and you couldn&#x27;t pick a level anymore. Distraught I went to Walmart, Target, Sams, everywhere looking for a simple trimmer that would easily cut my beard, mustache, and burns at an easily specified height. Surprisingly hard to find. Eventually I decided to go online and find the same model. I guess the MB200 is my originals grandson but it works just about the same, except it&#x27;s got a wheel instead of the lever to adjust the height, and it charges. Love it so far. No problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to gift it to one of my cousin in India and after checking the reviews I was very confident that this will be a great gift. Not exaggerating, it started but it just doesnt solve the purpose. I have been using Panasonic ES224s from last 3 yrs and its blade is still much better than this piece of junk. I am not sure if my piece is faulty or what but it just dont work....it was just so embarrassing to gift something which just dont work..</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this is by far my favorite trimmer. I myself like trimming the mustache and shaping my sideburns. This will definitely do the job if you&#x27;re looking for something in that category. The blades are ultra sharp, and the trimmer itself has a good sturdy/ergonomic feel. Cleaning the blades is tremendously easy. Just pop up the blade and brush/blow out the excess hair. I have realized that sometimes trimmer can make unequal cuts. But, to fix that make sure you use edge side of trimmer or the flat side, and not both. Overall, I am very satisfied with the results and would recommend it to anyone. Although, I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there with more superfluous features, but this trimmer has everything you need and love.</li>
    <li> for it&#x27;s price I thought that the quality will be cheap. I&#x27;ve had it now for 6 months and works perfectly. The battery takes time to charge but it stays for a long time. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I thought this would be cheaply made for the price I paid, but I am pleasantly surprised. The scroll wheel works great when adjusting the blade height. Take off the blade cover and it trims a fine line. It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge and no batteries to mess with. The only thing I miss is a case to put it in, but for the price, how can I complain?</li>
    <li> This product is precise and durable. Its an awesome value and perfect for that stubble look. Well built with good battery life. Ive paid $40 or more for lesser products, several times now actually. I would absolutely buy another 1 if this one broke.</li>
    <li> This is a brilliant little trimmer. The scroll wheel is excellent, I keep my beard at a 3 and my mustache at a 2, which is plenty long/short (depending on how you look at it) enough for a well-maintained beard very appropriate for the workplace. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost an entire year now, and the blades are still very sharp, no pinching whatsoever. Also, I think I&#x27;ve only had to charge it a handful of times - the battery life is tremendous. It feels very sturdy and almost waterproof, when I go on trips I just throw it in my backpack and fish it out later. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well with the guard removed. I can&#x27;t get the shave I want on my neckline, but then again no electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used has done that, so it&#x27;s not really a knock. Very efficient as well - I find I only have to make one pass, two at most to get an even trim, which means it takes about two minutes to complete my facial grooming in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I really love this trimmer.  It really holds a charge and I like the settings options. Plus there is only one attachment...you don&#x27;t have pieces of it everywhere.  Its gets pretty close too.</li>
    <li> Just got it today, and tried it out, so far so good!!!  It&#x27;s very comfortable, a clean shave with no pulling, and it&#x27;s convenient that everything is in one piece!!!!  The only downside is that my buddy bought the exact same thing at Walmart for the same price!  Would have been five stars, but minus one for offering it at the same price as Walmart!</li>
    <li> I had been using the same $5 walmart battery operated beard trimmer for more than 6 years.  I never really thought about the quality of it because it was so cheap but when it finally went out to pasture in my recent move I needed a replacement.  I actually did alot of research and didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of money which brought me to this product.  What sold me on it initially was the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a bunch of extra pieces that I would have to keep track of.  The adjustable head seemed perfect.  Once I got it and used it I have to say its the best trimmer I had ever used.  It worked better than even the $50+ hair clippers my brother owns.  I would definately recommend this product to anyone looking for great quality for a great price.  I can&#x27;t imagine what would be better if you spent more money on a \\&quot;higher quality\\&quot; trimmer.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! dont have to worry about losing attachments or attachments BREAKING!....Works great! My last groomer was  good but little by little the attachments started breaking! No worries with this one!</li>
    <li> Much better than what I used to use.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, but it&#x27;s not working anymore. it has a nice feel to it and it has the right settings.   i just bought it about 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> What to say.  It&#x27;s got a nice strong motor so no snagging, just clean cuts, the battery charges fast and holds for a decent amount of time, the guard is easy to use, what with the click wheel, and easy to pop off, no risk of losing multiple small guards.    However the guard itself is a big of a problem.  The \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; of the guard are super, super soft.  Any amount of pressure will cause them to be pushed down, lowing a 5 level to a 3 and a 3 to a 1 and so on.  If the guard were made of a harder, less flexible plastic, I&#x27;d give it five, as it is, you have to be super, super gentle and not put any pressure on it, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with patches of your beard shorter than in other spots where you used a lighter touch.</li>
    <li> I bought this baby last March, right from the get-go I was shocked with how well it worked. I have a pretty thick beard and it was smoother than any of the last trimmers I&#x27;ve used and I have gone through dozens. I really like that the charger is just a plug into the trimmer and not some base that always breaks. Today I noticed that it didn&#x27;t charge anymore. 8 months it lasted which doesn&#x27;t sound like long but honestly that is more than most of the more expensive trimmers lasted as well so I just bought a new one. Can&#x27;t beat it in terms of value.</li>
    <li> The trimmer just does not do a good job.  I went over my beard and head at least 20 times and each time got a bit more trim.  After the ~20 times my hair and beard looked neat, but that is not what I expect from a highly rated trimmer. It does not matter what angle or how fast you move the trimmer - it consistently does a poor job.    As other customers have noted, \\&quot;You get what you pay for, and in this case it is not much.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer from more then 10 years. My first trimmer bougth in Italy still works sharp.  The wheel to regulate the length of the cut is not only useful but  \\&quot;necessary\\&quot; to me as i like varying often between lengths according to the face position.  I bought the second one only because I have moved from europe to US and I needed the new power supply for 120V (220V in europe).....so I thought would be better to buy the entire thing to have a backup trimmer. Now I am set for other 10 years.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the money. Good buy if you need a simple beard trimmer. Easy to use and clean. I will recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. Read some negative reviews before purchasing, so was concerned at first, but well worth the price (which is extremely low in my opinion, offering a great value). Powerful, and the length adjustments really stay in place, with no additional parts. The only issue is you have to be careful what angle you hold it at, or else it will cut shorter than you may want at longer lengths.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described and works great. Great trimmer for the price and I love that it is cordless as well. This was exactly what I was looking for. So far so good</li>
    <li> Our old beard trimmer finally gave up, so I was in the market for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one because I loved the way it looked and it said battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, be aware that when you buy \\&quot;battery operated\\&quot;, it simply means there is no cord.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a LITHIUM battery.  That means that you have to CHARGE it, and often.&lt;br /&gt;That part has been a big disappointment to me.  I wanted a trimmer that you just popped new&lt;br /&gt;batteries in as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this model is that it dies randomly. You can&#x27;t use it while it is charging&lt;br /&gt;either. Yes, it will turn on, but there&#x27;s no power behind it. We don&#x27;t use it every day, so&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have the need or space to keep it plugged in all the time. That means it&#x27;s a roll of the&lt;br /&gt;dice any time you want to use it as to whether or not it will have enough charge to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, we hadn&#x27;t used it for a while, and I went to trim my husband&#x27;s sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;Dead in the box - no power at all. I charged it for maybe 10 minutes, thinking that would at least&lt;br /&gt;give us enough oomph to trim those little spots of hair. Nope. Started up fine, but died before I&lt;br /&gt;could complete the second sideburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that this takes an adapter, so it is yet another adapter that needs to be stored&lt;br /&gt;some place!  I keep all our hair cutting things in a box (I do our family&#x27;s hair at home, having had&lt;br /&gt;a beautician in the family, I learned plenty from her). It is uber annoying to pull out the box&lt;br /&gt;to work on hair and have no power, despite having not used it. So, the battery discharges itself&lt;br /&gt;whether you use it or not.  I hate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is wonderful - it feels so good in the hand, easy to use, ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;If they would just go back and rework the battery part, this would be the perfect trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;As is, it annoys the heck out of me. The blade cuts cleanly, and the plastic length guide&lt;br /&gt;does a good job as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you use a trimmer daily and can keep the charger close by, then you&#x27;ll love this one.&lt;br /&gt;If you only use it from time to time, be prepared to plan a day ahead and charge it, or be&lt;br /&gt;tempted to toss it into the trash can.y use it from time to time, be prepared to plan a day ahead and charge it, or be   tempted to toss it into the trash can.</li>
    <li> So, the current style on men is having some stubble on your face but still groomed. Meaning shave your neck line and above the cheeks so you still look clean cut. Anyways, I wanted a trimmer that would give me that \\&quot;in\\&quot; look of having stubble, but still be office appropriate. Well, this thing does the job splendidly! I use number 3 on my sideburn area and then #2 everywhere else for a quick, precise, and stylish trim. Love this thing, perfect for that modern look of stubble yet groomed.  Pros  -really inexpensive  -trims evenly and with precision  -never any pain or pulling  -easy to clean  -holds it charge for a long time  Cons  -should of bought one years ago  ;-)</li>
    <li> i am very happy that i decided to buy this item instead of the Wahl beard trimmer. It has worked better than the previous Remington trimmer i had and it was the same brand.  i would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this beard trimmer when I got it, but within a few months the battery started to go dead.  Problem is that it does not function while plugged in, so the only way to get it to work is with it being charged up.  It won&#x27;t take enough charge for me to trim my whole beard, which is very very annoying.  Stay far away from this product unless you want to replace it within a few months.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a good product so far. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and it holds the charge well, it trims very evenly and has more than enough length settings. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> the shaver works just fine and i charged it the first time i used it and it worked but the second time i use it and went to charge it the battery wouldnt charge. i tried everything and even basically pulled it apart but still could not figure out why it wasnt working</li>
    <li> At first I thought that there was something wrong with the battery because it quit on me while my wife was triming my hair.  It just wasn&#x27;t charged properly at first.  Now I don&#x27;t have any problems.  I don&#x27;t use it every day but I haven&#x27;t needed to charge it since.  I bought because it&#x27;s cordless and easy to use.  The guard is easy to use and stays how you set it.  I&#x27;m glad I got it and Amazon is great to work with.</li>
    <li> This product is what the positive reviews say it is. The trimmer works perfectly and I have no complaints so far with it. Glad I had purchased it.</li>
    <li> I guess I am not alone in my great dissatisfaction with the charging capabilities, or lack thereof, with this unit. What is Remington thinking, really? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service, yet in about a year, can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two. That it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in, unless it&#x27;s already charged, compounds the frustration &amp; annoyance! No matter how long it&#x27;s charged, even overnight, it will not hold a charge for more than a day, two at the most. And when it&#x27;s dead, even plugging it in does no good. I doubt Ill ever buy another Remington product again, for even the shaver works well, which this one does, if it can&#x27;t be used when needed, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this trimmer.  I have a light beard to keep in shape, and thus twice I bought this product through Amazon.  On both, the rechargeable battery died shortly after the short warranty.  Non-replaceable battery.  Remington wouldn&#x27;t help.  I even offered to pay for new batteries, but no go.  Obviously these are designed to be completely disposable.  That bothers me.  I bought the second cause it was cheaper than before and I thought the first failure might have been a fluke.  That one is on me.  I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the form factor and it works fine for my beard, but the battery dies after about 48 hours. Since I only need to trim my beard twice a week, when I realize need it in the morning before work it is basically useless unless I remember to plug it in the night before.</li>
    <li> Remmington&#x27;s MB-200 trimmer certainly is not among the most expensive mustache and beard trimmers on the market, and it&#x27;s fairly minimalistic, but it works well, holds a charge quite well, and seems sturdy enough to provide months and months and months of service.  The trimmer does have a few quirks, though.  Although the numbered wheel that allows the user to dial in the correct hair length works well, it is placed just where the user might think the on/off switch would be.  The other quirky aspect of the trimmer is that it really provides the most consistent beard length when it&#x27;s used in what some users might think of as an upside-down position.  Once the user gets used to these little oddities, though, the MB-200 is fully usable and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer-does a good job, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have a MB-200 which is loosing battery life.&lt;br /&gt;The MB-200 works for me. Use it several time per&lt;br /&gt;week. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer gets the job done. If the battery is low, plugging it in doesn&#x27;t give you full power instantly you have to wait for it to charge up even if its plugged in. Otherwise great.</li>
    <li> This product is better than advertised.Easy to use and is better than other higher priced trimmers.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best beard trimmer for the price that I have owned.  Rechargeable, has a thumbwheel for easy depth   settings.  You don&#x27;t have to change heads.  You pull the head off and you have a wide mustache trimmer.  Great item.</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer. My hat off to Remington. I have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard. It words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after reading many favorable reviews about it.  Previously I had been using a Remington PG-200 which was alright, but the attachments that it came with left much to be desired.  The plastic pins that secured them to the timmer broke off and left them virtually useless. I am very happy with the MB-200, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean. It does a good job of trimming my beard and doesn&#x27;t give a choppy uneven cut like I was getting with the other trimmer. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not much to report - the price is good, and it works just fine.  All the controls are easy to use and it&#x27;s comfortable.  The only downside is there&#x27;s no vacuum to suck up the whiskers, but models with that feature are more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer and the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Compared to the laborious comb and scissors I was using before, the Remington trimmer does a much better job in a fraction of the time.  It cuts without any tugs or pulls, and fits my hand well.  It seems solidly made, and I have yet to recharge it after 3 weeks of use.  Wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used the product three times. I doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I paid $30 for this thing and I want my money back. I will be phoning Remington to let them know about this product. It cuts great, but the product just didn&#x27;t charge up anymore.</li>
    <li> holds a charge well, trims well, easy to adjust.  better than my old trimmer.  only problem is that without the plastic guide it&#x27;s a jagged edge not a smooth one.  I&#x27;d recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2013&lt;br /&gt;Still working great, and it still holds a charge for a LONG time (1-2 months) before it needs to be charged.  Still 5 stars after 5+ years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a month, and using it once a week to keep the beard trimmed.  No complaints so far.  It was charged right out of the box and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.  The banana-shape took a bit of getting used to (as opposed to previous trimmers I owned that had a more \\&quot;candy bar\\&quot; shape) but I find that it allows for a more solid grip on the trimmer and doesn&#x27;t affect its use.  I really like the dial to adjust the trim length (I thought this was going to be gimmicky, but it&#x27;s actually quite practical).  The length guard comes off quite easily, for using the trimmer \\&quot;without a net\\&quot;.  Having been using various trimmers for the past 15 years and this one ranks as one of the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer going on three years now, it&#x27;s lasted a long time.  I use it pretty much exclusively for my facial hair which is thick and fast growing.  I get razor bumps bad from blades and even when using my Panasonic foil shaver - my skin is much better after switching to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time.  I use it two or three times a week and can go three weeks or a month between charges.  Even at close to three years old, I haven&#x27;t noticed a decline in the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Great for my skin - your mileage may vary, but using this is so much better for my skin than a blade or even a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets stuck inside.  You have to flip open the top and really shake it to get all of the hair out.  It seems like it doesn&#x27;t work as well when there&#x27;s a lost stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;Closest setting isn&#x27;t that close.  The most shallow setting isn&#x27;t all that close and I&#x27;d have a decent beard if I used the guide.  I carefully.  I end up using it bare nearly all of the time. (carefully)  Doesn&#x27;t get super close, but I work at a tech company, so a permanent shadow isn&#x27;t a big deal, and I like the look.&lt;br /&gt;Charger looks like a weird headphone jack.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband at Christmas. He was using his regular shaver to trim his beard. He would have never purchased this trimmer for himself and would have been content to \\&quot;make due\\&quot; with his shaver. I like his beard and was afraid he&#x27;d cut off more beard than he&#x27;d like with the old shaver. This trimmer has an adjustable trimmer so that his beard length will be proportional. He does like this trimmer and it has made trimming a lot easier for him.</li>
    <li> This clipper is a good size, easy to use with multiple adjustments, seems to hold a charge well, and seems solid and durable (hard to say, I have had it for only a month or so).  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the shortest setting were a bit shorter, but otherwise, it seems a good product so far.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this razor.  It is fine for thinning back my goatee and moustache, but it does a lousy job of trimming the line on my moustache.   The one positive I can mention is that it holds a charge for a long time and isn&#x27;t as noisy as other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.   I would not recommend this to anyone - I prbably should have returned it but I used it and waited too long.</li>
    <li> I have always hated hated hated having to shave. Now that I own this I dont mind it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he seems to like it and no complaint as he puts it.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver also. A bit to big. holds a charge for a long time and has sharp blades.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have grown and shaved my beard several times. I bought my first Remington MB 200 close to 15 years ago. I can&#x27;t remember what happened to it, but I remember liking it upon first use. I bought a second trimmer about 3 years ago. It worked well, but ultimately stopped charging. ( I have not been able to figure out if the battery is replaceable.....) I dropped the third trimmer and the beard length controler broke. My fault. I am about to purchase a fourth. I tried a few others, but none is as good for the price. Would give 5 stars if I could be assured that the battery was easily replaceable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl beard trimmer for the last 3 plus years, that looks and functions like a normal hair clippers.  But the little guard thing kept coming off mid-shave...with sometime disastrous results.  With the Wahl, a beard trim normally took ~15 minutes, and generally, would leave an inconsistent length.  So I saw this on sale, and pulled the trigger.  Last night, went in to trim my beard just a bit, and after seeing how easy and thorough it worked, trimmed my whole beard....in less than 5 minutes!  Not only is it easier to use and quicker than my old trimmer, it leaves my beard with a consistent length all the way around.  I only wish I had bought this sooner!  Updated review.  I can&#x27;t even remember how long its been since I purchased this, but its still going strong.  Only one downside I&#x27;ve found - you can&#x27;t shave while its plugged it/charging.  This is mildly problematic if you failed to have a full charge to cover your trim.....you&#x27;re kind of stuck with a half trim until its charged enough to finish up.  I&#x27;d probably give it 4 stars because of that...but I&#x27;d still buy it again.  Edit - Update - February 2012 (originally purchased Sept 2010).  The trimmer has basically died.  It was dropped, and now works somewhat sporadically.  The battery life has started to fade and only lasted two trims really before needing to be recharged.  I&#x27;m going to try another brand - leaning towards braun, hoping for longer life of a product.</li>
    <li> Perfect traveling trimmer.  I have a full beard and mustache, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this.  It doesn&#x27;t have a base, just plug charger into the bottom end, which makes this ideal for taking on the road.  Update a year later.  This thing is still the best trimmer I have ever purchased.  I don&#x27;t even bother with my $100 setup. Holds a charge well, and the guard never slips.</li>
    <li> The battery quit holding a charge overnight after 3 weeks of ownership. This is especially frustrating because the trimmer doesn&#x27;t operate unless there&#x27;s at least a slight charge on the battery. My previous Remington trimmer (almost identical model, now discontinued) lasted 5 years before the battery gave out, and could be used 4-6 times on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Jan 2015 Update - DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH A WARRANTY REPLACEMENT&lt;br /&gt;In response to the Remington customer rep&#x27;s comment to this review I was able to get a warranty replacement. The customer service rep was great and reaffirmed my belief that Remington was still a great brand although I was unlucky to receive a factory defect. Unfortunately the new unit has the identical problem. My guess is that the company is trying to look like the Nice Guy on the internet but doesn&#x27;t actually care about production quality or the customer. I&#x27;ve been a Remington owner since I first needed to start shaving, have always bought Remington products and recommended them to others, and I&#x27;m sad to say I&#x27;m no longer a customer for life. Thank you Ms. B at customer service---I only wish the corporate management cared about the brand as much as you do.</li>
    <li> My husband has had a beard for 32 years and says this is the best trimmer he has ever used.  Fits the hand well.  The down side:  he wishes it had a stand to sit in.</li>
    <li> While the adjustable head is a great idea in terms of convenience, the gear broke after a few weeks of use. In addition, the battery life on the shaver is very bad. An overnight charger can get the all of your facial hair trimming done; anything less than an overnight charge will give you 5 or 10 minutes of use if you&#x27;re lucky. Overall, a good idea, but the bad battery and the terrible construction of the adjustable head makes this a bad product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over two years now and have been very pleased with it.  It holds it&#x27;s charge well, cuts precisely and is well built, there&#x27;s not much more you could ask for.</li>
    <li> Technology is superior. Close, clean shave with no knicks. Love it!  Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace a Norelco unit that died after a number of years.  I liked my Norleco unit but it sure wasn&#x27;t the professional unit my barber used to trim my mustache.  I figured I would have to spend a fortune to get one like the barber so I looked for another Norelco like I had to no avail.    I probably spent an hour reading reviews on Amazon.  Lots of talk about beards, but not so much about mustaches.  I took a chance on this one and it is terrific.  If feels like what my barber uses.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> complete junk, broke, the battery from day one was terrible and died within an hour of not even being used, bought  a phillips for 18 and that thing is a beast</li>
    <li> This is my second MB-200 that I&#x27;ve owned.  The first one was amazingly convenient.  It held a charge for around a month.  With no accessories, it was great for traveling.  Unfortunally my cats knocked it off of the sink with the guard extended.  It broke a small piece inside and the guard doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  So I suggest to store it with the guard all the way in so that can&#x27;t happen.  Other than that, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I replaced a very old Norelco that served me well for over 5 years.  I tried the version of the Norelco that replaced mine and found it was terribly made.  It looked like the cheapest possible plastic available in the world and felt lousy in my hand.  The cut from the blade was good but I didn&#x27;t like the little hinged blade guard.  It just got in the way and added nothing positive.  This Remington feels much heavier and sturdier.  It feels better to hold and seems to give a decent trim to my mustache and beard.  Its not as good as my old one, a little rougher but I prefered it slightly to the new Norelco version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just had this trimmer a couple weeks, and I love it.  The \\&quot;dial-up\\&quot; hair length mechanism works great.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.  Seems solid.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> We just got a second Remington beard trimmer for my hirsute husband.  He loves the original one (which still works great) but wanted another so he didn&#x27;t have to take it back and forth to our vacation place.  This is a great value, easy to use without all the separate little trimmer heads that will only get misplaced someday.  The selector dial is easy to use, and he can select what length he wants for each part of his face \\&quot;on the go\\&quot;.  The price is certainly right for such a quality item.  I bought a Wahl trimmer at almost 3X the price, which was very well-made and solid, but he just didn&#x27;t like all the little doodads that had to be changed each time he wanted a different length.  The Remington trimmer also feels very solid, and not like cheap plastic.  He has been using his older version of this trimmer for several years, and it still works great...this one should be the same.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price for sure. I have bought others and would buy more. This one was not a top quality one though and had a mechanic problems so we shall see.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer on the market for the money. I shopped around at Target looking a various trimmers but ended up going with this one. I wanted a trimmer less a billion extra attachments and the greesy oil apply. This trimmer came with 4 items: Trimmer, comb, charger, and one universal attachment.  It&#x27;s works very well, holds a good charge, and best of all no mess. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right, this bad-boy has seen some pretty heavy action and is still in really good condition. The battery lasts for a while after a charge (enough for a two week road trip) after about 3 years of (bi)weekly use. I love this trimmer. I have had no problems with it at all. To be honest, I don&#x27;t mess with the length adjustment, I always shave with the plastic head off. It keeps the hair short, but still gives a scruffy man look that women love (without scratching too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer for everyone with a beard who wants to keep it in control, or who has a beard and does not want a beard (but hates shaving with a razor) or just wants the scruffy look. It works great for keeping your \\&quot;privates\\&quot; in check too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer just works, and it just works well. Don&#x27;t waste your time on anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer five times, but I would give it six stars if I could.  It didn&#x27;t look like it would work, but I took a chance and bought it after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  It does a better job and gets the job done much faster than the previous two trimmers I&#x27;ve owned with the various \\&quot;combs.\\&quot;  I could not be happier with it, except I was hoping to find a corded version to help save the environment.  I have not had to recharge it yet.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a great job. However, the battery died after a few weeks and won&#x27;t hold a charge. I have to keep it plugged in all the time, and still it begins to die after a few minutes shaving while plugged in.</li>
    <li> i had a old remington trimmer for 5 yrs and it was going out on me so i replace it with this model which is olmost the same.remington item last for a while and for the price you cant complain, its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have owned many beard and mustache trimmers over the last 30 years and this is the best I have owned.  It is easy to use, cuts beards and mustaches to the desired length without slipping and cutting too close.  It is also has a powerful motor so there is no pulling.  I would highly recommend this product and would purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I had never used a Remington product before so I was a bit skeptical and with a beard trimmer one has to be.  You don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s going to rip your hair out, made that mistake already.  The Remington MB-200 worked flawlessly.  It has a good weight to it, has plenty of length settings and the battery life is great.  I have used it probably half a dozen times and it is still going strong... as is my beard.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced beard trimmer, no need for oil, easy to use, and it does a great job.  Now I can get my beard trimmed without a barber.</li>
    <li> I havnt used it a lot yet but it seems good, the motor runs well and the charge lasts a good while.  Blades are sharp and the wheel adjustment for length is handy as well as solid.</li>
    <li> poor battery life ... I have already replaced this with Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache Beard and Stubble Trimmer</li>
    <li> It takes a dozen passes of a spot for it to create a uniform length.    You can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging.    You can&#x27;t use it with water.    The available lengths for it are too far apart - the 0 leaves you with almost no hair, and the 1 leaves you with a week&#x27;s worth of beard.    However, on the bright side, it is fairly cheap (though I assure you, you get what you pay for)</li>
    <li> I replaced my previous Remington trimmer (that had worked over 10 years) with this one. I&#x27;m completely disappointed in the difference in battery life. I basically have to keep it plugged in at all times in order to use it. Leaving it unplugged for even a day drains the battery completely. This is very inconvenient because it also takes hours to charge it so that it stays on longer than more than 20 seconds. Avoid.</li>
    <li> Sort of flimsy and not particularly good at trimming. I used to have the MB 35 I believe and that was great. This one is no worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers. The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do, then settings 1-3 will be the same. They will be a setting 1 - the closest. Reason for this is the guard is very flexible and doesn&#x27;t hold the 2nd and 3rd settings very well. Overall I do not like the weight, I think it is too heavy for what it is. I prefer the weighting of my Norelco G370 and this is still the best all &#x27;round beard trimmer for my money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a similar model that worked great. This one has no moustache trimmer and the clip doesn&#x27;t come off, so you get just a basic beard trimmer.  The worst problem is the unit will not hold a charge overnight or after a few minutes of use.  It also will not run directly off the power cord like previous models.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Quite a few attachments but works well</li>
    <li> This may not be the most robust or technically advanced trimmer, but it gets the job done. Definitely not a bad price at $15, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer looks good. However, it does not hold a battery charge beyond 2 trimmings.    The charger cannot be used to operate the trimmer. Therefore, you must wait 14-16 hours to use the trimmer if it is not fully charged.    This is the worst trimmer that I have ever used and I have had a beard for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> The product works wonderfully except that you must, must, must rake hair in through the comb in exactly the right way or else you&#x27;ll gouge out huge chunks: the guard on the bottom side of the trimmer doesn&#x27;t change its depth as you adjust it, instead always remaining almost flush with the bottom side.  This is a dumb design flaw: one should be able to safely twist and turn a trimmer without ever having hair cut shorter than the chosen guard setting indicates.</li>
    <li> Had great use out of it, but it broke when I dropped it.</li>
    <li> like this very well. highly recommend. works great. charge lasts forever. settings 1-9, 2 works just nice. can slip the head off and use clippers to shape beard line, etc.</li>
    <li> Like the small profile in my hand. Really easy to trim and the adjustable height cutting profile is perfect for a trim on my goatee. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. Very easy to operate. The guard is easy to attach and reattach as needed. It does what i wanted which is to keep my goatee looking neat. The only complaint really is the battery life. I only use it once a week anyway so its not a factor.</li>
    <li> The trimmer when charged works great, but the reason I believe this product only deserves two stars is that you cannot use it while the battery is charging. That&#x27;s right, even if the razor is plugged in, if the battery is low or dead, you cannot use it. You must wait until the battery is at least partially charged. This was a serious issue for me because I only use the razor every two weeks, which is just long enough for the battery to die. I would have to remember to charge it the night before I was planning to use it, which I often forgot to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased it and didn&#x27;t get a chance to open it until after the return policy window expired. It will not charge whatsoever. I was able to utilize it for a few days on the initial charge, but now it will not retain any charge. Not sure if its a bad cord, or trimmer.</li>
    <li> OK product, but like most beard trimmers they go bad after 2 years. Can&#x27;t really complain though, since the product wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer by far. I&#x27;m actually back on here Amazon to order a new one and thought I&#x27;d leave a review for you trimmer-seeking folks. The last one probably lasted me over a year.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer. I have had it for several years now and love it. Still going strong and I use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Easily adjustable and no need to waste time looking for the right length or trimming attachment. Length of cut is easily changed. The guide is attached to the trimmer and easily adjusted quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used several trimmers in the past and have been very dissatisfied with the majority of them. A purchased an MB-400 but dropped it an could not get the trimmer back onto the handle. As this product was discontinued I bought the MB-200 and am extremely pleased. It is smooth, easy to adjust, and never pulls or gets caught in the beard.</li>
    <li> When it worked, it was fantastic. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, though -- like everyone else&#x27;s here.</li>
    <li> Even though I went through most of the reviews for this trimmer, I was skeptical about this. But finally I bought the trimmer and trimmed my beard which is 2 weeks old. Surprisingly, this worked like a charm...I fell in love with this trimmer after the first use...It didn&#x27;t pull my beard at all. No rashes or any kinda problems. Above all for the price, I would strongly recommend this product with 5*****</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband - he thinks it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Works great, super easy to use with the height adjustable comb unit.  Super for other edge trimming with the comb off.  The battery lasts for many days on a single charge.</li>
    <li> The good: the trimmer works great!    The bad:   1) no charging stand.  2) it has the short life NiCad batteries instead of the more modern NiMh.  3) the recycle law has been met by the letter rather than the spirit of the law.  The batteries which will last not much more than 2 years are soldered in.  Thus when the batteries go south, you can cut them out but likely most people will not be able to solder in replacements.  Thus a product that could last 10 years is likely in the trash at three years.</li>
    <li> One of the main reasons I purchased the Remington MB-200 Trimmer was the large number of highly favorable reviews it received; well, here&#x27;s another!  This is a great product that exceeded my expectations.  It holds a charge for weeks with light use, it easily adjusts to trim a beard or goatee perfectly even to almost any length desired and it&#x27;s quiet and well made.  The number of attachments that many other products come with is cumbersome and confusing.  With its simple adjustable built-in trimmer guard, the Remington eliminates the need for any other accessories, except the compact re-charger.  I am very satisfied with this trimmer and would highly recommend it to any guy who wants to keep his facial hair neatly groomed.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest trimmer I have used.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer once a week. It is usually plugged in. In the middle of trimming, it just randomly shuts down.</li>
    <li> I needed a trimmer to take with me for traveling and this product did not disappoint. It caught my eye due to the price but it is of a solid construction material that I do not expect to break in my luggage. Do not get me wrong, I don&#x27;t expect it to survive much abuse by dropping it.     The trimming experience is adequate.  This has really saved me time in the mornings, but I would have liked the closest setting to be a bit closer of a shave.  I do make sure to take the head off and clean out any hair that may collect every week, so i am not sure what a lack of maintenance may do to its performance and life span. Power retention may not be as great as higher end models, but for the price I can handle plugging it in every few weeks.    If you are looking for a affordable trimmer that you would not rage over losing or breaking and still performs well, consider trying this product.</li>
    <li> I use this little guy to trim my beard and my hair.  It&#x27;s awesome, very sharp, very quick, very easy to use.  The adjustable blades stay where you set them, so you won&#x27;t take a chunk out your head.  I recommend this to anyone looking to trim there own beard or hair.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for few months now and I even trimmed my hair with it once. It is excellent for beard since it has adjustable spacing.. from 1 - 9. You can even remove the plastic spacer and use the trimmer for precise edges. Highly recommend it, especially at price Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> I started growing my present beard 3-4 weeks ago.  My only complaint is that the directions are sorely lacking in how to use this trimmer.  There is no picture with the adjustable length attachment in place &amp; not nearly enough words to save stress in figuring out which way to use it without cutting your beard very short or at the desired length.  I finally figured it out this morning &amp; with fear tried it &amp; I had figured right.  It worked great, but had I not thought it through for the past couple of weeks, it could have been a beard disaster.  I think I will enjoy using the trimmer now that I figured it out and tested it.  I have had beards previously in my life with no electric trimmer but this time will be a more pleasant experience at controlling the length &amp; style.  So the only reason I did not give the trimmer 5 stars is because of the crummy directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a short beard all my life and always used inexpensive trimmers. Unlike most, this one feels solid, not cheaply built, and it holds a charge unbelievably well. Its powerful and fast and cuts cleanly, no tugging. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for several weeks without recharging it, and it still runs like it was just charged (which doesn&#x27;t matter to me, but is amazing anyway.)   The height adjustment locks in positively so, unlike many I have used, you don&#x27;t have to worry that it will click down a few settings by accident in mid shave, which is hugely important. It also has very fine adjustments, and you can remove the guard to get a very short trim (down to almost a two or three day stubble length I&#x27;d say.)   If it has any drawback, its that the longest length setting is relatively short - maybe an  inch. Not a problem for most people, but if you wear your beard longer than that, it might be. I wear a short crew cut and use it on my head too - works great. It has no other attachments (nose/ear trimmer, etc), but in my experience most of that stuff is next to useless anyway.</li>
    <li> Cuts evenly without pulling.  Since I use this product only in between Barber visit cannnot comment on the durability or life of this product.  It suits the needs for which I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> It works well, and the only downside of it is the power line that can only charge the battery but cannot supply power for it to continue working during charging.</li>
    <li> I originally had this trimmer many years ago and replaced it with a Norelco when the battery went out on me, that was a mistake. If you have a beard this is the trimmer to get, it always cuts even and mine is still on the first battery charge which was 5 weeks ago and that&#x27;s with 3 uses per week! If you&#x27;re looking for a solid, dependable trimmer look no further, you just found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Do not get the trimmer wet or rinse the blades with water, this will slowly remove the lubrication on the blades causing more friction and the battery to drain more quickly. Also, without lubrication the blades will pull at your facial hair and cut unevenly. Although the manufacturer states the blades never need oiling, they will if they get wet.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my hair and my goatee mustache/beard. The wheel adjustabillity is a big plus on this trimmer. With in minutes I am completely groomed every few days. I have the lengths down on the wheel, and they are very precise. It is also built very sturdy. Really recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this trimmer if you expect to get clean edges. For short haircuts you need to go over the same area many times in different directions. I also don&#x27;t like battery operated trimmers, as when the battery dies, you need to need to replace the battery. In this case you can&#x27;t do that, you need to pay the manufacture to replace the battery. Buy one with a cord.</li>
    <li> Look at all the other one star reviews before buying. The battery will not hold a charge at all. You can never leave it unplugged and even if you do that doesn&#x27;t mean it will be charged when you use it. Also it will not run at all without a charged battery. Don&#x27;t think you can just use it while it is plugged in. This is the worst bread trimmer I have ever seen, and Remington should absolutely be ashamed of themselves for putting this piece of junk on the market.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, for many different makes and models, this one seemed to make the most sense for obvious reasons.  Only thing is, it&#x27;s kind of large. I just saw in a store, they have a newer model which looks almost identical, but is half the size.  In any case, I haven&#x27;t hard to charge it since buying it, but it feels very sturdy in your hand and is very easy to use.  for 15$ you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Very easy, convenient to use but it only worked for about five months before the battery stopped taking charge. I&#x27;m waiting for a response from Remington to see if it&#x27;s covered under warranty.</li>
    <li> Good product for an affordable price!! Using it for more than a year now and is working without any hassles..</li>
    <li> Great trimmer - fast and powerful.  Does get hairs everywhere, but it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than trimmers with built-in vacuums.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped on time, and works great.  Great price, and easy to use.  I like to cut my hair with this beard trimmer, since the additional settings allow my to better control the length of my hair!</li>
    <li> It was great for a few weeks, now it won&#x27;t charge at all.  What a piece of garbage.  You can rest assured that I will never buy anything from Remington again.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best trimmer on the market - I think I&#x27;ve tried every single trimmer on the market and this is not only the best trimmer out there but also the cheapest. I&#x27;ll be purchasing Remington products in the future!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great for trimming my beard, sideburns, back of neck, etc in between visits to the barbershop.  With the attachment, you don&#x27;t even have to use a comb, it has like nine different length settings.  Also very easy to clean.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Good price for a good trimmer. The settings are in line with other manufacturers and the battery life seems to be average.</li>
    <li> It works well enough but every time I go to clean the thing, the blade portion falls off. You can look and see how very cheaply this itty bitty plastic piece is. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before it wears out, breaks and makes the razor unusable. I&#x27;m just sick of the cheapo plastic designs. Again, the razor works as advertised, but it&#x27;s just more cheap plastic waiting to break.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another Remington shaver.  Unfortunately, this shaver is simpler (and cheaper) as it doesn&#x27;t have a short, second cutting blade, for trimming along the moustache and other close areas.  The unit shaves very well.  However, the one I bought malfunctioned - a piece of spring fell out of the head, misaligning the blade - and I cut myself.  Overall, this shave is somewhat problematic and not as good a product as before.</li>
    <li> I used prior reviews to giude my purchase &amp; now that I have the trimmer, it far Exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is a goodproduct. Light weight and it keeps a pretty long charge...at least long enough to get the job done. My only two gripes are that I wish it was usable while plugged in and that the blade was a little sharper to get a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I have a beard, so I need something reliable to keep it evenly trimmed. I wouldn&#x27;t go with any other trimmer besides the Remington MB-200.  The razor length is adjustable to nine different lengths with a simple scrolling wheel, so you can cut your beard and body hair down to any length you want. The blades are titanium coated, so they&#x27;ll last long and there&#x27;s no need to sharpen them. Cleaning is easy, too. The top opens up, and you simply blow or shake the hair out. Charging is a cinch; just plug it in and let it charge, and a charging indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s finished charging.   It seems that a lot of people are complaining about the life span of the razor&#x27;s rechargeable battery. I&#x27;m thinking some people might have faulty razors, but this is my second one and I&#x27;m happy with the battery life. When it&#x27;s new you should get a few uses out of it before you have to charge it again. Like with any rechargeable device, you should only charge it when the battery is running low for maximum battery life. After a year or so of regular use, you&#x27;ll notice that you have to charge it a bit more frequently, but this is the case with all rechargable devices, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  My only real complaint with the MB-200 is that the hinge that allows you to clean inside of the razor is plastic. It shouldn&#x27;t break if you&#x27;re careful with it, so just don&#x27;t drop it repeatedly. Otherwise, the fact that it&#x27;s plastic isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, and it helps keep the cost way down. I first had an older version of the MB-200, and it lasted a few years (until Feb. 2011) until I dropped it on my bathroom floor, breaking one of the plastic hinges and one of the teeth on the comb.  I should also mention that this isn&#x27;t an electric/corded trimmer; it&#x27;s cordless. For the best performance, you have to charge it fully before unplugging it and using it.  The bottom line: If you&#x27;re in the market for a rechargeable, reliable, fairly sturdy beard/body hair trimmer, then go with the Remington MB-200. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost six months now, and the battery is more or less as good as it was when I first opened it. It gives me a clean, even trim every time, and cleaning is easy. And for under $20, I promise you won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a strong motor and sharp blades. Doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened. Came fully charger, but charged it the 14 hours suggested in the manual. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time, Norelco was Norelco, and not Norelco Phillips. They used to make a fantastic trimmer that didn&#x27;t try to be everything to everyone, like the current one they offer. It was a beard and mustache trimmer, and it did a fantastic job. Would hold a charge for months, didn&#x27;t have 8000 attachments.    Why do I mention this thing? Because this Remington seems to be the God-child of that old Norelco I had for years. It&#x27;s solid, feels good in the hand. It has ONE trimmer attachment, not six. I don&#x27;t want to trim my ears with it, and it won&#x27;t do it, unless I was crazy enough to stick the corner in my ear and chop half my ear off. I need it for my mustache and beard and it does an amazing job. The number on the front actually measures out in fractions of a centimeter what the depth of the blade is. It holds a charge for a good long time, is neat, and sharp. I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for a trimmer, except to get it half off - and, oh yeah, it did that too!    I highly recommend this over the Phillips Norelco G370 which I had before. I lost chargers, the stand that comes with the shaver doesn&#x27;t really allow for charging in place.. it was just a mess. Get the Remington and save yourself a lot of trouble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought three different Remington Beard and Mustache Trimmers to trim my goatee/side burns and the MB-200 continues in the long line of superior and affordably-priced trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is quiet, palm-sized, has a long battery life between charges, and does a wonderful job cutting.  Recently I tried the Braun Cruze 6, which is twice as expensive, and it paled in comparison.  Using the exact same cutting method, it routinely left hair that I had then go back with the Remington and trim.  I liked the one I owned so much before buying the MB-200 that when the batteries died, I took it apart, jerry-rigged new rechargeable AA&#x27;s into it, and used it for another 3-4 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly there really is no comparison with other trimmers and for $20-25 and a 5-10 year expected lifetime, you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> Did a big mistake buying this item. It would have been better if i had ordered my previous trimmer from Philips.</li>
    <li> The title says it.  I probably used it ten times and now its dead.  I bought this because of the good reviews but I got a dud.</li>
    <li> I was leaning toward 2 stars, but I figured I would be generous. I&#x27;ll start by saying that this product does a good job at what it says it does. I can get a nice trim out of this. The huge issue is that it takes a long time to charge, a charge will only get you 1 trim at most, and it will not hold a charge while not being used. You really have to plan ahead whenever you need to trim your beard, and that is pretty frustrating. You can&#x27;t just charge it the day before and expect to use it when you need. It has to be charged fully immediately before using, and you have to go fast to finish before it dies. Using it while it&#x27;s plugged in does not seem to make any kind of difference. It has done this since the day I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the battery wasn&#x27;t absolutely horrible, it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband we didn&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a razor but wanted something that would work good, so far this has been a good razor, no pulls and cuts good, if it lasts, it will be a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a couple of months, not my favorite but gets the job done.    I do like that the head is adjustable so I don&#x27;t have to constantly switched heads when trimming my hair.    I mainly use this for my beard, I have used better but for the price I paid I would buy it again.    Other Thoughts: It kind of hurts my face because of he hard plastic on the tips of the razor, this defiantly makes me go slower, I like to shave and get it over with.</li>
    <li> You know the positives already. The charge on this unit sucks.My 7 year old Panasonic  shaver holds charge three times this trimmer. Also I would give it one star as a trimmer. You cannot really trim your goatee or sideburns with this trimmer and like before the T trimmer on my old Panasonic shaver trims and makes lines on sideburns and goatee.</li>
    <li> I had an MB300 for about a year (which is the exact same thing as the MB200 with the addition of a useless mini trimmer) but a piece of a metal spring inside the top of the unit where you open to empty trimmings rusted and broke, rendering it useless and unrepairable.  I guess I managed to get enough water in there while in the bathroom on occasion for it to rust out.  I really wish that spring was made out of stainless steel.    I purchased this MB200 a month ago to replace my broken MB300 after reading several atrocious reviews on competing products, and after having several failures and returns of other models including Norelco.  I have tried many beard trimmers over the years for both trimming stubble on my face and cutting my own hair, and this easily beats them all (I prefer the rechargeable ones with adjustable combs).  Some of the competing products are made out of cheap plastic and the fins on the combs have broken (specifically Norelco), some have too little cutting power, on some the blades on some are not wide enough, and others are just designed by moron engineers.      The MB200 has decent power, the cutting blade is reasonably wide, and the adjustment mechanism for the comb is well designed so you don&#x27;t accidentally choose the wrong length or have it end up moving around on you and ending up with a shaved spot where you didn&#x27;t mean to.  I&#x27;m not unhappy with the choice of Ni-Cd batteries since they last a reasonable amount of time, and I&#x27;m guessing that Lithium-Ion would have put it at a price point that would be non-competitive.   I do wish the batteries weren&#x27;t soldered in so it would be easier to replace them.  Seeing that this is the only decent rechargeable trimmer out there, I am going to purchase a couple more of these - one for my travel bag, and another as a spare.  These days companies seem to revise well designed products, and forget everything they learned that was good about the previous designs.  I hope Remington keeps the person/team around that designed this, keeps this model around for a long time to come,   and hopefully makes it a little mode water resistant and upgrades that spring inside to stainless steel!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. After looking at the reviews written and seeing how others liked it, decided to buy. The price was very good and much cheaper then other trimmers sold in stores. My husband has used it twice so far and is loving it. He stated it does a great job and likes how it has built in adjustable guides.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is horrible....it took me about 45 minutes just to get an even shave.  If you have a really short beard then I suppose it will work fine for you.  But if you have a beard around level 3 or higher, be prepared to stand there for at least half an hour trying to get an even shave.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be good from the past reviews, but it beat expectations.  Does a great job, well-built and no complaints after about 2 months of use.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this trimmer. For just around $15 it&#x27;s ideal. It comes with just one guard that can be height adjusted by a dial on the trimmer. Cleanup is a very easy as you can just remove the guard and fold back the trimming head and clean out all the hairs. It has a nice ergonomic shape that fits your hand comfortably and is light weight. For the money I think it&#x27;d be hard to find a better trimmer in this price range.</li>
    <li> After buying hundreds of products on Amazon, this is my first ever review--I&#x27;ve never been compelled to write anything until this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for years, and tried several corded/cordless options.  Nothing is better than this trimmer.  Pros:  - Easy cleaning.  Pull off the guard, flip open the blade assembly, and brush out any hairs that have accumulated.  Brilliant design by Remington.  - No oiling needed, ever.  I&#x27;ve had these for 1 year and they have never had that tell-tale sound of needing some lube.  - Great for traveling.  I just throw it in a zip lock bag and I&#x27;m set (sometimes I don&#x27;t use the bag out of laze, but since it keeps clean it&#x27;s not a big deal).  Cons:  - Non standard numerical settings.  The numbers on the adjustable guard do not correspond to any industry standard (at least one I know of).  So I just started high and dialed it down after my first attempt.  Not a big deal, really.  Bottom Line:  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  If you are like me and have tried a lot of other trimmers, appreciate thoughtful product design, and like to own the best, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item as a replacement for a 5 year old Remington cordless shaver and I am very happy with how well it works. If I have one complaint, it is that you need to be careful with the double combs in that you don&#x27;t snag your lip when you have settings above 2 or 3.</li>
    <li> It would be nice if this had a better battery life indicator, but for the price you can&#x27;t really beat it.  Just remember to charge it for an hour or so after each use and you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it.  If I recall correctly, the batteries should be discharged every 6 months to ensure longevity.  Overall, great.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my goatee in check and have not had a single problem after about 3 months of use. If you are looking for a cheap razor to get the job done, this is it.</li>
    <li> After about two years, the battery on this thing is completely shot, which makes the whole thing useless. Even when plugged in, I have to turn it off, wait a few minutes, then I get about 20 seconds of trimming before I have to repeat the process. It&#x27;s been getting worse and worse, and today it finally got to the point where it&#x27;s no longer able to do its job and is garbage.  This would be a 4-5 star product if they had decided to use a battery that wouldn&#x27;t make the product worthless after just two years. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of poorly constructed junk. There are 2 very small prongs that hold the blade in place. When you remove the guard and clean the blade of your hair, they break. Thus making the trimmer only useable if you manually hold the blade down, or makes it loose under the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington must have outsourced not only quality control, but engineering to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible. Can not reccommend anyone ever buy this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Second one purchased in many years, Only when I lost the charger did I need to buy another&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and excellent service at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I agree with the positive remarks in other reviews, can&#x27;t find any negatives to report.  Cuts clean, easy to adjust, great performance for the price.  Does a good job on bushy eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> The Good:  + It works well on sideburns  + Zoom wheel feature is great  + Stays charged for a long time  + Decent price  The Bad:  + There is no \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; indicator  I bought this trimmer about one year ago and I lost the recharging cord recently.  I decided to re-buy the MB-200 because I am happy with the product.  I wanted an all-in-one sideburns trimmer that had a extension function built in (aka: zoom wheel).  This trimmer fit the bill &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase(s).</li>
    <li> Bought this after my last, more expensive beard trimmer bit the dust on an overseas trip (I plugged it in and it didn&#x27;t have a switching adapter built-in!).  I have only used this once (today), but I am as pleased as can be.  Works incredibly well and I love the fact that it has a built in battery.  Really a terrific bargain.</li>
    <li> Close stubble shave and battery seems to last a long time between charges. Only complaint might be that I wish the cutting head was wider.</li>
    <li> Great at first, then the battery can only hold a charge for 3 minutes. Not happy about the product, but guess that is what one can expect from Remington. Still looking for a replacement...</li>
    <li> bought this after unsuccessfully searching for a reliable razor in my local stores. this one works really well as my wife likes the two day stuble look on me. Its sleek, well built and cleans fairly easily. All the reviews I read leading up to buying this were right of the money. Ive only had it for two months and shave only once a week so i cant vouch for longevity of it but I predict it will hold up fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer a year ago.  I have used it since and I am very pleased.  It is versatile and the price was right.  I would recommend it to anyone with a beard or moustache (even you ladies...)  Update 5/2015 After a year, could not use because the batteries died. You cannot plug the trimmer into the wall and use it at the same time.  I had to plug it in and wait for 24 hours or plus before it could be used and hope I got the beard trimmed before it died.  Finally died this week.  I used it maybe once a week, or every other week on average.  I really liked the way it worked and it did exactly what I needed.  I guess that 4+ years of use were okay for under $15, but I did not want the hassle and bought a Wahl what is wired  since it is next to the plug by my sink.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing fancy about this trimmer! It has an adjustable guard, an on/off switch, and an LED charging indicator. It does not come with any type of stand but it does come with a small cleaning brush and a beard comb. The guard adjust to cut anything from a medium length beard to a close stubble and the adjustment wheel securely locks into place so there are no worries about the guard retreating while in use. One nice thing about this trimmer is you can keep it plugged in all the time with out worry about overcharging and killing the battery. This trimmer is replacing my 2 year old, $50+, phillips norelco whose battery no longer held a charge longer for 5 seconds, and I can say with out a doubt, this $15 trimmer works 10 times better than my old trimmer, or any other I&#x27;ve owned, for the matter. We are all looking for a trimmer that is reliable and simply works and works well, right? Well, look no farther!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I just started growing a beard and had no idea of what type of trimmer  I should get. I checked online and saw reviews for this trimmer and the $15 price tag and went for the purchase. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision, charged it twice and it gets used every day and has plenty of battery life, owned over two months.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for 35 years. This is the best shaver/trimmer I have had yet. No doubt about it. It feels good in my hand, it trims without pulling and seemingly effortlessly, and it charges quickly. Now, if it would only wash dishes....</li>
    <li> After about 1 year of use the device to set the cut depth broke inside the unit. It still runs fine but it&#x27;s a real pain to use when you can set the depth of the cut. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading some great reviews about this beard trimmer, I decided to purchase it for about $15, back in November. What a great deal! I&#x27;ve used it at least a dozen times and it always has enough juice, cuts close*, and surprisingly, the curved handle works well for me. To be honest, once I opened the package, I figured I&#x27;d be really annoyed by the curved handle. Instead, it forces my hand out of the line of sight when I&#x27;m trying to trim/edge my beard.   Also, if you&#x27;re like me, beard trimmers can get annoying pretty quickly. Just consider all the separate parts that usually come with beard trimmers - my last one had a stand for the 7 different guards, plus the oil and the comb! Alternatively, this trimmer&#x27;s zoom wheel is a great alternative to the usual method of swapping out edge guards. The trimmer comes with no stand, no separate edge guards, nor any oil. Instead, it contains only one detachable guard (works great with the zoom wheel, allowing 9 different lengths), one small comb, and the electric cord. Plus, it never needs to be oiled! (And everything stores away without any hassle!)  Overall this was a great purchase. There are probably other trimmers out there that have even longer battery lives, have even more power, or cut even closer*, but for the money, this was an exceptional purchase. By the way, knowing what I know now, I&#x27;d definitely pay the normal $30 price for this product.  (Note: I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews talk about how this doesn&#x27;t cut very close. That may be the case, when compared to high dollar trimmers, but it cuts close enough, in my opinion.)</li>
    <li> I had an MB-40 for 6 years, finally would not charge. Found the MB200 on Amazon, almost exactly like the MB-40. Great trimmer, feels good in your hands, solid and does a great job. If you want an excellent trimmer, buy this one.</li>
    <li> I do regularly shave, but due to boils in my skin, I am unable to shave and I was growing beard. So decided to trim off extra hair, I searched for a cheaper yet better trimmer and found the reviews about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered and got it in 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for super fast shipping. Got well before...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I didn&#x27;t know how to use it and I was in a feeling that is it really trimming... But after reading the instructions, I figured it out how to use it and trust me it gives a closest shaved look without touching the skin and no plucking sensation and irritation. Its very handy to hold and do under arm trimming too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to maintain trimmed mustache/goatee/french beard</li>
    <li> After my Norelco beard/mustache trimmer recently died on me (after about two years), I of course needed a new one. The dead model wasn&#x27;t fantastic, but it got the job done and it did have the added benefit of teaching me what I do and don&#x27;t want in a trimmer. Browsing through the many brands and models available on Amazon, I was able to settle on this Remington unit. I didn&#x27;t want a combo beard trimmer and nose hair trimmer...this one is a purpose-built beard groomer. I didn&#x27;t want one that had a recharging cradle that gets constantly steamed up in the bathroom when the shower runs (that leads to corrosion on the charging leads)...this one just has a plug in charger. I didn&#x27;t want a trimmer with 10 different detachable guides that you constantly have to change with the type of trimming you&#x27;re doing...this one has one guide with selectable lengths. I DID want a trimmer that has the potential to last a very long time so I won&#x27;t have to go through this whole process again any time soon, and the reviews on this Remington suggest it&#x27;ll do just that. Used it twice so far, and find myself a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Works great, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Built in height setting make it nice not to have to mess with external accessories or snap on height restrictors.  No complaints about this great product.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a while back, but it was short-lived.  After about 2.5 years, the battery was not able to hold a charge for long at all, and I had to charge, then use it.  If I new I was going to use it again, I&#x27;d have to recharge it ahead of time.  But, I did like the available length options, as I set mine to setting &#x27;6&#x27;, which is about 9mm; a little longer than most trimmers can do, but that&#x27;s the way I like it.  So, I was happy enough to order a second one to replace the first.  Fast forward 1.5 years, and the new one has gotten to the point where the battery will not hold a charge at all.  Compounding the issue is that the trimmer cannot be used simply by plugging it in.  Connecting to a power source only allows for charging the battery, but the trimmer runs only off of the stored battery power.  With short-life charge, that is very inconvenient.  By comparison, I have a Norelco razor that is still going strong after about 6 years, with no noticeable degradation in battery life, and if the battery is low, I can just plug it in and shave, without having to first charge the battery.  I&#x27;m switching to a Norelco trimmer.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews unless the product I get is absolutely terrible. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this.  First impression was good. Seemed like it was exactly what i needed. A wireless reliable beard trimmer. I noticed the battery charge didn&#x27;t last too long after the first use. Also i didn&#x27;t like the fact that the teeth without the head attachment were pretty large and not fine like you want out of a trimmer especially when it comes to bare skin trimming. First time i used this trimmer i noticed that immediately so i began to use the cheap Wahl to shape the edges of my beard because it&#x27;s real fine and smooth on the skin. This is certainly NOT like that and honestly I don&#x27;t think too much of the Wahl, which is why i bought this trimmer to begin with. But the trimming head is obviously cheap and will cause irritation on bare skin.  The beard trimmer died after about 5 months. I bought it around July 25th, 2011. By Christmas 2011 it had completely died. It doesn&#x27;t charge any longer - the LED indicator light does not light up even when plugged in. If I leave it \\&quot;charging\\&quot; it will turn on for about 5 seconds before it dies out.   I think the head adjustment piece is fine. I prefer it over the Wahl trimmer heads. Honestly, i wish i just spent the extra money on maybe a 30 dollar trimmer instead. Now i&#x27;ll end up paying more anyway.  ** Also i hate the fact that you can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s plugged in. It doesn&#x27;t charge. My wahl cost me the same $$ but atleast if that battery is dead i can plug it in and use it at full capacity-- not so with this.</li>
    <li> After 6 months the battery only retains a charge sufficient for one one use.  After 12 months it will not even charge sufficiently for one use.  Worse, it will NOT work directly off the cord (i.e., it only works off the battery).</li>
    <li> I have had a goatee for more than 7 years now and in that period I have gone thru many beard trimmers who did an adequate job.  This is the first trimmer which costs less than 20 bucks that solves the basic problems most of the previous ones did not.    1. Trimmer attachment is solid and snaps on easy.  2. Trimmer can be adjusted in height easily.  3. Trimmer attachment can be removed easily.  4. Trimmer is powerful enough to cut through my slightly thicker hair.  5. Trimmer can be used to shape the goatee easily.  6. You can easily remove the trimmer blade and remove hair from inside.  7. You can easily put the trimmer blade back in place for reuse once removed.    #6 and #7 are elusive beasts that no other product has been able to do as well as this product.    5 out of 5 for the features on a sub 20 USD price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for a month now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. I&#x27;ve charged it only once and it&#x27;s still going strong. Depth adjustment is easy to make. I particularly like the permanently lubricated blades. The trimmer also feels very comfortable and well balanced in my hand.</li>
    <li> had awesome reviews, i actually got it when it was 17 bucks, works alright, not very even, but then it stopped charging like all the low reviews say so now its worthless.. theres a 2 year warrenty but its honestly not that great, doesnt get short enough for me, i just got the istubble and from my limited use i love it</li>
    <li> I would have to say that the Remington mb-200 does what its supposed to. You have 8 various settings which is more than enough to choose from. Didnt like the cheap plastic of which its made from, but that doesnt bother me as much as long as it serves its purposes, which it has been doing (so I&#x27;m very satisfied). Didnt have any problems charging/cleaning the trimmer, thus far.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly in perfect condition.  It works well.  I used it several weeks before it needed charging.</li>
    <li> This is a very great Quality product. I have used Remington brand for past 10 years and never had problems with this  Brand of Shaver/Trimmer. Only the newer model is better and keeps getting better each time I try to buy a new one. But--Remington brands are good and can be used for several years and don&#x27;t burn out even after using them regularly for several years.&lt;br /&gt;  In all it is a great Product --no complains at all !!!</li>
    <li> The guard is easily removable so this a good choice for getting a close shave.  Granted it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near straight razor clean, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m going for.  The razor is sturdy and the internal battery&#x27;s charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Battery has never held a charge more than a day or two.  I have had it for about two months.  Last week it would not hold a charge for more than a couple hours.  Went to trim my beard today, after having trimmer plugged in overnight, and the trimmer died within a minute.  Big PITA to have a section of beard shorter than the rest. I should have returned this to amazon within the 30 days, my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/3/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Remington after 30 days was up. They acknowledged battery issues with this item. Offered to replace it with no hassles. Sent me a new one and a prepaid label to return the defective trimmer. The replacement has been great. Upgrading to 4 stars from 1 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for 2 months now and I have to say, I&#x27;m really impressed. Once fully charged the battery lasts for about 10 trims. For a full charge, it takes about 2-3 hours. And it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It helps me sculpt and maintain my beard and mustache. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, no razor burns, etc. I would easily buy another. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for; an adjustable removable comb.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any drug store or Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Great design - 9 selectable length settings without changing parts, wireless convenience, and does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect for all areas of hair. Easy to use and works better than a professional trimmer. Its smaller so it works great on the hard to trim areas(if you know what I mean). Received item 3 days before they said I would. Great company easy transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++ Seller</li>
    <li> Works well on a heavy beard and keeps it nice and trim.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this trimmed to just about anyone who&#x27;s looking for a hair trimmer. It has built in lengths and can even go down to a clean cut, it works on all hair and the battery life is great, I am just highly satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.  I honestly don&#x27;t have a single complaint and could not think of a single thing i would change on this razor.  I use it to trim my goatee and it&#x27;s perfect.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s got different settings for length.  Simple, basic, gets the job done.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.  It&#x27;s just a trimmer, but it works.  I recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised but I wish there was a smaller end to it for trimmer my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product that holds it&#x27;s charge very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fairly good trimmer but the batteries do not last very long. If I charge it and use it a few weeks later, it will not last as long as I need to trim my beard. You have to leave it plugged in charging all the time in order for it to be ready when you need it. I have had several Norelco shavers and none had this problem. In the future, I will probably look for the Norelco name. I thought Remington was probably a good name brand but now I am not so sure.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Titanium?\\&quot;  This thing fell apart, literally, a few months after I bought it, and is impossible to put back together.  Of course by then I had thrown out the warranty papers.  The old cheap plastic one lasted me for years, and unfortunately no one makes a better beard trimming product (ease of use etc.)than Remington.....Norelco is worse.</li>
    <li> Cheezy junk. Won&#x27;t last close to as long as my 10yr old different brand razor that cost half the price and came with more heads</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. I use it 2-3 times a week for my beard, and once a month for my chest/back.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that the battery tends to drain and die so I have to work quick and efficient while doing my chest/back.&lt;br /&gt;This could just be because I am a fairly hairy person.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something good, unexpensive and that works great.&lt;br /&gt;This is the thing! Great design, good quality, very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret if you buy this. I am demanding!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Remington bread trimmers and this one matches all my expectations. Easy to use and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fuss device...highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco for the past 8 years.  The battery died and forced me to move on.  Quickly, the Remington is better when it comes to grip, height adjustment and balance in the hand.  It is the same for cutting and trimming.  The grudge I have is the sharpness of the cutting edge leads.  When you move it across your face they are sharp and irritating.  No doubt in time, my skin will acclamate.  But it is noticable.  If the battery lasts, it will have been a solid replacement.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked perfectly for my beard, except after six weeks it stopped charging. I even tried a different charger, the charge light doesn&#x27;t light up and it doesn&#x27;t charge at all.    Since it broke down past the 30 day return policy, there&#x27;s no recourse with their customer service either.  No matter how good it is when charged it&#x27;s just a paperweight now since I can&#x27;t charge it.</li>
    <li> Had an earlier model of this.  The battery in the old one finally gave up the ghost, so bought this one.  Easy to use.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is easy to adjust.  Hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled or left uncut.  I&#x27;ve used it a dozen times or more and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Peanut trimmer for years but dropped it so I was forced to buy a new one.  The MB-200 is a clearly superiour trimmer.  What makes it so nice is that I can set it to go as close as I want (\\&quot;stubble\\&quot;), it cuts evenly, and the battery hold a charge for a long time.  I also like that I don&#x27;t have to oil the blades.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This thing was terrible. If you want to groom yourself, find something else. This thing gave me uneven shaves on the lowest setting. It hardly worked for trimming. Finally broke after about a year. Poorly made, cheap product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer less than a year ago, and have to say it&#x27;s the first Remington product I&#x27;ve been disappointed with (having owned several).  I purchased it hoping that I may be one of the fortunate ones to get a trimmer that actually worked for the long run, yet as many reviewers have posted, the trimmer fails to consistently hold a charge.  I did like the &#x27;cut&#x27; the trimmer provided initially, but now I can barely use it.  Expected more from a Remington, and will search for something else that hopefully will be worth buying.</li>
    <li> Good price. A bit loud</li>
    <li> This trimmer is #4. The only drawback is, that numbers on adjustment part are hard to read. Also the voltage of 220V would be nice! Otherwise, lt is very good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver one year ago and it has worked perfectly until the plastic comb broke that guides the razor.  Now it cuts rows in my beard!  I have checked with Remington and other outlets and no one carries the part.  Old story....product works and plastic breaks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my MB-10 which I had for 6 years.  The first cut proved that I made the correct choice.  Hope it lasts as long as my last Remington!!!!!</li>
    <li> If it had a battery that lasted more than an hour I would love it, but that is just awful. I have to charge the thing for 8 hours every time I need to use it. Basically, I have to leave it plugged in 24/7.  Update: My razor now only lasts 30 seconds on a full charge after two years of use.</li>
    <li> This is a trimmer I have used for a few years now and I love it. As long as they keep making it I&#x27;ll keep buying them.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome.  Rechargeable (nicad), 9 length settings, and it only cuts the hairs you want due to the full enclosure over the blades.  You could buy one of the more expensive ones with a lithium battery, lcd display, and vacuum, but do you really NEED all that out of a trimmer?  Pick this bad boy up, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> raminton MB-200 ,,, Good. with titanium blades. and inbuit rechargeable battery.. good built... handy and useful.. timely delivery... good price.. light weight..</li>
    <li> I was happy with this trimmer until it dropped from my sink and landed on the trimmer nose. The adjustable click-wheel broke so now it has only two effective settings 0 and 1 (i.e. remove the guard or put the guard on in its lowest position). With the click-wheel broken the guard cannot be locked at a higher/longer setting. I am very disappoint​ed as I only had the trimmer about a month before it broke.</li>
    <li> A great product, I have nothing more then great words to say about this product.</li>
    <li> works well. adjustment numbers are extremely small to see when adjusting depth.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after growing a beard and needed to keep it groomed.  I am very happy with it, it charges quickly and cuts very well.  The amazon price was well below what I found locally and as usual am very happy with my purchase here.</li>
    <li> Great beard and mustache trimmer! I had my old one for almost 10 years and just bought the same one as a replacement. Best trimmer out there and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a great trimmer, but after several months the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. Now, a year later, I have to keep it plugged in for at least an entire day, and that barely gives it enough battery power for one trim (sometimes it dies before I finish). Unfortunately, using it while it&#x27;s plugged in isn&#x27;t a fix. Power is drained faster than the charger can restore it, so you definitely have to charge it before using it.</li>
    <li> The price, quality of product, the look, and performance are all excellent. Way better than those multiple beard trimmer guides and the price is excellent.  Right out the box, it cut perfectly. I will purchase another one hopefully in 5 more yrs or so.  The length of time I&#x27;m expecting this trimmer to last.</li>
    <li> I bought this in september, maybe used twice a week since.Now recently even after a full charge i&#x27;m lucky to barely get 5 minutes of use out of it before it dies.  I&#x27;m done using remington products have had maybe 3 or 4 shavers die on me, now this. Seems like a quality trimmer, but if it cant keep a full charge its useless to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two months ago and havent had a single problem with it whatsoever. It has great functions. The different settings for beard length works beautifully. It is also very easy to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that it cannot operate while charging. One has to charge the battery beforehand to use it.</li>
    <li> Really great product for the price and arrived fast</li>
    <li> The battery life on this thing is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It replaced a previous model that was well used.&lt;br /&gt;That battery last at 5-6 uses per charge.&lt;br /&gt;This one last one use then I have to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy something different next time.</li>
    <li> First beard, first trimmer (though I have had a moustache for 30+ years). I have been very pleased with the ease of use designed into this trimmer, the battery life, the ease with which it can be cleaned, and the freedom from needed lubrication. Also, the price. Thanks to all who wrote the ratings that helped me decide on this one! I add my enthusiastic endorsement to yours.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. Didn&#x27;t know what to get so I read some of the reviews for the different trimmers on Amazon. Was looking for something to replace an old, cheap trimmer I had that had broken. This one is not cheap at all. Seems very sturdy and nice in the hand. Looks and feels like it will last longer that the previous one I had. I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and have had no problems. It gets the job done. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My first trimmer was the Remington MB-250; bought one for myself and my son. These were terrible - Mine would give one trimming per charge. The one I got my son also gave one trimming per charge --- and ran at half speed! Clearly a poorly designed product. The MB-200 however is a different story. Both of the units I bought have performed flawlessly. I get about eight or nine trimmings per charge! Compared to the lousy MB-250, you wouldn&#x27;t think the MB-200 was made by the same company. Or, maybe the guy who designed the MB-250 was fired.</li>
    <li> I was about to shave my beard off about two months ago having been feed up with keeping it trim.  I used a trimmer intended for hair cutting and it did not work well at all, especially the incessant hair pulls.  I noticed this trimmer on Amazon and its good reviews, so I ordered one.  I&#x27;ve used it now for the last two months and very pleasantly surprised by the results and ease of use.  No more hair pulls and the trimming head never needs lubrication.  I especially like the height adjustment mechanism.  I&#x27;ve yet needed to recharge it over those two months.  I wish it had a charge indicator but nevertheless, given the results, I highly recommend it and have to rate it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update#1: as of today 11/14/2011 the Remington trimmer is still going strong with performance as good as on day one.  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing in my review of this trimmer except to add longevity to its attributes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update#2: as of today 11/01/2013 the Remington Trimmer is still working fine after all these years of use, albeit, I get fewer \\&quot;trims\\&quot; per charge and needs to be charged more frequently. I believe the secret for the batteries longevity is to resist charging it after every use and charge it only when it is completely discharged (almost fully depleted).  These NiCad batteries have what is known as a \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; and if you continually charge it before it is completely discharged, this will effectively lower the amount of charge it can hold (short answer to long explanation of this effect).  Also, overcharging by leaving it on the charger too long,  will also cause it to discharge quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update#3: as of today 06/01/2014 as expected, my trimmer is slowly going south. I now can only get two full trims per charge.  I fully expect it to get worse quickly now. When I&#x27;m down to one trim per charge, I may take it apart and try to solder in new NiCad&#x27;s if the ones in the trimmer are the standard AA size.  If that proves too complicated or time consuming, I&#x27;ll spring for a new one.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to post the results here in another update.  I know it&#x27;s not cost effective to try to repair it, but my curiosity will get the best of me and the trimmer itself, still does a good job on my beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> My MB-200 worked well for a few years, but then the rubberized grips on the sides deteriorated into a sticky mess for no apparent reason.  On top of this, the battery is NiCad, and is now failing - it only holds its charge for about a day.  To make things worse, you *have* to charge the battery to use it; even if your battery is weak and you plug it into the wall, it will still only run off of battery power.  Other reviewers have already pointed out that the battery is non-replaceable; yet another reason why I will likely choose a different model to replace my failing MB-200.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product for a new beard person, light weight and easy to use.  It is also a lot of fun getting use to the settings.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer.. The design is cool - you can set it to trim at different lengths without having to change any clips... So convenient! I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but I think if I take good care of it it should last me a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use my beard rather short, and for that this trimmer does a superb job. I charged it the first time, have used it every other day since then, it&#x27;s been two weeks and there is no sign I need to recharge it again yet. Trims smoothly and cleaning it is as easy as brushing it lighly. I&#x27;m delighted that I don&#x27;t have to use any oil to clean it. Great choice.</li>
    <li> When my old trimmer broke I looked through the Amazon reviews and decided on this trimmer.  I want to thank all those who had previously reviewed this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and it has performed flawlessly.  I don&#x27;t think the guard is flimsy.  I don&#x27;t think the controls are confusing.  I do think it holds a charge, has good settings for length, has a great pop-up mustache trimmer.  In fact, my only problem with this device is that you have to pull off the guard before you can use the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. It works great and the price is great. The only problem I have with it (and it still did not stop me from ordering a second one)is the shaver head when dropped from about six inches into the sink came off breaking one of the 2 \\&quot;plastic holder pieces\\&quot;.  They are very small and apparently easy to break thereby making the head useless. Also, they do not have a replacement for the head, you have to buy a whole new shaver.  But, it&#x27;s still worth buying another. I will just be much more carefull with this one.</li>
    <li> I have owned several different beard trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best. It is well built, works great, and is just a fantastic trimmer all around. I own 2 of these. Great job, Remington !!</li>
    <li> Just used this razor for the first time and it worked great! Fast charge, smooth shave. Being someone that shaves different lengths almost every time, the adjustable wheel is definitely handy. I would buy again in an instant.</li>
    <li> This is a great beard trimmer.  I had a Panasonic before but the Remington is superior by far.  It gives a better cut and is precise - im probably going to buy a second one since it does such a great job   I wear a short beard and it keeps it looking really great and well groomed</li>
    <li> Got it for about $15 and have been pleased after using for 2+ months.  Gives a fairly consistent cut for a hairy chap like me.  Able to keep my goatee and sideburns in check. Only takes a couple of minutes to get the job done.  Has a solid feel to it and the charge lasts for a while.  Only downside is that the rubbery length selector is very hard to turn with wet hands.  I always have to dry my hands and the trimmer when turning the selector wheel.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The battery life really sucks on this. It worked well for a little while, but now I have to charge it for hours before using. Doesn&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2 years now.  At first I loved it&#x27;s simplicity and not having to interchange a bunch of guards to fade my beard up to my sideburns but now it&#x27;s time for a new one.  It just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  Even on full charge I can only get through half my beard before it dies.  Maybe 10 seconds of run time.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  Maybe the battery suffers from memory issues but I thought it was a Lithium Ion battery which shouldn&#x27;t have that problem.  Now looking for a new trimmer but may purchase this one again.  I have a Norelco, for nose trimming and edging, and it&#x27;s battery has lasted for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> Very compact and easy to use. No extra parts to get lost for desired trim length, just dial it up. I&#x27;ve used it a half a dozen times and haven&#x27;t re-charged it yet! I&#x27;m pleased to reccommend this trimmer, so have at it!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that it had a flip out trimmer like my last one. plus,i don&#x27;t think it cuts as good as the old one.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my bf.  Hard to find a device that&#x27;s specifically for trimming your beard/mustache.  He hasn&#x27;t tried it yet so I can&#x27;t say for sure how well it works.  I&#x27;m only going by the reviews.</li>
    <li> I grew a beard and moustache last November and quickly realized I needed a trimmer to avoid descending into woolly Neanderthaldom. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far have no complaints.  The trimmer has a guard that can be quickly adjusted to several lengths, allowing even a novice beard-grower like me to achieve a sophisticated, clean-shaven look.  I can then easily remove the guard to shorten my sideburns or clean up the edges of my facial hair.  I still need a conventional razor or electric shaver to achieve a really close shave, but for the longer hair this item is just the ticket.  The trimmer is also cordless, rechargeable, and comfortable to hold.  Great value, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for about 8 months now.  It works perfectly every time, travels well, and holds a good charge.  My one complaint would be that it has a tendancy to let little trimmings get inside the height display, which can make it annoying.  Very happy with the product though, simple and reliable.</li>
    <li> Horrible Product, spend the extra money and get a product that will last. This product has numerous flaws that affect both the usability and the longevity of its use:  1. You CANNOT use the trimmer unless the battery is charged. I was half an hour late for work today because the battery died mid-trim. I had to wait half an hour before the battery was charged enough to finish the job. There is no battery meter on the product, so the only way to use reliably is too leave it charging 24/7 so that you know it is fully charged when you need it. As you probably know already, leaving it charging all the time is horrible for the battery, meaning that you will probably only get a year or two out of the product before it can&#x27;t hold enough charge to finish a single trim.  2. The adjustable guard is extremely flimsy. If you put even a slight amount of pressure on it, you will end up with an uneven trim  3. The part that connects the cutting blades to the base is extremely fragile. After dropping it one time, it broke off, so now I have hold down the top part anytime I want to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Remington Titanium because its batteries would no longer take a charge. Its ashame you can&#x27;t swap out the re-chargeable battery. But then again I would not have bought a new one if I could have replaced the battery.  This new one works just as well as the old one, no better really. But one advantage the old one had was that it vacuumed the cut hair and collected it in a drawer-like container at the bottom of the handle. Very little mess or hair on the area where you are using it. This new one just drops the hair in the sink for post cut clean up.  But I am very happy with how it trims my beard and how it feels comfortable in my hand. Seems pretty sturdy like it will hold up for a while.... until the rechargeable battery will no longer take a charge. Then time again for a new one that will hopefully devolve into having a hair catcher again!</li>
    <li> There are plenty of reviews of this product so I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet. This trimmer works well in all areas of the body. We, my wife and I, have used it for everything from cleaning up the back of my neck/hairline to trimming my bushy eyebrows. I&#x27;d imagine you could easily use it to keep many other areas of your body trimmed as well. It has 9 adjustable settings on the length that could certainly be long or short enough for anyone. We use 4 out of 9 on my eyebrows. It seems to hold it&#x27;s charge for a quite a while and cleans up quite easily. The only potential downfall to the product is that it is dry only so you can&#x27;t use it in the shower. Overall, it is a very versatile trimmer that offers an even trim at whatever length you desire. I would certainly recommend this to anyone, especially considering how cheap it is!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awsome before this one i had a accu vac which was ok but the battery was shot and the length adjuster broke..this one seems to be far better in quality and has a great feel.</li>
    <li> AC adapter is not powerful enough to run the charger. I cannot plug it in and use the trimmer if it is not already charged.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm; just wish I had thought to get one with a nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> After about 10 uses, it stopped recharging, then started again a few months later (I left it plugged in). It worked two or three times and stopped again.  Goodbye, Remington.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and many settings to accomplish any job. Holds a charge a long time and it is powerful.</li>
    <li> I just threw mine out as the blade broke off but it lasted me a few years. It worked well during its lifespan though.</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer, however, the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long, and since it&#x27;s not replaceable, you have to buy a whole new unit. I&#x27;ve had two, and they both lasted about a year before the battery died. I&#x27;ve since moved on to another trimmer in the hopes that it will last much longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Beyond worthless.  I owned a Remington MB200 for many years and was happy with it.  It came time to buy a new one, what a joke, the new one&#x27;s battery will not hold a charge.  The old unit works much better than the brand new one.  Remington should get their act together and include a battery that works.  This new unit is unusable because of it&#x27;s battery.</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty well, but now that ive owned this for over a year and half or so its battery life is gone to shit. kinda need to recharge battery after every long use.</li>
    <li> As a trimmer this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, easy to use, solid construction and trims very nicely.  As many other reviewers have noted it has a very brief life expectancy because the batteries are totally useless.  Imagine putting your trimmer on the charger, getting up in the morning and trimming a little less than half your beard and then silence.  This is what happened to me and without another trimmer available I was in a real pickle.  Finally after about 20 minutes of charging for 5 min, trimming for 20 seconds (repeat 4 times) I was ready to go out in public.  This happened out of the clear blue, without warning.  Too bad, until then I would have given it an enthusiastic 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer... I mostly use it for trimming my french beard.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is very good if you have the right expectations.... its a trimmer, not a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Plus not great at shaping/carving, but overall, a pretty decent trimmer... easy to clean and operate. It could have been a 4.5</li>
    <li> These are my husband&#x27;s words:  It is by far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 40 years and this one keeps it trimmed beautifully.  I&#x27;m glad that I found it.</li>
    <li> I have used many different beard-trimmers and hair-clippers before and this one beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to shave my beard AND my head.  Works better for both tasks than any beard-trimmer or hair-clippers I have ever owned!  It is SO much easier to shave if you run this trimmer over your face first!  Most times, I don&#x27;t even bother.  I just use the trimmer.  If you remove the adjustable length guard altogether, it will give you a VERY CLOSE trim, and will not cut you.  The blades never need to be cleaned or oiled!  How did they do it?  This device has profoundly simplified my life!  Thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> Do not buy.  Product failed to hold charge after only 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used once per week to trim moustache and side burns.  After less than 2 months, it no longer holds a charge.  It&#x27;s been charged no more than 3 or 4 times since purchased.  Garbage!</li>
    <li> I keep a very short beard that I trim weekly. I purchased this trimmer to replace a Panasonic (ER224S) trimmer that I had been using for the last two years. The Panasonic was a great trimmer but was poorly manufactured with a major stress point being made out of very bad plastic. After having to glue the part together several times, it finally broke on both sides which no longer allowed the trim height to be adjusted. I have used this Remington trimmer several times now with excellent results. The trimmer is well designed, easy on the hand, holds a charge very well, and is easy to clean. The tines on the trimmer (the most fragile part on all these adjustable trimmers) are thin, but the part that allows height adjustment seems well made and I feel comfortable removing it to clean the unit. The blades are very sharp and have not pulled or tugged my beard at all. I feel that with normal care I will get more than my moneys worth out of this trimmer and will look at Remington products again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2006.  Before I got this, I have used different trimmers available in the market, but they were not even close to this.  This trimmer trims the beard as close as possible to the skin.  and the self sharpening blades keep the blades sharp forever. Once the built-in battery is fully charged, this device can be used for at least 6 beard trims.    I have used my first MB-200 trimmer for 3 years and got another one and been using since 2009, I have recently purchased another one.  I dont want shift to any other product as I am extremely satisfied with this.  you get the best trimmer for the amount you spend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for about 2 months now &amp; I&#x27;m satisfied with its performance. I use it once or twice a week to trim my beard &amp; it&#x27;s still running on the 1st day&#x27;s charge. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of owning. I am bald by nature :), but have that moon halo around the back of my head that I have to shave off ever-so-often. I also sport a go-tee that I like to keep trimmed to the minimal level. This thing zips through both like a hot knife through butter! No pulling or burn afterwards. It&#x27;s Very sharp and cuts evenly. I use setting 1 to keep my mustache nearly shaved and setting 2 for the rest of my beard. I charged it for a few days after initially getting it, because I was working so much, and it&#x27;s nearly 4 weeks later and it&#x27;s still going strong with regular use and haven&#x27;t recharged it since the first time! The guard pulls right off with minimal effort but is solid when it&#x27;s attached and moves between the cut depth settings very well. It fits comfortably in either hand and is surprisingly easy to clean up after use. Bottom line, all the stuff about no charging stand, battery types and all that, the business end is the cutters, they are sharp, cut clean, quick and even and if it does die in two years...money extremely well spent. If you are that picky on this stuff, go to a professional, otherwise, become one with this trimmer!</li>
    <li> I used the same Norelco trimmer for many years and loved it. When it finally gave out on me I reluctantly bought the Remington and I absolutely love it. The battery is great, it has a great fit in my hand and it trims well. I look forward to using it every time I trim my mustache and goat.</li>
    <li> I like the easy length adjustment, light weight and apparent long battery life. 4 uses so far and still going strong without recharging. My 2 previous trimmers cost 2x+ as much and didn&#x27;t compare favorably. It does take a number of passes to get the job done but the end results are good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Philips Norelco Vacuum trimmer and boy was that a mistake. I was dazzled by the titanium blades and never needing oil but Im over it now. I like to trim on the lowest setting without the guard and the blades on this trimmer are so sharp that I usually end up with a few knicks. Bottom line, I went back to my 5 year old Philips Norelco Vacuum trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I started with a 2 star review but gave it 3 for the quality.</li>
    <li> Glad I read the other reviews about how well the Remington MB-200 works. &lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. Although It doesn&#x27;t shave really close as I was expecting. So, if want to shave, like those hairs in the neck you&#x27;ll need a real shaver or razor. If it had it would be the fitfth star.</li>
    <li> This mustache and beard trimmer is not bad.  For those close shaves, it gives a pretty neat and clean cut.  But those beards that you want to be a little more longer and fuller, the trim is not as even as I would like.    But overall, not a bad trimmer!</li>
    <li> Hi,  I bought this 3 months before very gud one working well.    battery charge is very gud</li>
    <li> It is a good product but I give it a 3 stars because its power adapter is 110V only so if you travel to a 220V country you can&#x27;t use it..&lt;br /&gt;Almost all electronic devices come these days with a 110V-240V power adapters so I don&#x27;t understand why Remington decided to cut this option...</li>
    <li> This thing has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;No more buying expensive razor blades. this thing is cheap price and high quality. had it for 2 years and then came back to get another one.</li>
    <li> For &lt;$20 it&#x27;s hard to beat.    cons:  -lacks power  -wall wart charger  -not expected to last  -comb is a bit pointy</li>
    <li> Like the trimmer a lot - the charger stopped working after one week of use and I had to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my thick coarse beard hairs. I recommend starting on the highest setting and working down based on how long you are looking for. There is a big difference between 8 and 7. 7 is much shorter than I wanted but 8 is just right.</li>
    <li> After my Braun shaver&#x27;s beard trimmer function puked, I started looking for a replacement. Reading various reviews, it became apparent that a beard trimmer by itself was what I really needed. Based on other reviews here I purchased the Remington trimmer and have used it for several months. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. This thing is super light weight, very easy to hold and just a delight after struggling with my shaver&#x27;s mediocre trimming attachment. Wish I had known about this thing years ago. It actually came out of the box with a mostly charged battery and was ready to use, something I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered. The multiple settings make getting the right length easy and it seems to hold a charge for a really long time. I&#x27;m quite pleased, and think it is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this beard trimmer. I was so skeptical about it being so cheap but after using it I am very very pleased. The shape of it and the shape of the attachment make for a really easy clean shave. Something about it&#x27;s curve and large space of flat comb on the attachment it makes it very easy to use and maneuver. By far the easiest beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The click wheel for adjusting the length of trim is just brilliant! No more switching attachments! Yes, the combs of the attachment are a little cheaply made and flimsy but they get the job done well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this beard trimmer! A+</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer, exactly what I needed. The battery lasts an extremely long time, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to get dull.</li>
    <li> Plenty powerful and great for the price.     Not good at all for stubble beards. Using it without a guard will result in you bleeding for sure. You&#x27;ve been warned. NOT GOOD FOR STUBBLE.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too wide to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can&#x27;t comfortably trim with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It&#x27;s just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome! That&#x27;s all that really needs to be said. The battery lasts an extremely long time and there are a ton of length selections to choose from. Settings are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1&#x3D;1.5mm&lt;br /&gt;2&#x3D;2.5mm&lt;br /&gt;3&#x3D;4mm&lt;br /&gt;4&#x3D;5.5mm&lt;br /&gt;5&#x3D;7mm&lt;br /&gt;6&#x3D;9mm&lt;br /&gt;7&#x3D;11mm&lt;br /&gt;8&#x3D;14mm&lt;br /&gt;9&#x3D;18mm&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing trimmer and I would recommend it to any man who needs a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed this trimmer shaves accurately at it&#x27;s corners (when the guard is off, of course), which means far less trimming with scissors afterwards.  It&#x27;s simple.  The previous model had a flip-out mini-trimmer which really wasn&#x27;t necessary.  I&#x27;m glad this one doesn&#x27;t have that.  My wife likes it.  It seems to keep a good charge.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to shampoo before and I wish it would clean itself out after I&#x27;m done, but that&#x27;s just silly talk.</li>
    <li> Just like others bad review, it is because of the battery. I hardly used it and when I tried charging it after a few month of being left there, the battery did not charge. Do not buy this product even if it is a portion of the price. That&#x27;s what I did and got con.</li>
    <li> Its a decent trimmer but NOT very high quality - Used it maybe 7 times in two years, treated it w kid gloves but the battery one day refused to recharge. I&#x27;m going back to Braun or Philips - Its not my first bad experience w Remington....but its my last.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington trimmer and should the time come, I&#x27;ll buy a third. I purchased this in January of 2010 and after over two years of weekly use, it&#x27;s just as good as it was the day it came out of the box.  It has more length settings than I honestly use, but enough to cover what I need. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to keep clean and the battery life is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I feel is probably the best feature though, is the charging cord.  My previous trimmer needed to be placed in a cradle to recharge and if the battery died while I was using it...well I either had to leave the house looking funny or wait 30 minutes until it had enough juice to finish. This model plugs in to charge just like a cell phone...so in a pinch, I can plug it in and finish up with no problem!</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer does a great job, but all of that is overshadowed by a dud battery.  I have to plug this in the night before I plan to use it EVERY time (even if I want to use it the following day).  The battery that came with mine never lasted more than about 15 minutes, which was really disappointing.  Maybe I got a dud, but I wish I had returned for a refund right away instead of hoping it&#x27;d work better</li>
    <li> I had been using a Schick Quatro razor with a trimmer on the back, and it had many disadvantages, including a poor battery life, the hair getting caught, and not a good cutter in general. Plus it took a long time to trim. So I was looking around for a beard trimmer, and I saw this one. I read the reviews of others, and it was a good price, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The first time I used it, I was truly amazed. The trimmer is nice and quick. The blades don&#x27;t need to be oiled which is really cool. I liked how the trimmer has nine adjustable settings, and the #1 setting cuts the hair really short. I&#x27;d recommend using the #3 or #4 for a nice short cut. And at $30 (this was the price at the time I purchased it), it was a great deal. If you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t need to be oiled and is a quick and easy and clean way to trim a beard, this is the trimmer for you.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, but the battery eventually loses the ability to hold a charge. You can keep it plugged ALWAYS to have it ready to go, but if you don&#x27;t, plugging it in does not give it power. You have to wait for it to charge for a while before it works. I wish the power cord gave it power instead of only charging the battery. Overall I&#x27;m still satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Love that it is cordless.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over two years ago the first time. My guy has used it with no problems. It was not until recently that he dropped it on hard stone tile that the adjuster broke. So we have bought another one. This has been the best beard trimmer he has used. He also said that it seem to stay very sharp and in working order.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that the product worked fine the first couple of days. I was very pleased with it. However, after 2 weeks it started having some problems with the battery. Somehow the trimmer kept turning off whenever I put it at a specific angle against my face. I recharged the battery many times but nothing fixed it. The machine turned off at some positions and at others it worked fine. I tried to take it apart to see if it was a problem with the battery but the screws were of the worst quality. They immediately lost all grip and I found myself with no other choice but to buy another trimmer. I have read many good reviews about this product but in my particular opinion I had very bad experience with it. Hope it helps any of you who are about to buy this product.</li>
    <li> The titanium mustache and beard trimmer is amazing and worth every penny. It comes with a comb and brush to clean the blades as well.    Highly reccommended</li>
    <li> This trimmer works very well on my boyfriend thick beard, however he wishes that the lowest comb would make the stubble shorter. But overall very good trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver. Does a nice job at trimming my beard. Very easy to use and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use, cleans up nice and is priced very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for one of my uncles who had heavy hair growth on his face. Due to the thickness of his facial hair other trimmers didn&#x27;t work effectively. This one however was very effective and seems to be working well so far.</li>
    <li> Works well, very short battery life.  It was dead within months of its purchase with regular use.</li>
    <li> The razor cuts, and I appreciate that the guides are built in (and therefore, not lost), but the battery trumps all. I use it only once or twice each week and it cannot hold a charge between shavings. Since you can only use it from battery, you have to plan ahead and start charging it several hours before you plan to use it. Probably fine if you shave daily, or if you don&#x27;t mind leaving it plugged in all the time, but nearly useless for my less frequent uses.</li>
    <li> If this Remington Mustache and Beard trimmer lasts as long as his last one, he is in very good shape.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington Beard Trimmer Model MB200 two weeks ago. It appeared to be a good product and worked fine during the first couple of times I used it. One of the reasons that i selected this product was the ability to wash the heads with water after use as indicted in Amazons advertising materials which state: \\&quot;The trimmer&#x27;s head is washable--a quick rinse removes loose hair. The MB200 features a rechargeable battery for handy, cord-free use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I reviewed the instructions on cleaning and maintenance, however, it became clear that Amazon&#x27;s descriptions were false and misleading. The documentation that was included with the razor is quite clear. The first page of the instructions state: \\&quot;KEEP AWAY FROM WATER.\\&quot; The section on cleaning and maintenance states: \\&quot;Blow out any loose hair that has accumulated. Brush out any remaining hair from the cutter teeth and hair pocket with the brush provided. Do not rinse the cutter assembly under water or use cleaning fluids with could remove the lubrication.\\&quot; the product materials are quite clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The descriptions, charts and materials on Amazon&#x27;s website, however,are inaccurate and misleading. This shaver should never be cleaned with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the shaver appears to work fine (my single star is a rating of Amazon), as long as you are not interested in cleaning it with water. The experience forces me to reconsider Amazon as a reputable merchant. Fortunately, there are several others to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up note: When I complained to Amazon, they apologized for the inaccuracies and promptly refunded my money. Nice job.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this trimmer after reading some of the reviews. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It has worked well for me. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars simply because I had nothing to compare it with. This was the first time ever I grew a beard. I found the settings worked very well and was able to get a nice even trim and lots of complements.&lt;br /&gt;**Update: I reduced this form 4 stars to 2 stars simply because the battery does not hold a charge, and you can&#x27;t use it while plugged in to recharge. I have some time ago shaved off my beard.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer. Wish it had more attachments.</li>
    <li> Just like my last one. Perfect! :)</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the performance of this razor and would buy it again.  However, it is not perfect.  The blades could be sharper and the on/off switch seems to be designed for a southpaw.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews of products unless they are somehow exceptional. This is the worst trimmer I have ever used. The teeth are spaced so far apart don&#x27;t even think about using it for edging on bare skin because it cuts you instantly. Spend the extra money and get something that won&#x27;t filet your face!</li>
    <li> I have had the trimmer for about a month now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance and battery life. The construction feels solid, adjusting knob works great. It cuts very well, head opens easily for cleaning. Charged it initially and haven&#x27;t yet had to charge it again after using it approx 3-4 times a week x 4 weeks. It&#x27;s a great trimmer, so much better than the Norelco it replaced and for the money it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> No problems yet. Have used it only once. Works well. For the price. I am giving the trimmer a 4 star approval. All was as advertized. Will make another review. After a couple of months.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great so far. I bought this after my old trimmer just stopped charging and I&#x27;m glad it did because this trimmer is a much higher quality for about half the price of what I paid for my old one. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the head slipping from pushing too hard on your face. The only con would be that it doesn&#x27;t come with different types of trimmer heads, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat the quality of this beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times to trim my beard and have been quite pleased with it. It cleans up much nicer than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used too.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the price. easy to use, easy to clean, works great. No stupid attatchments or anything, just turn the wheel to adjust the length of cut. Wish it would work while charging. Thats my only complaint.</li>
    <li> It is very powerful and the battery lasts a long time. Only downsides are 1) The plastic adjustment comb is hard to remove and put back which makes me think it will break sooner than later. 2) When you use the blade w/o the comb, it is very sharp and irritates the skin. The Norelco G370 is a much better product. It has more attachments, the blade is smoother and doesn&#x27;t irritate, and the comb is easier to remove. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge as well as this does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this trimmer. Works great for both my beard and moustache, especially for the price. A single charge lasts for months of weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap&lt;br /&gt;- easy to dial the length for your beard / moustache&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- charge works great&lt;br /&gt;- no huge pile of accessories / heads to keep track of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Proprietary charging socket. When I lost my charger for my previous copy, I had to buy a whole new setup.&lt;br /&gt;- missing a nice way to make trim lines.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product...  It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave blemishes of hair around.  The only problem is tht its loud..</li>
    <li> This is a simple device, but also a great devise.  The price is also a bargain for the power it delivers and I like the easy front dial to change the trimming height.  Only comment I have would be to add some sort of lock so it stays in place when applying force under your chin / neck areas.  In addition, I wish it had some type of charge indicator light or screen to show the power levels.  I give it 4 stars and would buy again, just wish they added those 2 things.</li>
    <li> This is the first beard trimmer I have ever owned. But I am very pleased with the product it is easy to use and clean. I have had this trimmer about 3 months and it has performed flawlessly. I do wish they would make some sort of stand to hold the trimmer in while not in use. Other than that it is a fine product for the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty bare bones model.  Trimmer.  Charger.  That&#x27;s it.  But it holds a charge on standby for about a week.  Which is fine.  I trim my beard once to twice per week and I just make sure to plug it in when I leave for work so that it&#x27;s charged fully for the evening grooming ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are titanium and apparently require little or no maintenance.  I like not having to oil the blades.  I really don&#x27;t miss that ritual!  I love that the guards adjust with an easy click.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough to where it doesn&#x27;t click to a lower setting from using it.  If you&#x27;ve used other trimmers, you know that often if you push against your face too hard, the trimmer will click to a lower setting and chop WAY too much beard.  Glad this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good, balanced weight and a nice grip.  Even if your hands are damp, the grip is solid.  Since I leave it under the sink until I bring it up to charge, I don&#x27;t really miss not having a charging stand.  I try and keep as little as possible on my sink area.  But for those who need to trim daily, this might not be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great, value priced trimmer.  And for a regular user like me who has kept a beard for the last 10 years, and used many terrible trimmers in the past (I&#x27;m looking at you Wahl!), this razor fits the bill.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good item for trimming up your beard. It is relatively fragile though like all the rest of the choices for this type of item. Mine broke but it does work well for a reasonable period of time. The cost to replace is significantly less than the barber shop fees you would incur to have someone else trim your beard. Good for shaving body hair for the swimming season too.</li>
    <li> I had always taken the \\&quot;clean-shaven\\&quot; route but recently decided to keep some stubble on my face.  I tried using a cheap Remington body hair trimmer for a little while, but it was not working out.  I read a lot of reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I found out after I ordered that the shortest setting is 1.5mm, and I was a little bit worried that that wouldn&#x27;t be short enough.  When the trimmer arrived, I first tried it on setting #2 to be safe.  Here are my thoughts:    I am overall very impressed with this trimmer.  After being worried that setting #1 (1.5mm) would be too long, it turns out that setting #2 is just the right length for a good \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on #1 yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine that not being short enough for somebody.  I&#x27;d compare #2 to about 2-3 days of not shaving, and by the looks of things, #1 seems like it would trim quite a bit shorter.  So, if you need shorter than #1 then you should probably just clean shave at night and you will be happy the next day.    I was also very happy with the comb and location of the trimming blades toward the \\&quot;front\\&quot; of the comb.  The comb allows for very easy following of facial contours and the position of the trimming blades makes it easy to trim all the way up to the nose.  The result is a good, same-length trim that takes just a couple of minutes.  The zoom wheel is very easy to use and it does not seem that the comb will accidentally push down once a setting is chosen.    I cannot comment on battery life yet as I have only used the trimmer once when I just got it, and I kept it plugged in.</li>
    <li> Good product, I buy it because I want something fast for my everyday beard mainteinance. Very powerful. Its a little annoying for the sound that became when you turn it on.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this trimmer in the begining, its really powerfull, and trim very well, but after just 3 months it stop charging. I met another guy who had the same problem with this machine. pitty..</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s one of the best tools that i&#x27;ve put in my hand in a long time.  solid feel.  not slippery.  nice contours.  easy cleaning w/ included brush.  manual states life time lubrication on the blades.  have used 8 or 9 times w/o charging it.  even cut w/ plenty of power.  better than my previous norelco w/ vacuum.  this doesn&#x27;t vacuum, but the norelco missed a lot of the hairs anyway.  all that i&#x27;m looking for in a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased the older model of this shaver 5 years ago and used it every 3 days or so in the summer to trim my neck in between haircuts to almost daily use in the winter when I attempt to grow what resembles a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Ease of use - With the flick of the thumb I can change guard lengths. The guard can also easily be removed to expose the blade for close trimming&lt;br /&gt;-- Convenience - There aren&#x27;t any attachments to keep track of or store. It&#x27;s relatively compact for having the power that it does and theres a simple power cord so you down have to worry about mounting a charger to your sink or wall&lt;br /&gt;-- Power - goes from trimming delicately around my neck to ripping through a thick February beard&lt;br /&gt;-- Reliability - never once has it pulled or nicked. The blades remain surprisingly sharp over time. The battery life is also very good (mine had charger connection problems, not battery issues). In it&#x27;s prime it could go a week or more between charges&lt;br /&gt;-- Price - I picked this up on sale for under 15 bucks. If it lasts another 5 years I&#x27;ll be extremely pleased at my $3 per year expenditure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> Bought this because my husband&#x27;s last one died and we were desperate for another one! The price was right (around $15) and we like the fact that it has the adjustable height without having to change the trimmer head. It does a good job.   We wish it would work when plugged in (if it has lost its charge, and you plug it in, you have to wait for it to recharge before being able to use it, as opposed to being to use it while plugged in).   The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;base\\&quot; for charging (just a cord you plug in) doesn&#x27;t matter to us, but it might to some consumers so please be aware that you&#x27;ll have to lay it flat somewhere.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a basic trimmer to use on my mustache and beard.  I bought this trimmer about a month ago and so far it&#x27;s been good.  I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and it is still buzzing away on it&#x27;s original charge.  The guides are easily adjustable and trim evenly.  The guides are sturdy and do not slip or move while trimming.  Since the blade is pretty wide it is not designed for detailed sculpting as some smaller trimmers would be, but for a basic trimming it works great.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my Remmington MB40 that I have had for many years, because the height adjustment broke.  If it weren&#x27;t for that the MB40 still works fine.      This unit has more power, I hope it lasts as long as my MB40.</li>
    <li> I had the previous generation MB-35 that worked fine for a couple years, until it could no longer hold a decent charge. I got to the point where I was charging it every night, and that&#x27;s just no good. So I bought this MB-200. It is just as amazing as the model it replaced, and then some. Solid fit and finish, holds a robust charge, and meets/exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> The Remington MB-200 Titanium Trimmer works - it is quick - easy to use - and the price is great</li>
    <li> Battery sucked... didnt last</li>
    <li> I like the other model, MB-300 better as it had a detailing portion that could pop out.  It also would charge as you used it, which this one does not.  Definitely does the job and overall still like it, just prefer my old one which apparently they do not make anymore.</li>
    <li> Typing on mobile device excuse typos. I used the older model for years and it has worked very well.  I&#x27;ve even dropped in water (you can imagine where) and after a rinse and dry cycle it worked fine. Only reason to replace  Is because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore and im sure the blade is a bit dull  Compared to new. I highly recommend. Cell phones don&#x27;t use charging stands and I&#x27;m glad this doesn&#x27;t use one either ,   Just more stuff to take up counter space in  bathroom.</li>
    <li> good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works well and I like the adjustable heads. A charges lasts for several days.  Not easy to tell when it is about to run out of charge and it is little nosier than I expected</li>
    <li> got this because of the price.  I use it every few days and i have only charged it once.  long lasting battery and adjustable settings are really nice.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product one month ago hoping to obtain a shave look, but I was wrong. The minimal hair lenght (without guard attachment)that one can get is 1,5 mm (a three day beard). This is reason I decided to knock off one star from this GROOMER.    Hope my humble comment will help the people who is considering to buy this gadget!</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my gotee. I had been using the trimmer on my electric razor, but it didn&#x27;t have a guard. I would regularly gap it bad and have to shave it all off and start over. This thing did the trick. It has an adjustable guard that will go pretty long if you need it. My only complaint is that it is a little loud and might wake up the wife in the morning, but nothing too bad. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new trimmer because the one I had&#x27;s battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge (even when plugged in) so naturally I went on to Amazon to find another.     The same day it arrived in I opened it up and started using it.  It was great and felt like a professional trim.  The picture posted makes it look like its straight but its got some curve to it like a banana.  It takes a little to get used to but I&#x27;m sure I will get the hang of it.    I also like that it is simple and does the job.  The previous trimmer I had, has all these different hookups and attachments that I either loose them or never use them and comes in a display case that I don&#x27;t care to keep out on the counter.  Its just one trimmer, comb and brush.</li>
    <li> Really nice product! And cheap! It has NINE settings, plus you can remove the \\&quot;guard\\&quot; and kind of freehand a trim (use a comb is what the instructions say to do). Nicely designed, it feels solid in your hand. It comes with a cleaning brush and a miniature comb to use on your beard before you trim it. I&#x27;m surprised and impressed at the quality of this trimmer, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> just like how it is described. it is my first beard/mustache trimmer and it works great. easy to use and very effective</li>
    <li> Works fine. No problems.  As others have said, a stand would be helpful.  But not that big of a deal for me.</li>
    <li> I just bought this mustache and beard trimmer about a month ago to replace my old dirty one. I cannot say its the best i have used but it gets the job done and its cheap. I mainly use to it to shave my beard and it cleans up pretty nicely. The head is adjustable so it doesn&#x27;t need to be changed constantly. The drawback is that my skin hurts sometimes because of the plastic on the tips..</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to carry these in stores anymore. They are all the beard trimmers with multiple clips and attachments... My boyfriend wanted one simple unit where the height can be adjusted. Very wonderful. Holds a charge well. Comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> Though the price was appealing I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with what it did.  It&#x27;s just your average trimmer (clipper) with a Guard / Head (plastic cap) on it that can be adjusted by turning a wheel.  The titanium blades felt powerful but it was either too short / too long when trimming my beard... wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
    <li> This thing is a steal.  Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but what used to take 5 minutes with my old Panasonic (no longer available) took only a minute!</li>
    <li> Love this thing, I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years and it still holds a great charge. For the price you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for several decades and have been through several beard trimmers in that time.  This one gets the job done, but it seems to do it a little better than the other razors I&#x27;ve had.  I can&#x27;t pin it down as to how it&#x27;s better, but I do know that the lower price was a nice difference.  I even bought a second one for a friend of mine who asked me what&#x27;s the best way to keep a beard under control.  He is satisfied with the Remington too.  One tip: remember when you have taken the cap off for close trims.  I forgot I did that one day and had a big surprise when I went to trim back my sideburns and suddenly there was nothing there.  That was the first, and hopefully the last time I have a goatee.  Yes the Remington can trim real close too.</li>
    <li> After years of trimming my beard with scissors, I decided to try an electric beard trimmer.  Since it was to be on a trial basis, I wanted to find a trimmer that had good reviews, and was coupled with a good price.  This Remington MB-200 was being sold for about $14.00, with free shipping, so I thought \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it was a good decision.  The trimmer has proven to have suited my needs.  The blades are sharp, the unit holds a charge well, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I especially like the adjustment wheel, as it enables one to make quick length adjustments, without having to remove heads (that is, unless you want the very shortest stubble or definition, which requires removal of the length guard).  Since I&#x27;m using the unit for short stubble length, I can&#x27;t attest as to how the trimmer would be for longer lengths, although I would venture to guess that it would work well in those cases, also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the 3-year-old equivalent of the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver]] or the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer, Black]] and was disappointed with the build quality. The product may be better-built now, but the version I had was almost entirely plastic and the shaving compartment broke awhile back.    Upon opening the Remington MB-200 I was instantly pleased with my purchase. To the touch, I could tell the Remington trimmer is made with better materials at half -- or even a third of -- the price I paid for my Norelco. I keep a constant \\&quot;5 o clock shadow\\&quot; look -- and after one use I can already tell this is going to be a better product for me. It could very well just be the fresh blades, but after one use I feel like the \\&quot;1\\&quot; setting on the Remington  gave me a tighter trim in half the passes. I may not always go this short, but it&#x27;s nice to have that option if I want it.    One comment in the Norelco&#x27;s favor: I quickly realized trimming with this Remington is probably going to be a little messier without the Norelco&#x27;s vacuum/compartment; I probably took that for granted. Small price to pay for a better trim, though.</li>
    <li> The Remington MB200 had a good start but a short run.  It was the perfect beard trimmer but stopped taking a charge after only seven months of moderate use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: July 2011.  I will say that Remington was very cooperative and replaced the product with a brand new one.  They do stand behind their warranty.</li>
    <li> I like the weightless of this trimmer, easy to use and clean but I will like for the company to provide this pckg with a larger brush to clean the trimmer.    For the price I can say is a good purchase, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer and it is very easy to use. Also, the Amazon experience was great and I definitely recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a birthday present for my husband who is wanted to start a new bearded look, and he LOOOVES IT!!! And that makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> I had been using an old beard trimmer, and finally replaced it with the MB-200.  The old one had been yanking my beard hairs, incredibly uncomfortable.  This one just whips through and quietly, efficiently trims everything just right.  It is SO much better!  It lasts a long time on a charge.  I don&#x27;t trim my beard every day, so a single charge will last at least a month.  I had really been hoping for one that took rechargeable AA or AAA batteries, but this is absolutely fine.  Maybe I will need to throw this one away in 10 years, when the battery fails;  if so, still a wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d just like to say that I never review anything I buy on here.&lt;br /&gt; But this is one to brag about.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a beard trimmer to purchase for my brother for a christmas present, After reading review after review. I landed with this one in my cart. And he freaking loves it, last night he actually shaved his head with it and it looked really good. Im bragging about this product because it&#x27;s less than 20 dollars and has better reviews than a 50 dollar one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your hard earned bucks on this one; it&#x27;s a real piece of junk...mine ended up in the trash after very few uses; couldn&#x27;t hold a charge &amp; it expired right after the initial warranty period; charger cord is a real nuisance / junky as well.</li>
    <li> Finally this product solved my problem of not being able to find a trimmer that  leaves my beard longer and not trimming so close to my skin.</li>
    <li> For the price, you&#x27;re not going to find a better trimmer.  The settings are extremely easy to use, the charger is compact, and it&#x27;s got plenty of power when fully charged.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s in the market for an affordable, functional, portable trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have the previous model which seems to be pretty much the same other than for the cosmetics.    Mine is at least three years old and gets used at least once a week. I tend to keep my beard short (about a #5 on the adjustment scale) and this trimmer does the job just fine. It cuts evenly and quickly and holds a charge for quite a while.    One thing to be aware of is the need to lubricate the blades. I generally do a lube after two uses and I think that this is partially responsable for the reliability. It&#x27;s also important to flip up the trimmer head and clean out the comparment underneath. A single drop of oil on the motor shaft helps here too. I use Wahl brand trimmer oil and a bottle will last the average user for years.    The popup trimmer is a great feature when trimming my moustache as it lets me get into smaller spaces than the main cutter will.    I keep wanting to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a more powerful trimmer,  but this thing doesn&#x27;t want to quit.</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  I spent years trimming my facial hair with a crappy beard trimmer that required constant disassembly for oiling and cleaning.  The difference is night and day.  This thing is incredibly low maintenance and simply works great.</li>
    <li> I used the trimmer right out of the box. It is intuitive, with very clear controls. Trimmers can catch beard hair, but this was very nice and smooth. I have no buyer&#x27;s remorse - very nice. Also, the trimmer is rechargeable, and came already charged. Nice touch.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head.  Its very easy to clean and does a great job!</li>
    <li> good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cut</li>
    <li> IN the first 30 days, this trimmer has run great and is much more adjustable than my previous one (Norelco T2000)</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one over the last 6 years or so. Like a genius, I blew out my first 2 by plugging them in to 220v outlets overseas. The earlier iterations of this trimmer didn&#x27;t support 220v but this one says that it does, which I have not yet tried out. It&#x27;s a great little trimmer for the price and I see no reason to buy a more expensive one. I use it for all my trimming needs: beard/mustache, neck, etc.</li>
    <li> Solid shaver.  After a few years, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, but still trims very close.</li>
    <li> I thought this will be another low quality trimmer in this range. But I bought it because I read some nice reviews. I really like this trimmer. It does everything that trimmer needs to. The best thing is it is rechargeable and a good battery which lasts for long time. Last time I had a trimmer whose battery couldn&#x27;t last for 1 trim even. I highly recommend this product in mid 10s range.</li>
    <li> well it is not the one I really wanted as the last time the it was a  silver  smaller one as the first one came in a black case with extra stuff or one could just buy the trimmer by itself.  And then the second time it was black and I bought the case and  I want that one back on here to buy as I bought like well  at first AVON  was selling them  and I bought like 5 or 6 of them and then some of them got worn out.  I had the # here some where but right I this moment I can&#x27;t get my hands on it to put on here  the  SC  #.  Shoot</li>
    <li> Like many other customers, my batteries died rapidly.  I was never able to run this trimmer on corded power, and it takes forever to fully charge the batteries, so it is hard to do anything but leave it plugged in.  This doubtless contributed to the short battery life, but the design of the trimmer leaves little other choice.  Very disappointed - my previous trimmer lasted for many years.</li>
    <li> This is the second one like this my husband bought.  Only thing is the battery dies in a year or two.  Otherwise, product works well.</li>
    <li> What a bargain ! This trimmer does what it promises and more, making it a pleaseure to take care of a beard and to change lengths and looks at the flip of a switch ! My wife wasn&#x27;t sure how long she wanted my beard and in two days I was able to use one trimmer to go from a full beard to the \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; look and each stop in between !</li>
    <li> Best trimmer that I ever purchased to my husband. After trying so many models, my husband loves it.  High quality product.</li>
    <li> It has worked flawlessly for me. The only downside I saw was that if its plugged in and the battery is dead then it won&#x27;t turn on. The battery must be charged.</li>
    <li> The trimmer impressed me in its solid feel.  Runs fast and smooth.  Seems like it was built to last.  I recommend the trimmer without reservation. Only possible drawback, lack of upright space saving recharger stand, is mitigated by length of time between needed charges.</li>
    <li> the Trimmer it self is quite good .  but when i receive this Trimmer it was already charged, i use it a few times until its out of battery the problem is no matter how long i tried to charged it will only work for a few second then it will stop, it is obvious the battery is a very cheap and very bad and the Trimmer is useless now</li>
    <li> good value. holds charge MUCH better than my previous trimmer. wish it had a lower setting for stubble, but still a nice little trimmer</li>
    <li> The battery died after only 6 months while i was using it, i was half way!!!! I gave 1 star just because it was good as far as he worked. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had this for about a year. I only used it to keep my face shaved at a stubble since my eczema will not allow me to shave closely more than once every ten days or so. It did a good job cutting and I got about 4-5 shaves with each charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone said it does not have a good design for laying safely on most surfaces - it wants to roll and tip over a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it safe for a year and it was still going strong when one drop of less than two feet broke it. Lame-O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a different model that is more rectangular and flat so less prone to rolling or flopping awkwardly in a early morning fumble. But it did the job Atari decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said you can use it while plugged in after losing its charge. Not true.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for about 3 years and it only has one major flaw and it is just the nature of the type of battery that they decided to use in this particular model. Unfortunately NiCad batteries are notorious for developing a memory and after a while they pretty much stop charging. Aside from this I would give it 5 stars. I&#x27;m going to try the MB4040 model which has a lithium-ion battery and should not have the same issues as this one. Hopefully it will cut just as great as this one did. I especially love the adjustability of the guard. Will post a report of the new model once I have some experience using it.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. The blade cuts super fast and beats my old trimmer. Like it because it does not have any cheaply made attachments. Precision trimming settings that truly work. Very happy with the Remington trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older model (same except colors)for about five years. One day it stopped taking a charge. Got this new one, and just for fun I plugged the old one into the new charger. Guess what? I now have two working trimmers and one working charger. Check your charger before you buy!</li>
    <li> Garbage. Like many reviewers here pointed out, this does not hold a charge. It gets progressively worse to the point that after the first month, you&#x27;ll have to charge it overnight if you plan to use it for 3 minutes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as my last one did.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington trimmer for many years which I loved.  It was incredible, always fast and sharp.  When I lost it, I bought this model, but I was really surprised by how badly it cut.  It will NOT cut close to the skin AT ALL.  It was not able to cut the hair under my nose, and it will simply not cut closer that 1/4 inch because of the way the blades are positioned.  So if you need to get close to the skin, for example under the nose or down on the neck, you&#x27;re going to be screwed by this shaver.  Not to mention that it pulls like the dickens.  I am just perplexed by what Remington has wrought.</li>
    <li> Buy Friday, October 4, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that no last two years, but has not reached 4 months was a shame now I atener to buy a replacement battery and try to remove the one with ... that bad</li>
    <li> Works great and just what I wanted.  Good price too.    Woody</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and have yet to have to recharge the battery.  It seems to deliver what is promised.  The speed is good for a battery unit and doesn&#x27;t snag on tough beards.  The design is ergonamic and the features are easy to use.  It is simply the best beard trimmer I have ever had, and I have been trimming my beard for close to 40 years.</li>
    <li> Price + quality + performance equates to a true value. Prior trimmer was a Wahl....the MB-200 exceeds the Wahl in ALL aspects. Guaranteed, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked fine for about eleven months, and was met with regular use. However a single two-foot tumble killed it DEAD. Won&#x27;t turn on, and won&#x27;t accept a charge. Beware and take VERY good care of this product should you decide to buy. They don&#x27;t offer warranties on this model for a reason.</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a decent price. I have only had it for a bit but it does a fantastic job making clear trims. Other cheaper shavers don&#x27;t seem to work stick with this one its easy to use and not very noisy.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer has been amazing. It has easily adjustable length settings that are by number, so you don&#x27;t have to guess each time how long to set it.  The battery, which you charge by plugging into the wall, lasts about 3 weeks (I use it about every 3-4 days) and is quick to charge. Also, it&#x27;s very easy to clean and feels very solid - no pulled hairs.     I highly recommend this beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> After owning several Wahl trimmers, I wanted something more reliable but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank.  This product is perfect and was on sale for $14.77.  This product feels well built, the charge lasts for and weeks, and has nice adjustable guard for various lengths and for trimming sensitive areas that is also removable for precise beard and mustache trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for 4 star is the misleading \\&quot;Made in PRC\\&quot; label which I do not believe is a TLA (Three Letter Acronym) for \\&quot;Puerto Rico Commonwealth\\&quot; but more likely \\&quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China.\\&quot;  Really Remington, are you really that concerned to have a \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; sticker on your product when I believe all Apple products and just about every other high tech device I own was probably made there?  5 star product well built in China minus 1 star for trying to hide it.</li>
    <li> WARNING: DO NOT BE A FOOL LIKE ME::: Yes, I read the reviews that said the battery would die on this w/i months of purchase... I thought &#x27;..that won&#x27;t happen to me.&#x27;  This was a great product while it worked...now less than a year after purchase it may work for 5 minutes after I charge it all day or it may not last but 5 seconds. The adjustable blade is really nice but without  working motor it is kinda useless. You may have guessed I would not recommend the MB100 to a friend nor purchase another. Good luck but don&#x27;t say you were NOT warned...</li>
    <li> Tried this trimmer for 3 years, a total of 3 trimmers. Every time, after 4-6 months of use, battery stops holding charge and have to charge 24 hours everyday for a 2 min usage. Put 25 more bucks and get a Braun... trust me, you wont regret.</li>
    <li> I grew a beard for the first time after surgery but decided I wanted a neat look, not stubble like I forgot to shave or something out of the back woods.  This very reasonably priced trimmer has allowed me my fantasy of looking sophisticated, and I haven&#x27;t yet managed to shave off half of my new facial hair while admiring the other side.  My beard is carefully trimmed, and  I hope to keep it that way.  I was able to progressively reduce the length until I found a look that I like.  Nine positions is more than enough.  I&#x27;d give the trimmer 5 stars, but am saving the fifth for one that can shave the spaces in between.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced a four year old version of this, when the batteries stopped holding a charge. Now I&#x27;m thinking I should have sprung for a better one, since this died after only four months.  I just emailed their customer service, we&#x27;ll see if they do anything for me.</li>
    <li> i got the previous version of these 8 years ago, i used it all the way up until i bought this one, i lost the height guard, thats the only reason i replaced it. very very worth the money</li>
    <li> Same as everyone else. Bought this because it had the best reviews, and now it&#x27;s dead (can&#x27;t charge). What a waste of money. I guess it&#x27;s impossible to find a good beard trimmer out there that doesn&#x27;t just die!</li>
    <li> What some others have said here- eventually it just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. It was good in the meantime- and cheap enough that it&#x27;s hard to complain about the lack of durability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the MB-200 for at least three years now.  My previous one broke after I dropped it.  I&#x27;ve noticed that other reviewers are saying that they had issues with the battery, but I haven&#x27;t had any.  I used my previous one at least twice a week for three years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem.  For the money, I&#x27;ve never found a better model of trimmers.  I feel that this is an excellent value, which is why I bought an extra one in case they discontinue the model. Great value at Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve grown frustrated with my previous trimmer, an otherwise excellent Wahl model, which required that I swap out different attachments to control the trim depth, or else used a disastrous adjustable slide that would collapse in use. (Surprise! You&#x27;re bald! Or at least patchy.)  This Remington integrates an excellent depth control device, selectable with a thumb-rotated wheel, and the guard can be removed for a closer trim. There are no other accessories needed, although it does come with the ubiqitous munchkin comb and rapidly discarded miniscule cleaning broom. Aside from those, I no longer need to keep track of an array of tiny flimsy pieces.  There are some problems with this, nothing glaring, but it does feel flimsy, especially the guard. I have no reason to expect it will fall apart soon - nothing has broken yet, or even hinted at it- but it does not have the solid and compact hand-feel that my Wahl has.  Which brings me to the next point: This is not compact. It&#x27;s an exceptionally long device, at least an inch longer than any trimmer I&#x27;ve had before, and it makes it difficult to maneuver at times. Tilting my head back, tucking it under my chin, and trying to eye the mirror has made for some memorable and lopsided shaves.  Still, when managed properly this is a very good trimmer. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two other trimmers for when I grow my goatee and around the ears. I really like this one. So simple to use, no worry about oil to keep the blades conditioned or batteries. It even works very well areas other than face and head. Simply buy it. Excellent price you will be impressed.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does what its supposed to do and does it well. The only problem I had was with the protective cover on, you couldn&#x27;t really get a trimmed look. Even the lowest setting leaves a pretty dense stubble. I&#x27;ve had to use the trimmer without the thingy - which then works well for me.     The charge has held for 5 uses so far - which is great if you don&#x27;t want to carry the power adapter with you when travelling.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews, and having quite satisfactorily previously owned a Remington beard trimmer years and years ago. It was the biggest mistake I could make.  This trimmer will *damage* longer beards. My beard is just over the length of the 8 setting on this, and while the trimmer was powerful and comfortable, a day after using it, my entire beard was completely and irreparably damaged. Where the Remington cuts the hairs is fine - the cuts are clean and straight, not resulting in any split ends. But if your beard hairs are even remotely stiff/brittle and thick, it will \\&quot;break\\&quot; them in multiple spots. It appears that the blades are \\&quot;messy,\\&quot; they will do half-cuts in more than one place along a hair. I&#x27;m not talking about one or two hairs here - a week after my \\&quot;trim,\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had to manually cull thousands of hairs and am still finding more that have been completely ruined. The only fix at this point is a clean shave and two months regrowth.  Don&#x27;t get this if you don&#x27;t feel like going clean shaven for a week in order to regrow your hair after this abomination of a trimmer damages it.  It works fine if you&#x27;re using it to shave rather than trim, or if you&#x27;re using it on sparse hair (mustaches vs beards).</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for $15 at a local Kroger (Smiths) outlet just to quickly replace my $50 trimmer that started to pinch and I have been very impressed with it for the price I paid. I&#x27;ve had it 6 months now and it works just like it did when I bought it.    Some things I like about this particular model:  #1 - NO ATTACHMENTS! Can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had to fumble and look through my stash to find the correct attachment to use. This completely defeats this problem by just using a scroll wheel to select what length of trim you want.  #2 - Charge indicator light, believe it or not some don&#x27;t have any charge indication lights which makes it real fun to try to determine if the device is charging or is fully charged.  #3 - No pinching. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and it still cuts great and I have thick black hair. I&#x27;ve spent $50-$70 only to get a unit that pinches and pulls on hairs rather than trim them.     You can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit, its cheap and it works better than some of the more expensive units you can find. This is one case where price isn&#x27;t a indication of quality.</li>
    <li> have had this model for several years. Works fine but does not hold much of a charge. Ordered new one due to low cost thinking that it will work fine initially but eventually end up with the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Enough for one use if you hurry</li>
    <li> This is the perfect trimmer, something that I always wished and never could find. Before buying this trimmer, I had a very  uncomfortable trimmer (I hide the name), with all these accessories, and different pieces with different sizes, and you go to the bathroom and is like if you were going for vacations, you have a complete bag with many things, they fall,..etc. You have here everything in only one piece!!, and is safe, you don&#x27;t have to worry about scratches in your face or something.</li>
    <li> This thing is diesel, not even comparable to my old trimmer and you can&#x27;t beat that for the price. I&#x27;ve had no problems so far, and it&#x27;s scary how well it cuts through a big &#x27;ol beard. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> So I picked this trimmer for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no oiling/ maintenance free&lt;br /&gt;- cordless, but rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;- low price point&lt;br /&gt;- number of positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving it an initial try here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come up with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Its relatively easy to use, even it the angling is a bit awkward. The adjustment mechanism feels good and it is easy to see what number it is on.&lt;br /&gt;- Worked well for its intended purpose&lt;br /&gt;- seems to be made well enough, especially for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Though it doesn&#x27;t mention one anyway, there was no stand for the unit, which is a little inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;- You cannot use it while it is plugged in. Rather you can, but it wont power the unit. The actual adapter looks like a 3.5 mm headphone jack and plug. Its a bit unusual and I assume that its the reason why it cant be used \\&quot;pass thru\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;- No warning when power dips too low for use. When I first opened it I tried to test it out without charging. It started fine, but then suddenly slowed to an unusable rate. It appears to have a light on it, but I didn&#x27;t notice it on when this happened.&lt;br /&gt;- While it has quite a number of adjustments, unfortunately the gaps between may be a bit extreme for some people. Also I found that on the lowest setting it wasn&#x27;t as short as I&#x27;d like to see. I ended up using a 4 for the bulk of the trimming, but I will still require the use of my Braun electric for touching up.&lt;br /&gt;-Angle is awkward to handle. I found it hard to make consistent strokes due to the severe angle of the head, luckily it doesn&#x27;t affect the results, just the comfort of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think if you maintain any facial hair this is a great tool, however don&#x27;t expect it to be a one stop tool. That being said it trimmer very well, with no tugging or jamming (my beard is pretty thick). I cant speak for the maintenance free area. They include a small brush to clean out the head, so depending on how you feel, that may be much for you. I found after one charged use it required it (it retains a lot of hair). It would appear it would require it every use, which is a little annoying, but is depended on your habits and usage too.ins a lot of hair).

    <li> I love this thing. No attachments to fiddle with, easy to adjust, and inexpensive. It&#x27;s small enough to be completly portable and keeps the charge for a long time. If you need a trimmer get this one.</li>
    <li> Had one before  giving it to my son who took a liking to it!! Reliable and functional product. Solid and well made.</li>
    <li> I was looking into buying a razor that was portable and effective. This fits my criteria and more. It works great. I have no complaints. received it quickly.</li>
    <li> You simply can&#x27;t find any thing wrong with this trimmer. After the charge recommended, it Just trimmed and trimmed without stopping. The adjustments are perfect and I use 3 as my setting for lenght of beard.</li>
    <li> A review for a beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t need to be lengthy - they&#x27;re basic devices.  They need to:  (a) trim your beard well, and  (b) not break.  I have had many different beard trimmers over the years and, surprisingly, this is the only one that has performed these two functions without fail.  For the money, pick up this no thrills but exceptionally functional beard trimmer.  Unless you need your beard trimmer to perform five other superfluous functions, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Remington is an excellent value and does a great job. This trimmer pays for itself when comparing the cost of paying the local barber to trim my beard. There is no downside on this purchase. Highly recommended to anyone in the market for a mustache and beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works like a charm.  I charged it up once and have been trimming my beard for several weeks now on a single charge.  Adjustable trimmer length is easy to use and works as expected.  Haven&#x27;t had to clean or oil it yet, but it came with the supplies to do so.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My only complaint is that the instructions on how to actually trim your beard with the trimmer (how to hold the trimmer, etc) are somewhat lacking.  If you&#x27;re new to trimming beards like me, you could easily wind up chopping off more hair than you wanted to, if you&#x27;re not very careful.</li>
    <li> Simply one of the best beard trimmers I have used and now recommend to family/friends all the time! And it&#x27;s last for over 2 years!</li>
    <li> I had an old Remington (probably a decade old) and it was finally starting to act kind of funky, so I bought a new one.  Hoping this one lasts me a good ten years too!  A great product!</li>
    <li> plenty powerful and easy to use. However, I wish that the gaps between the guide settings were a little too big for my taste. Also, the guide is made out of pretty mediocre plastic, and cracked easily when I accidentally dropped the trimmer into the sink.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the adjustable head. Easy to clean and easy to handle. Much better then my previous Panasonic trimmer and only a third of the cost.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is perfect for keeping my beard a nice length.  The adjustment wheel allows me to trim closely in some places and to maintain a little longer trim in other places. I was a little wary based on some of the reviews, but this trimmer is all I expected and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer. What a great trimmer, this is the third one I have ordered as gifts.  All the guys that received them say that they really like the clean cut they get and that they don&#x27;t have to change the head to adjust the length desired with the built in adjustible head.  I will be buying a couple more as Christmas gifts.  I still can&#x27;t believe the price plus my shipping was free.</li>
    <li> best adjustable razor yet thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Good shaver, great price, it works better then I expected it to.  Shipping was also very fast, overall I would say this is a very good product for the price</li>
    <li> I cannot thank my girlfriend enough for this amazing mustache and beard trimmer. The power and vacuum are great and the guard was so easy to adjust. It definitely keeps everything neat and tidy. Highly recommended! I&#x27;m even telling all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> Works very well for trimming beards to 9 lengths including a close stubble look. The down side is the battery, NiCD, which suffers from memory effect if improperly charged. If you find a trimmer for about the same price with Lithium or NiMH batteries then get that since they are fool-proof to charge. If you&#x27;re willing to put up with properly charging this and the price is right, you&#x27;ll be happy with this one. Like I said it performs very well.  NiCD batteries should be fully drained before charging, and fully charged before using; otherwise the battery life will shorten and if done a number of times the battery will stop holding a charge. (I&#x27;m guessing reviewers who say the battery stops working after a couple weeks didn&#x27;t do this) Also during use, NiCD batteries provide steady power until they run out suddenly with little warning. The problem with that is the charge time is 14 to 16 hours, which means even if you use the trimmer the night before, if the battery dies you can&#x27;t finish the job in the morning without fear of shortening the life of the battery somewhat.  But overall it performs very well and if charged properly should work for years and is very cheap; so I only took off 1 star.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer just fine, I dropped my 1st one in the sink and broke the plastic adjustment tab off.  I just saved the cutting head off it for a spare on my new trimmer and tossed the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after using the product for a few months--I&#x27;m glad I waited.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product worked fairly well, you can adjust the for the perfect trim of your beard or mustache depending on how long you want it.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I tried to trim my beard. I turn on the trimmer and about 5 seconds later it turns off due to not holding a charge. I&#x27;ve been trying to charge since then, its definitely not a user error; the battery no longer holds a charge. I would not suggest this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> It is a good product for people who have big beard, but it does not give close trim. But i found a way to do it. Simply just open up the top cover of it. Its hard in the beginning but pull with force, it should be out and then you can put it back too. This will help you for a close trim.</li>
    <li> Seriously, all I was looking for was a trimmer, NOT A SHAVER, I use a razor for that. This works perfectly to keep your beard at the right length. I personally don&#x27;t have a thick beard, which is perfect as I am able to maintain that 5&#x27;clock shadow look pretty easily. Just like everyone else said, no lubricant needed, one charge seems to last forever! Easy to use, and great price.</li>
    <li> This thing has power. I bought this for my partner and he loves it. He said it was alot better then the last one I got him. Buy it if your looking for good trimmer. I have been trying to find a good one for a while.</li>
    <li> Compact and pretty light trimmer. I&#x27;ve only started growing a beard the past couple of months but this trimmer makes it easy for a novice. Nine ( 9! ) different trimming levels means you can customize to whatever size you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a good while too, wish it lasted longer (my only complaint).</li>
    <li> This trimmer meets my needs perfectly. As a new beard and mustache wearer I did not know what would work best. But this trimmer does the job being easy to adjust the trim amount simply i without changing parts t; just change the dial. Trim your mustache shorter than your beard; just change the dial. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I found this by looking at other reviews on Amazon and decided to purchase it based on what I had read there.  I was not the least bit disappointed.  This has been a great little trimmer that holds a charge for a long time.  I use it mostly for trimming my beard, and it has worked great!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a trimmer about once a week so I would say very light usage.  After less than a year of use the battery would discharge fairly quickly even when the unit was turned off.  At this point its has to be charged before each use and this leads to the other issue.  Unlike the Norelco unit I previously owned this trimmer will not operate off the charger--you have to fully charge the battery before you can use the trimmer.  Since the battery won&#x27;t even last a week with no use it&#x27;s essentially a brick to me at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer it was ok.  No better or worse than the other brands (I have owned pretty much every brand over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor product quality.  Going back to the Norelco at this point.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 3 years now. I use it with no guard to shave my head, and add the guard to trim my goatee. This shaver works great as a \\&quot;balding clipper\\&quot; to shave your head bald without worrying about razor burn you get from a razor.     I knocked a star off the review because it seems the battery has gone bad, it barely holds a charge for 1 minute now. I came here to find a replacement battery with no luck. I guess for the low price of this shaver it&#x27;s ok to buy a new one after 3 years, but I plan to try find something with a replaceable battery.</li>
    <li> This is great. It was a lot better than I expected for the money I paid for it. If you&#x27;re looking for a decent basic trimmer, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer so i cannot compare it with anyone else. But i would recommend this product..</li>
    <li> Looks great. Feels good in your hand. Easy to use. But if it won&#x27;t hold a charge, then you can&#x27;t really use it, right? This unit must, must, must be plugged in at all times. Once you take it off the charge it slowly dies. Usually within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I was frustrated by not having the trimmer charged when I needed it. It would have been better if Remington just designed it with a cord. I thought I would charge it once a week, then put away the wall wart. Nope. That ain&#x27;t working. I&#x27;ll say it again. This trimmer must remain plugged into the wall at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to Wahl.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Easy to use, leaves my moustache looking neat.  One LITTLE thing is you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  Otherwise excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought one a year ago stilli n service today...no snags nothing cutting hair cutting facial hair.  Bought 5 more of these for everyone for chirstmas..very great product...no battery&#x27;s! I leave it plugged in..use it...plug it back in...simple great wonderful!</li>
    <li> MY BOYFRIEND SAYS IT WAS OK!</li>
    <li> It was very easy to use and easy to clean.  If only it cleaned out the sink when the man was done using it.  Hairs everywhere.  It did a great job and he looked clean cut afterwards.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why they felt the need to give this thing an &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; curvature.  it is like trying to hold a banana to shave with.  i miss my old norelco shaver that broke after 10 years and is no longer made.  there are very few options out there in the sliding guard category at this price range.  the battery life on this one also sucks, but i swapped them out for higher capacity NiMH batteries that have given it new life.</li>
    <li> The changing of the levels is as easy as it can be so I am able to create that five o clock shadow, trim sideburns and more.  Recharges easy, but with it had a stand instead I just cram the cord and razor in the drawer. Great price for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Runs nice when its fully charged but that is rarely the case. I have to charge this for a full hour before I want to use it. Ridiculous. Will not buy another Remington product.</li>
    <li> Some of the complaints are legit - it does not hold a great charge and it has some cheap pieces on it.    The good news is that the defects are easily remedied - don&#x27;t drop it on the floor, keep it charged and it&#x27;s the best trimmer ever for the dirt cheap price of $29.99.    After two years, it&#x27;s still running strong.    UPDATE:  Had some problems during year 3 - mostly about charging.  Now, I drain the charge completely before re-charging.  Only 1, 1 1/2 shaves per charge but I only trim my beard once per week so it still works fine.</li>
    <li> Thanks.... I love this one.  I have had a few different brands types over the years, but this one really works... We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts...</li>
    <li> I just bought this to replace a larger trimmer I have had for a few years.  I like this model a lot.  The cutting length guide is small enough to easily trim under your chin and above your lip.  There are no attachments, just the attached guide.  I prefer it that way.  I am tried of getting a bunch of plastic crap with every trimmer I buy when I just use one piece.  It cuts hair well without tugging or pain.  The adjustment wheel is like a mouse scroll wheel and functions a lot easier and smoother than most crude \\&quot;snapping\\&quot; adjustments on other trimmers.  The only problem is that the guide doesn&#x27;t appear to lock in place.  Granted it takes a reasonable amount of force to adjust it and I don&#x27;t think you will adjust it by pressing up against your face, but you could potentially bump / roll the wheel and adjust it inadvertently.  I like the prodcut a lot for facial hair trimming.  I have used 4 or 5 trimmers over the years and this is the best.  It&#x27;s pretty cheap too.</li>
    <li> Even after reading some of the weak reviews, I figured there would be no harm in spending about $30 on a beard trimmer. Howeverm like a lot of the other feedback, this shaver worked about 10 times, before promptly dying after being turned for 3 seconds each time. I do want to note that I charged it overseas (where I live) using an adapter.  This has never impacted any other appliances I&#x27;ve purchased, but I did want to note it.  My recommendation: spend a few more $$&#x27;s, and get something that will last</li>
    <li> This product has worked well for me. Get a close shave with just a little stubble left. I&#x27;ve used it 4 or 5 times now without having to recharge it after the initial charge. Easy grip, easy to alter the lengths of the shave. Product arrived promptly. Don&#x27;t know what else is needed, hence the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful trimmer.  While it is a little light weight and hums a little too loud, this trimmer is perfect.  Allows you to trim at a good lenght - setting 10 - and anywhere in between.  Easy to operate and clean.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier and like saving money from it&#x27;s competition.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this trimmer while it lasted. I had to keep it plugged in, but it *really* cut through hair fast and efficiently. I&#x27;m only not using it now because the click knob to change hair length broke and the guide would no longer move up or down appropriately. One problem with the trimmer is it never was good at giving the 2 day stub look. Before I grew out a full beard I found this lack of a feature bothersome. As your beard get&#x27;s closer to a size 3.5 this trimmer totally loses effectiveness -- I find the hairs near the chin to be substantially longer than the hairs on the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $7.00 more I&#x27;m going to order the HC-5550 this time around.</li>
    <li> This is another great buy from Amazon. The Trimmer is exceptional an with the length wheel on it you can keep yourself groomed with precision an its light weight makes for a more effortless shave. Amazons price also helps. Its definatley a great trimmer its price is definatley like giving it away because if I used it before I bought it I would think its worth at least a 100$ but amazingly its not even close. Definatley a great buy. That&#x27;s why I purchased 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Coulnd&#x27;t find these in Canada anymore and was really happy to find it at Amazon. Was there within a week and it&#x27;s the newer model of the one I had for years.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Used this trimmer probably less than a dozen times - for just a few minutes each time and the motor has already died. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very good beard trimmer. I am pleased. Loved the packaging and it feels good on the hands. The battery seems to last, 4 stars because the tirmmer is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I have been using it for over 2 years now and I love it. One of the best at precisely triming your beard.</li>
    <li> I bought in December 2012. And I was quite happy at the beginning. I use it for mustache trimming only (I don’t have a beard).&lt;br /&gt;But I was happy until I’ve discovered that it cannot work while being charged. Namely, one evening I’ve started trimming my mustache but it stopped after I trimmed only my left side. I plugged it in the outlet hoping to continue, but it does not work this way. As soon as you turn it on - it stops charging and switches back to using (uncharged) battery again. In short I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could trim my right side. I had my 15 years old Panasonic (before I bought this Remington) and I actually never charged my Panasonic because I always plugged it while trimming. Things got worse when battery got very weak. Now I have to charge it for 30 min every time right before I use it, and I have about 2 min to trim my mustache, otherwise I need to charge it again to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t buy any trimmer from Remington again and don’t suggest to anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> Good ergonomic design, easy cleanup. Bad news is, it does not hold a charge and can&#x27;t be used while charging. Wanna a quick trim before going out? Better have thought of that yesterday! I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I think I still have this same one after a few years....and still going strong. It&#x27;s beat to hell from shaving my German Shepard&#x27;s butt and hind quarters but it still works. The battery life on it sucks though -only a few minutes of use from a full charge. I guess that&#x27;s enough for a human. *shrug*</li>
    <li> Both this to replacement my old Remington. It was old.  The battery died long ago but could still be used while plugged in.  It was just time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this in the end of February and six months later it will not hold a charge.  I gave it a full days charge when unpacked, didn&#x27;t let it sit dead, or abuse it in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;What really bothers me is that they changed the design so the shaver will ONLY pull from the battery.  The plug is for charging only.  Once the battery goes the shaver will not work when plugged in.  This type of design change can not be considered an accident. It seems to be the typical \\&quot;design it to fail and consumers will have to replace more often increasing sales\\&quot; mentality that has swept through many companies over the last couple decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again Remington.  You lost a long time and brand faithful customer.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend getting this beard trimmer. The battery life is extremely bad. You have to plug it in for &amp;#34;14 hours&amp;#34; for it to be used for a decent amount of time. However, when the trimmer is not plugged into an electrical socket, it will lose its power in 1-2 days. The only decent thing about the trimmer is that it has numerous adjustable increments in the lower length end. I really think this is a cheap product with subpar materials and quality, and I think investing in a more expensive beard trimmer with better durability and quality is well worth it.</li>
    <li> It fails to hold a charge and I can&#x27;t get all my bread trimmed and it keeps getting worse.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep a charge. If not plugged in all the time between uses, it will completely lose it&#x27;s charge within 12 hours. Also, the teeth on the comb are too far apart; this prevents the trimmer from cutting to a uniform length. It always leaves numerous hairs longer than the rest no matter how many passes I make.</li>
    <li> Best Price , Best Value. I must have given 5 star if it has come up with a charging stand.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer would be OK except that after 6 months the battery is worthless. Even after charging for several hours it only gives about 20 seconds of use. The thing dies after a few seconds, even if it&#x27;s plugged into the wall! I guess the electronics don&#x27;t allow for direct flow through of current.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunately when the rechargeable battery turns to garbage after a few months, it becomes completely unusable.</li>
    <li> Charged it for 16 hours before first use like instructed.  Only used it once before it wont charge anymore. PURE CRAP!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints at all about the trim and functionality of this unit. I use it for a medium to close goat and mustache trim and have been very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say, after 2 years the battery will not hold a charge for more than a day or so and I presume that will only get worse. Unfortunately you cannot use it as a corded, you have to wait for it to charge. Luckily I don&#x27;t need to trim everyday so I just plug it in ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a shame. I would gladly buy again if it had a better or replaceable battery.</li>
    <li> when this arrived in the mail,there was no charge at all.I charged for 8 hours,and then did not touch it for over two weeks.when my beard needed trimming,i reached for my Remington and after over 10 minutes straight,the charge was still good and strong.fits well in your hand.well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable battery on this has pretty much died in just over a year. After that I got only one or two trims on a full charge! The genius who designed it didn&#x27;t even ensure that it will work when it is plugged in. After a couple of trims when it loses charge I need to plug it in overnight so I can use it again for the next couple of times. What a waste!&lt;br /&gt;I am back again shopping for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works so easily because there is no swapping out of attachments, and the wheel has plenty of positions for trim length. Cleans easily, and is very light. Does not do ultra-close trimming like the MB-300, though. That model was not available anymore on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Had the trimmer for about 3 weeks now. Worked easily straight out of the box and has continued to work flawlessly. Big improvement over my previous older trimmer. Probably the biggest thing that stands out is the solid build quality. Has a really nice \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it and just feels very solid in every way.</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer however when you take off the bland to clean the hair out.it is extremely fragile.had to return the first one but amazon is of course greal with returns so no problems there.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty shoddy.  I used it for two months and it no longer works.  The motor stopped working and the head attachments break easily during the cleaning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many other beard trimmers, and obviously over time they stop working, but this one takes the cake.  Very unreliable product.</li>
    <li> Very good product, however I previously owned 2 similar Remington trimmers that also included a mini, \\&quot;pop up\\&quot;, trimmer for hard to trim areas.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that for some reason.  Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Of the various razors I have used over the years to trim my beard, this is by far and away the best. It&#x27;s very well constructed, and the blades still cut like new after a few years&#x27; use. The trimmer attachment and the razor settings are both very easy to use/adjust.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a great trimmer at what it is meant for: trimming your beard/mustache.  I was very satisfied with the trim it delivered; it was easy to set the length and the setting stayed in place.  The blades seemed to be nice and sharp, it provided a smooth trim and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs or otherwise cause any discomfort.    The reason I am rating this 4 stars is because it can be a bit messy to use.  When using this trimmer, because there is no vacuum function the hairs literally go all over the bathroom sink and this can cause clogs if you just flush everything down the drain.  I actually have stopped using this and am using a competing product that contains a vacuum that sucks all cut hairs into a container for easy disposal in the trash.      Overall, this is still a very good product, I just can&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because I feel it could use the extra feature of a vacuum suction.  If you don&#x27;t need this feature, there&#x27;s no reason not to purchase this trimmer.</li>
    <li> At first, I was happy with this beard trimmer. About 6-8 months later, it fell on the floor and a plastic piece broke off. Now I have it all taped up with duct tape to make it work. Cheap crap.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  I really like the adjustable length rather than having to put on different heads.  Battery lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has been great for trimming my beard/mustache.  I like to keep it short, like the length it would be after not shaving for a few days, and this trimmer has an adjustment that is short enough for me (which many don&#x27;t).    The device works smoothly. It does not pull out any hairs, like some of my old trimmers, and the battery seems to last forever.  I charged once it when I bought it a few months ago, and it is still working.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a Christmas present for my son.  He has been using it since then and has no problems with it.  He says it works great every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after looking at various cheap trimmers and i have to say i am not dissapointed.  the charge lasts forever, the trimmer is lightweight and easy to grip.  It trims like it should, and the blades are self sharpening so no oiling necessary.  All in all im very happy with my purchase, i am only a teenager though so my facial hair is no that thick yet and it may not do well on thicker beards, but it works great for me. I would definately recommend this to anybody looking for an inexpensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> Whenever I want to use this pathetic trimmer, it is out of battery!!  Since I usually do not have time to wait for it to charge, it is pretty much useless!  I am getting rid of this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> My bathroom doesn&#x27;t have an outlet, but the local stores stopped carrying decent, inexpensive cordless beard trimmers, so I went with this one.  The value for the price is excellent and so far it&#x27;s held the charge well.    My only (minor) issues are that the curved shape can be awkward when doing a pass against the grain.  And It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut well if only the front edge is flush against the face - the back edge of the guard needs to touch also.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has great battery life. I have used it for over 30 minutes out of the box and have not yet needed to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in adjustable trimmer is a nice feature, but I don&#x27;t have a beard--I use it to trim my sideburns in between barber visits. However, I noticed that it is a bit difficult to adjust the wheel when my hands are damp. The rubberized wheel is great when your hands area dry, but impossible to adjust when damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power switch is also a bit difficult to use with damp hands. they should have added some bumps or ridges to the switch to make turning it on easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you&#x27;re using this without the trimming guide, the clippers are not flush with each other, so you may not be able to achieve razor-sharp trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a well-built trimmer, but it has a few flaws.</li>
    <li> Does everything it should, at a low price.  The only flaw is that the charging light on my trimmer does not display (I had the same problem with another Remington product).</li>
    <li> had the older model and didn&#x27;t want to give it up, but after nearly 10 years of use at least once a week the battery would hardly hold a charge, so I went for this one and I have enjoyed it thus far as it was exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through lots of these trimmers from various brands.  This is a good/solid one.  Working very well so far.</li>
    <li> 1: 1.5 mm / .06\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2: 2.5 mm / .10\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3: 4.0 mm / .16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4: 5.5 mm / .22\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;5: 7.0 mm / .28\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;6: 9.0 mm / .35\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;7: 11.0 mm / .43\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;8: 14.0 mm / .55\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;9: 18.0 mm / .71\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great and long lasting!</li>
    <li> Product started to not hold a charge about 14 months after purchase. Now at 20 months after purchase it dies before i can finish trimming my beard. This is unacceptable for a device that doesn&#x27;t even run when plugged in. I have lots of other rechargable items that last years and years before the batteries will no longer hold a charge.  I like the shaver but I am not going to buy one every 12-18 months. Amazon has no way of contacting Remmington through their website so that is irritating as well.</li>
    <li> Trimmer does a very good job. battery holds a charge a long time and is variable with regard to the trim depth. This is the second time I have purchased the same model. The previous one&#x27;s battery died, and it&#x27;s not replaceable so I liked it so much I replaced it with the identical model and type.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after dropping my previous one from a different brand.  The cheap plastic height modulator shattered and the only way to control the depth was to tape it in one place. Not very versatile, I must say.  So, I decided to purchase a sturdier-looking one, i.e. more klutz-proof.  I have been very happy with this product so far. The height wheel makes it exceedingly easy to switch how close you want to trim, and it&#x27;s all very solid.  Others have mentioned that there is no charging stand, but that is a plus for me as those things can topple over anyway.  Or at least they seem to if I get within a yard of them.  I much prefer to lie it down where it can&#x27;t fall.  It&#x27;s also very, very easy to clean.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.  For the money, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  Here&#x27;s to happy trimming and looking good!</li>
    <li> awsome product i like the shaver and it is an really good product to shave with. very comforting and fast shipping item, cost effective</li>
    <li> Save your money and get something better.  This didn&#x27;t trim my beard at all.  I used it a few times and was not impressed.  Get something better instead of this garbage.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for over a year now.  My main use is to trim my mustache (where I use it without the cutting-length comb), however I also use it occasionally to shape and trim my beard (using the comb).  It works well and the battery lasts quite a long time between charges -- I think I have charged it twice since I received it.  The power switch and length dial work well, and it has a nice range of length settings available.  The only negative comment I would make is that it is louder than previous trimmers I have owned which may bother some folks, but that has not been a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give these a better review if it worked overseas and it had a lithium battery. The charge doesnt last long and i need to use a travel transformer when I travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my father had one for a while and said it worked well. Guess what - it does. I wanted something rechargeable, simple, that could give me a &#x27;stubble&#x27; look. The product works great - just set it to the lowest setting and voila, take off the plastic head cover for an even closer detailing. The battery life is fantastic - charged it when I got it, have been using it maybe twice a week for a month now? Maybe more? Still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it. Cleaning is easy - shake it, pop open the top, and use the supplied brush to empty any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One design flaw - when you flip open the top to clean it, the top is only attached by a small plastic hinge. I have been careful and haven&#x27;t had any problems, but I can see that a bit too much force will snap it off. Be careful and you will be fine, but don&#x27;t let your kids play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: very good lightweigt rechargeable trimmer. Don&#x27;t bring it anywhere near water, but still cleanable. I even use it on other...areas of my body with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Had to knock it down a star for battery life. When you charge it, it definitely has enough juice to trim whatever you need to. But I&#x27;ve used it more infrequently as I shave more regularly, and when I do need to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed it has almost no charge after a few weeks in the closet.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what its made out to be. I purchased this trimmer for the price and the simplicity, so far it has meet all my expectations. It has a variety of different trimming lengths and the option to take of the guard for a closer shave. Although there are some reviews saying if you drop it, it will break, I have not found it to be so fragile.  If you are looking for something that will do the bare essentials for a great price, this is your bargain!</li>
    <li> My first time using a Remington Product and I&#x27;m very impressed.  I usually buy Norelco shavers and trimmers, but after a disappointing experience with the Norelco 4070 trimmer, I ended up getting this Remington for $14.77 at Amazon.  Knowing what I know now, even if it were $50, I would still buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m not an ergonomics engineer or anything, but this trimmer feels very good in your hands.  Sturdy, curved to fit your hand just right, and the shape makes it easy to get into the corners of your face that might be hard to reach with some trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;2) Charge last for a LONG LONG time.  Longer than I remember my Norelco&#x27;s lasting.&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not have a bin for the cut hairs, but makes as much mess as my Norelco&#x27;s did, which is to say, not that much.&lt;br /&gt;4) Price at $14.77 is excellent.  Seems as though the sale price has ended and it&#x27;s now $28.  I think $28 is still a bargain considering the newer Norelco&#x27;s are selling for $50+.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my old Remington PG-360 trimmer. I like how the adjustable guard is built in, yet still removable for easy cleaning without having to change the entire head (i.e.- different sized blades). The battery life is AWESOME! I bought this, charged it initially for 24 hours, and then used it 4-5 times over almost a month before it died. I used it to trim my beard and also my whole head, so one usage was maybe 5-7 minutes straight. It&#x27;s also great for deployed locations when you don&#x27;t have a barber and additionally to keep your \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; grooming standards from growing too wild. Overall, once again Remington produces a great product that is also fit for the AOR.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great!  It&#x27;s very impressive and it cuts and trims easily.  Holds a good charge too.  The only downside is that it is a little noisy but not horribly so. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. No attachments to worry about is one of the greater plusses for me. I just use it to trim my beard, nothing fancy. I just set it to 4, where it is securely locked in, and trim.</li>
    <li> The trimmer operates well. Does the job. But the battery is ni-cad and does not hold a charge well, which pretty much ruins an otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> charged this thing up, used it on a once, was going to use it again 3 days later and the battery was dead so I charged it up, it worked for maybe 5 mins and started dying after that it would not take a charge, it would work for maybe 2 minutes and die on me. Like the title says Dont buy, its a waste of money</li>
    <li> I had a Remington MB-30 that I bought back in the 90s, and it lasted so long and served me so well that I would not buy any other brand. I was afraid that they might have cheapened their products over the years, but I was pleasantly surprise by the improvements instead. It&#x27;s so MUCH quieter and has the same sturdy feel. In some ways, it feels even sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice improvement is that the middle teeth in the length guard (or whatever it&#x27;s called) are now flexible to fit the contour of your face. The outside edges of the guard are still stiff to keep the beard at the chosen length. This did make it hard for me to remove the guard at first until I learned to grab the other sides of the guard when removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;ll let you know if this one lasts 15 years like my old one did!</li>
    <li> As a trimmer its great, but after one year the battery holds a charge for about one or two uses, and you cannot use this corded, for whatever reason.  You cannot use it while the charger is plugged in.  Seems like a waste, as the product is more or less disposable because of this.</li>
    <li> This product has no pull and needs no oil just like they say.  The settings on the trimmer are fantastic as well.  You can extremely close if desired.  Overall great product.</li>
    <li> From the first use of the trimmer it would not hold a charge for more than a day or two. It was inconvenient but still useable.After becoming progressively worse it now refuses to hold a charge AT ALL. A shame, because the design of the unit is good, but in this day and age rechargeable batteries should not be such a problem. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco Beard Trimmers over the years...battery failed to recharge and I was forced to consider a replacement. Switched to the Remington MB-200 and was amazed at how wonderful this trimmer performs....it is sleek, has blades that never need to be lubed, and holds a good charge...completely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend over similar Norelco trimmers.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer after my Norelco died after three years of use, and this one is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Trims wells..  Fits the hand nicely.  Wish it would trim closer  so beard margin was sharper or more distinct.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great razor lasted about 2 years I bought another</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband he had a previous Remington and really liked it. This particular one does not hold a charge for long and doesn&#x27;t seem as durable.</li>
    <li> The battery does not hold a charge. You have to plug it in several hours before use to be able to use it. Cuts well - easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. Long lasting charge. Very sharp blades so be careful. Gets pretty close with out the guard on. A+</li>
    <li> so far works great but takes forever to charge and then the battery doesn&#x27;t last too long kind of a bummer since I run of solar at my house out in the sticks&lt;br /&gt;update after using this thing for less than 4 months I now have to charge it for 14 hours each time I shave just yet another piece of Chinese junk</li>
    <li> Worked fine when charged, but I had to charge after every use...Stopped holding a charge shortly after one year... I would not recommend this product or purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had exactly the same product for years with no complaints. When it quit working, I bought the same model, on April 28, 2015. This one, a few weeks back, began to have to be recharged almost daily. Evidently,it is defective, but by now, late June, it cannot be returned, and I got stuck with it!</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer. It feels good in your hand. I feel very confident using it, and it gives a consistent trim every time. This is my 2nd unit, as the battery died on the first one after 4 years. I would rather replace this unit every 4 years than use another brand. I ordered two different brands trimmers, and both were inferior. Forget about the negative battery reviews. This is the best sub $50 trimmer you will find.</li>
    <li> Worked great but the battery died after a year. Having said that this is the s second one I have owned and the last one lasted for four years.</li>
    <li> ok but nothing special. Wouldn&#x27;t work while cord plugged in.</li>
    <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t retain power for more than a week or two.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It really does help with grooming the beard. Really effective.</li>
    <li> Bought this for&lt;br /&gt;Christmas as a gift and my husband uses it every other day. He loves it. It is easy to use because he doesn&#x27;t  have to keep changing  the combs</li>
    <li> Performs as I had hoped it would. Awsome battery life, lots of height adjustments. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This thing is powered by old-school battery technology (I think it&#x27;s a Ni-Mh type battery).  After a couple of years, the batteries just don&#x27;t hold any charge.  The unit cuts well, and is easy to clean, but the battery life is just not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were going to buy another one of these (which I very well might be doing shortly), I would look for one that had a Li-Ion battery that lasted longer, had an option to plug directly into the wall outlet while in use, and/or took standard battery types.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re buying a depreciating asset that will eventually just be thrown away.</li>
    <li> Well, as far as \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; can be without any other perspective, because, again, this is the first time I have owned or used one.  And I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks at this point, but I love it.  Looks, feels, and works great so far.</li>
    <li> Had one for about a year, and my girlfriend broke the trimming head, which is admittedly attached with a very thin piece of plastic.  It should really be attached with a metal hinge, and that would give it 5 stars.  But it&#x27;s cheap, and cordless, and I like  it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a great design and is great for adjustable length trimming. However I bought it primarily to trim my neck line after a hair cut. Even after removing the length guard and using the blades directly on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Great item for price,works as advertised.Little small but works good.I would recommend to everybody.Side note is I am moving and have not found it yet,I need to find it soon.</li>
    <li> This trimmer&#x27;s battery life is awesome. I have used it between 7-8 trims for almost 12 mins per trimming and this is awesome.  Nice to hold and works really cool.</li>
    <li> As compared with price, I am satisfied with this product.Its size,charging,work,capacity will not disappoint you.My decsion to buy this ,product for my newly grown beard ,based upon the comments,I hope other guys who are thinking about having a beard ,will be benefited by these words.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but after having my trimmer stolen out of my luggage I needed something to maintain my beard and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. The price is cheap but the trimmer is awesome! I used it quite a few times right out of the packaging without initially charging it, and the battery life is excellent so far. I&#x27;ve had the trimmer about 2 months now, and I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Have the beard trimmer for a month or so.  Holds charge; comfortable and easy to use; trims beard to desired level and accurately cuts lower edge of mustache.  Might be better if the housing and guard were metal, so don&#x27;t throw it against the wall.  Good price.</li>
    <li> When I got this trimmer I was enthusiastic.  For as long as I had been  trimming my beard I had mostly used another remimgton unit (small  silver remimgton with several heads and a base that you can stick a  charger through).  My older trimmer would give me uneven cuts and  wouldn&#x27;t cut short enough.  When I saw reviews for this, I figured I  would give it a shot.  After I charged the unit I was shocked to see  that this guy trimmed my beard fantastically.  Although, I still need  to do some supplemental work around the beard line, this was easily  the best trimmer I had ever used.  However, there are two things about  this model that I do not like: Cleanup and Battery.  You cannot clean  this unit with water, you have to brush loose hairs out or blow them  out.  This unit lets you flip open the blades to remove hairs that  have accumulated under the blades.  The problem is that under the  blades resides a gunk that allows the components to move easily.  I  wasn&#x27;t sure what to do- wipe off the gunk or blow away as much as  possible.  Whichever the case, the inside of the trimmer will always  have stray hairs in it.  My second and most important gripe is the battery.  Mine can no longer hold a charge after only two months.  I am not sure why you cannot plug and use this trimmer but it doesnt charge when the power is on.  This is a problem I had with my older trimmer and a few others- why can&#x27;t you charge and use?  Overall, this was a good trimmer while it was able to keep a charge(2 months).  I&#x27;m not sure what my options are.  I know I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon- maybe I can get a replacement battery.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old Philips Norelco T980 and happened on this. The T980 was overall a very good trimmer despite a few minor flaws.  Considering how inexpensive the MB-200 is, you would expect to get a low quality trimmer with few features. Remington succeeded in making a very good trimmer that is devoid of several features of more expensive models, which is fine if you don&#x27;t need that kind of stuff anyway.  Pros:   - Size is just right and it fits well in the hand. This may seem like kind of a strange criteria, but I thought the T980 was a bit large. The MB-200 is smaller and contours to the shape of your hand.   - Wheel-clicks adjust the height of the clipper, meaning you don&#x27;t have to change anything out for different heights. This is really convenient and the height of the clipper seems quite sturdy regardless of how high it is. There are also 9 different length settings.    - Very easy to use and relatively quiet.  Cons:   - The hair. This can be quite messy - it lacks any sort of chamber or vacuum to catch stray hairs, so be prepared for a mess.   - Long charge time.  Overall, you can&#x27;t complain for the price and the quality of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought it for myself and then I got alopecia, a condition that makes all your hair fall out. Needless to say I do not need it now. Gave it to my brother. He ended up getting a job as an IT administrator for a very large company with a 6 figure income. My understanding of this product of this product is whoever buys it will loose all there hair. Whoever its gifted to will become rich. So make sure to put this on your Christmas Gift list!</li>
    <li> This unit is simply the best simple electric shaver out there for the price. My first one finally broke after several years of excellent use &amp; I knew that I would just buy it again. My hair is a constantly evolving canvas, so I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of facial hair styles over the years &amp; this shaver can do them all. It&#x27;s great for lining up &amp; trimming beards, goatees &amp; hairlines and can even handle simple hair cuts when in a pinch. It will even shave reasonably close to the skin if you don&#x27;t need a super close shaven look. No electric trimmer is going to give you a shave as close as a plain ol&#x27; blade, but it works reasonably well for what it is &amp; what I want. The adjustable height levels work well, the mechanism is long-term sturdy &amp; the entire device is easy to clean. It holds charge well, so I never really have to worry about bringing the charger when travelling for less than a few weeks. Basically, it&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product is warranted  for two years.  Two years and 9 days later the trimmer died.  It is too inexpensive to return.  Just be aware.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 3 months now and it was what I was looking for. A nice beard trimmer to cut close to the skin so I can actually use my razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realise that the charger would be American, but I bought a cheap adapter and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good when new. Battery lasted for a little over a year. Now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. This thing is excellent. Nice clean setup, charges easy. It has the look and feel of a much more expensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> Originally bought July 15, 2012. Up until a few months ago, the battery would last a while but recently became that it would need to be charged constantly until right before use. That was until today. Today it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;However, the entire time it had a charge I got good trims, and will in fact highly consider getting another. Nice weight in hand, powerful - the only consideration I have is this incident has caused me to consider getting one that works on A/C. This only charges, so when the battery goes down it becomes unusable. If it wasn&#x27;t for this, I would have bought another months ago.</li>
    <li> The Remington MB-200 is as excellent a trimmer as reviewers state. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t world class friendly. In fact it&#x27;s the only gadget I&#x27;ve purchased in years that is 120 volts only. This is surprising given that a trimmer would be a common travel item.</li>
    <li> Love it, battery life could do better but it works for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;Always make sure to charge the night before using it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer but don&#x27;t forget to charge - the power supply only charges the battery, it doesn&#x27;t power the razor. So if your battery runs down you can&#x27;t use the razor even when it&#x27;s plugged into the wall. Otherwise I&#x27;d give it five stars</li>
    <li> after about a year the battery dies and the trimmer can&#x27;t be used while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Wasteful disposable item.</li>
    <li> I WASN&#x27;T REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS MUSTACHE &amp; BEARD TRIMMER.  FIRST IT&#x27;S TOO BULKY. SECOND, IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T DO A GOOD JOB WITH SHAVEN ALL YOUR HAIR OFF. WHAT&#x27;S THE POINT OF HAVING A SHAVER, THAT DOESN&#x27;T DO WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO... I&#x27;VE ALREADY HAD 2 REPLACE IT. I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS OR BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Bought this item in Aug 2012. Battery won&#x27;t recharge in September 2013. Not cool that I have to SOLDER in replacement battery. Haven&#x27;t done any soldering since I built my last Heathkit in the 1950&#x27;s.  Won&#x27;t buy another of this brand/model.</li>
    <li> After using this trimmer once a week for five years the battery has died.  It&#x27;s obvious that it would die but there&#x27;s no way to replace the battery.  Remington should make the battery easier to change or at least allow this trimmer to work while hooked up to power.  Useless now.</li>
    <li> Search the reviews on \\&quot;battery\\&quot;. After less than two years, mine will only run a few seconds on battery and doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in. Since the batteries aren&#x27;t replaceable, it&#x27;s totally useless. However good the trimmer itself is (and it&#x27;s pretty good), the horrible battery is a deal-breaker. Avoid.</li>
    <li> This is a long lasting durable trimmer. It is easy to set, has nice selection of heads, and does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this beard trimmer I checked out many of the other reviews on Amazon. The majority of the reviewers felt as I do that this beard trimmer was a four or five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to charge, and it holds a charge for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer was also very easy to use, especially the adjustments and trimmed my beard quickly and properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...This product does what it claims.</li>
    <li> My biggest problem with this trimmer is the battery / battery life. I&#x27;m on my second one now, and, I&#x27;ve owned the one I have now for right at one year on the nose (I purchased off Amazon May 2014. After about 6 months, the battery gets to where it won&#x27;t hold a charge. If I plan on using this thing, I have to charge it all night long, then take it off the charger and IMMEDIATELY begin using it. If I take it off the charger, then, use the razor 10 minutes later, it&#x27;s dead. The first one was like that too. The only reason I bought a second one is that I love how it trims with the guards. It&#x27;s the only beard mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve owned that will get right up to my nose below my lip WITH the guard on. Others I&#x27;ve owned - the guard is too thick or something and it won&#x27;t reach the hair between my upper lip and nose. I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;ll buy a third one because of this battery garbage, but , well ... there you have it.</li>
    <li> Balls and beards my friends, balls and beards.</li>
    <li> My face and under carriage have never been smoother in my life.</li>
    <li> After less than 8 months the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Bought this as a replacement for the same brand and model that lasted 4 years.</li>
    <li> I recently had to grow a beard for a part in the play, Little Women. I need a full beard consistent with the 1860s period in which the play takes place.  Since I play a distinguished gentleman, the beard had to be neatly trimmed.  Rather than spend money on a barber or hair dresser, I decided to purchase an electric trimmer, which cost only as much as a single visit to a barber.  I found it easy to use and wholly effective in giving my beard and mustache a well-tailored look, fully suited to the role. It will serve me for years to come, and was clearly a great investment.</li>
    <li> At the price of the Remington MB-200, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong.  It works great, the preset trim gauge works like a charm.  Holds a charge for many weeks and cuts with out pulling.  Can&#x27;t do much better than that for under $15!  It fits nicely in the hand, so makes trimming very easy.  I use it once every 7 to 10 days and I have to admit I look marvelous!</li>
    <li> PowerfuL and really easy to use..  It has multiple settings that stay in place even with applied pressure.  Works great for my haircut and trimming my beard.  There is not a docking station just a simple plug.  Not a big deal but if you keep it out on your counter it could look sloppy.</li>
    <li> I owned the Remington MB-300 for a long time and loved it. When I needed to replace it, the MB-300 was nowhere to be found. Remington&#x27;s site is confusing in that it advertises products you don&#x27;t see at retailers and conversely it doesn&#x27;t give information about products it makes that do exist at retailers.  I found this model as a replacement, and except for being black, it is identical in appearance to the MB-300. The only difference I can tell between the two is that this one will not work unless the battery is charged (that is you cannot run it off of AC power). The problem with this is that the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long, and I frequently forget to plug it in, and it takes a long time to charge--so if you needed to trim before heading out the door and forgot to leave this plugged in, you&#x27;re out of luck.  I wrote Remington an e-mail with a suggestion that they bring back the MB-300 model back in October 2011, but they never responded. If I were buying one again, I would make sure the model works when plugged in.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the mostly positive reviews here after my old Norelco trimmer died (which I was a huge fan of), and much to my chagrin, it just died on me a few minutes ago, after about 2 months of use. It wasn&#x27;t even that good of a trim anyways, I had to go over the same spots constantly; this was never a problem with my previous trimmer. I just ordered a new trimmer, hopefully it&#x27;ll last longer than a pitiful two months.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm the battery has a long life, it is adjustable to your needs and very easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> This is my second trimmer from Remington.  The first one lasted several years, using it at least twice a week.  This one seems even better!  Highly recommend it!  My only complaint is that I wish it would shut itself off when fully charged.</li>
    <li> I got this for Cheap i&#x27;m not a fan pf shaving but this worked really great gets close but not to close i would say this is a really great buy its cheap but awsomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</li>
    <li> A critical flaw with this unit is the battery charging interface. Ever since I got this device, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long while not in use, and the device will not run off the wall current (the battery has to be charged). I have to keep it plugged in all the time, which has become impossible since my wife got an electric toothbrush. It takes multiple hours to get enough of a charge for a full trim. My former review of this item was favorable, as I like the design and built in/removable length guide; but the inability of this device to run off a wall current is forcing me to buy a new device.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the price ($14.77). The guard is seemingly fixed onto the razor, so the shave is not razor-close. Shaves down pretty close on the shortest setting and the fixed guard saves the skin from nicks and pulls. The longer setting works great for sideburns as well.</li>
    <li> I used the trimmer for 3 weeks and was fine but it suddenly stopped working. I recharged it for 3 days but still it does not turn on. I am not sure if the quality is like how they mention on their website. I had high regard for remington and their technology, but i did not have great experience with it.</li>
    <li> I have not owned this trimmer for long and it is my first, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  Having said that, it does the job well of trimming my beard.  It has a number of length settings and can also be used to define the border of the beard by removing the trimmer head.  All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the low price (assuming it does not break).  Update:  The battery didn&#x27;t last long and after~1.5 years couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> Been purchasing these for years. I do haircut/beard trim with it...so It wears out after a year. For the price, can&#x27;t beat it. Simple to use and effective. Shipping excellent.</li>
    <li> Great looking clippers.  cuts well.  fits great in hand.  too bad the rechargable battery dies every couple of weeks.  Very annoying.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well, but it cannot take power directly from the outlet. Meaning if you forgot to plug it in and you need to use it in the morning, you are out of luck. It takes about 20 minutes before it will have a single minute of charge. Also, the battery only seems to last me about 2 uses before it needs to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the battery used in this is a type that suffers from &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues.  If you just keep it plugged in all the time, the battery will quickly become unchargable, and since it can&#x27;t work directly off the power adaptor--you will end up without a working trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that is to be expected at this price point. All in all, I would buy it again. It&#x27;s a no frills tool that does what it is meant to do, and does it well. There is no pulling feeling at all after years of using it.</li>
    <li> Lasted years. Just ordered another. Does a very good job!</li>
    <li> I had the old model and I liked it a lot better.  This one is not as well made and I miss the mini razor for trimming my mustache.</li>
    <li> Precision definition of hair/stubble length desired. Easy cleaning and holds charge for at least 25 uses. Also, after 3 months looks like it is going to be maintenance free.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer that is easy to clean and gives great levels of trimming length.    Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. It is fantastic. Doesnt pull the hair out, nice smooth trim. And not having to take on and off attachments is a huge plus.   Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> This trimmer lasted me all of 3 minutes before i was done with it. It could barely cut my rough facial hair even if i ran it over the same spot 20 times. The blades are simply too dull to be of any use for me. I&#x27;d advise against picking this up.</li>
    <li> The trim wheel adjuster broke and would not adjust the trimmer. I took it apart and found that it snapped at the connection between the wheel and the trimmer head and now it is useless to me. Also the battery was only good for 2 1/2 uses max. I Purchased the MB4040 back in Feb 2013 and wow what a difference. Better build and battery lasts forever. Don&#x27;t wast your time and money on this unit and go for the MB4040.</li>
    <li> The battery on this lasts really long. You don&#x27;t have to charge very often like my old one. I recommend this to all men.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-Chargers Quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Does its job well with easy guard adjustment wheel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Impossible to shave flush because the guard cannot be removed,&lt;br /&gt; do not buy this if you are trying to do any detailing.</li>
    <li> easy to set height of blade/ holds a charge for a good peried of time/ I like the #3 setting</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer for my husband because he needed to do some much needed manscaping. I wasn&#x27;t even sure he would use it, but lo and behold not only did he use it, he loved it and has continued to use it with regularity. Yippy!! It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works good but not for long.  You get about 5 minutes to trim and then you have to recharge for 4-8 hours.  Not ideal... Wish I&#x27;d read reviews more closely.  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> you can not directly plug it and use it. you have to let it charge for an hour!&lt;br /&gt;built quality is okaish. very frustrated and disappointing :(</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve had so far. Have tried 2 other ones and they dont compare to this by remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels great in the hand and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and krappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it cuts very well and smoothly, easy to clean, and you only have 1 piece so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing pieces and having to switch pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you&#x27;re looking for a beard trimmer this is the best one out for the price.</li>
    <li> Updated review:  Works great until the battery stops holding a charge, which for me happened about 2 months after the warrantee expired.</li>
    <li> I bought this MB-200 to replace a previous one I had that broke when I dropped it.  The original unit was great and very reliable.  The difference between that one and the more recent version I purchased is that the newer one does not hold a charge to save its life.  I charge it for hours, unplug it at night and it is dead before I get a chance to use it the next day.  You essentially need to use it right after you unplug it.  On top of that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the initial one, or perhaps that is a function of the craptastic battery.  Regardless, avoid this model as I am sure there are other brands/models that can do much more for not much more $.</li>
    <li> Something happened with this trimmer and after only 3 uses it will not turn on.  A piece of junk, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Holds a powered charge for a nice daily cut.  A great purchase for facial hair control.  That is a nice price for a great item with all the attachments I need for a fresh look.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND ONE BECAUSE AFTER FIVE YEAR THE RECHARGABLE BATTERY GAVE OUT ON THE FIRST ONE.SO I WOULD BUY ANOTHER WHEN THIS BATTERY DIES HOPEFULLY THERE STILL AVAILABLE .</li>
    <li> Well thought out design that is easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers in the past and I prefer this one to all of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in October.  This product worked fine until a few weeks ago.  Now, the battery delivers normal power for, literally, about 10 seconds.  It continues to function at about 10 percent of the normal speed.  I can still use it but... I&#x27;m gonna have to buy a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for myself and one for my brother. We both still use this trimmer. The trimmer itself is quite easy to use, the adjustable height on the head is quite a nice feature and I always use it when trimming my beard. I also use the trimmer with the attachment to shorten the length of my beard if I haven&#x27;t shaved or trimmed in a week, so that my razor blade doesn&#x27;t dull too quickly. The battery last a very long time, I don&#x27;t charge this thing for a month and it still runs fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was that the plastic swivel part for the removable blades broke, but it still stays in place and works great. I would definitely buy again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Works well enough but the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge longer than a day. Serious corner cutting on battery quality. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend just because of this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap trimmer for my beard, which I usually keep pretty short.  I bought this without seeing it in a store.  I think I had seen that it had good reviews here, and it was under thirty bucks, which I figured was a good limit for something that is only going to last so long.  I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy.  I got exactly what I was looking for, but I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.  There aren&#x27;t any parts that seem like they&#x27;ll fall apart, and it&#x27;s got a great feel in the hand.  I like the action on it a lot.  My first trim was immediately better and much quicker then the previous trimmer I had (which had died on me).  I think this is a great deal for someone who needs an occasional shave of a beard.  I really like it.  Nothing fancy but it gets the job done very well.  I can&#x27;t think of how it would be better.</li>
    <li> This appears to be an updated version of a Remington trimmer that served well for many years.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a months use, I can report that the stability of the trim length setting has been improved, and the trimmer blades no longer require lubrication.  The quality of the beard trim is also improved, allowing for rapid trimming.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If this new trimmer is as durable as my first, I will more that satisfied.</li>
    <li> the machine is sturdy, the battery life is incredible.  excellent quality!</li>
    <li> My beard is like a wire brush and shaving is like... well shaving a wire brush. Thus far I couldn&#x27;t be happier I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer, yet the #3 setting on it leaves my beard longer than I like &amp; the #2 setting leaves it to short. Other than that this is a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> very bad quality of battery it gone down don&#x27;t charge after one month of use only save ur money better</li>
    <li> The trimmer would not take a charge. I contacted Remington and they sent me a replacement charger and cord, and a return prepaid shipping label, if needed. New cord and charger arrived; unit would still not charge. Have returned unit for replacement. Was told to expect its arrival in about a week. Waiting.</li>
    <li> After heart surgery I&#x27;ve decided to let my beard grow and this trimmer works great. I was concerned about getting trimmed too closely and perhaps getting nicked. Taking blood thinners can make getting nicked a real problem so was delighted that this trimmer allows us amateurs to work well and safely. Another triumph for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have owned several trimmers.  This might be my last one.  The unit still holds a charge for a very long time.  The blades are staying really sharp.  No cases of hairs being pulled out instead of cut.  The depth gauge is pretty basic, but it has worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to take the depth gauge off and use it like a clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good unit and a good price.  After two years of use I can definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome and does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are a little far apart which is good for trimming thick hair or a lot of hair, probably could be used on your head, but without the guard you could nick yourself if you&#x27;re not careful. I wanted a trimmer with as few of parts as possible and this is it! on guard with 9 settings. On the lowest setting you can trim a beard down to the &amp;#34;stubble look.&amp;#34;  It also works great as a body trimmer too, but like i said without the guard just be very careful depending on which parts you&#x27;re trimming.  On a full charge it seems to have a lot of power and if I&#x27;m just trimming my face a full charge last at least 4 uses maybe more. Definitely would recommend if your needs are the same as mine. Powerful, few parts, decent charge, multiple length settings</li>
    <li> As far as functionality goes this thing does exactly what you&#x27;d expect. My only gripe with it is the power/battery system. The product description says that it&#x27;s \\&quot;corded/cordless\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t true. If the battery is dead you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge, you CAN&#x27;T use it off of AC power. I was usually able to get 1-2 trims per charge, and if you let it sit too long the battery drains. On the other hand, leaving it plugged in all the time also seems to kill the battery life, it will barely do 1 trim on a full charge these days. For the price though it&#x27;s probably a good deal - I bought it 2 years ago and it finally bit the dust today, even after charging all night it can barely move the blades.</li>
    <li> Worked great when I first bought it.  Now I have to charge it right before I use it (It will lose battery power within one day- Even if you don&#x27;t use it).  And when it&#x27;s plugged in you still have to wait for the battery to have a full charge before you can use it (ie. you cannot use it as a plug in type trimmer).</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimer but, If you like a short beard when they say #1 setting  is short they mean it.</li>
    <li> USED IT APPROX. 120 TIMES AND IT SEEMED TO WORK WELL. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE. NOW WHEN I TRY TO USE IT, IT ONLY WORKS FOR 30 SECONDS OR SO BEFORE IT RUNS DOWN. I CONCLUDE TAHT THE BATTERY IS NOT GOOD, AND YET, IT;S NOT THAT OLD. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RICHARD B.</li>
    <li> Like many people on here, the product just stopped working one day.  I&#x27;ve had it for maybe 2 years, but only use it ~1x per month.  It no longer charges or runs.  I got maybe 20 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> this trimmer is great precise&lt;br /&gt;and i will sure recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and handle and the battery last for weeks.</li>
    <li> After less than a year of use, I have experienced the weak battery claims that other users report, and I just tried to move the head back to clean it, and it broke off and the trimmer is no longer usable.  Very poorly designed.</li>
    <li> I didnt think that paying for a good shaver would ever be worth it after using a super cheap one for a couple years. I thought it did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. This thing is super easy to use, sleek, and literally gets my gotee touched up within about 20 seconds. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and dont think I&#x27;ve plugged it in since its&#x27; initial charge.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of garbage for two very specific, and complementary, reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the battery dies after two or three days of sitting (fully charged) if it&#x27;s not plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;2) it does NOT OPERATE ON AC FROM THE OUTLET unless the battery is charged. This means that after it&#x27;s discharged, you must wait for it to recharge before using it again. I want to jam this things non-functional blades into the throat of every neckbeard that was responsible for saying \\&quot;yep, seems fine.\\&quot; during the approval process. simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer would chuckle at you, if it could hold a charge, while you are forced to leave the house with a half-trimmed whatever it is that is on your face.</li>
    <li> For the price of $25.00 when I bought it, this is definitely a great product. I love that the trimmer can adjust to 9 different trimming lengths with just 1 comb instead of multiple attachments that takes time to replace, takes up space to pack and can possibly get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer claims to have self-sharpening blades but I haven&#x27;t owned this product long enough to validate this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is rechargeable through a provided AC adapter. It does come with its own LED charging indicator, however NOTE that the LED will only tell you that the unit is charging; it will not tell you when the charge is complete. The charging indicator is simply what it is, a light to tell you that the unit is indeed charging, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer DOES run while it is being charged but I do not know if this means that it is indeed running while charging simultaneously. I will have to drain the battery one day and test this out for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance of the trimmer. It does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. My beard is nicely trimmed. The unit is very sturdy since I do apply a fair amount of pressure when I trim and not once has the comb slipped down to its shorter length settings. I don&#x27;t have very thick facial hair so therefore the trimmer cuts nicely. I do not know if it is powerful enough to handle people with very thick facial/body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does work as a body trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> Bought it in July 2015. It&#x27;s already broken. It won&#x27;t adjust anymore. I just threw it in garbage.</li>
    <li> NIce trimmer, works great, trims fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not run off wall power.  If the battery is dead, you have to wait for it to charge, and when the battery eventually quits, it&#x27;ll be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer height adjustment is positioned where a power switch would normally be.</li>
    <li> Husband picked this out and so far he&#x27;s happy with it.  The price was right and the product hasn&#x27;t failed him.  He&#x27;s been using it just under a month now.</li>
    <li> uneven results,didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
    <li> use it to keep bard trimmed and neat, the guard can scratch me sometinme, when i am hurrying. very fairly priced,but goys&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Perfect and even trim each time</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for a long time now. I have been very pleased with this trimmer, it is perfect for me. I like a nice close trim and this really does the job, but if you like leaving a bit more there, you can simply adjust the setting.</li>
    <li> this product is very reliable in terms of longevity and also great trim.... have bought it for myself and friends over and over again....and i always heard compliments about this product from many people...go for it!</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is well designed, easy to use, and effective. However, it uses outdated Ni-Cd battery technology that is prone to issues like memory effect. After about a year of use, I now have to charge it all day for about 2-3 min. of battery life (even though I have been using up the whole battery before recharging it). I would recommend instead purchasing a trimmer with a Ni-MH or Li-Ion to avoid this issue.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a bit more plastic on it than I would like, and the attachments don&#x27;t go as long as I would like (my beard can be 1-2&amp;#34; sometimes), but I knew that when I bought it, so it&#x27;s not a fault of the product. It holds a charge for a while but if you go away on vacation and come back, it won&#x27;t be fully charged so throw it on charge again before using. I don&#x27;t think you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in which seems kind of stupid to me, but in the end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, it still holds a charge just fine and it works well.</li>
    <li> I used this item about 6 or 8 times and was initially quite pleased with it. However, I discovered there is a little plastic piece that moves the trimming head up and down and it broke. I took it apart and sure enough the little plastic piece was sheered off and it was totally useless. I don&#x27;t know how this happened...I did not drop it or mishandle it in anyway. Just cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with saying I liked this trimmer AT FIRST. It worked well, didn&#x27;t need frequent charging, and it did a nice job of trimming. However, in less than a year of regular use, the trimmer began misbehaving. It needed charging more frequently, and then I had to run it with it plugged in, and then it wouldn&#x27;t even run while it was plugged in! When I reached out to Remington about filing a warranty claim, I never heard so much as a peep back from them. Spend a little more money on a better quality trimmer, and probably avoid Remington (or hope you don&#x27;t have to try to contact them).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years and it just recently broke because I dropped it on the floor,  so I&#x27;ll be ordering a duplicate.  this thing is great and holds a charge for a really long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer, with absolutely stellar results, for over three years now, maybe four. Have loved it without any reservations or caveats. It should be a five-star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lost a star because any rechargeable battery should be expected to die out eventually, and mine finally has. Now I find out that the batteries are soldered in, which is going to make replacing them a MUCH harder job. The trimmer is in perfect, like-new shape, and will probably last at least 10 years if I can figure out how to replace the batteries. Great product, shame they made this one lousy decision.</li>
    <li> The unit worked great for 18 months and then the battery could no longer hold a charge.  The battery cannot be changed.  I would have preferred to pay more for a unit with better designed battery circuity vs cheap circuitry.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this particular trimmer. I looked in all stores for it and could not find. Then I said if it&#x27;s available at all, Amazon will have it. There it was.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very high quality, especially for the price, however even the first setting is too long for a short beard.  I take off the attachment and go right to my skin with the buzzer, which is fine, but this thing is more of a head trimmer than a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer, works very well on my sideburns and beard. Ive been using it for about a year now and the only downside ive ever seen is the battery charge wears down quite fast if you dont keep it plugged in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame we live in a world where gadgets and gimmicks rule supreme over quality and simplicity. This razor is as straight forward as it gets. Its blades are sharp and the guide is dependable. It looks like they had to drop the price dramatically; most likely due to the supreme need for more and more and more choices, instead of quality items. If you are looking for simplicity of design, ease of use, and quality of craftsmanship, then this is the best choice.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk.  I guess it does the job but that&#x27;s only if it can hold a charge.  The battery does not last long at all, drains quickly, you have to re-charge almost all day everyday if you want to use it, it does not work while plugged in like other trimmers do, and the size increments are too big, should have more options.</li>
    <li> Good item but I&#x27;m disappointed that Remington changed it. This trimmer used to have a smaller detailing trimmer head that popped out on the underside for fine tuning for this same (or very close) price point. Now I see the one that has that feature is $100 for some reason. I will be pulling the mini trimmer head from my old pair and hooking it up to these to make this the product it once was and should still be.</li>
    <li> Battery is extremely erratic. Didnt lass more than a few months. Now basically dies off after one or two days of use.</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned and I still love it. Yes, it won&#x27;t last forever - but will any of them?  Has tons of length options and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it is the same (a bit of an updated version) as my old trimmer and that way I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the clip lengths being different than what I was already used to. The first time I used the product, the top popped off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Amazon replaced it for me and the second one has been working well for a couple of months now. Maybe I just got a lemon with the first one...</li>
    <li> This is not a piece of junk as some are. Well made and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Very well made hold charge well trimmer works awesome has all different levels  so u can&#x27;t never cut to much or to little  and it very well made</li>
    <li> Battery died after 11/2 years and will not hold a charge!</li>
    <li> Have used the product for a few weeks now &amp; I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  Believe I had a Norelco previously which also did a good job but I don&#x27;t have any complaints w/ the MB-200.  Looks good, handles well, does a good job trimming,  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is decent at trimming, but every time I want to use it the battery is dead... and it takes at least 1 or 2 hours charging to be useable. So basically it&#x27;s never ready when I want to use it. Once it&#x27;s charged, it will only last a day or two. I will look for a replacement with a lithium battery next time.</li>
    <li> speedy delivery, very good product!</li>
    <li> I should say that this replaced the model before the one I just purchased. The trimmer is very simple. It dials up and down for certain beard lengths. It  also is designed to go with the direction of the growth of the hair. This almost makes it foolproof. It also is very good at blending the hair especially at the base of my neck. It is also ergonomically good and that&#x27;s important if you are trimming your own hair. The charging of this unit is such that you can&#x27;t overcharge it. I think I had the original version of this trimmer for 17 years and a few weeks ago it just wouldn&#x27;t charge/run anymore. What this accomplishes is that your trimmer is always completely charged and cuts optimally. A lot of rechargeable trimmers require that you let them discharge and then you may have to recharge for 10 hours or more. Some call for not letting them discharge completely or it causes the batteries to wear out faster. The trimmer is very easy on the face when trimming your beard. You don&#x27;t have to snap on and off the combs some models require for different beard lengths and this eliminates the possibility of breaking the combs. I&#x27;ve dropped these combs in the past and broken some of the teeth or the edge which holds the comb in place. To sum it up, simpler is better and I think I actually purchase this unit for less than the original one. It also has plenty of power. I paid $40 for a unit from a major brand name and it isn&#x27;t half as powerful as this one. I was happy to see that Remington was still supplying this model.</li>
    <li> So the first MB-200 I bought had the batteries go bad in a little over 1 year.  I thought maybe it was me or I just got a bad one. I did like the razor so I ordered another one.  These batteries also went bad after 1 year.  My wife&#x27;s Panasonic razor is still going strong after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled the old razor apart and soldered in a pair of decent rechargeable AA batteries and these are still going strong.  Remington uses a very poor rated battery which, obviously, does not last. This is my last Remington!!</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this trimmer, I owned the same rechargeable Remington beard/mustache trimmer for 10-years.  I had no problems with it until the final year of its long and illustrious life.  I purchased this MB-200 trimmer expecting the same positive experience.  However, this trimmer only lasted one year and 5 disappointing months.  After about 6-months, the rechargeable battery life began to decline rapidly. I had to charge it overnight and then use it immediately the next day.  If I let it sit for even a day without charging, it would only work for 30-60 seconds before dying.  That wasn&#x27;t ideal for home use and it made it mostly worthless for travel, but I learned to live with it.  Then more recently the gears that control the adjustable guide broke, making the device worthless for trimming one&#x27;s beard at any given length - charged or not.  I had to throw it out.  I would add that I probably only used the trimmer 1-2 times per week, and sometimes not for a couple weeks at a time during its lifetime.  I don&#x27;t think it died from overuse.  I will be purchasing another, better made brand for my next trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchasing experience! Very satisfied with both the shipping service and quality of product.</li>
    <li> Junk.  Won&#x27;t even hold a charge long enough to get thru a single trimming.  And when the battery runs down, simply plugging in the charger provides insufficient juice to run it.  Essentially, you need not only a fully charged battery, but it also must be plugged in.  Forget traveling with it unless you want to bring the charger, too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. I have to keep it plugged in. Soon as you unplug it discharges. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have it plugged for days.</li>
    <li> When my husband&#x27;s beard trimmer died, I researched Amazon for a better product.  I lucked out this time and got him the Remington MB-200 that he loves!  It does a really nice job of keeping his goatee and mustache trimmed and neat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 4 months and fully trimmed my beard 3 times.  Now when I use the trimmer, it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 seconds, according to my stopwatch.  I&#x27;ve completed remove any blockage of hair like the directions say to.  I&#x27;ve let the charge run fully out and recharged it for the full 16 hours, and nothing seems to get it to last more than 30 seconds.  It was a really good trimmer the first few times, now I feel like the $29 I spent on it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is wonderful. Nice even cut, nicely adjustable length guard (for those w/ relatively short beards) that is removable to do edging easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the battery is pretty awful. It rarely lasts more than 2 trims (I average 2 trims a week) and there is ZERO indication that you&#x27;re running low. There is a small LED battery indicator, but it only serves to tell you that the unit is charging when it&#x27;s plugged in... as if you didn&#x27;t already know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it cannot run off of wall power when plugged in, making it impossible to use if it has died. Very frustrating. I would suggest purchasing a different model with better power options.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;  1. It&#x27;s sharp.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Lots of settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Battery lasts a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Only works on battery - even when plugged in. So, if battery is dead, it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;  3. After a year, I have to keep it on the charger 100% for it to be usable - Battery drains even when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;  4. TERRIBLE PORTABILITY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: Buy a trimmer that has plug-in ability, because this one is garbage for portability anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll regret buying this thing if you choose to use it more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I used this beard trimmer as a shaver since I have sensitive skin. It shaves well except the battery poops out after about a year. I&#x27;ve gone through two of these now and each failed after about a year.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.....</li>
    <li> It trims well enough, but it is not cordless after a few months.  A day after charging it to full and then unplugging it, it only trims for about 20 seconds before dying.  If that&#x27;s fine with you, this is a good enough trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not just the worst electric razer I&#x27;ve ever purchased, it&#x27;s the worst electronic device I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and a serious contender for the worst purchase of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not enough that it only works from battey power and not directly from AC, they had to also give it terrible battey life. After a few months it takes about three charges to make it through a single shave. Worthless. It now lives in a landfill somewhere.</li>
    <li> This works great for awhile but when the batteries &#x27;wear out&#x27;, there is no easy way to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries SHOULD have been in a socket under a removable cover. I just spent a few hours trying&lt;br /&gt;to switch the batteries from one that I dropped and broke (do not drop these either!) to another unit&lt;br /&gt;that died. It&#x27;s no easy task and because of the time spent vs. the price of a new one -- everything went&lt;br /&gt;into the trash.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad trimmer as it goes, but the battery strength is very poor and it needs to be charged often. And the trimmer cannot be operated directly off of the power adapter, so if you forget to charge it, you are out of luck getting your beard trimmed that day. After a year or two of operation, it lasts about one or two trims before it needs to be charged again. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Worked well for two years for trimming my beard. It started to hold less and less of a charge, until eventually it would only work for a minute, even plugged in. Had to buy a replacement, and I went for the Wahl Peanut, which is powered directly from an outlet.</li>
    <li> The sales pitch and description far exceeds the abilities of this clipper. It definitely could use some more abilities to attain a higher level of trimming. Rather clunky in it it&#x27;s handling and most assuredly difficult to hold when the trim head is off and using strictly to trim the mustache cut above the upper lip. Does not hold enough of a charge to do more than one complete trimming which is very annoying to say the least. Again I bought the description hook line and sinker so it is on me but just letting everybody else know to save them from this misfit. Would definitely NOT buy again. Sorry but that is the real world.</li>
    <li> I miss the little hair holder from the older models. It works great but, my wife has to clean the bathroom of hairs after!</li>
    <li> Almost a year ago, I decided to actually endulge my wife&#x27;s request and for go the clean shaven look. My previous trimmer had broken and I was looking for something easy to use and didn&#x27;t have a lot of extra parts that would inevitably get lost. I have been using this trimmer for a few months now and I love it! Adjustment is very easy via a thumb wheel to trim at various lengths and the shape and weight of the unit makes it easy to manouver. The unit can be easily brushed clean or rinsed which is very convenient. I also like that the fact that the charger is not some clunky charging base that takes up my limited counter space, it is just a simple cord that plugs in to the base if the trimmer. All pieces and parts take up very little room under the sink or in the averaged sized medicine cabinet. The trimmer size also makes it great for traveling. But don&#x27;t take my work for it, give it a try yourself!</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is no bueno.  I had it for one month and the motor went out on the shaver.  I am currently in the process of sending it back to get a replacement.  Whatever you do don&#x27;t drop this razor, it is more delicate than a house of cards.  Purchase at your own risk.  Shame on Remington for pushing out such an inferior product.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time</li>
    <li> Trimmer will not hold a charge.</li>
    <li> Previous reviews are right on.  This trimmer is easy to use, light and quite adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my mustache and eyebrows on #4 setting with no high or low areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased one for my grandson.  He likes to grow a light beard every other week so this works perfect to keep the beard neatly trimmed.</li>
    <li> Love the trimmer when its running... but after 1 year the rechargeable battery holds VERY short charge... says it can be used as a corded trimmer... not true.  This trimmer does NOT work as corded trimmer.  If it could be used corded, it would be fantastic, but not much worse than losing charge half way through a trim.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in January and it began showing signs of problems in March.  Finally dying completely in April. Won&#x27;t charge, won&#x27;t run.  Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I had a previous older model for years and needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer.  Unlike many other trimmers out there, this one allows a really close trim.  Definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a year now and really like it until now. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and I actually ended up breaking the top when I dropped it but I guess that part was my fault. The bigger problem is the lack of charge. I&#x27;ve had this issue with Remington before and while the product worked well until now, I&#x27;m going to need to replace it. I guess a full year of usage isn&#x27;t bad but I image other products would last longer.</li>
    <li> The MB200 is a nice tool for trimming mustache and beard, but I discovered that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge and is only good for one or two uses before it has to be recharged. The older models that I had were much better at holding charges.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cheap, does a good job clipping longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very big for a mustache/beard trimmer. Battery lasts long enough for a full use but needs to be plugged in after each use. Battery drains when it&#x27;s not plugged in.</li>
    <li> nice handle and work really great, you can&#x27;t beat the price.. i try so many trimmer and by so far this is the best one i use</li>
    <li> Product is next to useless because of its incompetent battery. IF you plan to shave immediately after pulling the unit off its charging cord, you MIGHT be okay, if your shave totals less than 60-90 seconds.  Do not plan on taking the trimmer in an overnight bag, or any where without its charger. Without a constant charge, this trimmer will likely have a dead battery within a day or two. Furthermore, this trimmer will not run independently on AC. Once the battery is discharged the only way it will work again is to wait hours for the battery recharge. In my experience, this is a DO NOT BUY.  Would love to have my money back.</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold much charge, must have died very quickly. Also always cuts and draws blood when I use it.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product for anyone. The battery life is subpar at best; for example, I cannot utilize this product more than once on one charge. It is constantly dying mid-shave, thus I constantly must charge it. Because of this issue, I will likely never again buy another Remington product.</li>
    <li> Awful - it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. AND if you attach the AC adapter, it still doesn&#x27;t work. You can only wait overnight for it to fully charge. Yuk - worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> After unsuccessfully trying another brand (Wahl) beard trimmer I replaced it with this Remington. I should have known better as I had had a Remington for seven years and loved it! This trimmer is solidly built, not flimsy or &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34;. It feels good in the hand. The length guard, controlled by a number dial, stays where you put it for an even, neat trim. The stubble guards are plastic, but they are nice enough to held up for use and are the right lengths. No problem with it &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; on your beard. Easy to charge, although I wish it came with a charging stand. In an effort to keep this short... the bottom line is, for a bit more money than the inferior brand you can have a solid, precise, easy to use beard trimmer with many, many different trimming lengths to keep you looking your best with minimal effort. I would recommend this Remington for those guys with full beards that need trimming and o guys that want the three-day-growth look. It work great for both! Please remember, this is one person&#x27;s opinion and YMMV,</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I liked it a lot.  But after a month or so, I started noticing it losing it&#x27;s charge in the middle of shaving.  That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, except you cannot simply plug it in and finish the job.  It ONLY works when it has a charge!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it now, I have to charge it at least 4 hours BEFORE i plan to trim my beard.  And even then it only holds the charge for 2 minutes.  I could charge it for 24 hours, and I would still only get 2 minutes of use...  Which is really inconvenient when you end up using a comb and scissors to make your beard look half-way presentable after it dies halfway in, and you are trying to get ready for work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy a Remington product again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this puppy for a long time now, and it&#x27;s still going ..on. It&#x27;s lost a bit of oomph over the years, but it still gets the job done. It&#x27;s nothing special, neither amazing nor disappointing. It has the standard array of attachments, though I suspect, like most people, I really don&#x27;t use them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I can claim is that the plastic cutter guard broke right out of the gate. It&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
    <li> Not worthwhile broken within a week</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a worn out one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington does the job well, holds a charge forever, runs great, cuts cleanly and afficiently.</li>
    <li> These are decent trimmers.  The comb is a bit too coarse for my liking, but it basically just means I need to do an extra pass or two.  They get the job done, but they&#x27;re nothing special.  I&#x27;m a pretty low maintenance person, and these meet my needs.</li>
    <li> It has sharp blades, lot&#x27;s of settings and lightweight. But it has one flaw, that makes it a &amp;#34;Do not buy&amp;#34; and that is the battery. It is totally dependent on the battery and won&#x27;t run off plug power. When the battery dies then the trimmer is done. For me, it lasted 10 months, now it&#x27;s headed for the trash. I can&#x27;t see buying a trimmer every year, no matter how awesome it is.</li>
    <li> I loved it for the first year, but now it is unusable because the battery will not hold a charge. I must plug it in overnight to get any charge at all, and I&#x27;m barely able to finish in the morning before it grinds to a halt.</li>
    <li> I like to keep a bit of stubble going and was in the market for a new trimmer. My previous one, a Wahl, had me juggling many interchangeable heads and using oil to keep the blades sharp. This Remington tackles both of those issues in elegant fashion: a self-sharpening blade and a blade that I &amp;#34;dial up&amp;#34; to the correct length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use it mainly for trimming my beard - I use a separate trimmer for my mustache.  I used to use that other trimmer for everything, but it&#x27;s beard trimming guard finally broke.  This new trimmer has a much better designed guard, and I hope it will last longer than my old one (seems better, more durable plastic)</li>
    <li> Have had for over two months now and can&#x27;t find anything to complaint about. Easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I liked this trimmer.  Really liked it.  But only for a couple months.  Now, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took a couple months for me to notice that the battery life was getting worse.  A few months later, and it had gotten ridiculous.  Adding to the problem: the battery is not replaceable.  Adding even more to the problem: you can&#x27;t run the trimmer by plugging it in.  The included adapter only works as a charger.  It won&#x27;t actually power the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington might as well market this as a \\&quot;disposable trimmer\\&quot;.  There are plenty of other trimmer options out there.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well, but the LiON batteries are very short-lived and not easily replaceable. I thought the first I bought might have been defective, but the second soon failed, too</li>
    <li> The battery life of this product is worthless. It started running out one month into using it and wouldn&#x27;t last despite keeping it plugged in for hours. It drains out in less than 1 minute. Highly UNRECOMMEND buying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got extremely curly hair (African-American) so I no longer shave to avoid the terror of ingrown hairs. This allows me to easily keep my beard trimmed at a variety of lengths. It&#x27;s easy to use charge and clean. You do need to be careful when opening the head up to clean out hair as the hinge can be a bit delicate and I almost broke it.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer. The blades stayed sharp for the 2 years I&#x27;ve had it and it was very comfortable to use. The only con is the battery lost it&#x27;s charge after about 2 years of use. It cannot even operate for more than a few minutes at this point. I got 2 years out of it and the price is cheap for a trimmer so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer.  No combs to swap, just dial in the right length and start trimming. The blades are sharp and it cuts smoothly, without pulling my wiskars. The battery lasts for multiple shaves before I need to recharge.</li>
    <li> i bought this trimmer with couple others. This one is definitely the best !&lt;br /&gt;it is so powerful, cutting everything that comes in its way, lovely titanuim blades, pain-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;like it &amp; love it. BUY IT !</li>
    <li> Its a good trimmer and is well designed and feels sturdy. The battery does seem to need frequent recharging though. My earlier trimmer would go a lot of days without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one somehow manages to remain cleaner with not too much hair getting stuck in the grill and the blades. Thats definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> Works very much like the previous version from 3 or 4 years ago. Only difference is the plastic head that goes directly over the cutters seems sharper and actually catches and jabs my skin when I apply pressure which I do to get a close cut on setting 1. Former shaver was smoother on tips and glided easily over face even with moderate pressure.</li>
    <li> Worked good but the battery is already junk after two years .Wont hold a charge.</li>
    <li> just so great, I love the adjustability. Just make sure you keep it charged. It&#x27;ll definitely last long enough, but you gotta plug it in or else you&#x27;re going to run dry in the middle of a trim. It won&#x27;t run from being plugged in only on a dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also runs fine wet, like in the shower,</li>
    <li> this trimmer is great but it wont, charge / use while plugged in. kinda sucks when the battery dies and you have to wait about 30-40 minutes to get a decent enough charge to go use it. other than that if you leave it plugged in it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few years and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this beard trimmer around 10/1/12 and for approximately 14 months, it was a great trimmer. The blades stayed sharp, and I really like the built in trim guide. After 14 months however, the battery quickly deteriorated and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Additionally, the trimmer will not work using the wall charger, so now I&#x27;m awaiting Remington&#x27;s customer service to see if they will honor their 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I really liked this trimmer until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 5 months of use. I then had to have it plugged in to the power adapter to get any use out of it. Then it totally stopped working. Totally unacceptable. Would not buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR THE MONEY WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an identical trimmer I&#x27;ve used for years.  Replacement was required because the power cord malfunctioned.  The new trimmer is doing fine.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase. I use it without the guide and the trimming feels smooth, no bumps or cuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years and it has worked great. The battery is now getting weaker and I have to charge it before every use, but it is still working fine. It is very easy to use -- the length adjustment is very convenient.</li>
    <li> It does everything just fine but after using 10-15 mins straight the battery seems to go low. If you are going to trim your entire body hair then this is not the product you want to buy...It is perfect for trimming facial hair :D....</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great levels of trim length.  Battery has VERY low charge life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned roughly 5 trimmer before this and let me just say , this one takes the cake , and the chicken and the soda. Cool looking design , fits your hand perfectly , not very loud yet powerful. Comes with a cool styling comb and cleaning brush , VERY easy to use and I just took it out of the case and been using it for a month now and I have not needed to charge it yet. Definitely deserves the many 5 stars it has been awarded.</li>
    <li> I had a trimmer for 15 years and it finaly gave up the ghost.  I now own the replacement model and it performs great.  So far so good.  It holds a charge a long time and it is easy to keep clean.  I highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT beard trimmer while it worked.  But the charger has completely stopped working, so it is broken.  I really have not owned this thing that long.  Very disappointing.  Can&#x27;t suggest buying a product that breaks down like this.    I don&#x27;t understand how companies that make products to do such a specific thing are incapable of success.  How are battery companies not able to make batteries that work?  It is just unbelievable to me.</li>
    <li> This is a decent -- and at the time I bought it, impressively inexpensive -- trimmer, but does have some limitations.    Pros: Adjustable guard; on sale for cheap.  Cons: Modest power (can choke a bit on my thick beard); does not trim especially close with the guard removed; no dock for charging.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the old MB-300.  It&#x27;s fine as just a beard trimmer, but the old one had a flip out side burn/mustache trimmer that was awesome.  I guess you can take the guard off this one, but it&#x27;s way too wide and not as good of a trim as the flip out trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even worse is the battery life, this won&#x27;t hold a charge after a few days, you have to plan when you&#x27;re going to trim and charge it before you need to use it.  You also can&#x27;t use it while being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would go back to the MB-300, I still have mine that is 6 years old now.  Still holds a charge for months at a time and I still use it for the flip out trimmer as the main guard broke and can&#x27;t be adjusted.</li>
    <li> Cuts fine, but the battery cannot hold a charge - even overnight.  Also, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it right away; instead, you have to wait for the battery to charge a sufficient amount (~1 hr) to give you 5 minutes of cutting time.  Only solution I&#x27;ve found is leaving it plugged in 24/7.  Frustrating.</li>
    <li> Poor battery performance at first was an annoyance, and has now rendered this item useless.</li>
    <li> i really liked this trimmer until the battery stopped holding a charge for more than 30 seconds...</li>
    <li> I only use this on Sundays ... so it&#x27;s been charging for a week ..... used it today ... lasted maybe two minutes.</li>
    <li> As others have noted, the battery life is ridiculously bad.  Worse, mine doesn&#x27;t work if I plug it in -- the plug is only for charging the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally died.  I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another Remington.</li>
    <li> For the price, this trimmer can&#x27;t be beat!  I had an older similar model that was dying.  I forgot how well these work until I got this brand new one.  The cutting worked great.  The only negative I have about this is that the blade guide comes off when you flip it up to clean the blades.  My old one would just flip up and stay on.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, but not as nice as the old design.  That is why I knocked off a star.</li>
    <li> It worked GREAT... for about 18 months.  After that, it will barely hold a charge long enough for one use.  I had a similar issue with my previous beard trimmer.  I&#x27;m surprised that this is still an issue in 2014 given the advancements in battery and charging technology.  I don&#x27;t feel like a failing battery failing should require the whole unit to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, it was a great trimmer until the battery issues started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to adjust - I really like the height adjustment&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - The blade hinges open and hair falls out.  A spray bottle with rubbing alcohol finishes the job.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;Fairly cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No charging base.&lt;br /&gt;Battery and charging system design are horrible - see comments above.</li>
    <li> This is the basic model but it does everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I had a similar model for many years before this recent purchase and the price is still excellent.</li>
    <li> On my third one.  Rechargable battery dies each and every time within  first year.</li>
    <li> Has one a few years ago and it finally played out.  This was the replacement and it turns out to be much better than the one we had prior.</li>
    <li> Good product, made with resistant material, works fine. Although, the package is too big for the content, I think they can save a lot of money by reducing the size of the box.</li>
    <li> For what it is, it is nice.  Gold cutting blade gives it a hint of luxury. Adjustability is consistent with clicks in between numbers.  Has not slipped while trimming.  I had a buddy with a patch of short hair as the pressure he put on his clicked it down a number. her didn&#x27;t notice. I did. haha.  Battery last three or four trims.  No big deal, but if you don&#x27;t pay attention it will be mid trim and peter off real quick.  Very sudden power drop to snagging hair to charging for ten minutes before you can finish.</li>
    <li> The battery does not stayed charge. I could overlook this if it worked while plugged in, but it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design fail.</li>
    <li> Before you purchase this beard trimmer, be aware of these two major flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It ONLY runs on battery power.  Everyone nowadays is accustomed to using their laptop and cell phone, where you can take your device with a dead battery, plug it in, and begin using it right away with full power.  With this beard trimmer, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it-- the battery has to charge first.  If your trimmer is new, that takes at least a few hours.  As your device gets older, it takes longer and longer--it now takes me a full 24 hours to charge the battery to the point where I can get a full beard-trim out of it.  And that brings me to flaw #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The battery will stop holding a charge after a fairly short life.  I used mine about once a week for about three years before it got really bad-- that&#x27;s probably 100-150 charges of the battery.  If you&#x27;re someone using it every day, of course you would go through 100-150 charges much faster.  As I mentioned, I now need to charge the trimmer for about 24 hours before I can use it.  As soon as it gets unplugged, it will lose the entire charge within about 6 hours or so whether it is turned on or not.  Thus, I have to plan my beard trimming 24 hours in advance, and for someone with a hectic life this can be very difficult.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to swap out the battery for a new one--I have done some searching for solutions and have not found anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was a way to swap out the battery for a new one I would do it, because I otherwise like this beard trimmer.  I like the curved design, and I like the numbered length settings with the handy wheel.  It has always cut quite well and never pulled my hair, except when the battery dies mid-shave (which now happens frequently).  I did get a good three years of light use out of it, but I still think the product should be made better and should last longer.  And I still think it&#x27;s ridiculous that you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: it&#x27;s not without its merits, but overall I have been a little disappointed by this beard trimmer and I will definitely choose a different one as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Battery failed after a few months of use.  Do not buy this crap shaver.  I should have purchased something from Norelco and stayed away from Remington, but I did not listen to common sense that told me not to buy anything from  Remington....EVER!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be an awesome beard trimmer because of all the good reviews and videos, boy was I WRONG!!! This is pure JUNK!!! First it doesn&#x27;t work while being charged (plugged in). After 8 months I had to charge it 24 hours in advance of use because it die after 2/3 min while being used. The charge now only last less then a min and have to charge for 10-15 between uses. I would only use this unit once every 10 days to two weeks or so. Stay away, endless you like buying a new beard trimmer every year or so.</li>
    <li> He absolutely loves it! He says its the best trimmer he has ever used. Loves all the features and settings.</li>
    <li> As an African American, I am always looking for cordless Clippers that do a great job at cutting facial hair. Not only are these Clippers great at trimming facial hair,  they are also great at cutting the hair on my head! It has 9 adjustable positions that adjusts with the roll of your thumb on the zoom wheel which takes away all the hassle of having to switch out trimmer gaurds. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the most consistant mustache trimmer i have purchased. It holds a charge for several uses over a long period of time. This is my third one. I will be sad when i cant find them anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for well over a year now and it works well, I do really like the built in attachments, but it has one major flow: it doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in to the wall.  Instead, you need to charge the battery up first.  This is rather annoying, especially because at this point the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple days anymore.  This means that anytime I am going to use it, I have to plug it up first, then come back the next day or many hours later and use it then.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing, and it works, but I feel like it&#x27;s a problem.  It should really work while plugged in, even with a dead battery.  At this point I&#x27;d much rather have a trimmer with a permanent cord so I know that I can always use it when I need to.  If that one flaw were fixed, this would be five stars all the way.  But with that issue, I can&#x27;t fully endorse it.  Didn&#x27;t crop up until about a year in, so I suspect they don&#x27;t use very high quality rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> Worked good for awhile, now the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge..&lt;br /&gt;Biggest gripe is you cannot use while plugged in! Wtf</li>
    <li> The older Remington Beard and Mustache trimmers use to work when the charger was plugged in although Remington must of made some changes to save a few pennies and screwed up a good product. I was once loyal customer this was my 4 or 5th trimmer I had purchased from them but after this error on their part it will be my last.</li>
    <li> This thing is crap.  The original versions of this model trimmer had a higher capacity battery and charger and was much more powerful.  I could go weeks on end giving my goatee a quick once over every morning.  Why Remington downgraded these specs is beyond me.  Grossly under powered and requires a recharge after only 10 min.  I&#x27;ve been through two of these, each doing the same thing, with the second one dying entirely after only a month of use.  No more.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I was happy with it -- even though it takes long to charge -- up until a couple of days, when the battery turned useless (won&#x27;t hold charge for 2min). This is absurd considering I bought the trimmer not longer than year and a half ago.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than my previous electric trimmer. Easy to adjust length of trim. Quiet, too.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am complete disappointed with this trimmer.  It does a good job trimming.  Where it falls absolutely flat on its face is on the depth adjustment.  It is completely worthless.  This trimmer only has one depth setting - because if you don&#x27;t hold the thing at the right angle, you will trim your beard way too short.  Also, there is no good way of getting under your nose with this thing.  The depth guard will be up your nostril before your hair even comes close to the trimming blade!</li>
    <li> When I bought this on the strength of the Amazon reviews, I thought to myself \\&quot;how good can it be?\\&quot;.  Well, I found out.  This unit lives up to all the praise.  No pulls or snags, and creates a uniform cut without exception.  Previously, I&#x27;d always have to go back without the depth gauge to smooth things off, but not with this model.  The only touchups I ever need to do is around the lips (but that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
    <li> This is the third trimmer I&#x27;ve used and I would definitely give a big thumbs up for it.  The trimming is very smooth and accurate and hardly takes any time.  I like this product so much that I&#x27;m ordering my next one from as far away as   India.</li>
    <li> The trimmer seems to be good enough. However, I bought it about 6 months ago and the charger stopped working recently. I have tried to find a replacement for the charger only but neither amazon nor remington itself does seem to sell one. Without a charger, of course, the whole trimmer is pretty useless. If you read through the reviews you will also find others complaining about this very same problem. So if you buy it, you risk no longer to be able to use a perfectly well functioning trimmer due to this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months (less than 6 months)and I have used it around twice a month. Well, now the battery is dead and since this trimmer doesn&#x27;t allow to use it while you have it connected to the electricity, it is just useless, a piece of junk!</li>
    <li> I bought this based of all the fantastic reviews online.  It never had a very powerful battery and pretty much only lasted maybe 2 trims off one charge.  Oh, and it takes 18 hrs to charge!  Insane!  I bought it in May of 2011 and it pretty much died in January of 2014.  So, take that into account if you want to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and they said I&#x27;m out of warrantee.  Another piece of unnecessary garbage for our landfills.  Thanks Remington!  I will be buying a different brand from here on out.</li>
    <li> this  shaver  work  great</li>
    <li> Good product but died after a year.</li>
    <li> This is a great product !! Been looking for one for a while. Finally found it !! Love It !!!!</li>
    <li> Pros - trims bear efficiently.  good range of adjustments on length.  fairly powerful.  cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cons - If not constantly left charging, battery doesn&#x27;t seem to hold charge for long.  If I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in constantly, odds are high that it won&#x27;t run for more than 10 seconds when I finally go to use it.  I&#x27;ve had the unit a couple of years, so perhaps it wasn&#x27;t always this way, but it has had this problem for at least a year.  The length adjustment mechanism is cheap plastic, the trimmer was dropped once and landed comb-end down, which broke something with the adjuster and now any length setting less than 7 will slide to 0 mid-trim which is a big problem.  If I&#x27;m very careful not to push it too hard against my face, I can keep it on 7 or above. It will not run off of AC power in the event that it is low on battery, you are out of luck util it sits and charges back up for a good long while.</li>
    <li> The razor works fine, but the batteries only lasted two years before they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  So, if you factor replacing every few years into your cost, you&#x27;d be smart.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  Rechargeable battery lasted ~4 years, before I bought my second one.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. I bought it for my son out in college and it stopped charging only after a short while.  While the Remmington company is good with replacing it, it has become a hassle to keep shipping it back and forth to them for credit or replacement. They have replaced it twice now, and yet again it is not holding a charge. I am tired of contacting Remmington &amp; paying for shipping. I went out and bought 2 Wahl brand battery operated bead trimmers for both my sons that are away at college and they are working perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a very versatile trimmer.  I use it to keep a stubble beard on my face and my wife uses it to cut my hair.  I like the easily adjustable guard so she can cut my sides and back shorter and then going longer on top.  I&#x27;ve had it for a month and haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all.  I am very pleased and would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> After owning this trimmer for less than 2 years it will not hold a charge when I leave it unplugged for one day.</li>
    <li> The thing that ruins this one for me is the battery.  If you forget to plug it in, the battery dies.  If you use it too long, the battery dies.  If it could run WHILE plugged in, all would be solved.  However it cannot pull enough current to run while plugged in and a half trimmed beard doesn&#x27;t look so good.</li>
    <li> This cordless rechargeable razor was not able to keep a charge for long from the beginning. After a few months it stopped charging at all. When it worked, it gave a decent trim within the limited settings. (No vacuum force either, meaning the trimmings fell all over.)</li>
    <li> Main problem is that the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Have owned it for a year, need to plug it in all the time to use.</li>
    <li> Moderate shave, absolutely terrible battery quality.  Move on, pick another razor.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts hair great with the beard guard on it. If I could wear a neck beard all the time then this product would be for me. Sadly I need to trim down my neck. This thing without it&#x27;s guard is a stabbing machine. First time I used it I poked into my hair follicle and cut it, gave me an ingrown hair/scab for a week and half. I still have a pink scar from it months later.  If you are looking for a beard trimmer you can fling around without worry, buy a safer one. If you are always cautious and need a simple BEARD trimmer then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this beard trimmer back in Feb 2012 and 19 months later it looks like I&#x27;ll have to purchase a new one, since this Remington MB-200 is now officially dead.  Specifically, the battery no longer holds a charge at all, and unfortunately you can&#x27;t turn the trimmer on while it&#x27;s plugged in.  It&#x27;s really a shame, because when I first got the trimmer it worked wonderfully.  With a full charge it would easily cut through my beard, which is quite thick compared to most and grows rather quickly.  That said, I probably got more use out of this trimmer than most men with thinner beards, and I&#x27;m sure the frequent use and recharging was responsible for the untimely death of the trimmer.  However, I still find it ridiculous that I wasn&#x27;t even able to get 2 years out of this trimmer, particularly when my Panasonic Electric Shaver has been alive and kicking for several years now, and is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are the main reasons I would NOT recommend the Remington MB-200:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Unable to trim while plugged in - There were times when I ran out of battery mid-shave. Rather than continue my day looking like the Batman villain Two-Face, I had to resort to shaving off my beard completely, instead of simply trimming it. It would have been nice to have been able to plug in the trimmer to continue the shave, but it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Plugging it in is only for charging the battery--not trimming.&lt;br /&gt;2. No low-battery indicator - Problem #1 listed above might have been lessened had there been some sort of battery indicator on the trimmer, but there is nothing.  This means that you have to gauge the remaining life of the battery by the sound of the rapidly slowing blades.  So if you hear the buzz of the blades start to struggle, you&#x27;d better finish up your trimming quickly or risk having a partially trimmed face.  I&#x27;m not asking for anything fancy here.  A nice &amp;#34;percentage of battery power left&amp;#34; icon would be nice, but even a flashing LED light would be helpful.  ANYTHING!  But no, there is no indicator whatsoever.  Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;3. Long charge time - Most times this wasn&#x27;t a huge issue and charging overnight was the way to go.  However, when I was left stranded with a partially-shaved face from problem #1 above, waiting 10+ hours for a good charge wasn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;4. Horrible battery life - As I said, I wasn&#x27;t even able to get 2 years out of this product and the battery no longer holds ANY charge.  Even before its untimely death I could notice the number of trims I could squeeze in before requiring a recharge was quickly dwindling.  Within the last month or two I could barely complete a single trim before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this wasn&#x27;t an expensive purchase, but as outlined above, there were a few simple fixes that would have made this a much better product.  When it was working it did its job well. But it was always a gamble, especially while traveling, wondering how long the trimmer would last before sputtering to a complete and unexpected stop.light would be helpful.  ANYTHING!

    <li> Works terrific. Easy to adjust &amp; clean, gives a great trim. Have had it almost 2 years &amp; still holds the charge well. I&#x27;ve had various trimmers over the years &amp; like this best.</li>
    <li> works great, supplies a clean cut. the beard guard stays in place and a nice solid wheel to make height adjustments. I use this on its closest settings, so I cannot speak to the performance at high settings, but if you have a lot of beard, you are probably using scissors anyway.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is so awesome!  It always gives me the right shave that I&#x27;m looking for with or without the guard on :D  I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these already and I hope they continue to make these because I enjoy using this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these trimmers for over 15 years. The latest version works fine, but the preset adjustability has changed for the worse. I&#x27;ve always trimmed to a 3 on my face, but the old 3 lives now between 2 and 3 so I&#x27;m now stuck going longer which I&#x27;m not a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need unlimited adjustment if they&#x27;re going to mess with settings.</li>
    <li> I get ingrown hair, and this shaver prevents that. Durable, and the charge seems to last forever on this thing. I charge maybe once every month or two, and I use it 5 days a week or more..Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The battery in my first trimmer wore out last year so I bought a new one at that time.  I bought this second one as a spare.  I use them as mustache and beard trimmers and my wife cuts my hair with them.</li>
    <li> Lasted about 6 months, using about 2 minutes per week, before failing completely.  Won&#x27;t take charge.  Had an older Remington model that last for years so I when I needed a new trimmer I&#x27;d get the latest.  I could tell immediately that the MB-200 was not built as well.  It seemed like a cheap plastic build.  It also did not have the pop up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The first one lasted a few years, but then the battery no longer held a charge and the case can&#x27;t be opened to replace the battery. That seems like a lousy design since the trimmer itself was still perfect. Eventually I gave up trying to get it to take a charge or open the case, and bought a new one just because there is no other trimmer I found that does such a good job. I hope the battery lasts longer, but I don&#x27;t think it will.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design.&lt;br /&gt;Built in height adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Long charge times and the battery does not hold a charge more than a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Scatters hair all over the sink and counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money this is not a bad trimmer. I like the built in height adjustment, and it does not really pull my hair while using it. My biggest complaint is the battery. It does not hold a charge, and you cannot use it when it’s plugged in. Add to that the 4-8 hour charge time, and it never seems to be ready when you need it. You must remember the night before that you are going to use it the next morning, and plug it in. If you forget and plug it in the morning, hoping it will have enough of a charge to use before you leave the house, it will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is the way it scatters hair everywhere. It covers the sink, the counter, everything after you use it. This was my first trimmer, so I thought this was just the nature of the beast. Then I bought my next trimmer, which basically just drops the trimmed hair right down into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is hard to beat for the money, but there are a lot of better trimmers out there, if you pay a bit more.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great.  Cuts smoothly with plenty of power. Easy to clean, lots of adjustments. It holds a charge for a long time and is a good size in your hand. My only complaints are that the start button is on the right side, (obviously designed by a lefty), it should be on the other side so it can be operated with the thumb, and that it is made of a rather slippery plastic. Haven&#x27;t dropped it yet, but I can&#x27;t believe they can&#x27;t think these things through. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for almost a year, using it about once a week, and have only had to plug it in to recharge once. So the battery life, one of the most important things in a cordless trimmer, is excellent thus far. As far as the trim, I haven&#x27;t felt it tug or pull whiskers one time, and it has a wide range of lengths, from stubble to quite long for a trimmed beard. Additionally, it is easy to clean (the head pivots open to empty any hairs caught inside) and reliable. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I know that shouldn&#x27;t be a reason for 5 stars, but these days it is! It does exactly what it says it will. If you follow the instructions and clean it regularly, this thing will last a long time.  Here to edit my review.  I would now give it 3 stars.  2 issues: 1) takes 16 hours to charge!!!!  Ridiculous!~ 2) if you take the top off to use it, the trimmer part with the blades pops off every other time I use it. it is held on by 2 1mm pins that go into the body, you have a really good chance of breaking these every time you need to put it back on. Today it dropped on the ground (just the head) and now it is out of alignment and won&#x27;t work at all. Disgusted.</li>
    <li> I have had some bad luck with beard trimmer with how thick my hairs are.  This one chops them right up with no problem, and the strength of the battery is great.  This definitely isn&#x27;t a bad purchase for the price.  It has the power of a beard trimmer 3 times its price.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Norelco rechargable that crapped out after 2 years moderate use.  Like this MUCH better.  More power, better speed.  Works with cord in if you forget to charge it.  Not like you ever notice it needs a charge until you are using it, and who wants to be walking around with a half trimmed beard?</li>
    <li> The battery life is great so far.I haven&#x27;t needed to charge its battery with 14 days use in a row. It trimmed my beard just fine because I didn&#x27;t have thick beard.</li>
    <li> Nobody ever told me this was a mustache and beard trimmer:  I&#x27;ve been using it to buzz my scalp (and beard) for years.  I&#x27;ve used it two to three times per week, every week, since the day I bought it.  It&#x27;s been around the world in my luggage.  I took it to Thailand fully charged, and managed a full month of brisk use without charging it!  It&#x27;s cordless, so I can buzz my hair in the shower and just wash the mess down the drain.  Over the years, it&#x27;s taken a number of tumbles from counters and shelves.  The paint is worn through in a few spots, and the tips of a few teeth on the hair guide have snapped off, but it&#x27;s still very functional, and you can get a replacement hair guide from Remington for just a couple dollars.    The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it would be nice if it had a recessed power switch, since it&#x27;s switched itself on in my luggage and drained itself a few times.  In the meantime, I put a piece of tape over the power switch before packing it away.  I suppose another con is that the charger is 120V only, which can be a problem for international travel.    There aren&#x27;t a lot of products that I whole-heartedly recommend to friends, but this is one of them.</li>
    <li> Last year I had to begin the hunt for a new beard trimmer...and man are there a lot out there and half of them wanted over $100 for something so simple.  This trimmer is a great price (even if it didn&#x27;t have the Amazon discount!) and does its job well.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year at this point and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it.  It recharges quickly, cuts cleanly, and is dead simple to use.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for just over 6 months, used for mustache, moderat size beard  and related trimming. Has easily adjustable head for variable length  trimming, handles easily, recharging rarely needed, light weight for traveling. I also use it for   trimming nose, ears and around ears which it does well.  I purchased it after reading   comparative reviews of several shavers on the web. This grimmer regulary came  up as among the best and I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have the same experience as mentioned by Amazon user \\&quot;Jwilkins\\&quot;    Worked great for 5 or 6 weeks, used probably 10-15 times. Then it stopped charging completely. Possibly an issue with the batteries, but even so, should last longer than this.    Bought overseas, not really worth the effort of getting it fixed as it was only $20...     I won&#x27;t be taking the risk and buying another, even at 1/4 the price of the other ones I am looking at.    Now I&#x27;m off to the store to buy another with a half shaved beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in the middle of February and only started using it form April, it worked for a month and now it wont charge up. No matter how long i leave it for charging it just wont work more then 10 seconds. Also the charging indicator doesn&#x27;t light up. Now im wondering if i can exchange or return this item.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable NiCd battery never held a great charge.  With (a few years of) only intermittent use, the battery now only holds a charge for a couple minutes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for the sake of removing the guide comb and trimming my beard to have a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; remaining, and used the comb to maintain a sculpted chin with a setting of 3 or 4. This trimmer allows you to flip a wheel to increase or decrease the width between the guide comb and trimmer head.    I went with the Remington MB-200 due to the cost and high star rating here on Amazon, and I was very let down. For starters, like mostly everything else made today, this thing is made with super low quality fragile plastic, in and out. The guide comb is extremely breakable and is made of the thinnest plastic.    However, that was not my main issue. I used this trimmer only five times until it completely broke down. Remington used a cheap underpowered motor. In my specific case, the little rotating motor pin under the trimmer head simply died down the more the trimmer was activated (it was audibly struggling to the point where it sounded like a car whose transmission was about to die). Eventually it stopped working entirely, and it could no longer nudge the trimmer head anymore, even though it was fully charged.     This experience made me realize that it might be better to simply choke up the $80+ to get a real trimmer, preferably a salon-quality one from a big name like Oster, with metallic guide combs. After all, this is something I&#x27;ll be using every day for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m guessing these cheap items are assumed to die down in the short-run and therefore be \\&quot;disposable.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great shaver however the battery sucks! After few months with minimal use, the battery no longer charges, so now I have to throw it out. I am sick and tired of this stupid approach to making products - make a weak product so that it can break fast and sell them cheap so people can buy them every 4 months. This is BS, I would rather pay more for a better product so that I don&#x27;t contribute to the pollution of the Earth. Not buying another shaver from Remington, although the trimmer was excellent.</li>
    <li> First of all, since a lot of people are wondering...here is the sizes (listed from the manual) that each setting will trim:    1 : 1.5mm, 0.06\\&quot; (Stubble look)  2 : 2.5mm, 0.1\\&quot;  3 : 4mm, 0.16\\&quot; (Short)  4 : 5.5mm, 0.22\\&quot;  5 : 7mm, 0.28\\&quot; (Medium)  6 : 9mm, 0.35\\&quot;  7 : 11mm, 0.43\\&quot;  8 : 14mm, 0.55\\&quot; (Long)  9 : 18mm, 0.71\\&quot;    I&#x27;ll admit, this is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought...but I think I made a great choice. I&#x27;ve had it around a month now, and trim on average twice a week. Everything about it is simple, easy to pick-up and use.     - Cleaning is simple. It comes with a comb and brush to clean the trimmer.    - I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say the plastic pieces are flimsy/break easily/etc. So far, I&#x27;ve had no problem. The guide is easy to remove (honestly though, just in case I&#x27;m totally baby-ing this thing so it won&#x27;t break).     - Some reviews say that even without the guide, it doesn&#x27;t trim close enough for them. In my opinion, if that&#x27;s not short enough for you...then you just need to shave! I use setting 1 to get a stubble look on my cheeks, a 3 for my mustache, and a 5 for my goatee. And I remove the guide to define the edges. Simple, and takes away a lot of the time used for shaving and cleanup.      Overall, great product. Hoping it will last awhile -knocks on wood-, if not I guess I&#x27;ll have to search for a more sturdy one or buy this one again lol.</li>
    <li> I researched several bread trimmers on Amazon after my [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] finally stopped working after 3 years.  I ended up purchasing the Remington MB-200 because of it&#x27;s excellent reviews and price of $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Remington MB-200 looks great, with an ergonomic design &amp; soft material finish and seems very well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer is extremely loud to the point that it was painful trimming around the ear area.  I have never had this issue with any of the trimmers I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In addition to it being loud the trimmer has a vibration that makes it not pleasant to hold for long durations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It took several passes to get the hair to be evenly cut and the look still did not look good as my low-end Norelco G370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The charge light stays on and there is no way to tell when it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this would atleast be better than my Norelco G370 given the reviews but unfortunately it was not.  Returned and decided to spend a little extra money and get the [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard and Head Cruzer, 6 Beard and Head Trimmer]].</li>
    <li> This is very similar, but cheaper in every way, to my old Remington trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Whoa!  I used this charger on my old trimmer and now I have a good, old trimmer, plus this one (that I don&#x27;t use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK trimmer, but I am super-pleased the old one is now working again! hahahaahaahahaahaahahaa!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this almost every day. We&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and its great. Takes a little longer to charge and looses charge a little quicker but its perfect. I love the adapter too because now I&#x27;m my man&#x27;s personal barber. Shape ups and everything right from this little trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I received this trimmer.  It felt right in my hand and the blades were sharp and stayed sharp.  The adjustable spacer stayed put where it was set, and I never had to worry about accidental changes in trimming length.  I&#x27;d trim about once a week or sometimes two weeks.  The problem was the trimmer did not hold charge very long, and the capacity seemed to be diminished as the unit aged.  Having experienced with rechargeable devices with cheap rechargeable batteries, I decided to open it up to see if I could replace the batteries.  I discovered that the batteries are permanently mounted and not replaceable, unless you want to do some work to disconnect the old batteries and solder 2 replacement AA-size batteries into place.  Each of the original batteries is rated 600mA.  Hence, this was a practically made to be a disposable trimmer.  Its life probably is dependent on how often you use it and how you recharge it.  Frankly, it is unfortunate that it was engineered to the thrown away before the blades become dull.   UPDATE:  The manufacturer was very responsive to my review/experience with my trimmer and it offered a solution.  This great customer care/service earns the product another star in my review.  I am definitely a fan.  Having said that, my next trimmer will have replaceable parts, if such trimmer exists and works as well as this one.  It would be nice if companies think about products that generate less waste.  UPDATE #2:  I am reducing my rating to 2-star because the brandnew replacement unit I received from Remington does not hold charge more than a few days.  Customer service was great but a bad product is still is a bad product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for my Norelco.  Seemed like a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1.5 years, the plastic hinge (that&#x27;s right, a plastic hinge) broke and no replacement is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Norelco lasted at least 7 years before a critical drop on the floor took it out of commission.</li>
    <li> Got this for the hubs for Christmas.... so far so good.  He really likes it and says it works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 of these now and they all last between 1-2 years before the batteries stop holding a charge.  Of course Remington won&#x27;t let you use the trimmer while it is plugged in, so you can&#x27;t just use it as a corded trimmer.  If you purchase one of these, just don&#x27;t expect it to last any longer than 2 years, because it won&#x27;t.  The actual trimmer itself is pretty nice and is built well, the adjustments are easy and when the batteries hold a charge it works really well.  If you are okay with something like this lasting you less than 2 years I would recommend it, otherwise I would recommend a corded trimmer or a different brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Remington MB-200 beard trimmer! This is my second one. Hope they  never quit making this model. I highly recommend this trimmer to all you bearded guys out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Chowns</li>
    <li> I bought the older MB-200 model about 8 years ago. It could sit charged for two months and still give me 15mintues of operation.&lt;br /&gt;I bought three of these newer units for myself and my nephews and we must always plug in the unit for a few hours before shaving. You get about 10 minutes of use after a fresh charge. If you let it sit for a month the charge reduces significantly.&lt;br /&gt;When the batteries are dead, it is unusable for at least 1 hour until the batteries develop some charge.</li>
    <li> I followed proper charging procedure and got about 3 trims off the first charge.  The next charge didn&#x27;t last long enough to finish trimming my beard even once (less than 2 minutes).  I thought it must have charged incorrectly and tried it again and it got worse.  I tried a third time to make absolutely certain that I was charging it with the correct charger and procedure, and now it runs for less than 10 seconds after charging overnight.  It&#x27;s worse than useless because I depended on it and wound up with a half-trimmed beard.  Thanks for making me look crazy, Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I use it so rarely that the window to return it is way closed.  I just have to suck it up and eat the expense.  This will be the last time I buy a NiCad device online.</li>
    <li> I loved the adjustment feature at first - never needing to keep track of attachments.  However, after only a couple of months, I think the gear inside that works the auto-adjust has broken.  I emailed Remington support - no word so far.  In addition to the adjustment feature, the trimmer only seems to be able to hold a charge for a day or two with light use.</li>
    <li> Does not hold a charge long at all.  You need to continuosly keep in plugged in. After charging you can get 1-2 trims in.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I first bought one of these from my local Walmart a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  When I moved, I lost the power cord for it so I couldn&#x27;t charge mine anymore.  This is such a nice trimmer that I could justify buying a new one just because I lost the old power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built in length adjustment is awesome.  When you first use it, start off long then slowly set it shorter until you reach a length you like and remember the number.  I use 7 for my beard and 4 for my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lost a star due to a battery issue.  If you leave it plugged in until you use it, it lasts long enough to cut your hair, beard, mustache, and to do a little trimming.  But, my old one wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge for longer than a day or 2, which means you always have to have it plugged in if you want to use it.  I haven&#x27;t tested the battery with the new one I received yet, so this may not be an issue with new ones.</li>
    <li> All aspects of this beard trimmer work great when it works. After a few charges it no longer holds a charge. That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it would work plugged in but even then it needs a charge to work!  I don&#x27;t need a cordless trimmer in the first place.  Too bad. Get something else.</li>
    <li> Bought this in January.  It&#x27;s July now and the thing will only work thirty seconds before it dies --- after being fully charged!  It doesn&#x27;t even work corded!  Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Works good, well made, sharp blades do not pull, easy to clean.  For me a little large for trimming mustache and beard.  Also the longest setting is still to short for my likes, I belive less than an inch. But, if you like to keep your beard very short it will be a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Refurbished and not quit the same as the first 2 I bought that were new not refurbished from the store. But it cuts good</li>
    <li> As noted by other reviewers, this trimmer doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and I would not buy this again or recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Remington beard trimmer, but it is the first that will not hold a charge. Have to trim beard in increments. When it is working it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Works for a while, then dies out very quickly.  I had it for about a year, and it began to start not holding battery charges for very long.  Now it&#x27;s at the point where it holds no battery charge.  It has to be connected to the plug.  Overall it&#x27;s a fair product, but as for cordless it sucks.</li>
    <li> Not what my husband expected at all. To big an clumbsy for him</li>
    <li> After a few charges, this product will not hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is held on by flimsy plastic tabs that break very easily.</li>
    <li> Cuts very nicely. Keeps charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this product six months ago after a good experience with an older Remington model. The trimmer works well, but it stopped holding a charge after two months. The brand new product was good for about 3-4 shaves, then it dropped to two. Now it will only hold enough for one shave, and when it dies, it dies lighting-quick: full speed to completely dead within 20 seconds. Now I have to charge before every use. Not ideal.</li>
    <li> I have bought many mustache and beard trimmers in my day but&lt;br /&gt;this one is the best I give it an A rateing</li>
    <li> Trimmer wide for close mustache work. Don&#x27;t drop. It&#x27;s very easy to break plastic hinge which secures the shaver head.</li>
    <li> The battery on this thing is terrible. I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a year and a half, and I can barely get through one beard trimming session. Why are shavers still using NiCad batteries?! Of course, the shaver is pretty inexpensive, but I hate tossing these kinds of things into landfills.</li>
    <li> WOW, I USUALLY WASTED TIME TRIMMING MY BEARD OR MUSTACHE WITH RAZORS, BUT WITH MY REMINGTON , NO PROBLEMS, I´M READY IN NO TIME!!</li>
    <li> I like the staying and the way it feel in my grasp. The dial is also very effective in creating a finely nuanced beard. I wish it had a nose hair attachment, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He goes back and forth between a goatee and beard and likes a more manicured look. It cuts evenly and has good size choices.</li>
    <li> Broke within a month, non returnable, poor design and has been replaced by the much better designed and better constructed Milano model ER-GB40-S. Get the latter and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> One simple reason why you dont want this pos is the plug to charge it gets put in on the bottom of the base!!! How the heck do you expect us to charge this while its standing up like every other shaver in creation!! i dont want my razor laying on its side like its a beached whale!!!  How lame is that!!!! Why didnt they show that on the picture!! I wish I hadnt ripped the box I never expected this plug to go on the bottom, and why dont they make the one with the vacuum catcher on the bottom. This gets hair all over the place. Why discontinue a great product and make this pos. To have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous. Buy something else or make sure your plug doesnt go on the bottom of anything else you buy. These blades cut like an sob too! Very disappointed I miss the mb 70 and mb 400 vacuum trimmers. Why&#x27;d they stop making that. Unreal. The blades on those ones were more delicate these blades on this one are sharp as heck. If you plan on using this remington for body hair LOOKOUT! This has the tendency to give you some nasty cuts.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after about 8 months.  Gave me a decent shave but nothing that blew my mind.  It&#x27;s a decent shaver if you&#x27;re on a budget but the battery is pretty poor.</li>
    <li> The battery life is limited. I didn&#x27;t know that when I purchased the first one. Now that I know that at one year the battery will start to lose it&#x27;s ability to keep a charge, I will plan on purchasing a new one. Apparently the batteries are soldered into the wiring and are difficult to replace. I will just plan to purchase a new unit every year. It&#x27;s cheap enough...works well...well enough to purchase one every year.</li>
    <li> I used this same model for about 4 years until the batteries would not charge any more.  When I went to see what it took to change the batteries, I decided it would be wise just to buy a new unit.  Charged-up new unit and I works great just like my old one of the same model.  Buy this model.  You don&#x27;t need the more expense model.  This will do all you should want it to do.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t hold a charge which makes it a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had the older version and it worked well for 4 or 5 years. I got this one and it won&#x27;t even hold a charge after 6 months. At least the old one would work when plugged to the wall. This one needs hours to change and then it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> It was nice, until I traveled with it and tried to charge it in the wrong country which broken the charger or whatever, now it&#x27;s unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Was good for the value and if you don&#x27;t plan on traveling too much.</li>
    <li> This replaces a Remington from the &amp;#34;MB&amp;#34; lineup that I&#x27;ve used for, I&#x27;d have to guess, close to a decade. The battery finally reached the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge on my old one so I went looking for the closest possible replacement, which this is. I use it to keep my beard trimmed. It works almost exactly as my previous trimmer did, which is to say: perfectly.</li>
    <li> Worked well, recharges quickly, and easily adjustable.  Sometimes have to go over same area multiple times to trim effectively.  Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have had...the internal batteries wear out and all you can do is throw them away. I was looking for one with 2 AA batteries, But I guess no one makes them any more. This works fine, but I know in 2 years it will fail.</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington I&#x27;ve bought, the first was the Titanium model and I loved it but it finally gave up after many years of use so I purchased this model . It seems to be as good just have to wait and see as time will tell. I like it so far and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product update: Bought this product a few months ago and wish I hadn&#x27;t. I owned a previous model and loved it, worked great and great battery life. Bought this one and it works OK if the battery is newly charged but the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge more than a few days at most. Very disappointed in the quality of the trimmer especially after such a wonderful previous model. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TRIMMER. IF YOU BUY IT YOU WILL BE SORRY. Battery will not hold a charge and it is very underpowered. Very disappointed in the product. Would love to return it but I&#x27;m sure they will want the original packaging which was discarded. That&#x27;s what I get for trusting a product name.Don&#x27;t commit the same mistake I made, buy another brand. The product name Remmington used to mean quality but not any more.</li>
    <li> When you rate so many items in one day it is not my ability to write a long lenghty description why I like a product suffice it to say I like this product according to the number of stars 1 stars i could not use it 3 stars I do not use it enough to rember 4 o5 I continually use this and reread and recommend it to others ok?</li>
    <li> I have used the trimmer 4 times and each time the battery had to be recharged before it could be used.  The battery does not hold a charge and the trimmer can&#x27;t be used while plugged in.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant rimmer. My husbsnf has had many beard trimmers, and is very happy with this one. He has used it for the past 3-1/2 years,</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Remington mustache and beard trimmer. I prefer Remington because the do a better job of getting a close mustache trim under the nose. I&#x27;ve used Panasonic but those leave a thicker trim just under the nostrils which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge seems to last a good amount of time, but there is one draw-back: There is no warning to when it needs recharging. It just kinda stops in the middle of a trim which usually results in pulled hair - and that hurts! I guess I could just keep it plugged in when i&#x27;m not using it so it is always &amp;#34;topped off&amp;#34; but I like to keep mine in a drawer, out of site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The batteries are not replaceable so you will need to replace the unit when it dies. Mine lasted a little over two years so I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth (I use it almost every day) I did buy this exact shaver again and it is working out.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it so thats all that matters he threw his old ones out lol</li>
    <li> I have had this less than one year. I purchased it from Amazon.  Initially the battery would hold the charge, but now I am good for 1 minute.  I intend to trash it and look for something else.  First, I will read the reviews on the next one.</li>
    <li> This works like a dream compared to the old Norelco I&#x27;ve been using for the past 15 years or so.  Good power and blade speed, convenient height adjustment mechanism that stays in place once set.  A single charge seems to last forever.  Would have preferred the on/off switch to be located on the opposite side of the body where I could operate with my thumb (being right-handed) but this is a nit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Have now been using a couple of years, original comments still valid.</li>
    <li> This product works well when the battery recharge works;which is seldom for long.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second unit (an indication that, when working-it works well) but my last.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality, poor product management on Remington&#x27;s part: I will not buy another&lt;br /&gt;of their products as a result</li>
    <li> I have been using this model for years to trim my hair.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used, mainly because the selector dial for length lets you clearly see and set your desired length .... AND IT NEVER ACCIDENTALLY SLIPS TO A DIFFERENT LENGTH/POSITION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last very long time (not forever, but several years of regular use without any problems)</li>
    <li> I bought this a gift for my husband; overall, he thinks the product would be good for beards, but just fair for mustaches.  You can&#x27;t get the little details with this product, so for mustaches, he would say not so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon for $15 though it&#x27;s now priced at $20.  I liked the built-in cut-length adjustment, and that (they claim) it will NEVER need oiling or sharpening.  That alone is worth the $15.  The first time I used it, it worked fine - had a strong charge, and trimmed well.  You can also pull off the length-adjuster to get a close trim or to clean out any hairs.  All you could ask for, and great price.</li>
    <li> THese trimmers work great and go forever. Broke my last one by dropping it. Much handier than the ueual heavy, awkward guide change clippers.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This works great!  My only complaint is it only works if the battery is charged.  In other words, if the charge is gone, you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it as if it were at full capacity - so you just have to be pro-active about making sure you pre-charge.  But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect, compact, and does exactly what I need!</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer and I&#x27;m happy to say it works perfectly. The charge seems to last for quite some time and it cuts evenly and cleanly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier for a quick easy tool to maintain my goatee.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor for a month and then one day during a grooming session one of the plastic snapped off. My embarrassment was great, as I am a 23 year old man who does not know how to effectively operate an electric razor. My razor which was designed to remove unwanted hair from my face had suddenly removed one of the plastic pieces from its own self. I finished up the best I could on my face; however my thoughts were that this razor does such a good job of cutting that it accidentally cut itself. I put the razor away with a renewed respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a few weeks later I needed to shave again. As I did so, another tine flew off to evermore decorate my bathroom floor. This made shaving increasingly more difficult. Every few weeks my beard was developing a strange look that I best defended as \\&quot;trendy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to call Remington and see if they could help, but I felt a little embarrassed as they could probably guess that I did something wrong with the razor. Not sure what I did, but Remington makes great products and they would never sell me something that is easily broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, people who do not have to shave their faces very often are really screwed over by 30 day guarantee programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting another electric razor, but I keep this one around out of respect. It sits on a little throne underneath my sink which is probably what it wanted all along.</li>
    <li> As a beard trimmer goes this does the job.  Apparently though if you snap on the removable guard with any kind of force it will break the 9 level system and leave you with only one. If you treat the trimmer very gently I don&#x27;t see this being an issue hence the two star rating.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome, when it works.  I barely had it 2 months, maybe charged it 3 times total, and it stopped charging.  I tried multiple outlets and it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  Never again Remington, never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews here on Amazon. I use it to trim my mustache and goatee every couple of weeks. It works great, no muss no fuss, and it&#x27;s inexpensive. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite like it.  I needed a stubble look and this one had a guard that prevented me to get that stubble look i was looking for.  I got another one that is specifically for stubble by Nerelco. Much, Much better than this one.  Brice was good.</li>
    <li> This razor does about everything you need it to do. For the money, it is hard beat. It feels sturdy. It is sharp, and makes a decent edger. The trimmer guard rolls up and down nice and give a good trim. I was actually debating on getting the 60 buck bad boy with the vacuum, but I&#x27;m glad I paid 15 for this instead. I&#x27;m happy so far. I&#x27;m sure the Norelco 60 buck is prob cooler, and maybe better, however this one is doing just fine.</li>
    <li> I have got this item and I like it very much, but problem is that charger is not working at all. Please give me advice.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ever!! Doesn&#x27;t pull my thick nappy hair. Gets a nice stubbly look and is easy to control the settings.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. Works really well. Easy to adjust. Easy to clean. Had my previous one for 5 years and only had to buy a new one because I dropped it and it landed on the guard and cracked it. My previous one was an older model, but looked exactly the same (except it was gray). So I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last just as long.</li>
    <li> When my Wahl wore out, I went looking for a substitute.  I got this prooduct.  The two things I don&#x27;t like about it are that it won&#x27;t work when plugged in with the charger -- the charger simply recharges the battery.  So if you want to use this thing, you have to make sure it is plugged in and charging for at least an hour before you use it.  The other thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it cuts unevenly.  I have to do my own scissors trim after I use this because some hairs are not trimmed.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this and just ordered a new Wahl brand -- one which supplies power through the outlet cord and cuts evenly.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. It&#x27;s compact and powerful. Last one he had had all sorts of attachments and didn&#x27;t come in a very sturdy holder. Was cumbersome and annoying. This is compact and has everything he needs for grooming.</li>
    <li> Battery runs out quickly.</li>
    <li> Battery dies so fast.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT work while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember how many times it died while trimming my beard and I had to wait for it to recharge</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.  Battery completely dead after 4 months of light use, and now the unit cannot hold a charge.  What a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is fine, but the battery life is atrocious. It loses a full charge in less than a day without even being used.</li>
    <li> Cheap, cordless, powerful, built-in adjustable guard. This baby has it all! Did I mention cheap? This is the second one i have bought after the first one&#x27;s battery finally died after many years of service. I NEVER buy the same electric device twice but there&#x27;s nothing better!</li>
    <li> This is a top notch product. It is constantly sharp and never pulls hairs. I have used it everyday for two months and have never had to charge it. It has nine settings and a close trim option. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Right from the start, the cut of my beard was a little uneven.  Looked ok right after, but two days later the variations in length made me want to trim again.  Then it started not keeping a good charge.  I have had it thirteen months, and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Maybe for $23 I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but now I will get something really good like the Wahl Peanut.</li>
    <li> This is a great and affordable trimmer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a almost two months now, and I&#x27;m liking it a lot.  No need to hassle with individual attachable guide combs to choose the length of hair you want to cut.  This trimmer an adjustable guide comb operated with a switch.  And battery life is excellent.  For the two months which I have been using it, I&#x27;ve only had to recharge only twice (I use it twice a week to do a quick touch-up on my facial hair and sideburns).  Overall, I would recommend this to any of my friends or family members.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is wonderful!  Easy to use with no extra trimmer blades to take off and have to store. Easy setting dial turns when you want it to and the trimmer guide stays on the settings and doesn&#x27;t move while using like some other trimmers! We are very satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer based on the multitude of good reviews. Everyone seemed to be impressed with the product. After using it for a few days, it has proved to be exactly what I needed. Has nine different lengths to choose from and you can even remove the trimmer guard to get close definition. Comes with a beard/mustache comb and cleaning brush. You can&#x27;t beat the value for this price!</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer simply works well, no problems.  Very inexpensive, easy to adjust the length of the trim, no pulled whiskers.  All good.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does everything it was advertised to do.  It&#x27;s easy to operate, and has held its first charge for over a month.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When the trimmer is working properly, it works wonderfully. The trimmer has plenty of power, and the trim adjustment range is more than adequate for me. Where it falls short, however, is in its ability to hold a charge. Like several other reviewers, mine worked great for the first few weeks, but now it only runs at full power (for about 10-15 seconds). It seemed like a great trimmer for the price, and it would be if it weren&#x27;t for its inability to hold a halfway decent charge.</li>
    <li> excellent product, product as stated - excellent service! A+</li>
    <li> Very usefull, better than anticitated. I use it at least every three days on my beard. For the money you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> I owned another Remmington beard trimmer for about 10 years and it was a good trimmer - solid construction, easy to take apart and clean. This model is a newer version of the same trimmer. The new trimmer works well but the adjustment of the attachment is not as good as the old one - it feels cheaper to me. Otherwise this is a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had many brands of trimmers and this one is the best so far.... The only down fall to this product is that it does not come with any accessories.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I have ever had. Now when I kiss the wife just after using it she doesn&#x27;t complain about sharp pokey things sticking her like needles!!!</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and this cut evenly and easily when fully charged. I also licked the height setting which was easy to use. So far so good</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for 4 months and can attest to its reliability and precision. It is a great product-easy to use, easy to clean, plenty of different settings. It also holds charge well.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is very strong and blades are too close to the edge when used as beard groomer without adjustable plastic.     UPDATE: Unit I received was replaced by Remington customers service. Customer service was quick to respond and issues was resolved quickly. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> No, this trimmer isn&#x27;t the best trimmer in the world. But for around $15, this trimmer does a really good job! I mostly use it to trim my entire face to get my beard short enough that I can use my electric foil shaver on it.   However, it also does a decent job of shortening hair too. It&#x27;s designed very well. You just move a wheel up and down to adjust the guard.   I wasn&#x27;t expecting the trimmer to be this good for so cheap, but it has exceeded my expectation. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a well made beard trimmer for quite sometime now.  I decided to check here on amazon as well as a few other sites before making the purchase.  I checked and read alot of reviews and the average for most seemed around 3-4 stars.  I decided to take the chance on this remington as I liked the idea of having the adjustment built in.  Upon arriving It seemed like a quality trimmer for the price.  I have already used it a few times and it has worked great.  I love how just turning the wheel you can put it on whatever adjustment you may need without fiddling around with clips.  At first I was concerned that it would not shave smooth because of the plastic head.  I soon found out the plastic top pops right off if you want just the razor itself to give you a close trim.  The only con I can see is the top cover that is used for the adjustment is made of plastic.  It seems durable enough but if it breaks it seems then the only thing this would be good for is a close shave. Overall for the price of 15$ it is well worth what I paid!</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself (which you have to remove to clean) has very cheap plastic taps that keep it on.  I&#x27;ve had it less than 6 months and it has to be thrown away. I&#x27;d spend a bit more money for something better.</li>
    <li> I always used Wahl trimmers but the last one i bought was a piece of junk so i switched to a Remington beard trimmer based on all the favorable reviews.I am very happy with my new purchase.It has good hand feel and balance and has many settings for various lengths.I used the lowest setting and was left with only a stubble of a beard but that was my own fault.I kind of like the look it gave me.There is no more oiling which is a nice feature.It came fully charged out of the package which was nice.There is no charging stand to hold unit while charging which is not a problem for me.All in all it seems to be a well built unit that should last for years....</li>
    <li> Spent quite a while comparing this product with more expensive alternatives, and I&#x27;m glad I let the cheapskate inside of me win out this time. The sliding head piece locks into place very nicely and never gives out under pressure leaving you with bald/short patches. Long battery life, nice to hold and use.  Overall a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times and have not had any problems.  It works as advertised, I would recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace one that my husband had for over 5 years.  He not only used it to shave his beard &amp; mustache, he also used it to cut his hair.  We had another trimmer to trim his hair but he felt like this trimmer did it even better.  The old one worked fine but it was no longer able to be charged so that&#x27;s why I bought this new one and it works equally as good.  My husband is very pleased with this product and for the money you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for less than a year.  It will not hold a charge longer than 1 week.  Since I use it approximately once a week, it means I must remember to plug it in the day before I use it.  Worse, you cannot use it when it is plugged into the wall recharging.  As far as its cutting ability, easy cleaning, and adjustability - it&#x27;s a great product.  Because of its non-existent battery life, I don&#x27;t consider it a cordless trimmer.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;plug it in the wall and wait several hours&amp;#34; trimmer.</li>
    <li> am very pleased with this trimmer-holds the charge a long time, I like the adjustment wheel, and is a great deal at this price. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Crap - doesnt work well, cheaply made</li>
    <li> Lousy battery.  Not even 2 years and it stopped taking a charge.  Not being able to at least run it THROUGH the charger just ads insult to injury.</li>
    <li> These things last forever and are versatile. Easy hair cuts for head, face, body and beyond.</li>
    <li> This trimer was great until a week ago. Just under 2 years old and now won&#x27;t hold a charge. Also, when battery dead cannot use while plugged in to charge. Disappointed that battery lasted less than 2 years and cannot use while plugged in.</li>
    <li> Used 3 times and now will not hold a charge or work plugged in.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t work with very short hair that you are shaping. For example shaping the edge of your mustache, but it covers everything else and odds are you already have a trimmer appropriate for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Reasonably good for the price. The battery is a problem - have always had to remember to charge it hours in advance to get a single use out of it, and it has gotten worse over time. Three years later, the trimmer is practically unusable because the battery won&#x27;t charge, and am finally upgrading to a more expensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> For all the bad reviews on here, you guys need to get a life or understand quality. The people who put less then 4 stars are used to cheap things and can&#x27;t afford this. Well in all other case this item is very good and literally better then any trimmer I have ever used. It&#x27;s battery is long and has great power to it. I would choose this over any trimmer.</li>
    <li> As many other people have noted here, the battery life is terrible. I have used mine once a week, and it has lasted less than two years before it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I get about 5 minutes of run time from a charge before the battery expires. Worse, despite the fact the product comparison chart on Amazon.com says \\&quot;Corded/Cordless\\&quot;, mine doesn&#x27;t function if I plug it in. So an otherwise good beard trimmer when it worked, is now a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewed said, I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another Remington.</li>
    <li> Works great when it&#x27;s charged. Problem is it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long. 2 or 3 trimmings at most is all you&#x27;ll get and then recharge again. My old one lasted for years and held a charge for weeks with multiple uses. Guess that&#x27;s the way it is these days. Cheap components, poor quality{made in china},high prices. I miss the good ole days.</li>
    <li> Updated review: I contacted customer support after my original trimmer stopped holding a charge after 2 years. They sent me a replacement trimmer free of charge. After a year the trimmer is still holding a charge and working well. Time will tell how long it will last...</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Does it&#x27;s job efficiently and having the option of 9 different length settings is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do have a few gripes:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery Life. This thing will not last more than a single use per charge. You must always keep this thing plugged in when you are not using it. I would fully charge it, use it once, not charge it, then try and use it a second time on the same charge. It would die on me halfway through the trim and have me looking like a patchy half-shaved man. If you are okay with single charge single use, then this won&#x27;t be a problem for you. But if you&#x27;re like me and would not rather always keep a charger on your bathroom counter, then look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;2) This is NOT a detailer! This device is used to trim all your beard hair to the same length for an even look all around. Even when you take the top off of the device, is provides an inadequate job of detailing your beard. You are better off using a simple razor to shape your beard.&lt;br /&gt;3) Figuring out how to take the top off is more difficult than it should be. You must first turn the setting to the highest, 9, then pull it off-- for anyone wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if these things aren&#x27;t issues for you, then this is a FANTASTIC trimmer for the price. I&#x27;m still using mine in conjunction with my razor to have a clean looking beard everyday.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned. The 1st lasted several years until the battery would no longer hold a charge. It is so inexpensive &amp; easy to use. Keeps your beard looking trimmed &amp; neat with very little effort. No multiple attachments to deal with. Simple &amp; effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these things over the past few years (I dropped the first one and the battery died completely in the 2nd) and I&#x27;m never buying one again.  The battery is horrific -- it takes a full day to completely charge, although there is no indicator of charging status whatsoever (only a green light to tell you it&#x27;s taking a charge, but it never shuts off.)  Leaving it unplugged for just 1-2 days and the battery gets almost completely depleted without ever turning it on.  And the worst:  IT DOESN&#x27;T RUN OFF A/C CURRENT WHILE PLUGGED IN.  That&#x27;s right, if your battery is dead you can&#x27;t do squat with it, you have to leave it charging for a full day first.  This thing is complete junk, avoid it!</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer for my son who broke his while away at college. It fell off his dresser and crashed to the floor. It is the same trimmer that he had before and he really liked it. He&#x27;s very happy with this trimmer and so he asked the same Remington trimmer if I could get one and I did. Amazon shipped it to his dorm quickly</li>
    <li> This item claims it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair while shaving and that&#x27;s all it did! Remington is usually reliable and I always buy Remington products so I was disappointed to try this out and have it not perform as expected. I use these kind of trimmers to shave my facial hair and this thing kept pulling my hairs as I was attempting to shave my face. I returned it for a refund, but I just wanted to let people know that it does pull your hair. The description says it doesn&#x27;t, but it does.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and holds a charge for well over a week.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve really let my beard grow in and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how simple this makes it to keep myself looking presentable.</li>
    <li> Very poor battery life.This is what you get for such a price.In the future I would only go for a Panasonic even though they are a little expensive.</li>
    <li> battery stays charged only one day. If you want it to be ready you must keep it on the charger. Might as well have a regular plug in trimmer. Absolutely no good for travel!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;vee had this product was the year, the battery has already died.I did exactly what the instructions told me to do, give it a big charge when I first got it. I use the battery until it dieD everytime before recharging. The battery just did not last. Also, if you want to keep a longer beard trimmed this one is not for you.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in many other reviews, this machine is only a couple of years old and the batteries will not hold a charge, in contrast to the old MB70 that it replaced. Furthermore, it&#x27;s not a great trimmer either; it requires going over the same site numerous times and at very specified angles.</li>
    <li> UGH! This is a decent razor while it lasts.  I had two, the first one broke when i was cleaning it.  The little hinge that locks the blades in place and the blades would not stay seated.  Amazon replace it for free.  I get the second arrives and it works great.... until the battery stops holding a charge!!  It lasted about a year and that is without heavy usage.  Maybe there are some lemons out there, it does work well when it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost two years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. The handle feels well-built and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wearing out anytime soon. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor. However, there are two things you should know about before buying it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The razor only works off the battery and charges take a couple hours. I trim around once a week and I have to recharge the razor the night before. It won&#x27;t work if you plug it into the wall with a dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The length scale is shorter than the standard barber units of 1 &#x3D; 1/8 of an inch. This isn&#x27;t really a big deal because you can just look at the plastic guard and see how far from the blade it is, but it took me a close shave to learn this. Maybe there are beard trimmer standards I don&#x27;t know about though.</li>
    <li> A very good groomer.&lt;br /&gt;My previous one was poor because the comb setting would not stay as set.  This one works GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Battery life is terrible. I have a Phillips that sits for a month and works flawlessly, this will die in days. Plus it&#x27;s not the best for tight beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Works great, but the part with the trimmer blade breaks off to easily if dropped.  I&#x27;ve had 3 of these...all of &#x27;em broke when I dropped them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done with this one!</li>
    <li> Has great power and work very well I like the rotating head level and how well it recharges. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> this product came free(?) with a panasonic razor.  does a okay job but does not hold a charge.  would not purchase as a single item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this beard trimmer 5 months ago for my fella- he loved it until it just stopped working or taking any charge whatsoever (we even ordered a new charger from Remington) about 5 months in. I e-mailed Remington and they told me to mail the trimmer and my receipt to them and they would further investigate. 3 weeks later, they sent a brand new and way upgraded model to us free of charge! Thank you Remington- I am so impressed by your customer service!</li>
    <li> Had one previously and love it.</li>
    <li> This remington beard and mustache trimmer product works well very easy to use and excellent price charge holds well no problems to date recommend</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great but the battery is lousy.  The batteries only last about two years and can&#x27;t be replaced, so you have to throw the whole trimmer away and buy another one.  I&#x27;d pay more for one with a good LiPo or Li-on battery. And the battery should be replaceable!</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple years ago and it used to give great trims. It is much better than those 5 in 1 trimmers, nose clipper things. I actually have a good beard that needs to be maintained. The problem now is that the charge doesn&#x27;t hold anymore. I used to be able to get 7 trims out of this with a few days of non use in between. Now I can get maybe two but after the first trim I can&#x27;t wait more than a day or the battery loses its charge. It also takes a significant amount of time to charge now as well and if I forget to plug it in the night before it won&#x27;t have enough juice to trim in the 30-45 min it takes me to get ready. I know its been a few years so I should have expected it but it&#x27;s still a perfectly good trimmer it&#x27;s just the battery that sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The settings dont shift and if you press hard on your face it wont change the length of the trim so you&#x27;ll get a nice even trim&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago, loved it, sad when it died, so now years later I bought again, works great, good price</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Does exactly what I need it to do and at a great price too!</li>
    <li> I had three wahl trimmers before buying this Remington this one was less expensive and does a much better job than any of those ever did</li>
    <li> Love it for a goatee trimmer.  The only downside is that when the battery goes dead you can&#x27;t trim while the unit is charging.</li>
    <li> Worked great for at least a year. Now the battery won&#x27;t keep a charge, so it&#x27;s a worthless. It doesn&#x27;t work plugged in while you are charging it either. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> Wimpy hinge broke while cleaning hair out of the cutting element by tapping on a sink basin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for beard trimming or as a body groomer. Plastic head can pop off, or stay on and is the easiest adjustment possible. Great blades, attractive design, and works corded or cordless. One caveat may be obvious, but do not plug into 230V abroad -- blew it out in Ireland.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Had for about a month and works as expected. No frills. Just a good electric trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping that it was the product in entirety as a gift. When I opened the box, it seemed incredibly light, so when I opened the actual product, I realized that everything was missing except the razor itself. There was not paperwork, and no wireless charger for it to sit on. As it was sent, I could only has possibly used it once until it ran out of charge. Absolutely returned and bought the real product in store. It&#x27;s worth $20+ to make the product able to be used more than once.</li>
    <li> I grow light, soft facial hair as opposed to the manly stubble you would see on television commercials, so finding the right trimmer to keep my facial hair looking short and fashionable has been difficult. I have purchased several beard trimmers over the past few months, including the wahl 9818 $70 trimmer which I returned the same day it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;  This little Remington mb-200 has worked out remarkably. Its solid, powerful, and the length guard cuts pretty close to the face without having to make numerous passes over the same area. It keeps me looking as though I have 3 days growth on my face 7 days a week, which is exactly what I am going for. And that&#x27;s not even the shortest setting.&lt;br /&gt;  I totally recommend this trimmer for its performance, extensive length settings, and the right price. I&#x27;m a Remington guy from here on.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Works great. I have had other trimmers but this is the best so far. Easy to use, trims smoothly, and battery life is great - used it over a month without a recharge yet.</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail really fast - was very excited. Plugged it in for the recommended 16 hours however it didnt charge.&lt;br /&gt;The charge light lit up for the first 10 minutes of charging before going out. I was unable to use this product at all !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;very dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on its useability as I simply couldn&#x27;t even turn it on!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a terrible experience</li>
    <li> I had a goatee trimmer like this that I have been using for 6 or 7 years. I decided to upgrade to a fancy beard trimmer a couple of months ago, and my goatee has been a mess ever since. I saw this trimmer by chance on Amazon, so I picked it up because it was at a low price. I love it! It gives a close trim, easy to hold, and is a no nonsense. This is a lot like the one I bought years ago, I should have stuck with what worked instead of wasting money to upgrade.</li>
    <li> Works great when it is charged.  Will only hold a charge for a few days after charging overnight.  Cant use it while it is charging either, only works on the battery.  Have to plan ahead and charge overnight to use it the next morning.  Kind of a pain.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was great while it lasted.. But after around 15 uses, the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
    <li> It works great for the first 6 months, but than it begins to become more weak. I found I had trouble with it holding a charge or the speed of the blade. The plastic pivot points used to open the head for cleaning are weak, mine broke earlier this week after 9 months of sporadic use. Was actually going to buy another one until I saw the price is now 25$. I&#x27;ll hold off or buy a different kind.</li>
    <li> It was working great until a short drop, with no visible damage, killed it. I bought another since they were still half off at the time and another short drop killed it again.</li>
    <li> Barely lasted a year before I couldn&#x27;t take anymore. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and doesn&#x27;t operate off of AC while charging. Spend the extra $8 and get a model/brand that does. Working, when you need it, is really the only important feature that matters.</li>
    <li> As a beard trimmer it is good. A mustache trimmer has a smaller head for detailing,this item has none. The name of this item is VERY deceiving. You cannot trim your mustache with the wide head.</li>
    <li> I spent several months looking at trimmers with a couple of criteria:&lt;br /&gt;1. Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;2. Able to create the 2-day look (ability to trim down to tiny lengths)&lt;br /&gt;  After reading probably hundreds of reviews, I finally decided to order this one and go for it. Based on a general concensus of those reviews, the battery life was supposed to be great, it could trim hair down to minuscule stubble, and had a resounding reputation for its simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;  Three months after receiving it, I am still highly satisfied and would not have changed my decision for any other similar price/quality ratio. In that entire time, I have used it around twice a week and have only had to recharge the unit two times. I definitely recommend this trimmer!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST!!!  for $25 you get a good face trimmer that will last.  i still have the one i bought 5 years ago, and i know use that on my head and this new one on my beard.  wish i could give it 6 stars... peace</li>
    <li> The cheap battery in this thing is reason enough not to buy it.  Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll charge it per instructions, use it for 5 minutes, come back to it 2-3 days later and find there&#x27;s 8 seconds of juice left before it disappoints you and forces you to charge it again.  Oh, and you can&#x27;t use while the AC adapter is plugged in. You have to wait for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and before you say, \\&quot;all rechargeable batteries act that way!\\&quot;. No, no they don&#x27;t.  My Norelco Spectra goes months on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this junk, even for the low cost.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I only have a patch of hair on my chin that I shave twice a week... so there is minimal use and I don&#x27;t have overly think hair.  That being said, I have not had any issues with this as of yet.  The guard (length setting) works great and has not slipped at all.  I don&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m pushing hard against the guard, and so maybe with a lot of pressure it would slip, though with normal use I haven&#x27;t had ANY issues yet.  Additionally, I have not had this long enough to evaluate the battery, but since I&#x27;m always next to a outlet and only using it for 3-5 minutes at a time it is not something I&#x27;m overly concerned with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this works great for my purposes: short shaves on a small area of the face about 2x/wk.</li>
    <li> When this dies, I&#x27;ll look to another company. As a trimmer, it&#x27;s fine, but the battery leaves much to be desired. I probably use it once a week, and have to remember to plug it in to charge before I want to use it, or else the battery will be nearly empty (when plugged in, it only charges the battery, it won&#x27;t run from being plugged into an outlet).</li>
    <li> It pains me to give this trimmer such a bad review. The trimmer itself is EXACTLY what I want. Great adjustments. Does a fantastic job on trimming everything from my beard to sideburns to whatever. However, here I am less than two years after my purchase and I am looking for another trimmer. Why? The battery has died. Worse, though it is described as \\&quot;corded/cordless\\&quot;, it only works cordless. In other words, even though you can have the trimmer plugged in, it still runs on battery (which won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore). I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I could just plug in and use the trimmer corded but I can&#x27;t. And the batteries aren&#x27;t replaceable. Yes, I did follow the instructions on battery maintenance but nothing helps. Looking at the owner&#x27;s manual, I see that the MB-300 does operate with AC. However, it doesn&#x27;t look like they make it anymore (if they ever did) so I&#x27;m stuck. Does Remington really expect us to buy a new one of these every 18 months?</li>
    <li> This is a pube trimmer. Who the hell wants a beard on their face in this day and age. This thing trims pubic and it does it well. I already knew this before I purchased the product because my roommate had an older model of the same product and it worked great too! Well now he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting my short and curlies in his beard anymore (Not that he ever knew) because I&#x27;ve got my own. A+++++</li>
    <li> I owned the initial version of this trimmer and absolutely LOVED it.  The charge lasted forever and it&#x27;s just a solid little trimmer that feels comfortable, gives you good, clean and even length settings and is very easy to clean.  However, I dropped it once and the mechanism that snapped the top part on broke.  My fault, so I was fine, but it was just too loose to be effective anymore.  When they went on sale for $9.99 last year around this time, I was so excited ordered 5 of them, 2 for me and 3 as gifts.  When I received them, I noticed they were a different color and in different boxing, but didn&#x27;t think much of it since the design looked identical.  Well, I have been using it over the last month after growing my beard back, and I am sorry to say that the newer version&#x27;s battery is terrible.  As other reviewers have said, it IS far worse than other trimmer battery lives, and the fact that you can&#x27;t use it plugged in is a huge design flaw. Here&#x27;s the problem:  you start trimming your beard and the charge seems strong, but then in the middle it just poops out on you.  Well, would be great if you could just plug in and finish the job, but no...you basically have to walk around with a half trimmed beard and hope the stupid thing charges fast.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the thing works great when it&#x27;s fully charged...but if it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, that&#x27;s a huge problem, because anyone who has a beard knows you aren&#x27;t going to trim the thing every day.  AND the fact that the initial version&#x27;s battery held a charge forever tells me they cheaped out on the battery of the newer version, which completely destroys the integrity of what was a fantastic product.  My old broken one still holds a charge forever, so I know this to be true.  It&#x27;s just a shame...</li>
    <li> I went through tons of reviews here about this product before I decided to buy it.  Some raised the issue of the trimmer not being able to hold a charge or even work when plugged in.  Since the overall rating of the trimmer was good (about 4.5 out of 5 stars) I ended up discounting these criticisms as flukes.  I bought the trimmer and, for the first month or so it worked great.  The trimmer itself is actually pretty good, which I think is the reason it has mostly positive reviews - most people reviewed it as soon as they got it, long before problems with the charge developed.  But after a month or so it got progressively worse in holding a charge.  Today, two and a half months after I bought it the thing not only barely holds a charge, now it won&#x27;t even charge at all!  Plugging it in now does nothing, rendering it absolutely useless.  Unlike some of the reviewers who blamed the problem partially on their own poor maintenance (like leaving it plugged in constantly), I was careful not to leave it plugged in after it had finished charging.  Even still, the thing only managed to last a couple of months.  Its basically a disposable trimmer.  Its just not worth it.  Pay more and get a normal trimmer.</li>
    <li> This baby is light, durable and has a nice range of lengths. Works good on pubes, too!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a small case, though.</li>
    <li> Had this trimmer for about 8 months.  Certainly did a good job, and I liked the adjustable head, but then&lt;br /&gt;the battery started to go a couple of months back, and a charge would last less and less time, until finally&lt;br /&gt;it now only runs a minute or less - not enough for even one careful trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if one could run it off house power, but for some odd reason the battery charger only&lt;br /&gt;charges the battery, it won&#x27;t run the trimmer.  So if the battery is dead and you need a quick trim, you&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;simply out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.  It&#x27;s actually a good little unit otherwise, but only 6 months of solid operation (and only occasional use)&lt;br /&gt;is just not acceptable.  I&#x27;d rather pay more up front for something that will last longer. Or at least will let me use it&lt;br /&gt;plugged in if I need to. (My old Remington cost a little more, but lasted over 3 years, and could be run off&lt;br /&gt;a wall socket as well as batteries - this was the &#x27;replacement model&#x27; - a huge step backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are too many people here with the same complaint (or even worse versions) to feel I just got a rare&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;lemon&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well and the guard holds in place well (I thought it would push to a lower level as I pushed it against my face but it holds fine).  One thing I have noticed recently is it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  It used to last 3-4 trims before needing a charge, now it lasts one shave, and I haven&#x27;t used it that much at all.  I would be ok with this IF I could use the trimmer while plugged in, but I can&#x27;t.  It allows me to turn it on while plugged in, but it doesn&#x27;t use the wall power, it still uses battery power and dies right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great trimmer, but I wish it held a charge better.</li>
    <li> trimmer works really good and is better than shaving every day</li>
    <li> As lots of others have stated, this thing is a piece of crap. Will not hold a charge even when not in use. Going on vacation for two days? Prepare for it to be dead when you arrive after giving it a full charge before you leave. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The 9 different lenght settings is great for trimming kids hair and daddys beard. Keep in mind you cannot use the device while it&#x27;s plugged in for charging.</li>
    <li> The trimmer must be charged overnight before use, and is not able to run from wall power (A/C power source) when the battery is dead. Garbage.</li>
    <li> I liked this clipper well enough when it still held a charge, but after 2 years that was no longer the case. It was only used every 2-4 weeks. The built-in guard is great, though, and has a good number of length settings.</li>
    <li> Is the trimmer of solid build?  Yes.  Is it more than capable of a nice even trim of a full beard (and then some) on a full charge?  Yes.  Does mine still trim as well as it did 18 months after purchasing it?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 3-star review?  The first star (and I almost took off 2 for this alone) is because I was shipped a trimmer that had obviously sat on the shelves for a long time, which made my battery nearly DOA.  Less than 3 months after purchasing it, the battery wouldn&#x27;t last 5 minutes, so it was off to Batteries Plus to spend almost as much as I did on the trimmer just to replace the battery.  That battery is still going strong, and based on other reviews, I expect it to go a while longer.  The second star is for using soldered-in NiCad batteries instead of NiMH (free or soldered).  I used free-standing NiMH batteries with the previous generation of this trimmer (which had a battery compartment instead of them being soldered-in) and they worked fantastically, so I have no doubt they would have worked well here.  The charge times would be shorter and the run times would be longer, and the shaver would be much more eco-friendly.  Because let&#x27;s face it, are most people going to take their trimmer to a battery recycling facility or a Batteries Plus when their trimmer dies after 3 months?  No, they&#x27;re going to throw the trimmer, NiCad battery and all, in the trash, and buy another one for barely more than replacing the battery would have cost.</li>
    <li> This is definetly on of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve had. No complaints.  I jusy wished it had a vacuum because it leaves hairs all around.</li>
    <li> My old Remington MB-10 lasted a very long time.  Must be something like 10-15 years.  The motor finally died, so I needed a replacement.  Found something from another brand at a discount department store for ten bucks.  What a piece of junk that was.  I returned that that day after I bought it.  Just ordered the Remington MB-200 on Amazon.  If the quality is as good as my old Remington beard trimmer, I expect to be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Remington has made a great product.  It does exactly what it advertises: trims beards and mustaches.  The 10 adjustable settings can keep your beard looking long or short.  And it effectively defines contours for beards.  This is my first beard trimmer and I did not want to mess up all those weeks of beard growing by getting an inferior beard trimmer.  The battery life is pretty good as far as I can tell.  I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it since I got it a couple of months ago.  I think it is also a little more affordable than the other beard trimmers of its kind. &lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems yet.  It does exactly what I want it to do.  Sort of a bland compliment, but one of a high order all the same.  Recomended for what it&#x27;s worth from a random stranger.</li>
    <li> the shaver really only does a poor-ok job.  It does nothing to make maintenance of my beard easier.  Seems there are cheap products at Walmart, just as good, cheaper.</li>
    <li> Remington used to make decent trimmers but now the cutters are so cheap that they&#x27;re more likely to yank your hair out than trim it.  Their customer service is horrendous.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I got a trimmer from walmart without seeing any reviews about that product. It looks good but works bad. I returned that and looking for a good one. I have a good experience with amazon from a long time. I believe their reviews it really works for me. I found this trimmer with a good review and got it. This is really a good trimmer better than my previous one. Works great,fast and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and the prompt shipping from the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer as my main tool for shaving since I bought it about a year and a half ago, using it once a week on average. Very happy until a few weeks ago, when I kept running out of power every time I&#x27;d shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery won&#x27;t retain its charge beyond the first 24 hours after charging (for however long). Problem is the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work when plugged. So basically now every time I want to use the trimmer I have to charge it just before for at least half an hour, which makes it unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still 2 stars because it wasn&#x27;t a very expensive purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this in may of 2012.  I use it once or twice a week to trim my beard.  The battery now dies after just one or two uses and needs to be recharged.  You can&#x27;t use the clippers while they are being recharged.  This has made me late on a couple of occasions because I get half way through trimming my beard and the battery dies. Then I have to wait for it to charge before I can finish trimming my beard.  I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted 5 years before I bought this one. I don&#x27;t see why this one only lasted 3 months.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LASTS!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, good seller.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works well. A much better approach to trimming my beard than I&#x27;ve been using for many years.</li>
    <li> Worked great for nine months; sharp.  No longer holds a charge.  Will not buy from Remington again.</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington MB 35 over 10 years ago the battery just stopped holding a charge The MB 200 appears to be identical just a different color, I love it expect 10 more years of being well groomed</li>
    <li> This works really well as a beard trimmer, except for one small but critical flaw- you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging. And the battery sucks, so it won&#x27;t hold a charge very long. Which means you have to charge it every time you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that you are never able to just pick it up and start using it, you have to &amp;#34;plan&amp;#34; a couple of hours ahead each time. Useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the actual trimming part works great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this new trimmer that I gave him for Christmas!  His old one had broken and I did a lot of research before choosing this one.  I am so glad that he loves it, because he&#x27;s a picky guy!!</li>
    <li> Uneven trimming, and now it will not hold a charge. Plugged in to recharge for 48 hrs, unplugged to use once and in less than 24 hours the trimmer will not run until recharged for 8-10 hours. Would not purchase this product agian and discourage others from purchasing.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for me</li>
    <li> Once the Rechargeable Battery no longer holds a charge the Device stops working even though you have it plugged into the outlet. The user manual states that the plug is only for recharging the device not to be used to operate the device. I wish this detail was properly advertised!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming and grooming my beard for 40 years, and I&#x27;ve gone through countless beard trimmers. Most of them were acceptable, but NOTHING compared to this one! No joke folks, this is by far the very best trimmer I&#x27;ve used! It&#x27;s easy to adjust, powerful, holds a charge for a long time &amp; light weight. It&#x27;s easy to see and feel the high quality. Go on guys, jump in and treat yourself!</li>
    <li> This is a well made product. It re-placed my Norelco which is made by Phillips and I&#x27;ve never had a product from Phillips worth a crap.(t.v. ,cd player, boom box just a few) . This trimmer holds a charge and is easy to use. I highly recommend this product. I even shaved my head with it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality trimmer. The best part about it is, the battery. I use it on and off every 3-4 days, and still I have charged it just 4-5 times the last 45 days. Its got a good, strong motor- very efficient. I owned a norelco before, but that was definitely a pansy as compared to this.</li>
    <li> The color is a little different now, but I have had this (otherwise)same trimmer for 5 years. The battery finally stopped holding a charge a couple of days ago-but I am still using it with the cord plugged in. I haven&#x27;t been careful charging it at all, so 5 years is probably pretty good. Especially for the price...It trims to a consistent adjustable height, and by removing the adjustable comb it is a very good detail trimmer for the sideburns and beard edges. When I have been lazy for a few days, I use it to to do a \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t trash my razor. You don&#x27;t need to spend more money, this will do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I bought the trimmer because I saw it was on sale at the time and had been looker for one. I was a little reluctant at first but four stars isn&#x27;t bad. Some of the poor ratings for not having this such as a stand are unfair complaints since you didn&#x27;t purchase an expensive trimmer with a stand. It does everything its supposed to and works great.     After a few months of use, my trimmer stopped working. I contacted customer service. Within 24 hrs I had a reply with simple detailed instructions on getting a replacement. Shipped it out next day. In less than two weeks time I had my replacement trimmer. Awesome support from Remington.</li>
    <li> Having had a beard since 1974 I have had my share of trimmers.  What I like about this one is that the head is easily adjusted by rotating a wheel.  It holds a charge for a very long time.  And it cuts cleanly.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I have ever used. I trim my beard around twice a week and have had to charge this thing once in 7 months. The adjustable wheel is much better than searching for and changing heads.</li>
    <li> I use the lowest setting and it is pretty good. so far has stayed sharp. I do wish it could cut shorter since i like a stubble look but you cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a beard expert, or one with long-standing experience in the matter, but this trimmer did everything I wanted it to: cut hairs without hurting me, and keep to uniform lengths, with lots of options for what lengths to set it at. Fine, just fine.</li>
    <li> Initially, this thing works great.  Holds a charge, does its job, etc.  But after only 22 months the batteries no longer hold a charge for more than a few seconds.  Nothing else is worn out and there&#x27;s no way to replace the battery yourself.  I think a ~$30 trimmer should last longer than that.</li>
    <li> The ability to adjust the height of the cut and the ease of use makes this a must buy for those who like to keep their beards neatly trimmed.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product. Beats my prior Norelco by miles. Holds a charge for over a week or more. The adjustable head holds its position something other products have a hard time with.</li>
    <li> When it came time to finally replace my trusty old Norelco I was a bit leery of ordering something online, but the number of positive reviews and the fantastic price convinced me to purchase it. After serveral months I can say I am very pleased with this trimmer. It is solid and well built. It has very good battery life. It is comfortable to use and does a great job! I had thought of buying a more expensive model that would vacuum clippings, or one that would operate while plugged in (for those occasions where you forget to charge it) but hours of reading reviews left me concerned about complaints of poor performance and flimsy parts. I&#x27;m glad I saved myself some potential aggravation and money too! Shortly after getting this I recommended it to a friend, he ordered one and is also very pleased!</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer better than my previous one because with this one all I have to do is rotate a dial to select the length of hair to be cut. With my old one, I had to change the covers to do that. To get the right length with the new one, I started with the highest setting and worked my way down.   The trimmer could be a bit smaller, but it looks well built. If it is like the Remington shavers I&#x27;ve had, it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my Braun electric razor developed a problem with the power button: it wouldn&#x27;t stay turned off. I got this for a quick, neaten-up while considering another razor purchase. I never made one; this does the job for me and cost so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it&#x27;s intended uses it works very well. But I use if for shaving. Here&#x27;s how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull of the front, adjustable head and leave the bare cutting edge exposed. Drag that across your face. Not back and forth, just drag. WOW! It is fast and leaves just a stubble. That&#x27;s just the way I wanted and it works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When new it held a charge for a long, long time. Now, with age, a full charge doesn&#x27;t last quite as long. Nut, hey, it has a long life left in it still; and when it finally goes, I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it. Thanks Amazon for a useful and efficient product!</li>
    <li> I have recent decided to grow out my beard and need something to clean it up a little.  This product was on sell for 15 bucks or something like that and already had great reviews.  I have also used this to trim the hair over my 4 year old&#x27;s ear in between hair cuts.  The guard that is part of the unit doesn&#x27;t slip off like other models i have used and I feel comfortable using it on my face and my sons hair.  There are 9 levels that the trimmer can be set to as well. Great Product for someone looking to maintain a nice clean beard.</li>
    <li> My first shaver was a 3 circular blade one. Only problem was it had no height settings and didn&#x27;t cut the hair, only ripped it out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver IS AWESOME. It has bunch of height settings with a height adjuster clipped onto it, and is easily taken off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it off and shaved my beard off in 30sec, and I have a HUGE beard. My old \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; took at least 5-10min to painfully remove the hair and clean the clogged up \\&quot;blades\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can even be used to easily shave/trim \\&quot;down there\\&quot; or your arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t get you baby smooth, but it will get you nice and shaven very quick. If you want baby smooth, just use a razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No batteries needed, it uses a plug just like a cellphone to keep it charged. It should stay charged for many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be it doesn&#x27;t have a stand, but I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This is a good no frills trimmer.  It is inexpensive and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It gives a nice cut and has good maneuverability.  I previously had a Norelco turbo vacuum trimmer which I loved which seemed to be quicker and the built in vacuum left significantly less mess behind too (so my wife liked it better too).   If I had it to do again, I would probably get the Norelco just because the extra 5 minutes spent between the cut and cleanup can be a big difference in the morning (and with getting the kids ready in the morning... being done 5 minutes faster can be huge).  But at ~$35 more, is that worth it to you?  But honestly, the 2 products are 2 different price points and it is probably an unfair comparison.  This does what is advertised to do and does it well.</li>
    <li> works gr8 .. i had a panasonic one before this but this one blade speed is far better and battery life is good too. no probs so far</li>
    <li> Does the job. Plenty of lengths and consistent on length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery type is a little annoying as it&#x27;s better to be totally drained to improve the battery life unlike most electronics which have the type that should be fully charged. But that&#x27;s my only qualm. It&#x27;s great for this price range.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my goatee and it&#x27;s been going strong for 2 years.  I only use it about 1 time per week or so, so it only requires charging about every 4-5 months (maybe even less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to clean, and adjust.  not much else to say</li>
    <li> And I had a few, even Remington&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This model is stronger, more durable and its battery lasts for much longer than the other models I had.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using MB-200 for almost a year and I can count on one hand the number of times it needed to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;One important note: when I bought the trimmer, it cost $14.77. As it&#x27;s strongly recommended, it might not be as appealing for $24.99.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on Amazon before deciding to buy this trimmer. I bought this over a year ago, so I have had good time to review its effectiveness. Note that I have never owned a trimmer prior to this so I do not know what is common to all of them, or even unique for that matter, so I will just describe what I have liked (pros) and disliked (cons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cover protects face from sharp blades&lt;br /&gt;-zoom wheel with numbered stops (incredibly useful)&lt;br /&gt;-firm build&lt;br /&gt;-cordless&lt;br /&gt;-charge seems to last a good while&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning brush included&lt;br /&gt;-small comb included&lt;br /&gt;-great price ($15 at the time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-cannot use while charging (if you hear it dying out, and want to quickly connect the charger and use it, forget it. It needs time to charge, it&#x27;s not a laptop in this regard. So, charge it every so often.)&lt;br /&gt;-no charging base&lt;br /&gt;-cannot stand on its own; can only lay down&lt;br /&gt;-washable?!? I don&#x27;t know. Amazon&#x27;s bullet-point description says that it is not washable, but further down on the product page under product description, Remington has a table displaying four of their models and there is distinctly says that this model has  washable design. I looked on Remington&#x27;s website, but did not find anything that clarifies this. Well, I&#x27;m not taking any chances, so I&#x27;d avoid dunking this in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great trimmer. At the time of purchase, this product was $15. Now, it is $24.99. There are some other Remington models that are higher-end, or appear that way, and they are about the same as the current price. But, overall, I would say that this has been a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product years ago and loved it! I thought that I would never be able to find the product again until I looked here. It was wonderful! It was exactly like what I purchased before and was brand new! It arrived fast. It was so easy and wonderful! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This trimmer gives me just the right amount of stubble and is pain free. So far the battery has been holding up well. It even lasts awhile in between charges. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once since I&#x27;ve owned it. It&#x27;s adjustable too in case you want to keep your facial hair short and even or have it grow out longer.</li>
    <li> this is the third one I have purchased, lost the power cord to the first and lost the end part that controls the settings on the second, works great, we even use it for hair cuts on the guys</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer that could trim very short and this does the job perfectly. It has many settings for guard height and charges quickly. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This does everything that I need it to.  I use it to trim my sideburns and even my eyebrows.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to remove the guard, but I have only myself to blame as I have not even opened the manual.</li>
    <li> This thing has kept me and my beard happy for 8 years now. The only warning I would give is that the battery DOES NOT LAST when it is not hooked up to the wall. For instance, don&#x27;t charge it and put it in your bag and expect to shave when you get to your hotel, it WILL be dead. The ONLY reason this thing is cordless is so that you can unplug it from the wall immediately before using it and then not have to fuss with the cord, and then plug it right back in afterwards. The battery is NOT so that you can haul it in your pack and shave on a mountain in Glacier National Park. This of course makes sense though, it takes a lot of power to get those blades moving and this design of battery is not the same as in your phone or laptop. This battery has to deliver a pretty high speed and lengthy amount of mechanical work, not just lights or computation. So I&#x27;m fine with the battery failing when it sits idle for a long time. The battery is only so you can shave without getting tangled in a cord, despite standing directly next to an outlet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a full-beard, yet. But it will be here soon. In the mean time, I use this to keep the hair trimmed low, which keeps me from having to worry about my not-even-close beard from looking extremely hideous. The battery lasts forever and the trim levels actually lock on this product.</li>
    <li> I heavily researched what&#x27;s out there and am glad I decided on the Remington MB-200. It&#x27;s strong and fast, and makes it an ease to switch between settings. If you like simple and strong at a reasonable price, this is a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be exactly as I expected.  I replaced a much older Remington trimmer with this one.  It is every bit as efficient as the old one.  Molded to fit comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl hair trimmer because it only had 1/4\\&quot; and 1/2\\&quot; guards and I wanted more control over the length (1/8th inch or finer).  I also wanted something that did not have to be plugged in while using so I could use it in the shower stall with a shaving mirror.  This meets all the requirements and I have been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use -&gt; Very Good&lt;br /&gt;The device has a guard that easily adjusts with a dial on the device to give you various lengths.  Much more convenient than replacing guards for different lengths and much more fine grained control of length.  I also take the guard off completely to make clean lines around the edges over the lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Build Quality -&gt; Very Good&lt;br /&gt;It has good grips for using with wet hands and when I have dropped it (a couple times) it was fine.  I have not attempted to submerge it or even use it while the shower is going, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it deals with being wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging -&gt; OK&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for a long time.  However, when it runs down you can&#x27;t plug it in and then use it while it is charging.  This would be more convenient and a feature I would like to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Overall -&gt; Very happy and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I owned an older, and the battery eventually died.  Since the shave was good, I bought the newest model.  Big mistake, as the new model has a battery that will not hold a charge for more than a couple of shaves.  Worse yet, you cannot attach the power cord and use the shaver while it is charging up.  The end result is this is good for 2-3 beard trims, after which you have to recharge for a day.  One of the reasons I bought this was for travel, and being able to leave the cord behind.  Since that will not work, I found this machine to be useless for my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a worn out Phillips Norelco trimmer I&#x27;d been using for 3+ years. After less than one year&#x27;s use, this Remington had worse battery life and duller blades than the much older and more heavily used Norelco.</li>
    <li> I use a beard trimmer to shave my head (and body) every 3 days. My old one that lasted me 6 years finally gave up. I&#x27;m very picky with my trimmers. This trimmer seems like it&#x27;s very well made. I was able to shave my head very quickly it has lots of power and is sharp, if not to sharp. I cut my armpit while shaving them and it still hurts. All in all so far this is a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> But I don&#x27;t.  I was using a real cheapie in the past and it worked fine but I thought I needed an upgrade.  You know, the holy grail.  Now my goatee is uneven and I&#x27;ve tried every &#x27;method&#x27; to use this thing.  Also, I don&#x27;t like shaving so I use it without the attachment to look halfway presentable.  This also does a worse job than the cheap one.  I just don&#x27;t like standing in front of a mirror till I get cramps trying to make this thing work.  I feel like I traded a 2012 Ford for a Yugo.&lt;br /&gt;It does look pretty cool but now I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll hit the flea market this weekend and find something that works.  Remington will probably have a booth trying to hock their inventory of this loser.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this trimmer for about a year.  It cuts at multiple levels, holds at the levels, is easy to clean, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a year, I have to charge it every time I want to use it.  #inconvenient</li>
    <li> If youre looking for a trimmer that adjusts to your mood, this one is perfect. With 9 different adjustment notches picking the right length for your hair is a snap. Feel like Gabby Hays, let it grow long and trim with a number 9. Feel like a jarhead fresh out? select down to a 2 or 3 and get a nice even stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful (enough) motor, takes about 3 minutes to get a good job and it saves you telling the barber and wondering what youll look like when shes done. Strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> Product lives up to my expectations. I have a full beard and use the product to trim it at setting \\&quot;3\\&quot; (slightly longer than stubble). Excellent quality, especially given the price. The construction is solid and does not feel flimsy or fragile. The adjustable head has flexible \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; which look like it could break easily if handled roughly. But this is hardly an issue for its intended use. Very good battery life. I like the fact that the cutting blades are hinged and can be lifted and cleaned from underneath, no special tools required. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Had to remove 1 star for the charger. I had to travel recently to a country where the outlet voltage is 220 volts, and realized that the charger is rated for only 110 volt AC input. This forced me to carry a (rather heavy) step down voltage adapter while traveling.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ever. Does exactly what I bought it for. I was looking for a very close trim because I don&#x27;t always like using a razor. It&#x27;s always on setting 1, which cuts closest to the face and it does a very good job. Setting 1 cuts the hair close enough to the face that it looks like I used a razor on it. Tried it on setting 2 and no matter how much pressure I put on it when trimming the gear always stays locked in. Overall, it does the job it was built to do in a very quick and efficient way and no hair pulling at all.</li>
    <li> This is convenient and keeps a charge very well.  I gave 4 stars because it is a hassle to clean.  I wish I bought one years ago.  Excellent quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months short of the 2 year mark it suddenly decided to not want to turn on.  Dropping it probably doesn&#x27;t help.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful gift this would make.  I bought two.  One for me and one for my brother.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> very useful and battery stays charged for such a long time.. only think i would note here is: the blade is not much useful for giving a shape to the mustache/beard.. for trimming it works very well.</li>
    <li> I have had a goatee for over 14 years and recently scaled it down to only a mustache. This trimmer from Remington has proven to be indispensable when it comes to trimming my facial hair. It&#x27;s inexpensive, so you get your money&#x27;s worth even if it lasts only 2 years. It trims without any tugging of the whiskers. It is completely self contained with no additional parts to fumble around with, something I like very much. The 9 length settings are very precise and consistent time after time, unlike trimming with scissors which I would NOT recommend to any man with facial hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, affordable mustache and beard trimmer order the Remington. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Great for creating stubble or trimming sideburns. Nothing else to say. Nice color, good price. Lasts a long time. One thing I don&#x27;t like is when battery runs out, it won&#x27;t run off of outlet power while plugged in - you have to wait for battery to charge and then use. But you&#x27;re supposed to charge it every night I guess.</li>
    <li> Battery dies out in 1 min. Bad trimmer, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Does not cut well or evenly and does not have a vacuum feature as does the MB70.  I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and there is no indication of wear and tear. I would buy another one if something happened to it.</li>
    <li> This item works very good. The price was exceptional as well. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> If you only plan to use it with the guard on, you&#x27;re probably fine.  If you plan to use it without the guard, especially for more intensive / multiple-angle tasks like head shaving, don&#x27;t buy it. The top is designed so that if any significant pressure is placed on the blade when used in a pretty normal hand position, it can pop open.  If it doesn&#x27;t pop open, the plastic (!) pins in the hinge will break off.  (The hinge is to allow you to open the top and clean out the hair around the driving pin.)  I owned a prior model and it lasted for seven years of once-weekly head shavings with no guard, plus beard trimming.  This version lasted barely six months before the first hinge pin broke, and less than a year before the second one broke, rendering the shaver unusable.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap and does not perform well. Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge - not enough to get a full trim finished. I could live with that if it would run from just being plugged in, but it doesn&#x27;t do that either. I&#x27;m throwing this one out (bought a little over a year ago) and looking for something that works.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable cut length that trims consistently.&lt;br /&gt;Holds its charge for many trims.&lt;br /&gt;Trims close to nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Quite hard to read the cut length indicator number.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product that should not be sold. After a few months the battery refuses to charge and hold a charge. Tragically, the device only runs off batteries. When the battery finally died after about a year of owning this product, the trimmer would not work even when it was plugged into a wall. It really sucks when you&#x27;ve trimmed half your beard and your beard trimmer dies and will not charge any more. Not very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when the battery was working, the blades were not very sharp and the device did not trim very well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It was a total out of box failure, was not able to use it even once. Turned it on and the blades just stopped after a few seconds. Returning it and hope that I will get a refund and not be out of pocket just for buying it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seemed to be the most economical, flexible and simple one around, and rather highly rated, so I bought it. I will spare you the minor problems with its height increments and other design flaws in light of this major one: after the return period for the trimmer ran out, so did the battery. It will not charge, and the battery life was never very good. $20 I&#x27;ll never see again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with how well this little trimmer works, especially for the price.  Trims well, although I have cut myself a few times when I get in too big of a hurry.  I usually trim my bear to the shortest setting, and I&#x27;ve been happy with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the battery life.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 3 or 4 trims.  I don&#x27;t trim my beard more than twice a week, so the battery life may be affected by not being used every day, but I find it dies out pretty quickly--and it&#x27;s pretty sad when the battery is dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again, but I try to remember to charge it after my 3rd use so it doesn&#x27;t die mid-trim.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic parts and wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to anyone. Accidentally slipped out of my hand and fell on the sink (less than 6 inches height) and it broke. There is a plastic part that connects the blade and that one broke and its just lying there.</li>
    <li> I dropped it a few months after I bought it, and the adjustable comb broke. It can no longer be adjusted, and floats freely. I realized that this was an inexpensive item, but I feel like knocking it off of the counter onto the bathroom rug should not result in an unusable product.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  After having the trimmer for only a year or two it can barely hold its charge for more than 5 minutes.  To make matters worse, you can plug the adapter in to the unit to allow it to charge yet while plugged in it does NOT use the AC power when operating, it still attempts to draw power from the batteries which are dead.  Although it wasn&#x27;t overly expensive, I am not satisfied with this product and would offer that you look at alternatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same exact beard trimmer twice and I completely love it.  The charge lasts a long time, I generally leave it plugged in overnight and pull out the cable the next morning.  But I can go through a full and intense shave with the battery still lasting a while after. Normally I can get in about two shaves with one charge, but I just stick it on the charger anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that I could have it plugged in and shave, for the times when I realize the battery is dead and don&#x27;t have time to let it charge, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal, now I just leave it plugged in right after I get done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the first one for over a year and a half and it was still going strong.  Just needed a new one since someone broke it! Oh, and I didn&#x27;t realize this, but the actual trimmer can flip up, so if you press up on the metal edge, where the teeth are, it should pop up so you can clean out all the hairs.</li>
    <li> After 5+ months of using this the charge of the battery is gone not worth the 20 dollars for this. Not recommended to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the many users who received a unit with a bad battery.  Unfortunately, the box was thrown away with all the other christmas presents boxes and wrapping so I never followed through on contacting Remington about a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly enough, my unit didn&#x27;t hold a single charge.  I charged it and finally used it about one week after I received it.  It worked as described.  Five days later when I went to use it again (assuming it would still have a charge for several uses in the future), it was dead.  I thought it was odd, but wasn&#x27;t too concerned.  Unfortunately that was a sign of things to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward ten months later, after being charged over night (I plan ahead) I get about 30 seconds of trim time - I feverishly trim hoping to get it all done in that time - that usually never happens.  I can plug it in again and it will give me another 15 seconds of trim time after 60 seconds of charge time.  Rinse and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my unit does not work cord/cordless like the comparison description indicates.  I don&#x27;t know if that is a change since I received my unit or if that too is a flaw in mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually willing to buy another unit since it did do the job for me when it was working.  Wondering if Remington has updated their battery setup.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer on Amazon .  It stopped holding a charge after about 1 year.  A waste of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> After 2 years of minimal use the battery has completely died. As in after a full charge it lasts maybe 4 minutes. If you&#x27;re looking for a long term trimmer spend the extra cash for something better</li>
    <li> Works well as a mustache and beard trimmer.  I very much like having an all-in-one unit with no separate attachments to store.  The dial works well for adjusting the length, and the comb can be easily removed when needing to use the trimmer without the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is that the battery is dead (won&#x27;t hold a charge) after 3 years of use, and there is no way to (easily) replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish that it could operate as a corded trimmer, so you could finish the job when the battery gets depleted, but it only runs off battery power, so plugging it in will start recharging the battery, but it won&#x27;t be any good to you until it recharges sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus would be if the power cord was coiled, but that&#x27;s a minor gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my next trimmer, I&#x27;m looking for something similar, but with NiMh or Li-ion battery and corded/cordless use.</li>
    <li> This must be the cheaper less useful version of the beard trimmer I used for almost 10 years.  This one holds very little charge and always dies when I am using it.  I would spend a little more and buy a better trimmer if I could do it all over again.</li>
    <li> We ar happy we were able to find the same model. The adjustment dial is easy to use an always trims at the right setting.</li>
    <li> I really liked this trimmer but less than a year later it stopped holding a charge. Charge lasts for 2 minutes now.</li>
    <li> No problems with uses for beard trimming and occasion hair trimming. Retains a charge for weeks, recharges overnight. Wish the adjustment wheel had numbers as I can not remember the prior settings.</li>
    <li> I had an old Remington for ten years that was working with some problems, so I decided to boy this MB-200 following the reviews. However this trimmer makes me bleed because stock in my skin. Also, if you use number 1 position doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have a ZZ-top beard maybe works but if you are looking for a trimmer to keep short your beard is a waste of money. Sorry Remington</li>
    <li> Used it about once a week for 3 months.  Doesn&#x27;t hold charge any longer.  Won&#x27;t even work with adapter plugged in.  This thing is crap.</li>
    <li> I like this one since the head is larger than most beard trimmers and the guard actually stays in place.  It has some trouble with my thick beard but most trimmers do.  I recommend it for the price</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. I maintain a military style haircut and this is my third Remington MB 200. I strongly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> this is the best beard trimmer i have had, granted ive never spent more than $25 on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have no complaints so far about this trimmer. i LOVE how its all in 1. all my previous trimmers you had to keep up with and change the attachments to change the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it says u can leave it plugged in as long as your going to use it once every two weeks. if your going on vacation and not taking it, unplug it. so far its been plugged up since i got it, ive used when needed, and the battery has not been affected in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE how this one has the battery built in and can recharge. my last one took AA batteries which sucked having to spend even more money on batteries even if u bought rechargeable you spent more than what u would on this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if any of the above changes, ill update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is cheap and will cut your hair whether its on your face or your ass. The cut is sorta close but not hella close.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good basic trimmer for the money.  Beard length adjustment is easy.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> Battery last about two trims for a goatee. Dies fast and doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s plugged into ac - charges only. So...if you&#x27;re in the middle of a trim and realize this thing is about to die - too bad - you&#x27;ll have to be happy with half a trim.    Gosh - other than that - it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Worked fine until the battery stopped taking charge. Can&#x27;t use plugged in. Cost me thirty through Amazon and it shouldn&#x27;t just become worthless like that.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, plenty of settings for closeness, stays charged for a long time.  I am very happy with your product...</li>
    <li> Broke after basically the first use.  Blade comes loose and then makes a very annoying noise.  Doesn&#x27;t hold its charge.  Overall, very poorly designed.</li>
    <li> It trims my beard nicely, but the NiCad battery is a real drawback. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long and it takes all day to charge. If you can afford one with a Li ion battery get that. Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> So, I got this because I wanted an all-in-one shaver that didn&#x27;t have 30 stupid accessories for me to store/lose. After searching for a couple of days this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shortest setting isn&#x27;t quite short enough for stubble, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;The blade guard mechanism is still stiff after two years, which is an accomplishment. In most units these tend to fail rather quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem, and it&#x27;s a big one:&lt;br /&gt;The battery. After six months of use it stopped holding a charge for more than a day. Now, it holds a charge for about 15 minutes, but it runs at such a slow speed that it pulls, rather than cuts hair. IIt has the same amount of power that you&#x27;d imagine it to have seconds before death, a slow slow slow churning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the batteries have failed to deliver enough voltage to do anything, and now it&#x27;s time for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this seems to be a theme among Remington products, their touch control razor (i went through 3, all returned) has similar battery issues within weeks. It&#x27;s a shame because for another $5 per product they could source decent batteries and produce awesome products.</li>
    <li> The remington mb-200 titanium mustache and beard trimmer works great. I have only used a few times, but no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I have only owned this for a month so I have little to say.  But for the price it cant be beat.  I use it to maintain a tight scruff and it does the job flawlessly.  Their are no bells and whistles that can break on this unit.  What I like the most is how the charger connects to the trimmer.  It uses a beefy headphone like jack.  Much nicer than the other more expensive models I have owned.  I have a feeling this will last a lot longer than the other ones I have owned.</li>
    <li> The best for the money I&#x27;ve found.  Sturdy, feels good in hand. CUTS EVENLY!  Really does a superb job. Clean-up a breeze.</li>
    <li> Works well, but should be recharged after each use.</li>
    <li> Trims really well&lt;br /&gt;This is the second generation of the same model trimmer that I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The first lasted fro ~3 years before the Batt pooped out which is not too bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This thing is extremely easy to use.  I especially like the fact that there aren&#x27;t a dozen attachments that pop off easily.  This thing holds a charge very well, is adjustable, easy to clean, and exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. Works well, nice quality. Very nice job trimming his beard and the brush keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as advertised. It arrived within two business days at Christmas time! The price was almost half of a similar trimmer for sale by your competition.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will shop with you online again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this that long, but so far i enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially clippers, the same one you may get your hair cut with at a barber shop or hair salon. The extra feature is the adjustable length you can set it to.  You simply roll the dial on the side of this device and it adjusts the measurement device at the end and you go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all pretty easy and convenient.  It advertises that it auto sharpens and you don&#x27;t need to oil it, which is great because I hate doing that stuff for something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to keep your facial hair a certain length, this is absolutely a great start especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any battery issues yet, but if i do I will surely update my review.</li>
    <li> Purchased on: February 12, 2011 for $14.95 Lasted just under two years. Does not hold a decent charge. Died on January 9 2013. Feels cheap. Glad I only paid $14.95. Two stars for both of the years it made it.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers who have observed that the trimmer itself is not a bad product, but it&#x27;s fatal flaw is the battery.  It just does not hold a charge.  I let it charge for 24 hours and it might hold enough of a charge to get me through two shaving sessions.  An otherwise good product, this is a deal killer for me.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for Christmas. One month later, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. In fact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even charging anymore. I&#x27;ve had it plugged in for several days and it still sounds like it&#x27;s going to die the minute I start using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my boyfriend seriously needs to trim his beard. There&#x27;s a lot of trimmers out there but I chose this one specifically because of the balance of price, and functionality. In terms of price, it is inexpensive compared to other trimmers. The trimmer is an all in one beard trimmer meaning you don&#x27;t need to keep multiple heads so there is no worry to misplace or lose some parts. It looks solid and sturdy. It is rechargeable. You can wash the head. It is cordless. The blades are self-sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He got his gift yesterday and he loves it because it is so simple, so easy to use, so portable yet meets his needs to trim his facial hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is neat not having to oil the blades at all.  It is designed to trim mustache and beard neatly.  I repeatedly recharged it for 24 hours and it just died today.  It is not deigned to last more than 1 year. I had to recharge it each time just before I use it. So disappointed cuz it worked real good on me. I have no way to contact the seller about this.</li>
    <li> It cuts fine but has to be recharged after every use.  As usual when I buy something inexpensive, Wish I&#x27;d spent a little more.</li>
    <li> Remington has cut too many corners manufacturing this low lifespan NiCad trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NiCad battery as you will see in many of the other reviews is very low quality and guaranteed not to last as long as one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got less than 6 months of use out of this trimmer and would not advise others to purchase one unless you need another plastic paperweight when it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Panasonic generously decided to make a ONE TIME courtesy replacement. Thanks Panasonic. &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of this model now. The battery in my first one finally gave out after years of reliable use. It was the model with the porcelain blades. I used it to cut my hair and my beard. The second one developed a battery issue where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long. I guess not every unit can be perfect. Otherwise that is the word I would use for this product. Compared to the other garbage beard trimmers I&#x27;ve tried this is about as good as it gets. Give it a try. If it has a weak battery like my second one had, luckily they aren&#x27;t too expensive to replace. My first one more than made up for the second one&#x27;s faulty battery in service time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I agree with the other reviewers who wish that the shaver could run off of the power cord and not require the battery to be charged. That being said its battery lasts a long time on a full charge when its a healthy battery. That would be just what this model needs to perfect it. It would probably hurt Remington&#x27;s business making that change. Everyone would only buy one but they would use it for decades and pass it onto their children. :-)</li>
    <li> I already had one of these but it started not holding a charge.  Surprisingly the new one doesn&#x27;t hold more than about 5 minutes total run time.  No stand to charge in, only a little plug in transformer with a cord. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I got this because i was tired of being baby faced.  This buzzer works great for my beard.  You have to roll over your face a few times to make sure it&#x27;s even but overall im very happy.  If you only plan on buzzing your beard once every 2 weeks like i do, make sure you plug the buzzer in atleast 30 minutes before hand or it will not stay on while you are trying to use it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is sharp, cuts well, solid and easy to hold.  I use it about twice a week and only charged it once (when received), since  a few months ago. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Trimming was pretty good while it lasted but died in just under a month. Extremely cheaply made product. Do not buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who never really did much when it came to facial hair maintenance - he loves it! He tells me quite often how he loves the settings and how easy it is to clean up his scruff for work.</li>
    <li> I only have one complaint.  This razor works great in all other aspects, it&#x27;s compact, works well and has remained sharp for over  a year.  But the battery is a horrible piece of equipment and has been that way since day one.&lt;br /&gt;If not used for three days, it entirely loses its charge.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work while plugged in - so you have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves you managing the battery in order to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it til it dies but won&#x27;t by another since the battery issue at best is annoying.</li>
    <li> Everything is great except that it DOES NOT work corded.  Really upset that you can&#x27;t use it corded.  I bought this specifically because it said that it would work cordless and corded.  I&#x27;m giving Remington a call soon to discuss this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Called Remington and they told me that sometimes when the battery is really low it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in.  After it charged for a little bit it ended up working while plugged in again.  Don&#x27;t let this run out of battery!</li>
    <li> It lasted five years before the battery finally wore out. Otherwise, it works as well today as when it was new. I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
    <li> Functional. Does not cut as close as i would like...especially on neck.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good and does what i bought it or.</li>
    <li> I used it to trim my goatee 1-2 times a week.  I charged it once in December 2012 and the charge lasted into June on that one charge, which was amazing!  I took it on a trip and it died.  I returned home, tried charging it, but it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  I have a rechargeable toothbrush that has lasted 10 years with daily use.  I am seriously disappointed in this Remington product and do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> excellent product. timely delivery.</li>
    <li> The battery won&#x27;t hold a charge past a year and a half. Form factor and the trimmer work great, but a complete waste of money because of the battery. Wouldn&#x27;t be such a waste if you could simply plug it in and use it, but you can&#x27;t even do that. It will only run after being charged, not while charging.    UPDATE: Remington customer service reached out and after validating my purchase, mailed me a replacement device which arrived today (10/30/2014). It&#x27;s great to see them stand by their product and replace devices like this (note that there is a 2-year warranty on these units). While the support is great, I&#x27;m leaving my original review intact since the type of battery used in the device, Nickel-Cadmium, does not appear to have changed which means it will also likely die in after a year and a half of use. Maybe my first device was a from  a bad batch (not likely after seeing the other reviews), but in general Nickel-Cadmium batteries don&#x27;t have as good a shelf-life as Lithium-Ion batteries. If this model were updated with a Lithium-Ion battery it would be a no-brainer purchase and recommendation, even if it added $20 to the cost.     Again, great to see them stand by their warranty and replace a bad battery. I&#x27;ll try and remember to update this review a few months down the road to share how this battery holds up.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, but the battery is awful.  I have to recharge it after every other use.</li>
    <li> So so. They should loose the light it eats power and i know where my nose is. Don&#x27;t need a light to find it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this garbage. I am so frustrated I have taken the time to come here and leave my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries barely have a 1 year life and you cant use it while plugged in. I have opened it to see if I could change the batteries myself only to find out that they soldered them. Lol, two 1.2v NiCd AA batteries, that is 1999 technology and they are low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely NOT buying from Remington again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really torn as to how to rate this. It trims very, very well. Really good job at that. However: the head (blades) attachment is a little flimsy and can pop off when you go to clean it. But the big problem is the battery, which would seem to be ni-cad. It loses its charge while not in use, it loses its capacity as time goes on, and it doesn&#x27;t have that many charge/discharge cycles before it basically doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. And, since it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in, it&#x27;s useless until it&#x27;s recharged. Which it doesn&#x27;t do all that quickly either. So it&#x27;s a great trimmer with some serious flaws. Frankly I just wish it was corded.</li>
    <li> It can be a little uneven sometimes. I wish it had more settings for a close shave. I use it to keep short stubble, and it works pretty well but I&#x27;d like to have the option of .5mm, 1mm, 1.5mm so that I have more options how I want my beard to look. The charge lasts pretty long and easy enough to clean. I haven&#x27;t tried any other beard trimmers but I am overall happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> the rechargeable battery on my unit failed, as well, within a couple of months.  this seems to be a recurring theme with this product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is good for one thing, and one thing only: trimming your beard.  The blade is wider than the [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]], which is both good and bad.  It is a little quicker to trim with, but not as maneuverable.  The built-in guard is great; no more rooting around in a drawer looking for attachments.  The only think I don&#x27;t like about it, as a beard trimmer, is the handle shape.  It has a weird bend that makes it awkward to hold in some positions (mostly when doing my neck, but also the offhand side of my face).  Don&#x27;t think about using it for anything else, though.  The blade is too wide to trim your mustache.  Or your ears.  I tried several times to use it without the guard, always with bloody results.  I&#x27;m getting the smaller Wahl to use in conjunction with this.  Neither one is perfect, but together they cover my needs pretty well.</li>
    <li> I used it for several times, but whenthe battery was off, I couldn&#x27;t charge it, the indicator was not lightning and the battery was not charging.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer works well.  I also use it for my hair though it doesn&#x27;t cut as well there, especially in the thinner parts.  It holds a charge, but takes a while to charge up.</li>
    <li> The battery does not last very long and they are not replaceable. Must be charged before each use and won&#x27;t hold a charge. Can&#x27;t be used with a low battery, won&#x27;t run off of the AC. At this point I would prefer a non-battery powered unit.</li>
    <li> 8 months after I bought the trimmer, it will barely hold a charge long enough to trim my beard. When half way through, you can actually hear the blades slow down. Plus this trimmer won&#x27;t work when plugged in, so it&#x27;s the rechargeable battery or nothing. Soon it will be in the trash. A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item 1/30/2012 and tried to return it today, but my refund date has expired. It was going to be the 4th time i would have used it, but it&#x27;s not even turning on anymore. Even when i did use it, the battery died within 3 minutes of trimming my beard. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Even if you plug it in to the charger and try to use it, it doesn&#x27;t work. Dont buy it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this 3+ times a week. We have had it a full 2 years now and it still works great.  He does say that he has to use a scissors to trim when he is done because it doesn&#x27;t trim it evenly everywhere.  I don&#x27;t know if that is a general problem or him or what.  He is very happy with it though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a couple months ago.  After no more than a dozen uses, it no longer holds a charge, and dies within seconds of being turned on.</li>
    <li> I found this replacement for a different shaver to be a little lacking.  It is not as wide as the one I had previously and it can&#x27;t be used when plugged in for charging.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, just wish the battery was better. Also, you can&#x27;t use it while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it does what I need with no issues and was priced nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to trim a full on mountain man beard I&#x27;m not sure this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people use this thing, it works great and is a great price. Great quality and the rechargeable feature is great. A great buy, will get another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I have worn a beard for 36 years, and have used the predecessor of this Remington (the MB-40) for the last 10 years. Loved the MB-40, and this MB-200 improves upon that model...more quiet (amazingly quiet), lighter and feels like a sharper cut. I am a happy camper (runner, walker, snowshoer, bicyclist, etc).</li>
    <li> The adjustable length scroll wheel broke within two months of me owning this. The scroll wheel is made of plastic and is easily stripped. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has been a life saver from day one. Its easy to charge and small enough to take with you anywhere you have to go.</li>
    <li> The battery life on this trimmer is miserable. So miserable, in fact, that it will not work if not plugged in for several hours beforehand. If you unplug it, the batteries drain almost immediately. This problem first cropped up after a couple months of using the product; Remington replaced it, only for the replacement to have the same issue within a few months. I noted this on several other reviews as well, so I know I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it performs as expected for the price. It&#x27;s just unusable without electricity.</li>
    <li> I use it to cut my hair as well. Good battery life. Easy to use and clean. Price is right.</li>
    <li> great very handy and well designed unit easily adjusted as to length and runs cordlessly and easy recharging.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Updated!  See below!  No longer holds a charge for longer than a few minutes, barely enough time for one use!  I have used this trimmer only about 20 times since purchase.  Obviously there is some serious battery flaw.  This unit is also a lot bigger than it needs to be and I am not a fan of the retractable head design.  It is just cumbersome and bulky.  I would avoid this trimmer.  I am really not happy with this purchase.  UPDATE 6/20/13 - To be fair - I contacted Remington after I wrote this review and explained the situation.  They replaced the razor with a new one (for free) and said they wanted to evaluate the old one.  I sent it back and got a new one which exhibits NONE of the battery problems! The new razor battery lasts a very long time. So it appears I got a lemon. I still think it&#x27;s a little oversized but I have acclimated to it.  I have changed my opinion to recommend (4 stars) because of great customer care and the problem does not seem to be endemic of the model.  UPDATE 9/27/15 - Not long after I got the new one it does the same thing.  Will not hold a charge even over night without any use!  That with the other things I noted before I am going back to one star.   Not good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. I charge it and it goes on for a week. Very nice and I recommend it to anyone that is into trimming them selves,, a+++++++++</li>
    <li> This is a very easy no-hassle product. I recommend it. I love that I don&#x27;t even have to oil the blade.</li>
    <li> No complaints so far. I have used this item for about two months. Love the wheeled trim size. I always lose the attachments to my trimmers, so not having anything that needs to be switched out is a definite plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{EDIT} A year in and this guy still works fine. I have very dry, coarse beard hair, but this still cuts right through it like the day we got it. No maintenance required other than a very infrequent brushing out of hair. Battery life is still very good too. I only have to charge it a couple times a month and it gets used a tad bit almost every day.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 of these beard trimmers in the past. The concept is really cool, being able to adjust the height of the trim with just a knob and no attachments but it won&#x27;t charge while plugged in and operating and after a few months use like all of the other reviewers stated it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I get through 10 seconds of trimming before it dies. It has a non replaceable internal battery so this thing is garbage now. Once that battery dies it will snag whatever hair you are shaving an it hurts. I would really recommend another brand that remington, the battery WILL die on you</li>
    <li> The battery finally quite on my last MB-200, so I&#x27;ve had this one for 1 1/2 years.  I discharge the battery completely before recharging each and every time.  The battery still seems strong, though lasts a bit less between charges than it did when new.  I occasionally grow a beard and then trim to nubs with this trimmer before shaving.  I always keep a thin strip-type goatee on my chin and use this trimmer to keep it in check.  I also use it for trimming my hair, to clean it up around the edges (between cuttings) and all other typical needs for a 40 year old hairy male.  It never needs lubricated.  The comb settings are just right.  It feels nice in my hands.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, adjust the trim setting, and to clean.</li>
    <li> Works well and fast. No problems except clean up cause it cuts everything it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Nice machine.</li>
    <li> This trimmer had everything I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;Easily adjustable and multiple length settings&lt;br /&gt;Washable&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it worked great and I was very happy.  Unfortunately after only a years worth of use, the battery is completely useless.  I can charge it all day and get 30 seconds of shaving now.  I thought it could also be used while plugged it, avoiding battery issues, but it cannot.  Going shopping for a corded only one today.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this!! It won&#x27;t work plugged in if it&#x27;s dead it always has to be changed I find it in convenient</li>
    <li> As described...  Happy with how easy it is to use and clean but poor battery life</li>
    <li> Not at all satisfied. the battery ran out after 5 mins even though i charged for straight 2 days. and its still relatively new.</li>
    <li> Worked great for some months, but eventually the battery doesn&#x27;t hold much charge and you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, the trimmer&#x27;s battery is terrible. After about three months of using the trimmer once a week, several hours of charging gives me about a minute of shaving time.</li>
    <li> For the first six months, it worked fine.  I&#x27;d used it a half-dozen times before it ran down and needed to be charged.  Now, it always needs to be charged, and even after being plugged in for two days, it still only runs at half-speed.</li>
    <li> This is not a reflection on the seller. They delivered the product on time.&lt;br /&gt;This is however to tell you not to waist your money on this piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this a month ago and it is now unable to hold a charge. One month old.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now back on the road traveling which is why I needed this to start with and am looking for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Never trust Remington again.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Buy!</li>
    <li> Will not run direct from the AC cord and wont hold a charge long enough to trim your beard no matter how long you charge it.</li>
    <li> Brilliantly designed. Total quality. This is the only item i have ever felt compelled enough to write a review on. I use it to maintain my beard as well as cut the sizes of my hair. If i could rate it ten stars i would. One of the best purchases i have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/14/13&lt;br /&gt;Dont drop it! I dropped it on the bathroom counter and the length wheel broke and i had to buy another one.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is great.  Numerous depth adjustments and the guard can be removed for sideburns or detail work.  However, the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2 days.  I only trim my beard once a week, so I have to charge the trimmer before every use (minimum of 2 hours charging for 2 minutes of trimming operation time).  If this trimmer was simply a corded model it would be fine.  Since it&#x27;s battery only and can&#x27;t work when connected to the outlet (until the battery is charged), it&#x27;s frustrating.  It works (in it&#x27;s own special way) and my pride won&#x27;t let me replace a working machine.  I&#x27;m patiently waiting the day when it dies so I can get a different trimmer with a working battery or a cord.  Save yourself the $25 and pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother, but only because my other half has it and loves it! He has had his for about 5 years and the rechargeable battery is just starting to go, when it does I will order another one just like it.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. I haven&#x27;t tried many beard trimmers, but this one definitely lives up to the hype. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace another Remington that I had, which died after about 2 years&#x27; worth of use, and I&#x27;m writing this review after using it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The length guard is softer material and doesn&#x27;t dig into your skin like the hard plastic ones&lt;br /&gt;- The cutting head is larger than I expected, so it takes fewer swipes to do the job&lt;br /&gt;- The design of the length guard should help keep things more even than the snap-on style length guards&lt;br /&gt;- The length guard can be adjusted very easily, which is handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer as a whole is bigger than my old one, so detail work is a little challenging&lt;br /&gt;- Removing the length guard to edge my goatee isn&#x27;t as easy as it was with the other model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a #3 setting on this one is shorter than the #3 on my old one.  I found this out the hard way.  This is not a criticism of the trimmer or the design, but I wanted to throw it out there to save other people from making the same mistake I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I prefer the other model, which was smaller and lighter.  But this is still a very good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for over a year. No complaints! I especially like that the guard is removable.</li>
    <li> Well, i never write reviews but don&#x27;t buy this thing. i had a norelco but i broke it. i bought this as a replacement and the battery life is HORRIBLE. fully charged, it didnt even last through one trimming session. by the way, u cant use the cord as a power source. all it does is charge the battery so when its dead u have to wait until it charges some to finish shaving. if i can save a few people from buying it this review was worth writhing. buy a norelco</li>
    <li> I should have known this thing would fall apart quickly from the price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Minuses: Poor battery life- held charge for 1-2 uses max; the clipper head was constantly falling off; trimmer guard length apparatus finally broke, rendering this thing mostly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this one, spend a little more money and get something higher quality that will last you more that six months.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and fit for someone who hates to go clean-shaven and goes scruffy.  I imagine it would also be helpful to use it to get your facial hair down to a manageable length to be able to go clean-shaven if you wanted.  The adjustable length setting seems durable, but for the most part I just use it on the first setting without the plastic guard.  The battery stays charged for a long amount of time.  I feel like I have left it off the charger for about a month now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  That is definitely a plus for people like me that are always forgetting to plug things back in.</li>
    <li> Wow, figured this would last me 6 months-1 year because it&#x27;s so cheap...left it charging over night and used for the second time today only to see that by the end of my use three of the teeth on the inner part of the guard are totally bent.  When I tried to straighten them back one of them broke off, I&#x27;m so angry!  I guess my recommendation is to not set the trimmer down with the guard resting on anything (it was in my dopp kit w/things pressed against it...never been a problem w/my last beard trimmer) because it&#x27;s VERY flimsy plastic, not hard like my hair trimmer guards or my old beard trimmer that lasted me two years.  Though they don&#x27;t even include a stand, so good luck keeping it propped up on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Trimmer itself seems pretty good but I could not recommend this product seeing as if any more of the teeth break off the entire thing is useless.  Also would&#x27;ve liked a longer setting or two.  I used the 8 setting and my beard is currently shorter than it usually is so not much room for growing it longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for 2 years now and it has not given me any problems. I use the trimmer on its lowest setting to quickly shave off enough stubble to be considered clean-enough for work. The battery holds a charge for an impressive amount of time; I&#x27;ve been surprised to be able to shave without charging after not using the trimmer for a month. If I had to complain at all about the product I would say that, when it is getting low on battery, it starts to wind down and you can feel it losing power. This has become worse as the trimmer has aged. It&#x27;s not much of an inconvenience though. Just plug it back in for at least 30-45 minutes and you should be able to get through a single shave. Bottom line: For the price, this trimmer would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why Remington and other companies find it so hard to make a good shaver. This model feels cheap and plasticky and it acts like one. If you want a really fine grain, it&#x27;ll be tough to obtain. Areas on my neck look like someone clutched hair and randomly pulled it out. I have patches of skin and hair. The shaver works better on the cheeks, but fails around the chin. I bought a newer model, with touchscreen and USB charging no less, and it fares worse than this. Everything is flimsy. I would invest in more $$ and get a Philips or something. I am done with Remington.</li>
    <li> Since i bought this trimmer my beard is controlled and trimmed in a very fancy and cool way... This is a product i really recommend for you or for a gift.</li>
    <li> trimmed beard, mustache and hair great! thought it had a lithium ion battery but it comes with a ni-cad&lt;br /&gt; but seems to work just as good, only flaw as I see it, is the blade top where you lift it to clean hair only plastic pin hinges holding it on. they came out several times during cleaning</li>
    <li> Worked great while it could hold a charge.  Did I mention it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore?  Very disappointed, but I&#x27;m sure if I pay for shipping the manufacturer would repair it....</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this trimmer I checked the 1 star ratings for complaints and there were LOTS of complaints about the battery. I thought to myself that it was unfortunate for those buyers and that there was no way I too would get a dud. WRONG!!!! About a month after purchasing this trimmer it stopped charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when it did work the teeth on the trimmer were a bit sharp and constantly nicked my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ended up buying the Phillips QT4000 and have been very happy with that one.</li>
    <li> Bought it, loved it, used it frequently for a couple of years, and then the batteries stopped holding the change. if you&#x27;re willing to buy a new one every 2-3 years, then this is a decent deal. never got clogged up, wasn&#x27;t difficult to clean.    this video -[...]explains the issues perfectly (if the link is removed, just search for \\&quot;Remington MB200 Trimmer Battery Repair\\&quot; on youtube). wasn&#x27;t willing to put in the work to replace the batteries, so just bought a different trimmer with higher-grade batteries/charging system.</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington MB-200 type A beard trimmer a few years ago. When exactly I can&#x27;t say other than it was at least 3 years ago, but not more than 7. After a couple of years I found that it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge the way it used to. I keep it in my shower and mainly use it to trim my goatee to a shorter length. In the last few months it hasn&#x27;t held a charge well at all, requiring me to leave it on the charging cable by the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to see if I could disassemble it and replace the battery. I found 2 interesting things - first, this uses standard AA Nickel Cadmium batteries (N-600AAK Sanyo Batteries which cost $2-3ea.). They appear to be easily replaceable. But I also found that disassembling this pretty much destroys it. While you might do a better job than I did, I found I had to remove the glued on side plates and pry the thing apart after removing the small screws that hold it together. You might do a better job than I did, but once apart I decided I was better off buying a new one. I removed the batteries to dispose of separately and properly and am ordering a new one of the same model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap enough for the life it lasted, not user serviceable, dispose of properly due to battery type.</li>
    <li> Been through a dozen horrible to average trimmers and wasted hundreds of dollars on them. This trimmer is solid, feels good in the hand and works exactly as you would hope. Dont buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Battery does not hold a charge well and it will not operate without a charged battery.  Older models would operate when plugged in, even if the battery was dead.  Clearly quality has gone down.  Also this model is more difficult to clean out hair caught under cutters.</li>
    <li> So many of you have expressed their affection for the Remington MB-50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JI6B5K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several of these type of trimmers, all at a wide variation in prices over the years. The Remington MB-50 was my favorite of all of them and also one of the least expensive. I used it regularly for about 10 years! I even used it occasionally to give my little Yorkshire dog a cut and trim. I never had a pulled hair while using it. It&#x27;s hard to believe the Ni-Cad battery service life was that long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the battery recently no longer took a charge I did a lot of research to try to find another Remington MB-50 and couldn&#x27;t find it any where. I was willing to pay any price for it just because I knew it was a quality product and liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I halfheartedly ordered the Remington MB-200 http://www.amazon.com/Remington-MB-200-Titanium-Mustache-Trimmer/dp/B0009OMU0A/ref&#x3D;cm_cd_ql_qh_dp_t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, the Remington MB-200 looks identical to my old Remington MB-50, with the exception of the new color. I&#x27;ve also noticed the motor sounds quieter than my original MB-50 trimmer, but perhaps that is because the MB-50 is now 10 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking to replace your old Remington MB-50, give the Remington MB-200 a try. It doesn&#x27;t have one of the new Lithium batteries that are all the rage today but if this Ni-Cad battery in the MB-200 performs anything like the old one did in the MB-50, you will never miss having a Lithium battery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased 4 of these over the last few years for various friends and relatives.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better beard trimmer for the price.  I highly recommend this if you are a frequent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Had an older model for like 6 years and when the battery finally died I couldn&#x27;t find a comparable product. Instead I bought a more expensive Braun and have spent the last several months shaving for an excessively long time in order to evenly cover all areas of my face &amp; neck. Just used this new model for the first time and it worked just like I remembered.</li>
    <li> Though not as exacting as a Wahl hair trimmer, it is easy to use, easy to calibrate, easy to store and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Well-designed beard trimmer. Adjusting the various lengths is really smooth and easy and its really easy to clean. The clipper on the end pops off and gives you the raw clippers for your sideburns and mustache.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this stopped working after about 6 months.  Not very sturdy and we ended up buying a replacement on-the-ground so we could see how well-made/sturdy it was.</li>
    <li> For years now, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to replace my old Norelco trimmers.  They were awesome until Philips took them over and made them crappy.  I still haven&#x27;t found anything as good for the price, but this is the closest I&#x27;ve come.  I liked it enough that I bought a second one, same model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it trims well without catching and pulling my hair.  It has a decent number of adjustable lengths (9 settings), and it stays locked in place while trimming.  It has a nice shape, which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to move around without accidentally adjusting the length setting or hitting the power switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first crticism is that you have to be careful with the battery.  Of course, it holds a lot of charge when new, but it will diminish significantly if you&#x27;re not careful.  Despite what the directions say, my recommendation is to charge it fully, unplug it, and not plug in again until the charge is almost drained.  If you don&#x27;t charge the battery fully or begin charging when the battery is not close to empty, it will definitely reduce the battery life.  Using care when charging will extend the life of the product.  It would also be nice if you could trim while simultaneously charging, but this trimmer doesn&#x27;t work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second criticism is that the charger is only compatible with 120 VAC input.  I often travel overseas, and this is the ONLY electronic product I have that is NOT compatible with inputs up to 240 VAC.  It&#x27;s the 21st century, why is this charger using a 19th century limitation in its power transformer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good value for what I paid.  My first one lasted about 21 months.  I&#x27;m hoping to stretch this one beyond 2 years by taking more care with charging.</li>
    <li> My husband was complaining one afternoon, after he informed me of smashing his new shaver on the floor of his garage, that he would never find another shaver like the one he&#x27;s had for years that finally kicked the bucket... I said why would you ruin a new working shaver, just because you didn&#x27;t like it? We could have at least return it,  got his $$ back.. He replied it was worth the $30 to smash that piece of crap on the floor... I asked him why didn&#x27;t  just purchase another Remington like the one he loved. He replied that he couldn&#x27;t find it and then gave up his search and thought they didn&#x27;t make them anymore. Well, that&#x27;s when I come back into the story.I asked for the old one  with  computer in hand, I &amp;#34;Amazoned&amp;#34; it. Low and behold...BOOM! there it was... a newer model!! (his was pretty old) so like any good wife , I ordered it.. it arrived 2 days later!! free shipping too!!  and needless to say... I got me one happy camper again!!! Oh and a nicely trimmed gotee  to admire!!! Two words... BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This is my third one of these.  I love these things--I love the shape and way it cuts, but the battery on these things eventually just dies, to the point where you cannot use it without having it plugged into the charger, and then, eventually, it will barely work when plugged in.  For me, it has taken at least a year for this to happen though, therefore justifying the relatively cheap cost compare to more fancy trimmers.  I will buy more, even when my third one croaks in a year or so, unless I can find something better, which I haven&#x27;t : )</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good trimmer.  I like that the size stays put when you trim and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the setting coming loose if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update 02/13/2014]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I liked this trimmer when I first got it, now a year later it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  I only used it maybe once every week or 2, just to give my beard some shape.  I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating from 4 stars to 2.</li>
    <li> battery life is inferior to other trimmers.  After a year of use, the batter only holds a charge for one trim-up, and all I have is a pretentious bit of stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for 2 and 1/2 years now, roughly once a week. It does a fantastic job on my beard that I keep pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it still worked right, but the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and is not replaceable. So this unit is useless now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a beard trimmer, I would buy one with better battery life and/or the ability to be replaced.</li>
    <li> within six months charge works for just one shave&lt;br /&gt;this is the third one that I bought. the first was good the second ok</li>
    <li> Great for weekly beard trim.  Battery last about 3 trims(45 min for me). Hard to read depth setting indicator.  It&#x27;s too small for my tired eyes.</li>
    <li> got it not expecting too much - as I had my norelco for at least 10 years w/o a hitch until the slide control on the height adjustment broke...  otherwise that shaver still works as good as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one works well enough - though you do have to keep going over the same areas to get a consistent level... liked it enough though to buy 1 for my son</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Lightweight, but not too cheap feeling. Cuts that beard pretty darn good. Nothing amazing or mind blowing, just good. Not much tugging or pulling at all. Different heights to choose from are great. Although if you want a really really tight almost not there stubble look, the lowest setting won&#x27;t get you there. But the shortest setting does get it really low and tight, and looks great. Battery life isn&#x27;t the greatest, but it&#x27;s adequate. I&#x27;ve had better battery life from other shavers. But overall, one of the best values in trimmers out there. Is very inexpensive and works great.</li>
    <li> great trimmer but I give it 3 stars because the battery life is terrible and the standby charge hold is terrible</li>
    <li> Cheap and nice product. Very easy to use. Battery lasts long. I like the way it adjusts the length. No real downsides yet.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price, but with one flaw: plugging it in with a dead battery doesn&#x27;t allow you to use it. It seems to draw power only from the battery, not bypassing it when it&#x27;s dead but plugged in. This, combined with the fact that it seems to hemorrhage battery life (I only use it about once a week), means that I have to plug it in before use and wait a while before using.</li>
    <li> The unit itself is fine - I would give it four stars. However, after about a year, the battery life took a significant dive - two stars. Today the battery lasted about three minutes. I checked the warranty, and the unit is covered for two years. So now, just less than 1 1/2 years after purchase, I contacted Remington and they are sending a replacement unit with a prepaid label to send back the defective unit. That, at least, is good service. So I give the entire episode three stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these and continue to buy them however the battery doesn&#x27;t last long - you&#x27;ll need to replace it in a year if you use it a lot (I use mine weekly for face trimming and every other week to shave my head).  The guard is a little flimsy and you could get one with some not-so-sharp blades (so the overall quality is somewhat hit or miss).  But it really is great especially for shaving your head - I take the guard off and use it that way and it&#x27;s great (I can&#x27;t use a regular razor\blade because I have moles).  I still recommend it even with the issues because I&#x27;ve tried so many others there isn&#x27;t anything else better out there.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t hold a charge more than 30 seconds since Day 1.  I haven&#x27;t had a more frustrating piece of junk product in a long time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It can&#x27;t even cut while plugged in.  Hunk of junk.</li>
    <li> Works good ,good price, but its a little large</li>
    <li> Great in beginning but soon loses charge and cannot charge anymore.  Bought three of these all three have died and cannot be used.  Shaving my beard it dies immediately.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend uses it all the time. great product.</li>
    <li> Not only is the price right, the trimmer is outstanding.  Love the shape of it... makes it really easy to get those odd angles.  The guard adjustment works and locks into place well.  And, not that they&#x27;re expensive to buy, but the mustache comb that comes with the trimmer is also a great one.  Very well worth the reasonable price you pay!!</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer regularly for three years. Compared to the other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used this one is average. It can&#x27;t hold a charge so I leave it plugged in. If I&#x27;m traveling I have to wait for it to recharge to use it. At one point the guard broke and I super-glued it back together. Lately it has been vibrating more and getting louder, it has also started pulling on hair (ouch!), so I&#x27;m going to replace it. I try to buy American made products but I may have to buy elsewhere this time.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I ORIGINALLY LOVED THIS TRIMMER.  I BOUGHT IT IN MAY.  IN NOVEMBER I SENT IT TO REMINGTON UNDER THE TWO YEAR WARRANTY.  THEY GOT A NEW ONE BACK TO ME QUICKLY.  IT IS NOW OCTOBER AND I CHARGED IT ON SUNDAY, WENT TO USE IT ON FRIDAY AND IT IS DEAD.  IT USAGE TIME HAS BEEN GETTING SHORTER AND SHORTER JUST LIKE THE FIRST DID.  THE DESIGN IS EXCELLENT BUT THEY USED A CRAPPY BATTERY THAT DOESN&#x27;T LAST.  I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE IF IT HAD A BETTER BATTERY.  AS IT IS NOW I COULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS LET ALONE BUY ANOTHER.  THE BATTERY SEEMS TO LAST SIX MONTHS THEN IT DOES NOT ACCEPT A CHARGE ANY LONGER.  SO NOW MY REVIEW IS BASED ON THE BATTERY LIFE, WHICH ENDS UP BEING THE LIFE OF THE TRIMMER.  NOW HAVE TO SEND IT BACK AGAIN.  WOULDN&#x27;T BUY ANOTHER UNLESS THEY START PUTTING BETTER BATTERIES IN IT.</li>
    <li> Does what I need too. Like the guard. Only holds a charge for a few weeks. Used or not.</li>
    <li> This thing is a real piece.  Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for longer than 10 minutes after being plugged in for several hours.  It doesn&#x27;t even work when it&#x27;s plugged in so I have to plan my shaving a day in advance to ensure that it charges overnight and hope that I&#x27;m quick enough to finish before the battery dies.  Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> My beard is quite coarse and I had a hard time finding a trimmer that would cut easily. This one does the job well and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This here is one good product! I probably shave twice a week, and this helps keep the stubble from getting out of hand. Trimmer keeps its charge for weeks, but this I suppose would depend on the frequency of use. I am pleased with this gadget and would recommend to others!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in August 2012, used it at the most 4-5 times a month. Last month the upper blade covering came lose, though i should mention this is a physical design problem. Ok for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my third beard trimmer in the past 15 years and it works quite well, is versatile in its settings, has a long life battery and fits my hand well.</li>
    <li> No longer recharges, and I can&#x27;t even use it while its plugged in.  Was a nice trimmer while it worked.</li>
    <li> I like the way that this trimmer does its job, but I am very unhappy with the battery. It won&#x27;t run off the cord if the battery has runs dead so if it dies part way through I&#x27;m going to look funny all day. After using it for a year I could always guarantee the battery would drop too low between uses and I&#x27;d have to charge it the night before or risk it dying before I finished—and I don&#x27;t even have a beard, just a mustache—it got that bad. After a year and a half it got to the point where I don&#x27;t even unplug it because the battery barely holds any charge.</li>
    <li> Everything else about this trimmer is fine, but the power situation makes it unusable.  If I shave for 3 minutes and don&#x27;t recharge it, it won&#x27;t get through another shave 3 days later.  I have to recharge it each time.  Even this would be fine if the power cord powered the shaver itself, but it only charges the battery, making it mostly useless.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement right now.  Oh, and it won&#x27;t work with 240V/60Hz outlets in Europe.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Norelco Accutrol 900 that I had for a couple years.  The new Remington trimmer works great and the length adjustment stays were you put it.&lt;br /&gt;As a warning - the operating instructions say to hold the trimmer so that the length adjustment wheel is facing away from you.  This is INCORRECT because if you do that the blades are the same distance from the guide no matter what setting you have and the only thing that changes the depth of cut is the angle you hold the trimmer to your face!  Hold it so the adjustment wheel faces towards you!!&lt;br /&gt;I think most people would spot this right away but in case you haven&#x27;t used a trimmer like this before, it&#x27;s good to know before you make a mistake that&#x27;ll last a week, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it for about a month now and it does a great job, still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it since the initial charge.  The only downside compared to my previous Norelco is that this one doesn&#x27;t have a smaller pop-up detail trimmer...overall no big deal and I would highly recommend the MB-200 to anyone looking for a good beard &amp; mustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Easy to clean.  Very precise trimming.  It feels well balanced and it is good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The product description listed this as a beard shaping trimmer. It may be a good trimmer but not good for shaping a beard.</li>
    <li> I have had this for one year, and the battery will less for less than a minute.  I have to charge it for an hour before every use.  Worthless.  I&#x27;m going back to a corded beard trimmer.  Not for men with thick beards!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older model.  This one is awful.  The battery won&#x27;t stay charged and you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The blades on this machine are great and very powerful! I previously owned Philips Norelco products and found myself replacing them every 6 months due to a defect. This product looks and performs as if it is going to last years.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Works very well and stays running for a long time on the batteries. Trimmer gets very close to your skin without cutting you. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> He loves it! Uses it every day. He likes to have a little stubble and the trimmer is perfect for that look.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Norelco trimmer that ran me about $50.  When the Norelco finally broke down I decided to replace it within something inexpensive.  So far so good.  The Remington has done a great job replacing my previous trimmer.  There seems to be more juice to the unit and more length settings for trimming.  If you&#x27;re in the market for an inexpensive trimmer that gets the job done, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is sturdy (ie. the guiding bracket has no wobble in it).  It holds a decent charge, it&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold.  I really enjoy using this shaver - more than any other shaver i&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver to replace my last Remington MB trimmer that I lost.  It worked tirelessly for 10 years (although the battery had memory effect, so it was becoming problematic anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about this unit is that it&#x27;s missing the stubble shaver.  My last Remington MB trimmer had a flip-out stubble shaver that would remove almost all hair on my face.  If you look at the back of this unit, there&#x27;s a panel there to hide where they took it out.  If I find my old shaver, I might put the stubble shaver back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Seemed like this was a good item, however after a few months of use not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It works well especially with the different levels of trimming, however out of the box one of the bristles was broken so i had to glue it back on. Also after a few months this thing wont hold a charge anymore. Even with a full charge it runs sluggish and slow, sometimes getting stuck in my beard which hurts....</li>
    <li> Great quality, nice shape, but the battery life on this thing is just horrible. It lasts a LOT less than their last model I owned.</li>
    <li> Started out as a great item but was disappointed when battery failed to hold charge after a year of use. Other than that it worked great.  Felt solid in hand and trimmed great.</li>
    <li> So long as you are not expecting and professional clipper unit, this one is easy to handle, comfortable to use, charges quickly, and maintains a charge very well. After one charge, I have used it multiple times without needing to plug it in again. Be aware, as with all such clippers, to test it at a high blade setting the first time you uses it and then turn the setting down to cut closer if needed. The number gauge on all such units doesn&#x27;t really mean much, and the same number between different brands and makes may not cut at the same length.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these that the head broke off. They cut good and hold charge good if it weren&#x27;t for the weak head, I would give it at least 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I really loved this trimmer until the battery started losing its charge.  Too bad you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it (instead of just for charging.)  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been 3 years and it&#x27;s lucky if it lasts 5min on one charge.  I&#x27;d love to give it 5 stars, but don&#x27;t think using it once a week (app 150 times total) should be cause for a dead battery.</li>
    <li> This thing has a s*** battery which diminishes even further very quickly. I have to plug it in for practically 12 hours, and then it lasts maybe 20 minutes worth of shaving. On top of that, when plugged in it doesn&#x27;t run off the electricity from the wall, it just stops charging and runs off of the battery. So the only way to use the product is to charge it which is ridiculous. If you have no battery life, and plug it in and turn it on it will NOT run. Idiotic design.</li>
    <li> I have tried the sideburn trimmer to do this and half the time i cant get a straight cut but this baby lets me have a sharp looking beard...  I love the adjustable knob and the side of the trimmer...</li>
    <li> When I first got this it would last maybe 8-10 days on a single charge, but over the next 8 months that gradually lessened to where it now only holds charge for a few hours, even after charging all night.  I expect soon it&#x27;ll just stop working completely, and it appears the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable, so after not even a year I&#x27;ll be in the market for a new trimmer already.  Last one I got lasted over 5 years, so this is quite the disappointment!</li>
    <li> Purchased this in March. it&#x27;s now October and it&#x27;s dead, won&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old one with the same make/model.  Works great.  Easy to adjust.  Good for close trims.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and has worked well after moderate use for about a year. Makes shaving quick and easy if I grow out my beard. It&#x27;s a little silly that it can&#x27;t run on wall power (you have to charge the battery even if it&#x27;s plugged) but I&#x27;ve only run into that once since I always have it plugged in when not in use.</li>
    <li> Couldnt hold a charge for long and finally no longer worked. If you buy cheap, expect it to be cheap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had my trimmer for about one year and already the batteries will not keep there charge. Buy something else!!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in 2010 and it is still going strong. I have had no issues with the blades or the rest of the it&#x27;s construction. It is very simple to use and you don&#x27;t have to deal with attachments. I picked it up from Amazon for about $14 at the time, and boy, what a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the battery does not hold charge for more than a few minutes any more (after 3 years of use). You cannot use it while it is charging. This can be annoying when you realize that you left it unplugged the previous time.</li>
    <li> Maybe too good.  At least that would explain how mine disappeared from the bathroom of a hotel room a few weeks ago.  The product works very well.  I used it to trim my beard and found it easy to use from the first time I tried it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is easy to adjust. You don&#x27;t have to swap out different attachments. small adjustments allow incremental length changes. great value</li>
    <li> This is the third Remington MB-200 I&#x27;ve owned.  The first one gave me several years of fine service.  I dropped it and slightly damaged the cutters.  The second one&#x27;s battery lasted about one year, but I did not follow the instructions on recharging, so I can&#x27;t blame the manufacturer.  The instructions say to keep it charged and then let it run down completely and recharge every six months.  The battery is not replaceable, so I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts much longer.  As for the quality and features, it&#x27;s top notch.  Nine cutting depth settings, a removable guide, and pop-open cleaning are nice features, and the blades are very sharp and do an excellent job of cutting.  If the battery pack was replaceable, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this on February 1, have used it about 7 times, now it will not hold a charge and wont even work while plugged in.  Evedently it is past its 30 waranty so I am out of luck.  Horrible product even when it worked.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s very easy to switch between lengths, is comfortable to use, and the different lengths give you a lot of options for your beard.</li>
    <li> I was wondering exactly how long I had been using this same trimmer, so I checked my Amazon order history. I bought it in September 2011! Now, 3.5 years later, it is still going strong. Other people have said theirs have died, so maybe mine is a fluke? Either way, I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 9 length settings (from 1.5mm / 0.06&amp;#34; up to 18mm / 0.71&amp;#34;), and the little click wheel makes it easy to change from one to the other. I actually have a second, smaller trimmer that I use for getting to places that I want completely clean-shaven, like my neck or under my jawline. This one is just good for trimming big patches at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy. You don&#x27;t wash it, you just wipe it down with a cloth or soft brush. The blades never need to be sharpened or oiled either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- The battery self-discharges. This means if you leave your trimmer unplugged for any significant length of time (more than about a day), the battery loses its charge. It then takes a really long time to recharge. I just leave my trimmer plugged in in a corner of the room at all times so that I don&#x27;t worry about it not being charged when I need it&lt;br /&gt;- If the battery is dead, you cannot operate the trimmer by plugging it in. This is not how things should work. If your cell phone battery dies, you can plug your phone in and turn it on as long as it&#x27;s connected to the power outlet. With the trimmer, you have to wait until the battery recharges, then use battery power. And the battery takes a LONG time to recharge (more than a couple hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some people like trimmers that can stand up. This one cannot stand, but must lie flat. It&#x27;s not a problem for me, but it might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this trimmer is ideal for me, and it might work for you too if you&#x27;re not bothered by the battery issues.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works rather fast and you can trim your beard, no matter the length, pretty quick. Big plus when you 10 minutes late for work.</li>
    <li> As stated in many reviews. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you plan to replace it within a year. Total junk. Works decent, until it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. What a bummer. I hate throwing my money in the trash. Products like this, especially ones that I only use once a month or so, should last me decades, not months. There is no excuse for a company to sell a crap product, and not be held accountable for it. I wish I could get my money back, but it waited until almost exactly a year to fail. I&#x27;m irritated enough by this, I&#x27;ll probably not ever buy a Remington product again either.</li>
    <li> great tool and I would highly recommend.  I love the ability to go from 1-8 settings rather than other brands that go 1, 3, 5, 7.</li>
    <li> its very useful and handy for me and my friends got attracted to it and one of them has ordered it i think hope U should provide such items in a bit low cost, so that it would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Barely one year later and the battery won&#x27;t keep a charge.  After charging the trimmer for several hours, I can use the trimmer for my hair.  However, after I store it away for several days or longer, the battery loses all charge and I need to plug it in for several hours to use it again.  Very disappointing, a good product otherwise.</li>
    <li> horribe, horrible battery.  It keeps a charge for the day.  I bought another electric razor and charge holds for months.  This thing absolutely stinks.</li>
    <li> Absolute piece of junk; batteries won&#x27;t hold a charge AT ALL!!  SAVE YOUR $ and DO NOT BUY THIS POS!!&lt;br /&gt;(by the way, Made in China)</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this often to trim his beard. It does the job well. No complaints from him about the trimmer or the settings. He did say it&#x27;s better than ones he&#x27;s used in the past. The only drawback is the charge lasts a few days but he has to charge it often when he has to trim. His routine is to charge it the night before and use the next day.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it still works great.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer and it did the trick very simply but the jog wheel stopped working after 6 months and it has a short battery life.  Other than that I really liked it compared to any other trimmer i have used and am buying another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after the charger on my Philips Norelco T765 got toasted.&lt;br /&gt;The trim is quick and painless - powerful motor, effective blades. Construction quality is a notch above that of my old Philips Norelco T765. The wheel-adjusted height is a nice feature and very convenient. The blades come pre-lubed and seem of good quality. The head is relatively easy to clean. However, some product descriptions seem to imply that it is rinsable - which is absolutely not the case. So don&#x27;t get fooled (like I did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a good product that does the job well, and at a low price point. What else do we need?</li>
    <li> For the price you arent going to find a better quality trimmer. Lots of power, lightweight, and very durable. Dont waste your time or money with any other one. I suggest this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This trimmer stop charging after a few months. It will not work even if it is plugeed in .... useless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> always been a fan of remington shavers for about 20 yrs now. this model is as good as any they&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. The rechargeable battery dies after a year or two, so this is my 3rd or 4th.  I still haven&#x27;t found a better brand, and if I did it probably would have the same problem.  I wish they would make this with replaceable rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> It works just fine.  I had one before.  The prior one took two AA batteries which lasted for months.  The new one is rechargeable and now I have to carry a charger with me.  I like the battery one better</li>
    <li> The razor&#x27;s internal battery does not hold a charge well.  I have to charge hours before each use.  It works well otherwise but this is very annoying.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.  battery life is so so.</li>
    <li> The good: quick, easy to use and adjust, virtually no maintenance required, and pretty good trim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: in less than a year, I am purchasing my second because the batteries have crapped out.  It literally doesn&#x27;t hold charge for longer than one 2min shave now.  But I guess the evidence that despite this I&#x27;m buying my second is pretty good support for the product, overall.</li>
    <li> This trimmer fits the bill for a quick touch-up on the beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight&lt;br /&gt;- Fast charge (after the first charge)&lt;br /&gt;- Contour handle is nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Not as accurate for trimming.  Length isn&#x27;t necessarily what you think it is.&lt;br /&gt;- Still no use while plugged in.  I understand they want you to buy a new one every couple years, but not being able to use it plugged in is a a little ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all a good trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> The battery got increasingly weak and now, just one year later, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  Worst of all, it can&#x27;t run on AC power so you can&#x27;t just plug it in to use it.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these before. I replaced it because Remington did not offer a replacement JUST for the blade. I like how small and easy to handle this trimmer is, again this will be the second one I owned, so you know I like this</li>
    <li> Works well and rolling adjustor is accurate and easy to use.  Great for beards or buzz cuts.  Charge last long.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;got dull and the beard place was broke. I like this one it was exactly like my other one, it holds a charge, it works either off or on the plug .I wish there were more like this in the cheaper market because I know that men would rather not have to pay through the nose and still like to trimm their beard.</li>
    <li> Directions for use could use a little more pictures or factual directions. But other then that it&#x27;s been a great first time beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars only because they don&#x27;t offer the model I used for years. That model had a pop-up mustache trimmer and it worked flawlessly for a very long time. I still use it for the pop-up. I bought this one recently and I am getting great results. The ability to dial up the cut lengths is a must have. It works great. I will probably buy another one because I wish I had bought an extra &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; model before, now that I can&#x27;t get it anymore. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great all in one trimmer without the need of changing the heads of the razor</li>
    <li> This works great at first. After a couple months the batteries will not hold a charge. The only way I can use it is to let it charge overnight. Then take it straight off the charger to my face. It will not operate off the wall power. Any time in a drawer and you get 30 seconds of use out of it and a really funny looking beard. Once that happens even letting it charge a couple hours will get you another 30 seconds. I went back to using my Wahl hair clippers for my beard. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work when plugged in when it has little to no charge.  You need a trim because you notice it NOW.  So you pull the trimmer out after a few weeks of not needing a trim and no charge and doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in.  So you go out scruffy leaving it plugged in for hours so you can use it later.  Come on.  Switch the wires so it will work as it charges and not just work off the charger.  Parallel wiring would solve this problem .Otherwise, works great, easy to use, and fully adjustable.  I will NOT BUY another trimmer that has this flaw.  Thank goodness my electric shaver doesn&#x27;t behave like this.</li>
    <li> Cheap, efficient, and compact.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first year or so but now it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge beyond a few seconds.  When it works, it works pretty well but obviously not being able to hold a charge (plus you can&#x27;t shave with it plugged in) makes it completely ineffective.</li>
    <li> Pros: It&#x27;s only $22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it seriously lacks power and batteries last no where near as long as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend another $15 and get a Li-ion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2.5 years since I&#x27;ve owned this product. I bought it for my husband, who has a full (and awesome) beard. It was great for about a year or so. Now it wont hold a charge very long. He has it on for about 2-4 minutes before it starts dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Now it will only work for about 20 seconds before dying. I&#x27;m currently looking for one you can use while plugged in. I would stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> MB-200 cool...I&#x27;ve tried to purchased from remington website before but there is no shipping to asia, product is in a good condition , i believed it will be last for a couple of years</li>
    <li> i used this product 3times and it&#x27;s already not working. im not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it. the charging light lights up green when plugged in, but it only tries to turn on for a few moments and fizzles out whether it is plugged in or not. it never got wet. the gaurd/comb is very cheap/flimsy and felt like it would break easily in the near future supposing i were to get more use out of it. the guard didnt lock into place very well and screwed up my beard the first time i used it. all in all, i was extremely disappointed due to all the positive reviews and ratings. but, at least it was a small price to pay to find out i probably need to drop a chunk of change on a trimmer to get decent results. i recommend this product to thrifty people who are used to being very careful to take care of cheap products and dont mind cheap, slightly unsatisfactory results</li>
    <li> This is a good little trimmer, it gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long and takes a long time to charge back up once it&#x27;s died.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a decent trimmer for the price.  I&#x27;ve had this for eight months.  For the first three months it kept a decent charge.  Now, I have to charge it every time I want to use it.  And, you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it right away like other ones I had.  It has to charge for about two hours prior to use.  I trim my beard once a week.  I would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Does its job in terms of actually trimming the beard for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap price&lt;br /&gt;- Mostly does its job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not shave close at all, leaving a lot of stubble even if you remove the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;- Only 1 attachment type.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not hold a charge at all...can charge it all night and it will run out of power after the next use or so.&lt;br /&gt;- Also does not use power from the outlet if you leave it plugged in. Will run out of power as usual, forcing you to delay your shave or use another method.&lt;br /&gt;- Cheaply made...it slipped off my counter top, not much more than 4 feet, and the head snapped off, which ended its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with another option that at least FEELS less cheaply made but for around the same price.</li>
    <li> Device is simple, inexpensive, and very easy to use. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s effective trimming both my beard and mustache. The thumbwheel used to set the length of the hair has a wide adjustable range and has clearly visible numbers so you can always dial in the same setting that works best for you. The recharging technology for this trimmer is NiCAD. For Li-ION, you&#x27;d probably have to pay a bit more.</li>
    <li> My husband dosen&#x27;t comment too often on things so I was surprised when he said how good it works.  Really close shave under his beard and for trimming back of hair.  He would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> If there are any good reviews of this product, it&#x27;s from people who just bought it.  I LOVED this thing when I got it.  That lasted about a month.  Now the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge through a single trimming.  I have to stage trimming, do one sideburn (quickly) then wait a couple hours for the battery to hold enough of a charge to do the next one. No way I could do my beard or mustache at once, have to space my face out over the week. The power adapter isn&#x27;t one where you can run the thing while plugged in, you have to wait for the battery to charge. Completely useless.  Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t last very long so you&#x27;ll just be replacing it soon.  SO, I&#x27;m off to buy a new trimmer....</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a piece of crap I bought from Target.  Wow.  The cut is great, it holds a charge extremely well and it just feels right just holding it.  And for the price, it&#x27;s a great buy.  Never needs sharpening?  Sold!</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold charge after a few months. Worst part is that it won&#x27;t even work if it&#x27;s plugged in - you have to charge it immediately before you use it and then be completely done within 15 minutes or so when the battery will have died.</li>
    <li> If you want a good trimmer, prepare to spend a lot more than $30. This thing barely cuts, it can&#x27;t hold a charge, and it&#x27;s loud. To give you an idea of what to expect - two weeks ago the battery died mid-shave, which was probably only the second or third time I&#x27;d used it. Today I needed a little trim and guess what, I couldn&#x27;t finish this time either. Never had such problems with my $100+ Norelco. This thing is absolutely USELESS.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I have bought.  The first on gave long and excellent service and, no, it did not wear out--it got lost when my wife and I moved to new quarters.  It does a great job.  I do not, however, know how long it retains its power when  not in use and not being charged so if that is important to you it  might be best to read more reviews.  For my use it is definitely rates five stars</li>
    <li> I recently started growing beard and mustache. After reading positive reviews, I bought this from Amazon. It did not disappoint me. It gives a perfect trim in 5-10 minutes. After one full charge, I was able to get 6 trims. It is definitely well worth the price. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a mustache and beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> While I cannot speak to the longevity of the trimmer, my initial experience with it has been that it&#x27;s far better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve bought.  It balances a reasonable size against easy portability quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it cuts all my hair to the same easily adjustable length.  What more do you want?</li>
    <li> I used to have the older version of this product, which is no longer available.  Both versions have really weak batteries, but at least with the old version you could plug it in and it would operate off the AC directly.  On this version, when the batteries die, you have to plug it in AND wait until the batteries recharge.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised.  Holds a charge for a long time.  Head is a little hard to remove for cleaning but it might be tight since it is new.  Only complaint is that the height adjustment numbers are too small and unclear to read.</li>
    <li> It was really great while it was working. Then, the trimmer adjustment broke. Didn&#x27;t even make it to month 3. I only use it once every two weeks. It wasn&#x27;t abused or anything... just garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Remington must have missed my first email, but promptly responded to my second. They are sending me a new unit in 7 - 10 business days. If the new one works out, I&#x27;ll update my review. Regardless, not being able to use a trimmer for over two weeks is extremely inconvenient.</li>
    <li> This worked great until I dropped it once. A plastic tab broke off and the length attachments don&#x27;t stay on unless they&#x27;re held in place now. It still works.. duct tape might help.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a beloved MB-300 that I used for 4 consecutive years before leaving it in a hotel room. This model has failed to meet my expectations in a couple of ways:&lt;br /&gt; - There is no smaller mustache trimmer built-in.&lt;br /&gt; - It does not allow corded operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer remains one of my favorite models because there aren&#x27;t any parts to mess with or keep track of. I can easily adjust the length and, until now, I didn&#x27;t need a separate tool for delicate regions like my mustache.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my cheap trimmer that i bought at Target last year that broke on my at the start of this fall.  I like most people was skeptical because it wasnt what i was use to buying, but for the price you cannot beat it.  With easy to change levels of trimming, i am able to fade my hair with the beard with no problems at all.  No changing trimming head pieces and what not; everything is right on the trimmer. Been using for about a month or two now and still sharp with no pulls.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is easily adjustable and works well.  The battery life is good and overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great, but the battery life after a full charge is horrible, contacted Remington (Spectrum Brands) 800-392-6544, who are great, but the product MB200 simply does not hold a charge, so I am being shipped a MB4040 to replace the MB200  Do not purchase the MB200, unless you want to charge it every 3 to 4 days</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer for the most part, it does everything I need it to do without a bunch of changable heads.  The adjustable trimimg comb works flawlessly and I have never had a problem with the cutting head becoming dull.  This is the third one I have owned so this is where the dissapointment comes in.  The recharagble batteries seem to get weeker till they just fail to charge at all at about the 2 year mark.  This has happened to all three no matter how I have treated recharging them.  This razor does not have a self vacume to keep small facial hair from getting on the counter so that could be a deal breaker for some. I looked high and low in almost every department store as well as every drug store, however I didn&#x27;t find any that I felt matched the price or functionality that this razor has.</li>
    <li> Very bad product. Used it on my sensitive areas and this product butchered me with blood everywhere. This should not be sold.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his b-day and he really likes it, he said it was easy to use with the built in adjustments.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Simple.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should with no problems.  Doesn&#x27;t pull like some other clippers, is easy to clean and holds a charge for several trims.</li>
    <li> I had a norelco before this one. The battery on the norelco still held a charge for at least 6 shaves after 10 years of use! After 1 year, this one only gets through 1 shave.</li>
    <li> This was actually a replacement for the same item purchased 3 years ago...only the 1 st item was purchased in a store.....GREAT JOB, AMAZON!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I had an older Remington model that lasted 10-15 years and was very satisfied. (I only trim once a month.)  I wanted something similar and this one was it.  As many people have written - IT DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE!.  Don&#x27;t buy this model!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer less than two years ago and the battery will no longer hold a charge through a full head and beard trim.  It gives a decent cut but it&#x27;s much buzzier in the hand than the five year old Panasonic it replaced. I didn&#x27;t get another Panasonic because I couldn&#x27;t find a cut depth guide when mine broke even though the battery and cutting head were still going strong.</li>
    <li> Simple and well made. Good value for money. Works well and makes for an easy trim, easy to clean up afterwards. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who asked for a new trimmer. He said he liked it. Not sure about anything else, as i never used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m curious why the title of this product states that it is for mustaches and beards when the directions in the package and the packaging itself states it is for beards only.  Perhaps it can be used for mustaches but where are the directions for that?  They certainly aren&#x27;t in the package.  I foolishly bought this product based on its title and not its functionality.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well on my thick mustache hair! wife loves to feel my face and kiss me now. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this trimmer, and tried several others since and none are as effective as this unit. While it no longer has the little flip out mini trimmer blade, it&#x27;s thumb wheel length adjuster means no dealing with a bunch of attachments. Makes the job much faster.</li>
    <li> My husband seems to have enjoyed this product while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last very long. Not sure whether we&#x27;ll buy another or upgrade to a more sturdy product. He&#x27;s used it pretty heavily for about 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My husband tells me he dropped it, which explains why it broke after only 8 months. But he also said that he didn&#x27;t find the battery charge very good.</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington beard trimmer I have owned and the batteries in both stopped taking a re-charge after about two years use.  Not coincidently there is a two-year warranty, and this one died almost exactly two years from the purchase date.  When it is running it works very well in trimming my beard, but I don&#x27;t like having to replace it every two years.</li>
    <li> When I opened this trimmer the inside plastic bag was torn open and there were cut beard hairs in the blades.  Naturally, I returned it, but it&#x27;s annoying for me to have to do that when I ordered a supposedly new product.  Also, I wonder why Amazon is not refunding my postage.  Now I have to chase that down.  In their defense, this is the first time (and hopefully only) that something like this has happened to me.</li>
    <li> This product is sturdy, holds a charge well, easy to use and is well put-together.  I like the ergonomic handle and how easy it is to adjust the length of the shave.</li>
    <li> I had one of these a few year ago and it just stopped working one day after about 5 years.  I tried other adjustable trimmers and the types that have the attachable plastic guards, which are the worst!!! This unit is great and adjusts easily to any trim length.  Can also use a comb to help create an even trim if desired.  I use it mainly for my bread to keep it a certain length, the 3 day unshaven look.  It also great for triming other areas of the body if you need to do that as well.  Hopefully this last a lot longer than 5 years.  If so, then it&#x27;s five stars!!</li>
    <li> My husbandman says it&#x27;s his most favorites trimmer ever, and he&#x27;s gone through a lot of them. It does a fabulous job and holds a charge for a long time. he can use it a few times to trim his thick beard before he has to recharge it, and it&#x27;s a powerful little bugger. Would definitely buy it again, especially for the awesome price.</li>
    <li> I have owned two or these beard trimmers. The first one worked reasonably well for a couple months, then stopped working completely. Foolishly, I bought the same trimmer again, reasoning that my individual trimmer must have been defective, while the product as a whole was actually really good (based on so many positive Amazon reviews). A few months after purchasing my second trimmer, it broke just like the first one (motor burned out?). Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beard and mustache trimmer. I use it to trim my beard and mustache, and it does so with great ease and effectiveness. It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles but that&#x27;s just fine. I love the adjustable height of the cutting head. Very convenient and the charge lasts numerous trims. I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now and still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. I trim once a week so that&#x27;s 4 trims and counting. The trim is simple and edgy and flat, just as I want it. You&#x27;ll still need a razor blade to fine tune the edges though, as well as getting rid of unnecessary stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other brands over the last thirty years and this is the best by far. I am happy to recommend it for beard or mustache trimming. It may have other uses (for the ladies?).</li>
    <li> well made,no there is no stand,and I don&#x27;t have a problem with that,I knew that I read what it comes with.Charges easy overnight.Was easy to handle,no matter how hard you push it on your face,there still was a nice even cut.Cut,trimmed mine done in about 2 minutes,no doubt the best one I have ever owned,and for 25 bucks!!If I had one small gripe,the numbers on the little dial to set the length are very small and hard to read,but I have had a beard for 40 years maybe its just weak eyes!</li>
    <li> I have had a beard since I was 19.  I have a skin condition and shaving breaks me out something terrible.  Also I hate shaving, it&#x27;s not natural for a man to scrap off all his facial hair on a regular basis.  Thus many years ago I recieved as a gift a Remington beard trimmer.  I loved it right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard trimmers have to be the best invention of the 20th/21st century.  Now a man can have a beard but keep it tight.  Thanks to beard trimmers most men now in America sport some sort of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Remington performed great, was built of a sturdy composit material and stayed relatively sharp.  My biggest complaint with it was after about 3 years, the battery life died on it.  It would not hold a charge.  I would charge it for 3 hours and if I was lucky it may last 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus I ordered myself the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer off Amazon and can say so far I have no real complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this newer model is almost exactly the same to my old one.  So if you are a die hard Remington fan you will not have to go through any re-ajusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts good, the blades are sharp and lubricated well.  NOTE, never run water under the shaver head to clean it, this washes away the lubricent.  This model has the same beard height \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; you turn with your knumb to ajust cutting height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great so far.  I probably could trim my beard charging only every other time if I wanted too.  The old shaver I had used Nichol-Cadium batteries.  I am not sure if the newer model uses this outdated type or if they have switched to lithium.  Either way, know that overcharging your shaver which I am prone to do at times, damages batteries.  That may have been why my older model died on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is the plastic on this new model feels a little bit \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  I get the feeling that if I dropped it, (like I did with my old model never resulting in breakage), this new model would break.  So I guess I&#x27;ll need to be careful and not drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---To buy or not to buy?---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid buy, if the price it right.  I only paid around 14.99 for mine off Amazon.  They&#x27;re going for more right now.  Wait around for a price reduction and I am sure you can get this great trimmer for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Final thought---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good way to clean out the trimmer head when it gets clogged with hair, pop up the top and go outside and blast it with a few shots of canned compressed air.  Best way I&#x27;ve found to clean it, that little brush they give you just doesn&#x27;t cut it sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well good luck and remember a well grommed man is a successful man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always sorry for any misspellings and grammer errors.  I went to public school, where my principal looked like Grizzly Adams and my teachers would reminisce out loud about the old days, when they could have beaten us when we were bad.ing in breakage), this new model would break.  So I guess I&#x27;ll need to be careful and not drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---To buy or not to buy?---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid buy, if the price it right.

    <li> I owned the previous model of this trimmer for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge held for a very long time and for weeks in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current model looses it&#x27;s charge in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk.  The angle of the cutter makes it extremely difficult to trim your beard without pulling the hair out or catching on your skin.</li>
    <li> i really enjoy this machine, ive only had it for 2 days now, but ive used it quite often..i like the adjustment options on the adjustable head from 0 to 9, mine is a 3 for my mustache and gotee, its also pretty heavy not flimsy plastic feel, you know your holding a piece of machinery in your hands which is good..good grip to it, its quiet too, if you got the wife in the bedroom and your in the masterbath you wont wake her up or annoy her if shes watching tv..i love that it does not take batters it comes with a charger..so that saves me money on buying battries..also when i was trimming it felt like it was not even touching the hairs..but when i removed it from my face and looked down there they were..and my beard was trimmed i was surprised cause it first it seems like its not trimming but it is..so good buy here folks..pick a few up for xmas and be the hero..lol</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer.  It seems strong (we&#x27;ll see how it goes given the batter is new).  The charge holds for a long time.  I think I haven&#x27;t charged it in at month or more.  Itasn&#x27;t failed me yet and I use weekly (not a heavy user).  I like the ergonomic design -- the shape is rather interesting (apparently for male use :-)).  The size of the head is just right for trimming my mustache and gotee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a solid device.  At a good price, I think it&#x27;s a great value.  Would absolutely buy again if I had to do it all over.  Would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a liner to shave and to line your hair and beard up, you came to the wrong place. Go buy a Andis Outliner. It will line your hair and beard up crisp and clean. But if you are looking for a Mustache/Beard trimmer, you came to the RIGHT PLACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially was looking for something to shave and something to line with. That is not the case with this product. It does EXACTLY as it says it does. It trims and edges just well enough for you to have a nice beard. The built in comb is FANTASTIC. I used it to keep a small goatee, while removing it to cleanse my face of any and all unwanted hair. It cuts CLOSE at level one, and even closer when you take off the gaurd. Just a little bit above the Outliner I was speaking about earlier. Me personally, because I&#x27;m young (18) and do not have alot of facial hair, I simply keep it at a nice 3. It keeps my face hair dark and visible yet not thick. This brings me to the complaints I&#x27;ve heard about the built in comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do agree with some people, it feels odd to take it off as you feel as you may brake it in the beginning, you get used to it. I fear that because it is NOT very thick it COULD break, but because my beard is not very thick it would not be a big problem for me. This is partly because it comes with a mini comb also to use for say eye brow trimming (watch out! I have not attempted this and do not recommend it if you are NOT confident in your abilities). This is still a shame as it is a very good adition especially when it has 9 levels from border line afro, to level one 5oClock Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this item for about 2 months now. It is a very good product and I recommend it for its use. I have heard problems about it dying on you in the first year and what not, BUT don&#x27;t be afraid as it COMES WITH A 2 YEAR WARRANTY FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can&#x27;t stress this enough. Simply keep the box and the instruction manual it comes with and you should be fine for the next 2 years.It does NOT work when plugged in so (run on AC current) so it is a problem, but just follow the directions in the instruction booklet (Such as NOT leaving it charged 24/7, and letting the battery die FULLY every 6 months) and you SHOULD be fine. If not, there is always that 2 year warranty Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It does exactly as its advertised (except for the water thing, NEVER PUT WATER ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it comes with SELF SHARPENING BLADE and a CLEANING BRUSH! If you put water on it, it will ruin it!) and gets the job done fairly well for its pricing. The only con is it does NOT do Tape Ups for a hair line like I hoped it would, but thats my own foolish assumptions. Any way if you would like to keep your bear/moostachio in mint condition this does the job well with no nicking and cutting, a smooth cut, and a strong battery! I recomend it 4/5 stars!</li>
    <li> I had bought two of these. The first pair was for my dad and he loves the trimmer. I would use it on my son&#x27;s hair too and the cuts came out beautifully. I had bought a cheapo hair cutter that broke so I ordered myself one of these to cut my son&#x27;s hair. He is 14 months old and tolerates this just fine. The 9 length settings are great and you can remove the guard to use just the blade. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT TRIMMER, FAST SHIPPING :) IT WAS PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND AT BIRTHDAY SOOOO MY HUSBAND LIKE IT VERY MATCH. IT WORKS VERY GOOD. THANKS A LOT:)</li>
    <li> Not worth it, I was expecting something bet which would do the job but this is a regular type of sh*t you would buy form any store. Not worth it most of these other comments are regular stupid customers who just spend money and think that&#x27;s what they wanted. Does not even do the job it&#x27;s more of a shaving the head thing</li>
    <li> This thing whistled across my thick, thick beard like it was nothing! It trimmed everything on the first go-around with ZERO pulling. Maybe I am partial because my previous one basically tore half the hair out of my face, haha, but this product definitely does what it is supposed to do! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Pros: Supper Long battery life, adjustable guard&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Didn&#x27;t know I could take the guard all the way off at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this beard trimmer. It does not have a bunch of different guards that I always end up breaking or losing when swapping them out. The one adjustable guard makes using the trimmer quick and easy. Also I was surprised by the battery life of this trimmer. I have had it for over 6 months and only have only charged it a few times with pretty regular use. Love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this thing for very long, about 1.5 years. I only use it once every couple of weeks to trim my beard. It will not hold a charge anymore. I have to plug it in every time I want to trim and let it charge for a couple hours beforehand, because as other reviewers have noted: it won&#x27;t operate on A/C power. So if the battery goes, the whole thing is worthless even when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To its credit, it trims pretty well. But once the battery goes, it&#x27;s a paperweight. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer at a great price! I have used it probably at least 12+ times and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet. The length settings are perfect and can work from stubble to a full beard.</li>
    <li> Good price, great adjustability, perfect size but will not hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I take it out of the bathroom drawer to use the battery dies after 3 seconds of being turned on.  I then have to charge it before every use which is very inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also louder than a few others trimmers I have owned.</li>
    <li> If you wanna buy this trimmer, consider yourself buying a 3 hours trimmer. Cause after it&#x27;s batter goes out, it never charges again!!!! i threw it away after the battery was out! there is no way to replace the battery as it can&#x27;t be opened or anything. you just throw it away</li>
    <li> It worked great and did a good job trimming my goatee while it worked. Not having a stand was no big deal but I would have liked it if you could use it plugged in while it charged and while the battery was dead. The battery died out on it a few weeks ago and no longer holds a charge after 1 year and 10 months of use. I only paid $15 for (now its $25)but I thought I would get more than almost 2 years of use. If Remington hoped I&#x27;d just buy another one, well they are right, but it won&#x27;t be a Remington, I&#x27;ll try another brand out, especially since its $10 more now.</li>
    <li> Finally! A great trimmer with a smooth cut and also solid \\&quot;dial\\&quot; type length settings. So far, it&#x60;s well recomended...</li>
    <li> Solid construction.  Significantly better than my last Remington. Wish it had a small flip up blade or a small attachment.</li>
    <li> I had a rather bushy goatee and decided to trim it down to professional level. When using this product as advised I found it quite difficult to get through the hair. Using it in reverse of recommended works,  but then you&#x27;re not really able to pick the length. It definitely seems to struggle with hair of any real length or thickness. I&#x27;ll be getting a different one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I had an old $20 beard trimmer prior that lasted years until I lost the adapters. This thing basically came apart in my hand after the 3rd time using it. Look elsewhere..</li>
    <li> I have two of this product its really good battery backup and usage is good, worth for money I like it.</li>
    <li> At first, the battery would last for weeks on a single charge. Towards the end, after charging for hours,&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer couldn&#x27;t sustain operation for not even a minute. I had to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, the blade plate was not secure. It would pop out when I went to use it&lt;br /&gt;and I had to careful click it back into place and hope it wouldn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> I used this for both my beard and my hair and it was great for a year and a half. The only down side when it was working is that it took a while to fully charge (it doesn&#x27;t run while plugged in like some more expensive models). The guide is firm and sturdy, I never had a single mishap or issue and the blades remained sharp the whole time I used it. It lasted about a 1.5 years of weekly beard and hair trimming - which would translate to probably 3 years of just beard trims - honestly pretty good for the price. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;top end&amp;#34; trimmer, but it is a good deal and it&#x27;s a reliable as long as the battery is alive.</li>
    <li> perfect for my husband&#x27;s face and also for my son&#x27;s hair when I cut it at home to trim it up</li>
    <li> Small size, easy to carry, easy to handle, easy to use and easy to clean, what else can I say, it works fine, battery last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift.  It came highly recommended.  The receiver is very pleased and now looks ever so handsome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> (IMPORTANT NOTES: I use only setting \\&quot;1\\&quot; - I prefer a &#x60;scruff&#x27; look and generally do not grow a full beard, so please keep this in mind when reading my review.  I have not used any of the longer settings)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review will consist of 3 parts - first, a review of the Remington&#x27;s performance and, second, some tips &amp; tricks I have figured out when using the Remington.  Lastly, some final thoughts / comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the Remington for about 3 months now and am generally pleased with its performance.  The product is 100% analog - there are no digital displays and the length is adjusted via manual \\&quot;zoom wheel.\\&quot;  Some trimmers indicate length via a digital display screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a total of 9 length settings.  It can go as low as 1.5mm (that&#x27;s the setting I use 100% of the time) and as long as 18mm (setting # 9).  The zoom wheel is placed exactly where I happen to place my thumb during shaving.  This hasn&#x27;t presented much of a problem, at least not for me - but I can see where it might for some people.  On setting 1 (1.5mm), the trimmer will give a *slightly* longer than 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look - more of a &#x60;scruff&#x27; look (if that makes sense), but it&#x27;s pretty darn short (the way I like it).  I tend to press the unit pretty firmly against my face on some parts.  The guide comb seems to do an admirable job of preventing nicks / scrapes / and cuts - I have not experienced any problems of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is fairly ergonomic and easy to hold.  It feels like a natural extension of my hand and fits snugly in my palm - almost like a fork or a spoon.  I do not have any issues with the unit slipping in undesired positions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade area is approximately 1.5 inches wide - which seems to be &#x60;just right.&#x27; (see my picture)  It&#x27;s not too narrow, and not too wide. It seems to hug my face accurately and efficiently trims facial hair.  I have a fairly chiseled face - not sure if that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length guide comb is removable - you simply just need to yank it off (see my picture).  This serves two purposes.  First, it enables the user to use the unit to trim facial &#x60;borders&#x27; at the edge of one&#x27;s beard.  Personally, I just stick to my foil shaver for that, so I cannot comment on how well the Remington might perform (never have used that feature).  Secondly, the blades themselves can be flipped open to enable cleaning inside the trimmer&#x27;s cavity where some hair might collect over time (see my picture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a standard plug-in wall charger and a cleaning brush.  During charging, a green light remains lit.  Unfortunately, the unit does not indicate remaining battery life.  This would have been a nice feature, though really it is a minor gripe on my end.  Some have complained about the unit&#x27;s lack of battery life.  For me this has not been an issue.  I seem to be able to use the trimmer for several shavings before charging becomes an issue.  As well, 100% of my shaving is done in my home and so it&#x27;s just as easy for me to charge the unit - I do not travel with it.  I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with other reviews that complain about battery life - it just hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also would have been nice to have some sort of cloth carrying pouch for the trimmer.  In all fairness, most of these trimmers seem not to include this - so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS &amp; TRICKS&lt;br /&gt;Like any type of facial hair trimming product, your face will take time, perhaps several weeks, to &#x60;adjust&#x27; to the shaver&#x27;s surface area.  This is a known fact among the industry and, in fact, many regular / foil shavers will indicate this in the product&#x27;s user guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as usage, you may need to use a variety of angles and techniques on different parts of your face whilst trimming your facial hair.  For me, on some parts of my face, I trim against the direction of the facial hair (left-hand side ofmy face), but on my right-hand side, I tend to use a combination of a &#x60;swirling&#x27; motion to trim my hair along with cutting crosswise.  On my chin, I tend to use a quick, firm, and repeated upward motion.  For whatever reason, these all seem to work well.  I figured out these methods after having the trimmer for a few weeks and just seemed to fall into place over time.  If you look closely, you will see that the hair on your face does not grow uniformly - some parts grow in different directions than other parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who prefer to maintain the scruff appearance, you will definitely need to trim your face more than once a day.  I do so twice - once in the morning before work, and also shortly before I go to bed.  I suppose this is not unique to the Remington, but just a general observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS / COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I am satisfied with the product.  I do not see myself running out and buying another brand - this one more than suffices.  The unit is simple and 100% analog (to me that is a plus).  Electronic components can wear over time or simply malfunction.  I guess I tend to be a bit more &#x60;old school&#x27; in that regard (but feel free to disagree).  The price point is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> My husband used this trimmer for years before his went out. He was so disappointed that he couldn&#x27;t find another in store, and was thrilled when we found it online. He loves it! He has very thick, coarse facial hair and is extremely particular.</li>
    <li> I now own two of these - not because one broke, but because I left one at home while going on vacation and couldn&#x27;t live without it. A lot can be said about a trimmer that works well and is inexpensive enough to order an additional one without hesitation. The only addition I would make to it is the use of a lithium battery and smart charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid buy you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace mb-300 with dying battery, the ergonomic design remains the same, but the plastic used for the variable length comb mechanism is cheap and flimsy.  It lacks the pop up detail function of the mb-300.  Quality of construction has deteriorated considerably.  It&#x27;s serviceable, but not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> According to the Amazon description, this charger works either corded or cordless.  According to the manual, the cord only works to recharge the battery.  If the battery is dead, you can&#x27;t use it even with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also according to the Amazon description, this has a washable design.  According to the manual, you must not rinse the cutter assembly under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once you charge it up, and keep it clean with the enclosed brush, it does an okay job of trimming.</li>
    <li> BEST TRIMMMER IM ON MY SECOND ONE. I HAD MY FIRST ONE FOR TO YEARS JUST WISH IT DIDN&#x27;T DIE ON ME</li>
    <li> Had this thing for a while now and I really like it. The battery tends to die out quickly so you always have to charge it for a few hours right before you need it, but it gets the job done. Its great if you&#x27;re not looking to do anything crazy, I just trim my beard every now and then.</li>
    <li> cuts good last long enough to weed whack the face and the bushes</li>
    <li> I have bought many trimmers in my life but this is the absolute worst. It has not been able to hold a charge since the third month I owned it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it does not work when plugged in like past trimmers I have had. So useless.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!  Nice quality and features!!</li>
    <li> GOOD: Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD: The pivot is plastic. It broke while securely packed in my luggage during a travel. It did not drop or anything. It is a weak spot.</li>
    <li> I wanted something durable, with a strong powered motor. This seems to fit the bill quite nicely. I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in all the time, but after charging it overnight and using once or twice a week, it still works. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It was a good deal.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, but it does not have a replacement battery.  When it&#x27;s dead its dead....</li>
    <li> I liked this product initially, but after 6 months the battery life began to shorten, and by 12 months it would not hold a charge longer than 24 hours.  Useless for travel.  Would definitely not buy again!</li>
    <li> Trims smooth &amp; nice, Good battery backup, Firm grip, Great look &amp; most importantly I like the special trim blade &#x27;Adjust&#x27; button :)</li>
    <li> This is the perfect beard trimmer for you if you like your whiskers to be trimmed off and then thrown into your eyes and all around your bathroom. I was amazed at how messy this little device is. And also how incredibly uneven my beard would come cut. I also did not appreciate the sizing. I&#x27;ve always cut my beard to a \\&quot;3\\&quot; on a variety of beard trimmers. On this one though a 3 is shorter than I was used to and a 4 was much longer than I wanted. I went with it but it was still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After maybe 50-70 uses it now won&#x27;t keep a charge. I&#x27;m glad to finally have a reason to get something better.</li>
    <li> It bought this to replace my old Remington when the battery finally gave out. With the old shaver I could cut my beard 3 or 4 times per charge, but Remington has put a really cheap battery into this new model. Remember you can&#x27;t use this when it&#x27;s plugged in, the way you can with some shavers. So you&#x27;ll be plugging this in to recharge after every use.</li>
    <li> I just ordered a replacement as my original which I had for 4 years, got damaged.  I wear a meticulously-ssculpted, low-cut beard (about 3/8&amp;#34; tapered) and these clippers with the click-roller adjustable wheel have been excellent at keeping me groomed.  I usually use Setting 4 for through my beard and Setting 2 thru 3 to effortlessly blend my sideburns.  They are chargeable (which is a HUGE plus) and I usually slip them into a thick sport sock when travelling and that works well especially since the blade is not exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minus:&lt;br /&gt;The original clippers had a small half-inch wide, flick-out blade for small detail grooming which was exacting for corners, ears, eyebrows and other &#x27;just a smidgin&#x27; work.  I was taken aback and disappointed to find that this feature has been completely removed. I guess I&#x27;ll get used to the mold of plastic they put in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall quality of this item though makes it a keeper and my beard has an ever-expanding fan club...lol!</li>
    <li> Smooth and comfortable  adjusts from stubble to long with a thumb dial.  Not a bunch of cheap plastic parts to keep track of.  Nice.</li>
    <li> This is a quality trimmer and it cuts really well.  The only difficulty is that there is a learning curve in using it.  Trying to get used to how close or long it cuts is difficult.  Otherwise it is well made and operates very well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Well made. Nice feel in the hand. Works as advertised. Battery live excellent. Very happy with trimmer. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is ok.. convenient dial for various lengths without attachments.... removable guard for stubble look.. BUT the battery life is horrible.. get ready to start plugging it in everyday after a short time... then get ready for the battery to start dying during your shave.. to top it off, you can not use it plugged in so your stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away and get one with a Lithium-ion battery which last long and their charge does not go down when they&#x27;re just sitting around.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because mine was broken.  The new one far exceeds the performance of the old one.  I recommend this item for anyone that wants a nice clean cut.</li>
    <li> Purchased 3 years ago.  Batteries are dead, several other complaints of this similar problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to see Remington is still making this product. Had to replace my old one after battery stopped being reliable. This shaver is so versatile you can not only use it for beard and mustache but even your head if you are feeling daring and even handed. You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer it has all the position I could ever use. it is perfect and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well and the clip attachment does as well. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because something is wrong with the power system. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just mine or all models, but the power drains faster than it charges, even when plugged in. So if I plug it in and start using it, it&#x27;ll be maybe a minute before it slows and then stops working altogether -- EVEN WHEN PLUGGED IN. It&#x27;s either a major design flaw or just a defect in my particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in order to use it, I have to first leave it plugged in for hours so it gains enough juice to get me through the trim session (during which I still have to leave it plugged in). I use it very sparingly so I haven&#x27;t bothered to contact the seller or get a new one, but a more regular user wouldn&#x27;t be able to get by with this issue.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Remington Beard Groomer about 4 years ago and I was very satisfied with it.  It would go for several dozen trims (probably 2 hours in running time) before needing re-charging and did a great job on my beard.  Then it began to need re-charging after 3 or 4 trims (maybe 10 minutes in running time). Not unusual for a re-chargeable product. I then bought a new, identical model.  Big mistake. I did the initial charge as per the instructions, but the new groomer needs re-charging after only 1 trim (maybe 3 minutes in running time).  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  I&#x27;m back to using my old groomer and when it fails, I plan to buy another brand, probably a more expensive model.  The Remington is an inexpensive product and you often get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> lithium or not....the older nic-cad battery held a charge longer.  Still one of the best brands out there though.</li>
    <li> Old style. Doesn&#x27;t have the flip up stubble trimmer on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a decent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works the same as the battery powered one. This one does not hold a charge for very long though. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent value at 23$, did what it said it would do. However, I had to do an unsatisfactory amount of passes for the blades to cut all the hairs in my beard. Close shave properties were known to be lacking, but it was worse than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type is coarse&lt;br /&gt;Beard length 3/4 inch</li>
    <li> fast shipping, great product, husband hasn&#x27;t used it yet but had the exact same one before and really liked. thanks</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
    <li> Crapola.  Needs to be constantly plugged in to ac outlet or else it dies fast.</li>
    <li> bought this on Apr 10,2014 and it worked really well but now,May 28,2014, it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to charge anymore and for $30, it ain&#x27;t right</li>
    <li> This is a good product...I like the fact that it has so many cutting levels.  It is rechargeable and comes with the cord.  I only gave this a 4 star as it is slightly bulkier then the model it replaced.  Why companies feel the need to fix something not broken is beyond me</li>
    <li> My husband uses it, but does not like it any where close to the one it  replaced!! No more to say!</li>
    <li> For the price this is an excellent product. The guard and adjustment are the BEST. it&#x27;s so easy to adjust to your length without storing annoying guards in your drawer. The battery lasts plenty long, both for single use and overall. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple years and it still works great. Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for...&amp;#34; never rung truer than this.  Great product initially, but battery will go south within 24 months, I purchased mine July 9th 2012 and she&#x27;s pretty close to the end.  Just barely holds a charge long enough for a quickie trim.</li>
    <li> Great, till the battery died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasted about 1.5 years so I guess it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked, it was perfect.</li>
    <li> This trimmer charges quickly (in about 4 hours), works over a week on a charge.  Great trimming performance, trimmer comb has positive stops (won&#x27;t move unintentionally under pressure).  Ergonomic design, very easy to hold - and to hold at the correct angle.  The product information states that the cutting blade never dulls - thus far I agree (after over a year of almost daily use).  Easy to clean.  Fairly solid construction, quality materials.  I would prefer some kind of indicator for the remaining charge level, since it just goes from normal cutting speed to near stall in seconds (that is a feature of the battery technology used).  The charger is small and light weight, easy to pack or travel.</li>
    <li> My old trimmer finaly broke, so I decided to give the Remington a try. The dial beard settings are solid, my old trimmer would move and change the level. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and still have not had to recharge it. My beard has never looked better.</li>
    <li> My beard does not grow very fast, but I like to keep it short so I do trim at least twice per week and each time takes less than two minutes.  I originally bought this a few years ago and really like the design.  The other beard trimmers had snap-on plastic blade guards that were so flimsy that they&#x27;d break against my face.  With no blade guard, they were instantly useless.  The Remington blade guard is made of heavy plastic that wraps around the entire trimmer and after several years has never broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use the trimmer infrequently, I do an overnight charge perhaps once per month and then the trimmer sits unplugged for up to one month without needing to be recharged.  The trimmer does not come with any sort of stand, but I found that the trimmers that had stands were all of poor quality (like the two earlier ones that had a nice stand to hold broken blade guards that can neither be replaced nor repaired).  The Remington is self-contained.  What you see in the graphic is all that it is, except for the plug-in charger.  The blade guard slides up and down via a scroll wheel and clicks at various, measured stops.  Since there are no parts to keep track of, a stand really is not needed.  I keep the charger cord in the vanity and pull it out when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine died, I shopped for a new one and could only find lousy trimmers at higher prices.  One trimmer from Phillips came wrapped with a set of ear phones (whah???) and I quickly returned that to the store because the shortest setting of that blade guard was already longer than my beard.  The Remington settings trim my beard neatly, but also allow trimming all the way down to &amp;#34;heavy five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  I was pleased that somehow I could get overnight free shipping on this from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, I was able to get my old Remington trimmer (just like this one) to work simply by giving it another overnight on the charger.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t plug it in right ... dunno ... but the next day it was fine again and the replacement for it was waiting on my porch.  This is a nice enough trimmer that if the batteries really did fail, I would take this apart and attempt to rebuild the battery pack by hand.  Most likely though, if the internal battery pack really is dead, then the trimmer is so old that every other aspect of it is also worn out.  At that point, I&#x27;ll just reach for the one I just bought which is waiting in the package in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times,  works great. Trims very close.  Has meet all my expectations. I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> I liked the features of the shaver, and would have given it 5 stars if I&#x27;d reviewed it in the first few months I owned it. After about a year, I got fewer and fewer shaves with each charge of the battery. About 18 months after I bought it, it would hold a charge for only one shave. After two years, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. And it won&#x27;t run on AC power, so it now awaits recycling. If the manufacturer had made some provision for replacing the battery, I wouldn&#x27;t have minded this so much. But they didn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m giving this a 1-star rating.</li>
    <li> I use this thing a lot and it&#x27;s still kicking.  The charging is a little annoying because you don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s going to die until it does, and you can&#x27;t use it again until it&#x27;s charged up for a little bit.  Just having the plug in won&#x27;t run it off the outlet.  Other than that it works phenomenal, I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times and it&#x27;s held up, and I shave my face and chest with it.  Works really well, I liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a couple years now and its still humming. I like the adjustable head for different lengths. I can tell its getting near the end of the life but its had a good run.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. The guard does not slip which is a huge plus! Does not keep charge for days but if you plug it in in between shaves it is great. Nice sharp blades and easy to hold makes this a comfortable trim. I would re buy.</li>
    <li> I had an old model just like this where the battery worked well and took a charge for years and years of use until it finally died. I could not find a new battery for it, so I got this one. This model from the very first time I used it had a horrid battery life. A full overnight charge would decay in hours and barely give a full trim - if any trim at all. I can&#x27;t rate this low enough as it is useless with the no good battery - even with the charger cord plugged in at the same time you are using it.</li>
    <li> Work well, trims quickly and efficently. When are they going to go wireless on this small type of hand appliances</li>
    <li> It is totally ridiculous to have a minimum amount of words for a product review. blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.</li>
    <li> On full charge it used to last 10 minutes (less then 2 trims).  After 3 months, it started lasting less then 4 minutes on FULL CHARGE.  All of the reviews you see with battery life are true.  One year later, it now lasts 3 minutes at 1/4 speed.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works ok but it is hard to take the comb off and I have yet to figure out how to do it. I wish manufacturers would use a larger type for their manuals.  I bought it because it is made by an American company but found out it is made in China.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever had, and I have had a lot of different brands and styles. Also works great to keep my head shaved with no noticeable dulling of the blades.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent and simple to use sums it up. I have not yet owned this long enough to have an opinion on durability, maintenance and cleaning at length, but for the simple purpose of keeping facial hair in check, it does very nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent trimmer.  I am writing this review after several years of good use.  The battery has depleted over time and needs to be plugged in order to get a minute of shave.  If this was able to work while charging/plugged in, I would give this a 5 star rating.  I am starting to look at the overall life-cycle of products I buy and keeping this plugged in is probably a waste of electricity in the long run.  If you forget to charge it, you are out of luck.</li>
    <li> After 5.5 solid years with my previous Remington trimmer, I expected a similarly pleasant experience with the 200. Instead I have had only problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one plus: it shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side: it only shaves well when it&#x27;s plugged into a wall socket. Thankfully, my beard is short, I couldn&#x27;t even imagine using it for thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it shaves nicely when plugged-in, the charger burnt out after 3.5 weeks. The batteries proceeded to last only two shaves without a recharge. What if I was away on a business trip?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either I had great luck with my first Remington or miserable luck with the newest Remington.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s beard because he lazy about keeping up with trimming it. It worked great at first, but after maybe 4-5 uses over the course of 4-5 months (I told you he doesn&#x27;t trim up often), it stopped working. It lasts for about 5 seconds of use then dies, and you can&#x27;t use it while plugged in. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used a generic brand razor with the three metal pieces that form to your face to shave for 10 years until I got this. I recently started maintaining a short beard so I needed something adjustable to shave with. For trimming and such it is great! Works fast and is easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for shaving (all the hair down to your face) it really sucks. Its rough as heck, hurts, and is impossible to do without getting some surface skin and leaving marks. I strongly suggest not using it to shave but just to trim.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version of this model for several years and was very satisfied with it.  As one would expect, the rechargeable battery eventually ran out of steam, so I replaced it (ignoring the warnings of reliability problems of the current - 2012 - \\&quot;equivalent\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a mistake.  After less than 90 days, the thing has run down to inoperable (even when plugged in).  No drops or other mishandling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the middle of a move, so don&#x27;t have time to negotiate a return.  Will chalk it up to failing to heed wise and experienced warnings - this device (and probably the entire Remington brand) is JUNK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really digging this Trimmer had it a few weeks now and I really like how it trims and love the guard on it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it could even do a good job on trimming down my hair (on my head) if I needed it too.&lt;br /&gt;It was a great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s fully charged but you have no idea when it&#x27;s going to die on you.  The LED simply lets you know that you plugged it in.  I LOVE only doing half my beard and the thing dies on me.  It wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal if you could use it while plugged in but when they say cordless they mean cordless only.  Next time I&#x27;m getting one with a battery indicator or one that will work while charging.</li>
    <li> Functionally this is a great trimmer.  I actually like the design of this one better than the more expensive models.  The only issue I have with this is that they use Ni-Cd batteries that tend to give out after a year or so of use.  Really wish they would make another version of this with NiMH batteries in it or even Li-ion!  I&#x27;d buy one of those in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer on my face for about 8 months now, and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to stay sharp, the battery lasts quite a while, and it comes with a little brush to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with it is that the guard doesn&#x27;t stay put if you push too hard.  I cut my hair with it once and had to re-do half of my head because it had slipped from a \\&quot;7\\&quot; to a \\&quot;6\\&quot; mid-cut.  Obviously, this trimmer is not made for haircuts so that&#x27;s my own fault!&lt;br /&gt;But for normal, everyday use on your face you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Any man wanting to wear a beard or mustache should consider buying one of these. I started wearing a goatee about a year ago and decided then to buy it. It&#x27;s been the perfect tool for maintaing a well groomed appearance on a day to day basis and it has performed without a glitch. The adjustable depth blade guard provides for easy control, and consistency, of the length at which the beard is cut. It&#x27;s also great for keeping eyebrows trimmed if your inclined to do so. Remove the guard and one can easily use the trimmer to carefully shape the limits of facial hair or otherwise get rid of unwanted/unsightly hairs. After nearly a year of service I expect to be using this trimmer for many more.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer 18 months ago to replace a Norelco that finally died after 10 years.  The functions are great for trimming beard and mustache, but after only 18 months, the battery will no longer hold a charge more than a week or two.  Nothing quite as delightful as getting halfway through trimming your beard before going to work on Monday morning and having the battery die halfway through!  And BTW, it won&#x27;t work on wall power; you have to wait for it to charge up enough to finish....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to the fact that electronics are so cheap now that they&#x27;re disposable, but this is insulting.  No more Remington for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old trusty Norelco that I bought from Walmart years ago.  This one is very durable and holds a charge for a long time.  I have a full beard and trim 2x per week.  I usually get a 3-4 weeks out of this before I have to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I loved this beard and mustache trimmer.  The built-in length adjuster works great and is a great feature, but the battery&#x27;s lifespan is the Achilles heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NiCad batteries only lasted me about 2 to 2 1/2 years before giving up altogether.  A NiMh or Li-Ion battery would make this a much better unit for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can&#x27;t be too mad about a $25 trimmer though, hence the 3 stars.  I&#x27;m even considering getting a new one to replace Wahl that I&#x27;m currently using.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Though marketed as a trimmer, I expected to be able to get a decent shave/detail out of this as well. With most trimmers you can remove the adjustable length setting part to shave off stubble and/or detail your facial hair. Not the case here. Even with the adjustable head removed, there is a good few millimeters gap between the blades and the guard, preventing you from getting even a modestly close shave. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for 3 years with no issues. It doesn&#x27;t trim perfectly misses a hair here and there, but overall very pleased. I knock off a star because it barely holds a charge anymore and have to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> I have to say... I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this trimmer and it&#x27;s lasted me quite a long time. Now the battery is completely shot, in that if I don&#x27;t have it plugged in it will die within hours (even without use) so what I do is have it plugged in all the time, &amp;#34;charging&amp;#34;, and only unplug it when I&#x27;m using it... even then it feels like it holds just enough charge before it starts dying. This is after about 2 years of use... I&#x27;ve had this for about 3</li>
    <li> Broke after 2 years (a few of the internal parts are plastic, and the one securing the blade broke, rendering the trimmer completely useless). Trimmer did a good job of actually trimming when it worked and when it was charged. Whenever I wanted to use it, I&#x27;d have to charge for 12 hours before every single use. It didn&#x27;t work with a dead battery even when plugged in.</li>
    <li> Lasted a year and now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 minute, literally.</li>
    <li> This unit worked for a about 6 months and then crapped out on me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  I had the same model for over 20 years and was satisfied with it.  When it finally died, I bought the same model but Remington cheapened the quality of materials and it fell apart right out of the box.  I threw it away and bought a Norelco Multigroom which I love.  It is much better than even the old model Remington.  Wish I had the Norelco 20 years ago.  I will never buy Remington again.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Fast delivery. recommended</li>
    <li> Works well but needs to be charged often.</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  Just barely a year old.  I think I&#x27;ll get one with an easily replaced battery next time.      UPDATED: 9/13/2014    Remington contacted me after I wrote a one-star review and told me they had a two-year warranty.  So I sent off the defective unit along with my receipt and they have sent me a new one already! Very happy with the service and I hope they have gotten past the bad batch they were selling last year.  I do like the design and quality of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Stainless Steel Screws are rusted and it needs to be plugged in all the time for it to turn on and work. I have only had this for 3 months!</li>
    <li> OK trimmer.  It has easy adjustable length setting, although the guard is a little difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to produce a very even trim. That was obvious right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery seems to lose charge quickly, and to make things worse, you can&#x27;t use it with AC power.  If you use it while plugged in, it just uses up the battery juice while slowly recharging (i.e. it can&#x27;t keep up when the battery is running low).</li>
    <li> This is a great product......when it works. I had the previous model to this (don&#x27;t know if it had a different model number), it was all grey, it worked great! charged it very little and lasted for a long time per charge and lasted me for years, when it died on me, I felt I got my money&#x27;s worth of use out of it and went back to find the new version was black and silver, this one worked great for about 6 months, then the battery life started declining and now its to the point if I want to use it once or twice a week for 5 minutes at a time I have to recharge it, very annoying to turn it on ready to shave and trim only to hear it die on me when I&#x27;ve barely used it. I called Remington customer service 1-800-392-6544, the girl over the phone sounded like she set a trap when I brought up battery life, she asked how long I charged it, I told her 4 hours but I have left it for over 8 hours in the past with not much difference, she said I have to charge it 14 hours to get half an hour use out of it! it wont make a difference, even on a full charge, the point is even with no use, the battery just dies, I go back to use it 5 days after a full charge and it works for 20 seconds and dies, the Remington employee couldn&#x27;t sounded like she gave less of an ish over the phone</li>
    <li> It was pretty cheap, it was doing most of its job fine (don&#x27;t try to use it somewhere else except your face).&lt;br /&gt;Died in 2 years of rare use. feels flimsy, no carrying pouch, no overcharge protection</li>
    <li> I can only echo what hundreds of others have already said: &amp;#34;After a too-short period of time, the shaver will not hold a charge.&amp;#34;  Since you can&#x27;t use it when plugged in, it becomes useless. Although there is a  2 year warranty, it is probably not cost effective to pay for the shipping.  A new shaver (and not another Remington) is in my future.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer seemed great when I first purchased it, and the price was perfect. After a couple uses I even bought a second one to keep in my travel bag. Within a few weeks, however, I realized this was a mistake. The batteries in both trimmers has quickly become useless, barely holding a charge for a full beard trim even if you keep it plugged in full time. This is a pathetic product and I find it disgraceful that they still sell it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. My brother in law requested the same trimmer this year for Christmas so I was happy enough with it to give it to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Can sculpt and trim pretty well around the face and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable trimmer height options give you the trim length you want&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The battery starts to go haywire after a year&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t plug and trim. In other words if the battery dies you can&#x27;t plug the thing in and continue to use it (not sure why)&lt;br /&gt;- Trimming around the neck is pretty hit or miss. It&#x27;s cut me a couple of times, but not often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the battery life and lack of ability to plug-in and trim I docked two points. But as I said, it was good enough for me to buy for my brother-in-law so it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> This trimmer did a decent job while it worked. It does not do well when trying to shave to detail, but if you&#x27;re going for a general beard trimming, then you may like it. Until it dies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with beard trimmers. Most of them are not reliable and don&#x27;t provide an even cut. This product is a monumental upgrade in that category. This &amp;#34;no-frills&amp;#34; trimmer will do exactly what it says and nothing else. The battery lasts forever and the build is very solid. The latch that holds the blade to the body and flips out broke but still works fine. I just have to be careful when cleaning the blade.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for about 3 full discharges but now it will not stay charged for more than a few uses.</li>
    <li> It worked once than quit, enough said.  Doesn&#x27;t even work when it is plugged in</li>
    <li> To echo the 100 or so 1 star reviews, after less than 1 year the product will not hold a charge. However what most reviewers forgot to say, the MB-200 comes with a 2 year replacement warranty. Contact Remington for your replacement: [...]  Pro: When it works, its just perfect. I paid $14.77 and it comes with a 2 year warranty.  Con: Will not run off of A/C power, very poor battery life</li>
    <li> I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with.  It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that.  I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model.  This one is just not  nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one.  I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use the battery would no longer hold a proper charge and it became a paper weight.  Since having purchased this product I noticed many other people had an identical experience.  Steer clear!  It&#x27;s a shame because when I first got it, it did a great job and then quickly became useless.</li>
    <li> All I need in a trimmer. Setting up to 9, fast, easy to use. It&#x27;s great. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I use this several times a week to trim facial hair. It works well (much better than hair clippers...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I had trouble with the battery. If I just plugged it in and used it, the motor would stop within a few seconds. I left it charging one day for an hour or so and have not had that problem since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you notice it slowing down pull it away from your face because it will pull hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. If i dont keepnit plugged in at all times, the battery dies. This thing does NOT hold a charge whatsoever, and seems to pull my hairs more than cutting them. Would NEVER EVER recommend this trimmer to anyone, ven my worst enemy. Gave it 1 star cuz i had to</li>
    <li> I had the older model of this razor for about 5 years. Used it weekly to keep my stubble in check and would have never replaced it but sadly it crapped out. This one does a similarly good job but it can get a little hot. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of rechargeable razors because if you forget to charge it and wake up in a hurry you have to forgo shaving. Whats worse is if you&#x27;re half way through shaving when it dies. YIKES. Otherwise, it does an awesome job.</li>
    <li> Does not have smart charging.  Battery starting to give out after only a year of use.  Avoid Remington unless they improve their charging technology or provide an easy way to replace the batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one before could not remember which one it was. I&#x27;m very thankful I found it again. This is the best one out there. When it dies I&#x27;ll get another one.:)</li>
    <li> I just wish the blades were easier to remove and reinstall.</li>
    <li> great setting are an excellent design easy to handle hope they dont change design price is right i will buy it again</li>
    <li> Husband is pleased with beard trimmer EXCEPT that if battery is not charged it is impossible to use while plugged in. Obviously it is important to remember to charge trimmer on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own at least three of these in the past.  Sometimes the cutting guard breaks, other times the battery simply dies.  I hope this one last longer.  It works very well at the moment.  I like the fact that it has so many length settings.</li>
    <li> Nice little machine for my son who likes to sport different forms of facial hair, he was pleased to get this beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it. It does a great job. The only thing is that you need to keep it fully charged to get the best shave/cut.</li>
    <li> This works quite well and it was my way around buying other trimmers that come with a dizzying array of attachments.  This has a simple adjustment wheel that changes the guard height.  My old Remington had a genius vacuum built into the base to collect all those annoying beard trimming that otherwise land all over the sink, which also worked as a foot that you could set the trimmer up vertically.  I miss that.</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd remington of this model.  the newest version works great, but i&#x27;ve been shocked at how SHARP the blades are.  when i use it without the cover it cuts my face and i even slit open my finger when trying to remove hair from the blade.  It&#x27;s needlessly sharp. not happy about this newest change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now. Its a good beard trimmer. Easy to adjust and clean. No complaints. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> We had the older model that was silver and have been looking for Remington to come out with another unit.  My husband loves this thing.  Easy and likes the adjustable settings.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not small, but it runs like forever.&lt;br /&gt;Has a great battery life and is well designed.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to operate and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every $</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great! But only while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned this trimmer for about 7 months, and used it 1-2 times each week. The plastic head stays perfectly in place, and the adjustment wheel is perfect and easy to figure out what fits. The head is removable, too, giving a nice trimmer for around the edges of the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, either the motor or the batteries died about a week ago. I&#x27;m fairly certain it was the soldered-in batteries, since the trimmer doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than about 5 seconds any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an inexpensive trimmer, but 20-25 bucks for only 7 months of use is frustrating. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and seen that it usually seems to last 1-2 years, but be aware that mine didn&#x27;t. Time to try out a different model.</li>
    <li> I had 1 of these for about 5 years. It broke and I bought a different trimmer at the department store and it was crap. I found this lovely trimmer on amazon and ordered it, and it is exactly the same as the first 1 I had. Great great great man-scaper!</li>
    <li> Seem to be up dated from my old MB-200. It works great. would recommend it to anyone with a beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for well over a year now and it still works very well. I&#x27;m extremely happy with it, and when it craps out I&#x27;ll probably buy another one.</li>
    <li> I had this trimmer before so I was pretty sure to get it again. This trimmer does its work, built very solid (not cheap plastic parts), ergonomic and easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It broke down after about a year, with minimal usage, running at a very low RPM.  The most annoying part is that it discharges significantly faster than it can charge, so even if it&#x27;s plugged in, you still have to wait like half a day before it&#x27;s usable.</li>
    <li> My old one broke after many years--this one works well--but I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  It is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Just the controls are little strangely laid out.  Probably just because I&#x27;m used to my last one.  Holds a charge well, blades are sharp, strong motor, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Works great.  Cant wait to use it again when i trim my beard.  Would recommend to anyone that has a beard.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed after taking this out of the box is how strong the motor is.&lt;br /&gt;Buzzes at a very high RPM, which is obviously ideal for clean cutting.&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of use, I finally decided to charge this razor.  It was that well charged from the factory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide offers very ideal length settings.  It&#x27;s easy to find one you will like.  Start with a tall one first and work your way to shorter until you find that perfect beard/mustache length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does \\&quot;ok\\&quot; with the guide off for clean up work.  Maybe it&#x27;s my beard type, but I still have to resort to a 2 blade and shaving cream to really tighten things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold, decent ergonomics.  Make sure you hold the length adjustment wheel firmly when taking the guide off or it will spin to a different setting, and you may not be aware of it the next time you go to trim your beard!  Always check the length setting first!  Learned this the hard way with an older electric trimmer!  Went from beard to 5 o&#x27;clock shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good razor overall.</li>
    <li> Good adjustable beard trimmer.  Holds a good charge and was going strong after 5 years.  I recently dropped it and the internal scroll wheel mechanism no longer adjusts to different heights.  Will probably be ordering another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/5/2014 - Lowering my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.  Bought the same trimmer in April 2013.  While the first trimmer was much better quality (rubber grip, more solid feel, and great battery life) the new version has none of these attributes.  After having the new trimmer for a little over one year and having used is a dozen or so times, it will no longer hold a charge.  The other reviews are dead-on.  Look elsewhere.  Remington is off my product list.</li>
    <li> Close shave, good beard trimming levels, holds a charge REALLY well (i.e. weeks).  The clipper part flips out, and on one of the days I went to clean it (with a brush that&#x27;s not all that great, and is not one of the parts on the trimmer), I applied little force by accidently, and it snapped off the contraption completely!  Apparently, it&#x27;s plastic - a bit of a design flaw, no?</li>
    <li> I really really love this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used it for quite some time, and it makes my life much easier.  But I&#x27;ve started the notice that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long...but then again...i&#x27;ve had it for over a year.</li>
    <li> For a beard, I haven&#x27;t test anything that work that good. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sound and it is very soft on the skin. The adjustable wheel doesn&#x27;t change even if you apply a bit of pressure. I found that the size 4 was perfect for me and I used it since for the last month and never had to recharge it still. Don&#x27;t understand why but it keeps working. Would recommended for anybody that like to have a well trimmed beard and have a somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> For a beginner like me it was a great choice. It does the job as I was expecting and the price was fair in my perception.</li>
    <li> This worked fine for the first year or so, then it stopped holding a charge. I opened it up and scraped off some foreign material that I found on the circuit board. That fixed it, and it&#x27;s been working ever since (~2 years, so far). Obviously, try this fix at your own risk, and be careful of electric shocks and/or fires.</li>
    <li> works well. simple adjustments, no need to change pieces for different beard lengths.&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable battery leaves much to be desired - it stops taking a charge after about 1 year, can&#x27;t be replaced as it is soldered into the circuit so you have to buy a complete new trimmer.</li>
    <li> It was a good trimmer while it lasted, but battery tied after about a year and it won&#x27;t run just by plugging in the cord. Pretty disappointed, overall.</li>
    <li> Trims well, but only a year old and it won’t hold a charge at all, and it will not run plugged in to an electrical outlet with a dead battery. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> this is probably my favorite product on the planet</li>
    <li> Simple, easy to use, multiple length settings..</li>
    <li> uneven cutting, no mater what setting as the comb is to wide, and with it removed it cuts your skin.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage. Battery died after first 90 days then again a year later. Buy a different brand or a corded version. Guards and settings feel nice but useless if it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for two years, and within a month, I had the same problems tons of other people have had with this trimmer: The battery refuses to hold a charge for very long, and it when it&#x27;s dead, plugging it in won&#x27;t help.  So for over a year, I&#x27;ve had to leave it plugged in permanently so that it&#x27;s not dead (and needing a long charge) when I go to use it.  The trimmer works great when it works, but the battery issue has made it a hassle.</li>
    <li> Similar to the other 1-star reviewers, mine won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore after only a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the battery will also not work in pass-through mode. That is, if it dies, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and resume trimming. You have to let it charge for a while.</li>
    <li> Battery life is terrible.  It&#x27;s only good for one trim if you&#x27;re lucky.  This trimmer was a terrible disappointment. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what anyone could want from a mustache and beard trimmer beyond trimming their mustache and beard. For the price, this product can&#x27;t really be beat. The charge time is longer than ideal, but if you remember to plug it in the night before, you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues. It would also be nice to have a battery indicator, but again, if you remember to charge sufficiently, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Use and maintenance are easy, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t come with too many parts (there&#x27;s the unit, charging plug, and a detachable guard with seven settings).</li>
    <li> it has a very long lasting cutter. long battery life too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions about this please don&#x27;t be afraid to ask me. I&#x27;d be more than happy to answer any and all of them.</li>
    <li> This is a good beard trimmer, so-so for mustache only because the guard is so large and the interval between the heights is not really fine enough for my tastes. I do use this several times a week with good results. It holds a charge for weeks and is easy to clean. This is not great for details and you will require at least one other detail trimmer for a quality job. 5 Mar 15 I am back to downgrade this because the battery is now so poor that you can&#x27;t get through even a brief trim without having to stop to recharge. This will not run corded when the battery is drained. 17 Mar 15, Remington customer service followed up with me after my review update. With few questions asked, they shipped me a complete new unit. I don&#x27;t know if this a newer model with an improved battery, but I am very impressed with their customer service.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best beard trimmer I have come across, minus the battery issues I had with it.  I have purchased 4 or 5 trimmers in the last year or so and this is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Remington MB-200 a while back and after 18 months of use, the battery would not hold a charge anymore, so I was forced to buy a new one.  I liked the trimmer so much I bought the same one again, even though the battery failed after just 18 months.  The adjustable guard goes from 1-9 and gives you the ability to customize your beard however you like.  I purchased the Braun Cruzer 5 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer and the Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer, and neither come close to the Remington MB-200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Adjustable guard works great, if you want to &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; your beard this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Battery gave out after 18 months, If you are looking for a trimmer to get close to your face, this is not the one.  It is more for trimming and shaping</li>
    <li> This trimmer cuts okay. I&#x27;m happy with the results I get. However, the battery in it really sucks. It doesn&#x27;t last long at all, which means you basically have to keep it plugged in all of the time you are not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it every day you probably won&#x27;t notice a problem, but if you trim only once every week or two like I do, you&#x27;ll notice problems. When you wait more than a week without charging it, the charge vanishes mid-shave. Every stroke, the pitch of the buzzing decreases, and it becomes impossible to finish a whole shave. When this happens, sometimes it grabs and pulls hairs instead of cutting them. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the battery would be manageable if the trimmer worked while plugged in. However, plugging it in doesn&#x27;t alleviate the battery issue. You would hope that while plugged it, the trimmer would draw its power straight from the wall and deliver a strong cut, but it doesn&#x27;t -- it keeps drawing from the battery, so you actually have to wait until the trimmer is fully charged again before it will deliver a strong cut. This can be a problem when you&#x27;ve shaved half of your face and then the trimmer dies, and you have to go to work soon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you trim every day, you probably won&#x27;t have any issues with this trimmer because you&#x27;ll keep it charged. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Get a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t rely on a battery for its performance instead.</li>
    <li> I had this for about 4 months and it worked great.  Up to that point the only complaint was the holding of a charge.  If I didn&#x27;t put it on the charger, I would get about 3 uses (once a week) before it was too weak to use.  I fell of the sink one time and the adjustable guard came off it&#x27;s guides.  I tried multiple times to get it back on the guides but no success.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;--Does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Can&#x27;t use while plugged in&lt;br /&gt;--Battery life is terrible. Became totally useless in 2015 after purchasing in 2009&lt;br /&gt;--Charge time is terrible</li>
    <li> Have now had this trimmer for over 4 months and still holds its charge, easy to clean, light, and durable. Just a great product. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re in the market for a trimmer</li>
    <li> This a pretty good value trimmer.  The sliding length adjustment is the most convenient feature for me.  The edge is longer than many other trimmers.  I compare this to an andis trimmer with detachable clips.  I find this Remington doesn&#x27;t have as much power or cut as efficiently per swipe.  I use it for getting a consistent length across my face or multiple lengths with the quick adjust.  I went back to the andis or a straight razor for lining up and quick shaves.</li>
    <li> Had this trimmer for just shy under two years. It&#x27;s charge is so sad now after 24 hours...it might last a few seconds.</li>
    <li> One of my family members had put this on his Christmas list, and I don&#x27;t think he believed anyone was going to get it for him. When he opened it up, he LOVED it. Wonderful design and perfect for his needs.</li>
    <li> Every time we need to use the blade in length 1 or 2 which doesn&#x27;t have much difference.&lt;br /&gt;with others lengths we cant even trim.</li>
    <li> Did not realise after watching the YouTube review that it was not like many other electrical items you can get these days i.e. OK to use in 110v &amp; 240 volt countries, this is only good for 110V countries. Also takes a while to get the desired affect, not as crisp as the YouTube video suggests. I will be looking for a more up market item for my needs as its too time consuming to get desired affect.</li>
    <li> Worked well enough, but the battery started to drain very rapidly within about 20 months of perhaps weekly usage. Nearly unusable at 26 months.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap, don&#x27;t waste your money. This item stopped holding a charge/disipating its charge within minutes of using it once a week or so for 8 months. It now won&#x27;t even show the charge light when plugged in. Complete waste. Gave it two stars work working great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Having bought this early in 2012, the battery already won&#x27;t hold a charge.  This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem except the designer elected not to include circuitry that would allow it to run straight off mains power or charge the battery while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it&#x27;s either running on the battery, or charging.  So when the battery is dead (and die it will, as another reviewer notes, these seem to use obsolete NiCad cells) it&#x27;s useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other problems:&lt;br /&gt;-Flip-open mechanism to clean the blade assembly is very fragile&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustment wheel (on mine at least) was a pain to turn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You almost expect some issues with a relatively cheap beard trimmer, but the battery vs. mains thing is inexcusable; it speaks to deliberately designing it to be unusable altogether in a relatively short time.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for haircuts, shaving head, trimming beards and moustache.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer...  Until the battery dies after 6 months.  I pulled the unit apart to try and change out the bad cells and found two AA size 600 mh nicads.  This is probably everyones issue with the battery life.  Changing out the cell to better cells was not possible.  The charging circuit is not strong enough to accept better cells.  I did replace them, but the shaver is now weak and does not perform as it did before.  I have trashed it and am looking for something better.  Complete waste of money.  My last one lasted over 6 years.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap product but I like it...it typically lasts me 4-5 months and I need to buy another one which is fine. I used to have a fancy one but never even liked it to be honest.</li>
    <li> Battery life could be better</li>
    <li> What can I say? Works as advertised for me.</li>
    <li> Short battery life, won&#x27;t run while plugged in. What sense does that make?</li>
    <li> This trimmer is just what you need. It&#x27;s is rechargeable and with retractable head. You don&#x27;t have to worry about losing your attachments to keep your beard looking great.</li>
    <li> i had one of these for 5 plus years it died so i found this again thank god this trimmer is great just dial your number and trim you cant mess it up all even cleaning is a snap flip up the cutters and clean i use can air works great the only thing i miss my older one had was the flip up side burn trimmer no problem though charge holds great would buy again always remington</li>
    <li> When this thing is working, it does a nice job. I had one and it lasted 2 years before it died so i got another one.  It lasted 4.5 months, trimming every 4-5 days.  After the 4th recharge, it would not hold a charge.  A complete waste of money</li>
    <li> Works as described. Battery has a lifespan of about 20 months. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several personal groomers made by Remington including this model.  They work well enough but the rechargeable battery just does not last very long.  After two years or so you have to throw away an otherwise perfectly good groomer.  I would prefer if they just made them to operate with AA or AAA disposable batteries.  By comparison I have Norelco and Panasonic products that I have been using for years with diminished battery capacity but they will still hold a charge for several cycles.</li>
    <li> WONT HOLD A CHARGE HAD ONE BEFORE FOR TEN YEARS THIS ONE LESS THAN A YEAR JUNK&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS MODEL</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a year now and it will not even hold a charge for 5 minutes, it did not hold very long even when it was new. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
    <li> MB-200 just wont hold a charge. Dumpster destination.</li>
    <li> The product was great when I first got it. It worked really well. Didn&#x27;t have any problem cutting my relatively thick facial hair, but after some time, the small connector that holds the blades on broke. I couldn&#x27;t find any replacements, rendering the whole unit useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive trimmers but have come back to this one. It&#x27;s reliable and has good length settings. The battery doesnt hold much of a charge after a while, but I just keep it plugged in.</li>
    <li> Needs more balls for this I&#x27;m grey beard ..,</li>
    <li> I does not hold a charge. Have to charge it just before using it. Done a better job of trimming with my electric razor. You don&#x27;t want one...</li>
    <li> Does the trick.  It won&#x27;t work when charged, which normally isn&#x27;t an issue, but when it dies it dies VERY quickly.  The charge lasts about two weeks, so not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say about this product.  It works.  It has a wide range of beard height adjustments.  I&#x27;ve kept it on the same level most of the time, and it hasn&#x27;t slipped up or down.  I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year, and it still performs like new.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, trim levels could be a little closer</li>
    <li> My second one. With routine use, the second one lasted as long as the first. About a year. The blades go dull and the battery stops holding a charge.</li>
    <li> bought one... battery burned out in 3 months... bought another figuring i got a lemon... battery burned out in another 3 months.. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me</li>
    <li> Very dependable. The charge will only hold for 3-4 uses but unless you&#x27;re using it every day I don&#x27;t find it inconvenient. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I find a very even trim after using it. Nothing about it disappoints.</li>
    <li> Have had this for 6 months and it will not keep a charge for a day.</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer. Get&#x27;s the job done well with adjustable settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the battery is a serious problem. I purchased mine about a year ago (Aug 7, 2011) and now I only get a few uses before it dies. And when it dies, it goes quickly without warning so you may have a half-trimmed beard. It will not run off of wall power, so once the battery dies, you&#x27;re out of luck. So I imagine if you use this frequently, you may need to replace it every year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had far better luck with my Philips Norelco shaver (Speed XL). Seems to last months on a charge even 3 years later. After this trimmer finally dies, I won&#x27;t be buy the next one from Remington.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer based on previous Remmington products that I&#x27;ve owned. I have only used it a few times and have had no issues. The setting I have it on holds and does not move when using it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It works well.  I like that I can take off the guard.  What I hate is that the batteries aren&#x27;t swappable and they don&#x27;t hold a charge.  I bought this about a year ago and the batteries are toast.  I have rechargeable AA batteries from 6 years ago that still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t order this or any other trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have removable batteries.  I wish it was just hard wired.</li>
    <li> Worked fine...for six months! Now it won&#x27;t keep a charge for more than a few seconds. Crap.</li>
    <li> Just about exactly one year after purchase, this thing no longer works for more than a few seconds.  It does not work on A/C.  It only works on a battery charge.  The battery is just about dead.  If I keep it charging, it runs for a few seconds, then dies.  If I don&#x27;t keep it charging, it does not run at all.  From now on I will NEVER buy a product that operates only on a built-in, non-replaceable rechargeable battery that cannot run on A/C.</li>
    <li> The converter does not accept 240 voltage.  That means you can&#x27;t recharge it in most parts of the world.  I bought it for a trip and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet because I can&#x27;t charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no indication on the Amazon page that the converter has a limited voltage input.</li>
    <li> Long story short, the rechargeable battery on this trimmer is very poor. You have to charge it hours before you shave for it to work for more than 2 minutes. Forget about using this wirelessly at all. If you&#x27;re fine with having this plugged in 24/7, then by all means, buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really given anything a bad review on Amazon, as things can be easily researched in terms of quality. However, I made the mistake of buying this trimmer based on the other reviews here on Amazon. What a lot of them fail to mention is that this trimmer has to be plugged in at ALL times in order for it to be able to work for more than one minute. I often wanted to hide the cords for this trimmer, as it makes the sink look messy; I just wanted to get them out of the way. So I would unplug the trimmer from the outlet and leave it until the next time I had to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, the next time I would go to shave (say, a week later), the battery would be completely depleted. I would plug it in assuming it would work while plugged in. Nope. It works for about 30 seconds, then dies out and stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution to this was keeping it plugged in at least 2 hours before I needed to shave. I wasn&#x27;t willing to do that. I shouldn&#x27;t have to plan out my shaving habits and remember to plug this thing in 2 hours before every shave.</li>
    <li> Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months. Then the battery started dying, slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods. Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all. And on top of that, the plug doesn&#x27;t supply enough power to use the razor, so it&#x27;s pretty much junk now. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I write this review on 1/15/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now purchased this trimmer twice - once on 5/23/11, and most recently on 7/24/2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on this is the big issue, as other reviewers have said. I swear, I remember having a Norelco that did the exact same thing in a similar style, and that thing lasted 3 years at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that the MB-200 has once again died on me, I will be purchasing a Norelco QT4000/42.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really isn&#x27;t a bad product for the price. It is easy to use, and will not break your bank - just don&#x27;t grow super attached to it, cause you will need a new one shortly enough...</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to the negative &amp;#34;charge problem&amp;#34; reviews. Being a retired electronics tech, I know not to leave a NiCd battery device plugged in and charging. Nope, I treated it perfectly, letting the battery run down in use before charging - never leaving it plugged in. Still, it won&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t trim well it would be a total piece of junk! Of course it won&#x27;t hold a charge, it&#x27;s still a total piece of junk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get ripped off too, buy something else.</li>
    <li> I have used it a little over 8 months now and it is still working well and I have been very happy with it.  I use it almost everyday, although not for very long, and I rarely have to charge it.  I do not have any of the poor battery issues that other reviewers are mentioning.</li>
    <li> I like this unit - I owned a similar Remington model for several years, and was happy with the job it did. Other units I have tried in the past year have left me frustrated, so I was happy to purchase another Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one of the most attractive things about the newer model was that Amazon&#x27;s product description page clearly stated that the head was washable. (In fact, this was stated more than once.) However, upon receiving the item, I find that the enclosed instructions specifically advise you not to rinse the cutter assembly under water. I know that the space under the cutter head can be cleaned with the supplied brush, but I find the process unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other minor drawback to the MB-200 is that, unlike my older model, it cannot be operated with the cord attached. The adapter cord only recharges the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall a good product, but not quite as advertised.</li>
    <li> This trimmer performed well during the first year of use: sharp blades, fast, ergonomic, and easy to clean. After a year, the battery does not hold a recharge anymore, and you cannot used the trimmer connected to the power cord. I would not recommend this trimmer just because of the battery issue.</li>
    <li> so far it works great, it&#x27;s remington i think you are going to be satisfied with this one. it doesn&#x27;t have many parts so i love it &#x27;cos they wont get lost!</li>
    <li> I broke my old razor so needed a new one fast, I had started to look too much like a lumberjack. I used the discover promo and It was delivered the same day! ordered bit past midnight Thursday (technically Friday) and it was waiting at my door by the time i got back from work. A quick charge and 5 min of grooming latter I once again looked presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is powerful enough to make shaving an ease and does not pull at hair at all. I am extremely happy with it and for the money and speed of delivery the deal can not be beat.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaver and I am glad he purchased it. The shaver works well and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I had old one almost like it that lasted for 15years for batter died. love it, better then the old one. The best on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over a year ago but only now needed to write a review. It has stopped holding a charge. When it worked it was great. Sharp, easy to use, easy to clean. It help a charge for a while in the beginning but now it wont even hold a charge for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be contacting Remington to see what they can do. I assume it is out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable trimmer is very convenient, but I guess I will have to find a different company that uses better batteries.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the features and the price.  I got what I paid for.  Battery life has been miserably short since I purchased it in July of 2011. Even after being fully charged, I am lucky if I can trim my mustache and goatee before it dies on me.  And of course, you all know how painful THAT can be!  The battery life wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue if it had some type of override, that would allow me to run it straight off the AC outlet. Guess I got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; based on all the positive reviews, but it will be hard to return as all the packaging was recycled some time ago.  When I replace it, I will be looking for a better charging system, maybe a rechargeable lithium ion battery would be better.  Or, I&#x27;ll just find a model that plugs into the outlet, tho that limits portability.  Will be somewhat leery of buying a Remington now...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 to 3 times per week, for about a month and a half without re-charging. It doesn&#x27;t pull. I love this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am now on my third Remington MB-200. I have been using this trimmer since 2006, from the days of the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old model lasted me three years, and would have lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t lose it. The new models are the one that needs to be replaced every year or so, it seems. These trimmers are built cheap and they break quite easily (the hair-door at the front that you need to lift to clean hairs from underneath mostly). If they do not break, the battery will die on you first - currently my trimmer can&#x27;t last more than three or four shavings without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I do use this trimmer for more than just facial hair: I use it to take haircuts (I am almost fully bald, so I just trim my head once in two weeks or so) as well as other parts (armpits, pubic hair) and it does do a great job, so I do use it almost on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, especially if I calculate how many trips to the barber it saves me, I can&#x27;t really complain; however, I can&#x27;t stop from thinking that perhaps for $10 more or so I could get a trimmer that does a much better job. I think this time around I&#x27;m going to try a different trimmer and see if there&#x27;s a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say get this one if you want to do &amp;#34;general&amp;#34; hair treatment. Don&#x27;t expect this piece to be too specific and get into the nooks of your face and curve the perfect beard, it is not going to happen. Use it for general &amp;#34;damage control,&amp;#34; if you get my drift.</li>
    <li> After a year of use for trimming sideburns, doesn&#x27;t keep a charge and you can not use while it is charging.</li>
    <li> Super-easy beard and mustache trimming - just set dial from 1 to 9 and go. I think I&#x27;ve had to charge it once, maybe twice in 16 months or so. If I&#x27;d known how handy this little device would be, I&#x27;d have bought one years ago. (I wish I could say the ladies have noticed the better-groomed look. (;-) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov. 2013 update: batteries dying, not user-replaceable. Sucks that the device won&#x27;t run off the power adapter; that is, with failing batteries, device useless. (:-( Looking for replacement product with hopefully better battery.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked great until the battery completely died and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  For me it lasted a little less than a year before dying.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect much from such a cheap product.  Also, one annoying feature is that if the trimmer dies while you&#x27;re using it, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and continue use.  You have to wait for it to actually charge.</li>
    <li> This is a nice trimmer, I buy the same one once every five years or so when the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I won&#x27;t cut my beard with anything else. It always stays sharp, and the blades are maintenance free, so you don&#x27;t have to oil them.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer ROCKS! It&#x27;s still running strong, and I would have rated it five stars EXCEPT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic hinged piece of the blade is broken, which is a small annoyance. Granted, I&#x27;ve dropped it once or twice, and I was able to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it with a piece of tape, but the motor and blades still work as good as when i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I&#x27;ve even given myself a haircut with it. Not the best thing you ever saw, but it worked well enough. I imagine with practice you could give yourself a decent buzzcut with this.</li>
    <li> This works great and keeps its charge for a long time.  Its sharp and trims my beard perfectly.  I would say though it seems to be a big jump between settings and 4 and 5.  5 being too long and 4 being too short.  Not the end of the world but noticeable.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son for Christmas.  He has tried many different kinds, and says this is the best one he has ever used.  I am a huge fan of Amazon and do a lot of shopping on this sight.  They have never let me down!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok, not the best but not the worst.  have never found the perfect trimmer.  is it out there?</li>
    <li> Pro: It cuts your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Extremely flimsy.  You must charge before every use.  You cannot even use it if plugged in.  It pulls on my hair when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around.  I used to get Norelco but couldn&#x27;t find the same model I had and figured a trimmer is a trimmer....</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days but this thing is great. The reason I had to buy it was because I accidentally dropped my last trimmer and it landed on its head and broke. It was time for a new one anyway. Funny thing is, when I opened the package for this trimmer, I did the exact same thing and dropped it (I&#x27;m normally not this clumsy, I swear). I was nervous to see the damage but there was none at all. This thing has a nice weight and feel, is obviously pretty durable, and the feature for the adjustable hair length is awesome. My last trimmer had separate attachments which proved to be a real pain so this was a great improvement. It takes about two or three passes to get my beard exactly how I&#x27;d like but I have yet to feel any pulls or tugs. Overall, this is a great value and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/9/2013&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after only four months of use my battery no longer holds a charge. Rather disappointing.  This product was great while it lasted but what&#x27;s the point if it&#x27;s going to give out that quickly.</li>
    <li> Tried to like it but just can&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t come with a stand, battery drains quickly, doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in so if you drain the battery you have to wait until it&#x27;s fully charged to use it. Overall I would not recommend this product. Am searching for a new trimmer now.</li>
    <li> Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for less than five seconds.  I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on, instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer.  Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made.  Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months.  Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, he loved it ! He had purchased two others, we returned them. He is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> After years of having beard and using scissors and a lesser electric razor with only 3 settings, this is the best. The longest setting is over a 1/2 inch, longer than I would want it, and the shortest setting is almost a clean shave, so you have a lot of control over the length. There are a total of 9 lengths. This makes beard trimming very quick and easy. It is still running great after a year.</li>
    <li> Pain in the neck because from the git go the battery will not stay up between uses.  If I charge it and use it immediately it works fine, but if I charge it and set it aside for a couple of days, it&#x27;s effectively dead when I get it out again.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in January as my beard was getting fairly long and I wanted it to get trimmed. I put it on the longest hair setting (9) and it starts taking off large swathes of hair. What gives, Remington? Playing around with the settings didn&#x27;t help, it just got progressively shorter. But I wanted to keep my beard, not look like I had five o&#x27;clock shadow! So disappointed in this product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Have been using it to try and see if it would get better over time, and it now won&#x27;t even charge. Less than 6 months to a DNR situation. I would warn anyone away from this product. Not only does it not work very well, it has the durability of something you&#x27;d buy at the flea market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this product only has a 60 day money back return policy. I made a mistake and tried to give it more of a chance. Big mistake! If you don&#x27;t love this thing, return it and buy another company&#x27;s brand. This one is not one you can trust.</li>
    <li> I needed a beard trimmer and opted for this model over the newer lithium-ion model based on various reviews.  First off, forget the reviews that say to get this model over the newer model because this one supposedly works better.  I combed my beard thoroughly before using this trimmer, and it still pulled on my hairs painfully a few times whenever I shaved.  It seemed to be a lot worse the longer my beard was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you use this trimmer more than twice a week or if you do a lot of trimming, you&#x27;re not going to be happy with this one.  The battery is about good enough for 2-3 longer sessions, or 10-12 quick trims, and since it&#x27;s a NiCad battery, there&#x27;s no such thing as quickly topping it off.  You have to run the battery down to zero, then charge it for more than 12 hours.  And of course, if you let it sit for a couple months without using it, it&#x27;ll be dead anyway--so you need to plan at least a day in advance of ever wanting to use it.  Since I rarely grow a beard, I suppose this will get me by, but anyone who trims their beard or mustache regularly is going to be annoyed at the battery&#x27;s inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the product listing on Amazon is inconsistent.  In one place, it says this trimmer is rinsable, and in another place, it says it is not.  As it turns out, this trimmer is absolutely not rinsable.  It also does not include a detail head, which is included with at least one of the newer models in about the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m disappointed in this trimmer.  I knew ahead of time what sacrifices I was making, but other Amazon reviews had led me to believe the performance was so much better than other models that this one was worth it.  It isn&#x27;t as awesome as other reviewers have suggested, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the tradeoffs.  I&#x27;d much rather have had the rinsable lithium-ion model with detail trimmer.</li>
    <li> For the price, this was an ok investment.  It is compact, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.  If it&#x27;s out of juice, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and run it.  You have to wait for it to charge and then run it.  In addition, the beard trimmings go everywhere.  In the end, the hassle of this device lead me to shave off my beard.  It&#x27;s easier to just shave in the shower, plus I look 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> For the price this is the best trimmer I have ever had.  It does a great job of trimming a beard and I have always found that difficult to get in a razor.  Won&#x27;t get you the closest shave but that is not what it is intended for.  Every week I can trim My beard and this product was great!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this, however the battery does not last very long. Not the end of the world considering you can plug and shave.</li>
    <li> Most beard trimmers are too bulky to trim the mustache the way I want.  This trimmer can get super close under the nose and does the trick.</li>
    <li> Works for about 1 year - then battery wont keep charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise works fine;  it&#x27;s the second Remington product I&#x27;ve owned, and they all seem to do the same thing:  battery death within 1 year</li>
    <li> I had a similar previous model for 5+ years and it finally broke.  So I bought this one thinking it was the same only new! ..Not so much.  My biggest gripe is that once the battery runs out and if your still cutting hair then you&#x27;re s*** outta luck because the trimmer will not function while plugged in.  It needs to charge up before you can use it again.  How stupid is that?!  And my previous 5+ year older model was even able to operate directly from the wall plug even if it had no charge.  So I find myself having to plug it in after every use because the battery runs out fairly quickly.  If that was not an issue I would&#x27;ve probably rated it at 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are amazing. They are extremely easy to adjust but very secure once you select your setting. In the past four years I have owned half a dozen pairs of beard trimmers and this one by far did the best job. Very even trim that I can not find on any other trimmers without having to spend too much time going over the same spot repetitively. I would love to give this item 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately these trimmers have an extremely short standby time and the charger does not give enough juice for these to run on a dead battery plugged in. Once charged and unplugged within as little as 24 hours it would not hold enough of a charge to be able to trim your beard. So unless you keep your trimmer plugged in constantly except when in use you will have this problem. I found myself never being able to trim or would start and then have to resort to hair clippers or shave completey because the battery would die. After so many times mine ended in pieces and I will never buy one again.</li>
    <li> Feels sturdy in your hand. Battery hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge still after a couple weeks. And the length guard stats where you set it, especially while actually trimming. Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had a previous Remington Beard Trimmer that lasted for a good several years before the re-chargeable battery in that one decided to stop charging one day.  I had always followed Remington&#x27;s charging instructions to the letter.  Regardless, I&#x27;d been fairly happy with its dependability so I thought I&#x27;d buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery in this latest and greatest MB-200 lasted less than 11 months before it, too, refused to accept a charge, making the trimmer useless.  Unfortunately, by design, you can&#x27;t fix it yourself;  all you can do is throw it away and start over...with a different brand, in my case.</li>
    <li> It trims well, doesn&#x27;t miss a lot of hair, and is easy to use and adjust.  Better than my old Andis trimmer that cost 3x more.</li>
    <li> Very good ! cool groomer I like it very much , I&#x27;m so happy with this now. Now I looks neat and clean .</li>
    <li> Trimmer lasted less then one and a half years because the battery no longer holds a charge.  I can charge it for 24 hours and I get a minute out of it if that.  Worked well until the battery issue.</li>
    <li> Battery has a long life. More for beards not for stubble.</li>
    <li> works great,best on the market for the price,will buy another for a backup in case they discontinue,but i dont know why they would.</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer for a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that you only have one piece that with the wheel system works for different lengths. It feels nice in your hand and it does a nice job at trimming. I have not tried lengths over 5 yet, but the lower ones work nicely. I just don&#x27;t like that when it&#x27;s charging it does not tell you if the battery is fully charged or not. I usually charge it for 10 hours, use it until it dies and then charge it again for another 10 hours. Hopefully this way it will last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product for keeping a stubble/beard look. Price is good and cons are really very few!</li>
    <li> I use it almost every day...I haven&#x27;t even had to charge it yet!I would recommend this little jewel to anyone that wants to keep their beard or mustache tidy!</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work properly.  Refurbished doesn&#x27;t stayed charged</li>
    <li> I use this to shave almost everything on my body. I am not a fan of body hair, and this product does the trick perfectly. This is my second purchase of this same product in six years.</li>
    <li> I wish it were a bit easier to trim nose and ear hairs (older guy, you see) but otherwise just right</li>
