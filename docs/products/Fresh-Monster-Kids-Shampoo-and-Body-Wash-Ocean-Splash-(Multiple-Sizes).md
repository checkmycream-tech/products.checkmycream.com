      <li>The kids really love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the product to lack for bubbles because it is non toxic but the lather and scent were fantastic!</li>
      <li>Many child products don&#x27;t lather well; this product lathered better than the Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Wash that I used to use.  </li>
      <li>Kids love it.</li>
      <li>Really enjoyed using this product with my kids.</li>
      <li>and I love that it has ingredients I trust.</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the scent - smells like a day at the beach.  </li>

      <li>I have been searching for a nice smelling shampoo/soap for my 2yo son who has eczema, and Fresh Monster was it!</li>
      <li>The smell is mild and pleasant and the product leaves them clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The idea of becoming a &amp;#34;fresh monster&amp;#34; was really appealing to my daughter.</li>
      <li>Love the natural ingredients, and the price makes it a great value.  </li>
      <li>my 2 and 4 year old boys made a beeline for it and started asking all about the monster and said they wanted to take a bath with it right away - win!  </li>
      <li>Good stuff, I like the light, natural scent, and it makes nice bubbles.</li>
      <li>Love Fresh Monster!  </li>
      <li>We also use Honest Co. shampoo as a family &amp; I love this just as much --</li>
      <li>I had been looking for an organic product for her but couldn&#x27;t find anything that I liked very much.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way; the smell is very pleasant, and best of all, it cleans my kids!  </li>
      <li>It smells great, washes away all of the grit and grime from Monsters at play, and is perfect for both thick, curly hair and fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>Now, bath time is even better with the Fresh Monster array of bath and shower products.</li>
      <li>The cherry on top is that the kids think the monster on the pack is fun - after the product arrived it was sitting on the counter and</li>
      <li>My boys love Fresh Monster soap - they like using the pump, and I like that they are not coated in harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>Especially this shampoo + body wash is a great idea...</li>
      <li>but i think that the products are tear free.</li>
      <li>They love the smell and it is the right amount of suds.  </li>
      <li>The grandchildren (ages 18 months to 12 years)  love them because they relate positively to the fun packaging, they don&#x27;t burn the eyes and leave them smelling a lot better than when they arrived (we like that too).</li>
      <li>They come out smelling fresh and clean and are excited about bath time!</li>
      <li>My son loves the packaging - a fun monster! -</li>
      <li>And my daughter loves the scent and is so excited to use this in her bath.</li>
      <li>Well worth it!</li>
      <li>I love the scents because they are fresh and fun, but not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>One pump will get their body clean &amp; 1/2</li>
      <li>We were so excited to try Fresh Monster as we have been looking for kids products that are free of chemicals and toxins.</li>
      <li>They love the fun monsters and it works really well!  </li>
      <li>LOVE and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells amazing and is very gentle on my boy&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The packaging is super fun, and kid-friendly.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>It actually smells really nice - sort of like the ocean maybe.  </li>
      <li>Fresh Monster did the trick.  </li>
      <li>you Fresh Monster for these products.</li>
      <li>And then I stumbled upon Fresh Monster.</li>
      <li>My son has very sensitive skin that breaks into rashes easily and since switching to this body wash</li>
      <li>Smells great and very few chemicals:</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great product at an affordable price point - definitely something I will keep buying and would recommend to parents!</li>
      <li>Most importantly, our youngest has eczema and the product performed very well with his sensitive skin and even better than other products that are marketed as being specifically for baby eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is very gentle on him.  </li>
      <li>We typically only use fragrance-free, but this scent is very mild and super easy on her sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the first bottle sent to me leaked during shipping and the replacemt did as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>because also my daughter is getting at that age that her hair really gets frizzy.</li>
      <li>I hoped it would work well and definitely was excited to try it because of the ingredient list.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a nanny to two girls and they are obsessed with these products. They really like the Ocean Splash and Coconut products because they smell wonderful and I like the fact that they don&#x27;t bother my kiddos&#x27; eyes. They come out smelling fresh and clean and are excited about bath time!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew and the smell is perfect for a young boy (almost teenager).  And it works! The best part is I feel good that my family is using toxin free products.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my friend as a baby gift. Her little boy was born 14 weeks premie. His skin and lungs are so sensitive and this product was the perfect thing for him. She is loving it! As a bonus, it is so darling to look at! Thanks for making a great product!</li>
    <li> Finally!! A truly safe product for my kids that I can afford! I have 2 little girls with severe &#x27;bed head&#x27; issues each morning and this detangler worked perfectly, with an awesome scent I never had before with a kids or baby hair product. LOVE and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  We have been looking for something like this for a while and are happy with our purchase.  Nice it has a pump for dispensing for our daughter to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the kiddos.  They love the smell and it is the right amount of suds.  It got into my son&#x27;s eye and he wiped it out &amp; it didn&#x27;t seem to bother him.</li>

    <li> This is good stuff!  A little goes a long way; the smell is very pleasant, and best of all, it cleans my kids!  A+ product.</li>
    <li> My son loves the packaging - a fun monster! - and I love that it has ingredients I trust. A win for both of us!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and is very gentle on my boy&#x27;s sensitive skin. We also use Honest Co. shampoo as a family &amp; I love this just as much -- I love the scent more though for a boy.</li>
    <li> We have 8 grandchildren. They all like to come to Grandma&#x27;s house for dinner, stories and a bath. Now, bath time is even better with the Fresh Monster array of bath and shower products. We love them because they are &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and work beautifully. The grandchildren (ages 18 months to 12 years)  love them because they relate positively to the fun packaging, they don&#x27;t burn the eyes and leave them smelling a lot better than when they arrived (we like that too). Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a great value for a toxin free shampoo/ body wash.  I tried it on all three of my boys and they loved it - no tears, all laughs. Most importantly, our youngest has eczema and the product performed very well with his sensitive skin and even better than other products that are marketed as being specifically for baby eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to others to try for their kids.</li>
    <li> Love Fresh Monster!  Our toddler and sensitive skin (eczema) and this is very gentle on him.  Great product, great company!</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed using this product with my kids. I hoped it would work well and definitely was excited to try it because of the ingredient list. I was very impressed with how much one pump of the soap lathered up. Only used 2 pumps when washing my 6 month old.</li>
    <li> I have a 3 year old &amp; 5 year old. This stuff is great! One pump will get their body clean &amp; 1/2 a pump is good for their hair. I love that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I like the light, natural scent, and it makes nice bubbles.</li>
    <li> Not all that. It does the job. Not really a good smell and it is drying to my daughters curly hair.</li>
    <li> We were so excited to try Fresh Monster as we have been looking for kids products that are free of chemicals and toxins. Our kids 4 and 2 LOVE the monster on the bottle and using the pump themselves to wash in the shower. The smell is mild and pleasant and the product leaves them clean and moisturized. We will definitely be trying some of the other products!!</li>
    <li> Love this line of products. Son loves it too!</li>
    <li> The ocean scent is amazing. I have been searching for cheaper alternatives to California Baby and this is it.  Excellent EWG rating and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of shampoo and body wash in one. Great value.</li>
    <li> Great product. Kids like it</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Smell chemicals for some reason</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell and it leaves my hands feeling very dry. Additionally, the first bottle sent to me leaked during shipping and the replacemt did as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! And I love it! My kids don&#x27;t like taking baths as it is and trying to find a natural soap that still suds easily is REALLY hard. This one does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo / kids body wash! The kids loved the smell and the monsters on the bottle. Have ordered the conditioner now that we found this one.</li>
    <li> Kids love it. Smells great and very few chemicals:</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Used this product while visiting my sister and definitely plan to buy this for my son at home.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product for my 2 year old daughter. I used Mustela for her when she was little but it was increasingly feeling like not good value for my money. I had been looking for an organic product for her but couldn&#x27;t find anything that I liked very much. And then I stumbled upon Fresh Monster. I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PRODUCTS. Especially this shampoo + body wash is a great idea... because also my daughter is getting at that age that her hair really gets frizzy. Yea, call me crazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say on the pack but i think that the products are tear free. My daughter enjoys her bath time with these products. Plus the products smells great. And hey I also tried the ocean splash line. It is just as good. We often go back and forth between both the products. The detangler is next on my list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Fresh Monster for these products.</li>
    <li> In looking for a natural shampoo/soap for my 16 month daughter, I came across this item and gave it a try.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to care at all about what soap I&#x27;m using (though she does NOT care for me pouring water on her head!), but I do - I want something that doesn&#x27;t have any bad stuff and smells good, and ideally without costing a fortune like some other similar products.  Fresh Monster did the trick.  It actually smells really nice - sort of like the ocean maybe.  And best of all... my daughter keeps (happily) pointing to the monster on the label.</li>
    <li> My boys love Fresh Monster soap - they like using the pump, and I like that they are not coated in harmful chemicals. They also don&#x27;t cry when the soap gets in their eyes.</li>
    <li> We have a little trouble motivating at bath time. The idea of becoming a &amp;#34;fresh monster&amp;#34; was really appealing to my daughter. I was expecting the product to lack for bubbles because it is non toxic but the lather and scent were fantastic! I&#x27;m going to try the 2 in 1 next as this left my daughters hair a little dry but certainly squeaky clean. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been searching for a nice smelling shampoo/soap for my 2yo son who has eczema, and Fresh Monster was it! Delicate on my son&#x27;s skin and smells like the spa. I like using it for myself!!! (Shhh, don&#x27;t tell). It also lathers really well with only a small amount. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We like the fresh, sweet scent, which is an improvement over dirty boy smell! Rinses out great.</li>
