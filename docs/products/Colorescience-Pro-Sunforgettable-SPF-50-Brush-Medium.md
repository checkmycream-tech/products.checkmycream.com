      <li>a scuba  diving error and the waterproofing and sun protection are better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to apply sunscreen throughout the day especially if you are wearing makeup.</li>

      <li>The brush also can &amp;#34;dump&amp;#34; the powder if you don&#x27;t consistently hold it at the same angle.  </li>
      <li>I finally bought my first powder and now my 8 year old and 14 year old are hooked!</li>
      <li>I have moderate skin damage even though I always used high SPF sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone what wants skin protection with limited time.</li>
      <li>Much heavier and less translucent than I was expecting.</li>

<li> Pretty disappointing for the money.</li>
<li> I have some tiny broken blood vessels in the crease of my nostrils, and this powder does not hide them at all.  </li>
<li> But, it does require quite a lot of brush strokes to get the product on and see a powdered look, and it caused me to break out in small pimples.  </li>
<li> So no more stinging eyes.  </li>
<li> that I use everyday, but I&#x27;m disappointed the coverage is nothing like the other powder or liquid foundations</li>
<li> I am addicted!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like how it makes my face look powdery.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s much easier than using a lotion. However, I&#x27;ve recently read that it is not safe to inhale the zinc and titanium particles. It&#x27;s increases chances of lung cancer so try not to inhale the cloud of powder that inevitably forms around your head.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and effective. I use it particularly on the part in my hair.</li>
    <li> Best thing about this product is it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my eyes, not like the Peter Thomas Roth brand;  But, it does require quite a lot of brush strokes to get the product on and see a powdered look, and it caused me to break out in small pimples.  I think it&#x27;s clogging my pores.  It&#x27;s a convenient sunscreen, but I&#x27;ll only use it when I need a touch up during the day and am out in the sun a lot.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated.  Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Having skin cancer on my face a couple years ago I really needed some protection all the time from the sun. This product is awesome. It really works well. Just brush it on and forget about it. No oily feeling on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I read many reviews of people who loved it too. I finally bought my first powder and now my 8 year old and 14 year old are hooked! Reapplying is a breeze! And it just doesn&#x27;t look like we have anything on!</li>
    <li> Much heavier and less translucent than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great way to apply sunscreen throughout the day especially if you are wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! This is the first product that literally protects my skin. I have moderate skin damage even though I always used high SPF sunscreen. With this product, I do not feel the burning sensation on my skin. This is a product I can not live without!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed with this product.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the price, but it&#x27;s working.  A few months in Santa Fe working outside and I haven&#x27;t suffered a burn.  It&#x27;s been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.  I leave a container in the car and poof it on my face, neck and chest when I head out.  It seems to have great staying power.  I would hope for a larger size for the price, but for the convenience and that it&#x27;s working for me, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the great reviews, but I don&#x27;t agree with them.  I have some tiny broken blood vessels in the crease of my nostrils, and this powder does not hide them at all.  It looks like it sits on top of my skin.  It will provide another layer of sun protection (to the liquid sunscreen or CeraVe) that I use everyday, but I&#x27;m disappointed the coverage is nothing like the other powder or liquid foundations I use during the work week. It will be for weekend activities where I&#x27;m not as concerned about how good I look!  The brush also can &amp;#34;dump&amp;#34; the powder if you don&#x27;t consistently hold it at the same angle.  Pretty disappointing for the money.</li>
    <li> Love this! Very easy to apply to my toddler and myself. Really works well, haven&#x27;t been sunburned. Perfect size to keep in my purse. Best idea ever.</li>
    <li> Still got red on nose and cheeks, even after applying every hour.  Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but for the price, I expected better results.</li>
    <li> One of my games or items products.  I&amp;#34;mean a scuba  diving error and the waterproofing and sun protection are better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using Colorscience Sunforgettable SPF 50 for about a year and powder my face as the last part of my morning routine.  I have yet to get a tan mark or sunburn whether inside or outside even in the Galapagos at equatorial sun and heat--did wear a hat also!  The powder is not visible and doesn&#x27;t cake. I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s so convenient! I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup when applying or reapplying. I live in sun SoCal and having this handy saves my skin from premature aging. I just apply it to my face, chest, exposed arms, and tattoos right before my runs and don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating it off. I recommend this for anyone what wants skin protection with limited time.</li>
    <li> love the weightless feelling of powder,..and that it can be reapplied,..unlike lotion,..once your make-up is on,  applicator works well,..I am addicted!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this product.  It actually stays put when you sweat.  So no more stinging eyes.  Ease to apply.  Even my husband will use it.</li>
