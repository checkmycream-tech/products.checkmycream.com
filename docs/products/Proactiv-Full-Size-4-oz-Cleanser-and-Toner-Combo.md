      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The Toner is a great buy.</li>
      <li>The bottles arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>but ProActiv is not as good as it used to be.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and excellent results!!</li>
      <li>I love proactiv products!</li>
      <li>so I knew I liked the product.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this product!</li>
      <li>For the most part it does keep my breakouts to a minimum</li>
      <li>I do feel it works and would and do have to order some more.</li>
      <li>But the toner when applied, gives a moist and healthy skin</li>
      <li>well works better than the stuff in the stores.</li>
      <li>but if u get hormonal breakouts like me then this will work ok for everything</li>
      <li>It works love it, would keep using it.</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to use it again</li>
      <li>So I was pleased to find an alternative supplier for the products I want in the quantities I use.  </li>
      <li>Not much else to say that others have not said a million times, it works great!</li>
      <li>I have been using ProActiv since 2006 and the original formula has been my choice I have noticed over the years since they have come out with the micro crystal and ProActiv plus formulas the original formula is not as effective.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, honest product.</li>
      <li>This works great not to harsh good for sensitive skin like mine</li>
      <li>I received this product quickly.  </li>

      <li>Shipping was fast going to order again!</li>
      <li>Was unsure at first if this would work for a woman in her 50&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Proactiv was okay, but you can buy neutrogena just the same for cheaper and it has benzoyl peroxide in it as well.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to pretty much anyone with acne or someone who is looking to go into the modeling industry as well.</li>
      <li>I did not like the Proactiv Cleanser much.</li>
      <li>They are not the miracle products the company says they are, but they do work better than other products he has tried.  </li>
      <li>then I think I&#x27;d rather live with my pores!  </li>
      <li>This was the older proactiv, not the new product.  </li>
      <li>Have started using the Green Tea Moisturizer, which I really love.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I dont like is when you first start using it it will make you break out.</li>
      <li>but it does clear my acne spots like it used to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen great results, but it&#x27;s actually painful to use the cleanser to the point where I try to avoid using it.</li>
      <li>I have tried the other proactive products, but I find those three to be the ones I really need.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product quickly.  Not much else to say that others have not said a million times, it works great!</li>
    <li> I buy Proactiv products for my son.  They are not the miracle products the company says they are, but they do work better than other products he has tried.  We will continue to buy Proactiv from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Was unsure at first if this would work for a woman in her 50&#x27;s.  Works wonderfully.  My complexion now looks the way it should.  Well worth the $$ investment.  Have started using the Green Tea Moisturizer, which I really love.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for 2 years and loves it. It cleared the problems she was having on her face and continues to help her maintain a beautiful complexion.</li>
    <li> Ive always been a fan of proactive. It works for some others it does not. The only thing that I dont like is when you first start using it it will make you break out.</li>
    <li> This was the older proactiv, not the new product.  Proactiv was okay, but you can buy neutrogena just the same for cheaper and it has benzoyl peroxide in it as well.</li>
    <li> Yes, once again, I jumped on the proactive bandwagon.  I do feel it works and would and do have to order some more.</li>
    <li> I have had breakouts pretty much since i can remember and this is the only product I&#x27;ve used that has effectively controlled it. kudos</li>
    <li> Great as always! The bottles arrived on time and in good condition. I love proactiv products! Ive been using it for over 7 years now</li>
    <li> ...so I knew I liked the product.  Dealing with Proactiv, however, has gotten to be a harder challenge.  They divide up your payments (whether you&#x27;ve asked them to or not) in order to hide the actual cost, and their website is not particularly user-friendly.  I tend to run out of the toner long before the face wash, but you pay a premium for ordering a la carte.  So I was pleased to find an alternative supplier for the products I want in the quantities I use.  Fast delivery, honest product.</li>
    <li> I always use this product it seems to work on my type of skin. It doesn&#x27;t give me any rashes on my face</li>
    <li> With continuous use, Proactiv works great!</li>
    <li> It works love it, would keep using it. Every one else should to. Even if you have a little skin prob</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast going to order again!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! Quick delivery and excellent results!!</li>
    <li> This works great not to harsh good for sensitive skin like mine but if u get hormonal breakouts like me then this will work ok for everything but those o well works better than the stuff in the stores.</li>
    <li> The price for the set is great and it might just be me but ProActiv is not as good as it used to be. I have been using ProActiv since 2006 and the original formula has been my choice I have noticed over the years since they have come out with the micro crystal and ProActiv plus formulas the original formula is not as effective. I refuse to pay for the ProActiv Plus line. For the most part it does keep my breakouts to a minimum but it does clear my acne spots like it used to.</li>
    <li> I use the cleanser, toner, and mask, and those three Proactive products keep my skin looking great. I have tried the other proactive products, but I find those three to be the ones I really need.</li>
    <li> The Toner is a great buy. I did not like the Proactiv Cleanser much. The cleanser did not suit my skin. But the toner when applied, gives a moist and healthy skin</li>
    <li> Great product. been using it for years. Does wonders for my skin and confidence. I would recommend to pretty much anyone with acne or someone who is looking to go into the modeling industry as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, and really like it.  I am glad I decided to use it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now (The facial cleanser once a week and the toner once a day) and i must admit that I see an improvement.  However, the cleanser stings so badly when I use it (and it smells awful) that it makes me wish it didn&#x27;t work as well as it does.  I&#x27;ve seen great results, but it&#x27;s actually painful to use the cleanser to the point where I try to avoid using it. (Hence my using it only once a week.)  The toner I like, but I&#x27;m unsure if just it will be enough to help me.  I&#x27;m going to stop using the cleanser and see if I can get the same results with just the toner because if I&#x27;m reliant upon the cleanser for these results then I think I&#x27;d rather live with my pores!  (Three stars because I figured that was the average for the two items; since I like the toner and hate the cleanser.)</li>
