    <li> Doesn&#x27;t decrease hand pain!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and it works very well on sore and painful muscles.  Other products are too warm/hot, but Miracle Rub is not.  The smell dissipates and does not linger for long, but the pain-reducing effect does.  By using Miracle Rub, I can cut back or eliminate the use of ibuprofen.  This product was packaged well and arrived quickly.  I will continue to buy and use Miracle Rub.</li>
    <li> I dearly love the effects of the Miracle Rub.  I have used it for quite sometime and it gets rid of the aches and pains and also of leg cramps.  Use it all the time.  Thank you so much for carrying it in your inventory.  Thanks lghj</li>

    <li> Though not the same size as i had wanted, you sent me two smaller sizes, after i gave you a go ahead; plus a bonus feet healing tube. It is great.</li>
    <li> Works well on my knee pain. Pleasant aroma</li>
    <li> I found this cream by accident at Ross.  It was just by chance that this cream was available.  After searching around I finally decided it must be ordered.  Amazon does have the lowest price.  I will say that it does have a pretty fierce sting when applied but that is usually when it helps the most.  I love it so much that I bought 5 tubes!!!</li>
