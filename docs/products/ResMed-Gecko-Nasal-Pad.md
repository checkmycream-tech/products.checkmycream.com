### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful to have the pressure releived from my nose when wearing my bi-PAP!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>this was the best one I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>This is an excellent silicone pad.</li>
      <li>I have been using these for a year now (each lasts about 1 1/2 months before greatly discoloring).  </li>
      <li>Worksing great and I like the</li>
      <li>$5 for 12 pair, which will keep me stocked for a good 6 months.</li>
      <li>Provided a secure seal with great comfort.</li>
      <li>Great product that arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>Works better than</li>
      <li>I have experienced some leakage, but you really need something to stop the nose bridge irritation of those masks.</li>
      <li>The ResMed Gel Pad makes sleeping with the CPAP mask much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>We continue to look for ways that make the use of the machine a more positive experience.</li>
      <li>This pad helps to seal the air flow on a full mask.  </li>
      <li>A good product with little maintenence.</li>
      <li>have Large size so it covers much</li>
      <li>It really helps when your mask leaves a mark on your nose and makes a sore spot.</li>
      <li>It works very well and fo a fraction of he cost.  </li>
      <li>This pad really makes a difference when using a C Pap unit.</li>
      <li>The fit aligns well to ResMed gel masks, and I find they give me an extra cushion.</li>
      <li>For a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>It provides the necessary cushioning on the bridge of the nose, but the uniform thickness results in significant leakage at the edges of my Mirage nasal mask where the pad goes under the mask.  </li>
      <li>BUT what do I do when red , bright red splotches are left turning into BLI:</li>
      <li>And to my surprise, because the band aid is thinner, the mask itself fits better and \\&quot;burps\\&quot; and leaks less.</li>
      <li>So thanks for making one smaller than the large one I had been using</li>
      <li>I used many other brands and so far this is the only one that really worked and stopped by nose bruises.</li>
      <li>This item leaves too thick of a gap so air seeps out, cannot get a good enough seal</li>
      <li>This was a huge waste of money.  </li>
      <li>It raises the mask up off the bridge of the nose (and sides of nose), directly causing leaks&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>I have taken to putting some night cream on the bridge of my nose and then applying a sport bandage (the night cream prevents the bandage from sticking too much &amp; makes removal in the morning very simple &amp; painless).  </li>
      <li>I purchased this nose pad for my wife as she is a new CPAP user and I am trying to make her early use of the machine less stressful than my early days with a CPAP.</li>
      <li>In my humble opinion, this item does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

<li> Thank you for a product that really helps my poor nose!</li>
<li> However, I felt compelled to write a short review of this useless and extremely over-priced item.  </li>
<li> used the small size pad, which was initially a bit difficult to keep in place before putting the cpap mask on, but once I got the hang of it, no problem there.</li>
<li> This gel thing would not say in place, and was so thick.  </li>
<li> Too bad I paid 25 bucks for this tiny piece of plastic.</li>
<li> Tired of repositioning the pad, I&#x27;ve switched instead to putting a common band aid on my nose.</li>
<li> Not happy with the product, no instructions for sizing or how to use,  Did not work well with my mask.  </li>
<li> The problem I have had with this relatively expensive nasal pad is that it is too thick at the ends/edges.</li>
<li> Difficult to get get it to stay in place while putting on the mask.  </li>
<li> The Gecko nasal pad immediately relieved the discoloration, bruising, cutting, and bleeding on the bridge of my nose.</li>
<li> It does not stick and is very very difficult to position.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>

    <li> This was a huge waste of money.  This gel thing would not say in place, and was so thick.  I ended up getting pliable ear plugs, forming an inverted V of one an putting it on the bridge of the mask.  It works very well and fo a fraction of he cost.  $5 for 12 pair, which will keep me stocked for a good 6 months.</li>
    <li> The gel pad works to keep the red marks from my face, but it seemed to cause extra leaking from the cpap mask that I wear at night.</li>
    <li> This pad helps to seal the air flow on a full mask.  It softens the nose area of the mask.</li>
    <li> Great product that arrived right on time. This pad really makes a difference when using a C Pap unit. I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product, no instructions for sizing or how to use,  Did not work well with my mask.  Overpriced!!!</li>
    <li> This item leaves too thick of a gap so air seeps out, cannot get a good enough seal it see if it helps with nose discomfort.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nose pad for my wife as she is a new CPAP user and I am trying to make her early use of the machine less stressful than my early days with a CPAP. There is nothing wrong with pad, it just wasn&#x27;t comfortable for her. We continue to look for ways that make the use of the machine a more positive experience.</li>
    <li> Works better than the larger one is what I&#x27;ve determined after one night of using it. So thanks for making one smaller than the large one I had been using</li>
    <li> Wonderful to have the pressure releived from my nose when wearing my bi-PAP!</li>
    <li> Would buy again. It really helps when your mask leaves a mark on your nose and makes a sore spot.</li>
    <li> Worksing great and I like the</li>
    <li> I have never before written a review of a product ordered through Amazon.  However, I felt compelled to write a short review of this useless and extremely over-priced item.  It is impossible to use, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$$$.!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It kept me from getting a red sore on the bridge of my nose like I had before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It helps the bridge on my nose, just what i needed, but i can see it must be replaced after a while.</li>
    <li> I have experienced some leakage, but you really need something to stop the nose bridge irritation of those masks. I have taken to putting some night cream on the bridge of my nose and then applying a sport bandage (the night cream prevents the bandage from sticking too much &amp; makes removal in the morning very simple &amp; painless).  The problem I have had with this relatively expensive nasal pad is that it is too thick at the ends/edges. It provides the necessary cushioning on the bridge of the nose, but the uniform thickness results in significant leakage at the edges of my Mirage nasal mask where the pad goes under the mask.  Too bad I paid 25 bucks for this tiny piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent silicone pad. I&#x27;m usaing an apnea machine now three years &amp; have MUCH trouble with my facical skin reacting in rashes, red spots, then BIG READ SPOTS then BLISTERS.  So this gel pack eliminated ALL of that for about 8 or 9 days now the red spots have started &amp; additional ones I didn&#x27;t have before , along the side of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Am going CRAZY as I love this one...have Large size so it covers much BUT what do I do when red , bright red splotches are left turning into BLI:STERS ??? I cannot continue with this . Does anyone know of another mask that does NOT need a shield?&lt;br /&gt;S.O.S.  HELP&lt;br /&gt;But this was the best one I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
    <li> Thank you for a product that really helps my poor nose! I will give it five stars later if it holds up. For a reasonable amount of time. Packaging recommends buying one a month. They are a bit pricey for what it is and I hope it lasts 2 momths.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Before discovering these, I would contantly get nose sore with my CPAP nasal coushion.  I have been using these for a year now (each lasts about 1 1/2 months before greatly discoloring).  I wash them in Johnsons Baby Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I used many other brands and so far this is the only one that really worked and stopped by nose bruises.</li>
    <li> The ResMed Gel Pad makes sleeping with the CPAP mask much more comfortable.  The fit aligns well to ResMed gel masks, and I find they give me an extra cushion.</li>
    <li> Provided a secure seal with great comfort. Took away facial marking as advertised. Increased air flow without adjustment. A good product with little maintenence.</li>
    <li> The size i wanted was small, i got large (male), i am a woman.  Regardless on that mistake, the product did reduce the soreness.  However then contributed to a leak in the mask.  Difficult to get get it to stay in place while putting on the mask.  I&#x27;ll try gel bandades.</li>
    <li> In my humble opinion, this item does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;1. It raises the mask up off the bridge of the nose (and sides of nose), directly causing leaks&lt;br /&gt;2. It concentrates all of the force of the mask-face interface on the bridge of the nose, increasing discomfort in that area by increasing the pressure there.&lt;br /&gt;3. It does not stick and is very very difficult to position.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is ludicrously over priced.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and put a double layer of Micropore tape over the bridge of the nose to prevent skin erosion.</li>
    <li> Help my nose not to get red with small veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend !</li>
    <li> The Gecko nasal pad immediately relieved the discoloration, bruising, cutting, and bleeding on the bridge of my nose. Just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;I used the small size pad, which was initially a bit difficult to keep in place before putting the cpap mask on, but once I got the hang of it, no problem there. Once on, the mask itself keeps the pad in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum, 2/18/13: The pad sometimes shifts during the night so that it pokes an eye. It&#x27;s then necessary to reposition it, which usually involves lifting the mask to remove pressure on the pad to allow it to be moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 10/10/13: Tired of repositioning the pad, I&#x27;ve switched instead to putting a common band aid on my nose. It too prevents the injuries to my nose. The band aid of course adheres and doesn&#x27;t shift. And to my surprise, because the band aid is thinner, the mask itself fits better and \\&quot;burps\\&quot; and leaks less. Dropping my rating of the pad to 3 stars.</li>
