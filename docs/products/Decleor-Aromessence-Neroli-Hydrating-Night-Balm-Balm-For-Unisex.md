<li> I really like andit is extremely hard to find.</li>
<li> Its a very very thick natural balm that absorbs overnight and leaves ur skin soft and supple.</li>

<li> so I felt I have wasted my money.</li>
<li> So you still need a face cream before you put this on... which seems redundant, and break-out prone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just not in my usual night time beauty regimen of cleanse, tone and moisturize.</li>
<li> This night balm is definitely not my favorite.</li>
<li> Although it is expensive, one jar typically lasts almost a year.</li>
<li> I always thought that oily skin should not use oil, but I was wrong.  </li>
<li> Fake product?</li>
<li> You will not be sorry!</li>
<li> I have been using Decleor products for years but hate paying the spa price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently started using Decleor products: love the essential oil, face cream, and face wash. This night balm is definitely not my favorite. It&#x27;s just not in my usual night time beauty regimen of cleanse, tone and moisturize. Because as a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t hydrate the skin, just puts a oily and fragrant layer on top. So you still need a face cream before you put this on... which seems redundant, and break-out prone. Anyone else interested in Decleor products - stick with their basics of face wash, toner, and face cream. the essential oils and essential night balms are extras.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique product - no other skincare line has anything like it. I&#x27;ve used it for 15 years - I put it on chapped lips, under my eyes at night, on burns - anywhere my skin is compromised and sore. I put it on my babies&#x27; chapped skin when they were little. It has a vaseline-like texture initially, but after a few moments of warming on the fingertips, it becomes creamy. Although it is expensive, one jar typically lasts almost a year.</li>
    <li> Personally, I am not a big fan of its fragrance...</li>
    <li> Recently, I visited a day spa and the woman who performed my facial recommended that I use this product each night before bed.  I didn&#x27;t buy it from the spa because I wanted to see if Amazon carried it and they did!  It is probably one of the BEST products I have invested in because it leaves my face feeling silken and smooth every single day.  The woman who did my facial told me that eventually, my skin would start feeling this way and she was absolutely right!  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and I already notice a difference.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer!  I always thought that oily skin should not use oil, but I was wrong.  Using this at night has kept my oil problem during the day down.  It may seem a bit oily and thick when you first start using it, but when you wake up in the morning, your face is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Highly recommend it!  I have tried many others and none compare to this.  All Decleor products are outstanding!  Try them!  You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I dont like when people rate something at first try.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for well over 3 weeks now and it seems to be best for very dry skin but the rose aroma is over whelming.&lt;br /&gt;As far how good it has done on my face, i am not sure if it had done any good except to have kept it hydrated&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel or for keeping in your cabinet. When travel I do not bring anything else except sunscreen. This keeps my skin soft and keeps the under eye lines at bay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still testing it.  Love the smell</li>
    <li> I love this product so much.  No matter what I&#x27;ve done to my skin during the day, I put this on at night and in the morning my skin is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using Decleor products for years but hate paying the spa price. Happy to support a company that will get it for me at a cheaper price with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Love the natural organic fragrance but little greasy. It takes about hr or two for skin to obsorb. But it feels very wonderful and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love this item. For a balm it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  Readily absorbs into skin</li>
    <li> Not what I had expected,  It felt very heavy and greasy on my skin and I did not care for the fragrance.  It is not a returnable item so I felt I have wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Exellent very relaxing and leaves my face dewy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great for a very dry climate like AZ but also good for oily skin. Its a very very thick natural balm that absorbs overnight and leaves ur skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but this made me break out in red, itchy, pus-like bumps. My dermatologist recommended that I stop using it and when I did, the bumps went away.</li>
    <li> Love the Decléor Brand. My aesthetician used their products on me during my facials, in the 80s, and I have bought their night balms ever since. I use at night and put a little on my lips and eyelashes to keep my lashes from getting brittle.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better than when using this Decleor Balm; its just radiant.  We&#x27;ve had a very dry winter, and I&#x27;ve seen vast improvement using the Balm.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for many yrs. I really like andit is extremely hard to find. thank you for carrying and the price is great.Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> This product is great for a once a week deep moisture treatment for your face and neck. My face looks 5 years younger the next day.</li>
    <li> apply it singly or over night time products. Nutritious for the skin yet doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores. Your skin feels supple and hydrated in the morning. The essential oils Decleor uses are wonderful and not to heavy.</li>
    <li> This product smells exactly like the ylang ylang night balm I purchased, but it was supposed to be a completely different item... Fake product?</li>
    <li> They used this for my facial at bliss spa and it was divine. it was my asthetians personal favorite.  Love the smell and always get compliments on my skin</li>
    <li> While it seems to work as the same product I purchased in a local spa, it did not have the same aroma as the spa product, which was a part of its appeal</li>
