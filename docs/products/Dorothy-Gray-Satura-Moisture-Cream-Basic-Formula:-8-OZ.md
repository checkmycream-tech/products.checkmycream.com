      <li>It is very greasy and while it may not be as good as the original, it still has collagen in it which is difficult to find in a night cream.  </li>

      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, I tried many other moisturizers, but my skin felt dry and wrinkled.  </li>

      <li>The complexion is left very soft and youthful...</li>
      <li>The formula has been completely changed and is now very greasy, is a different color, and has a little too much fragrance for my liking.  </li>
      <li>The product came a few days later that originally estimated.  </li>
      <li>My mother likes this cream for ultimate hydration, though fragrance is not subtle enough for me,</li>
      <li>When her house burned down, the first thing she wanted to know was, was my Satura saved?</li>

<li> I tried to wet my fingers to give a little slack to the product, but it appears to be waterproof.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Delivery was earlier than promised which was great!  Have been using and enjoying the product.  Seems to live up to my&lt;br /&gt;expectations.</li>
    <li> My mom  used this product I started using it in my 30&#x27;s, I am almost 63 everyone tells me I do not look it, this product has always made my sking very soft &amp; not dry at all.  I use it only at bedtime, if I have lines I will dab it in between and use a daytime lotion.  Hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dorothy Gray&#x27;s Satura Moisture Cream for years. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in the stores any more. So when I found it at Amazon on line, I was extremely happy. Not only was it less expensive then I previously paid at the store, my product was delivered to me in just days.  It seems to be the only product that works on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I grew up with this product and was upset when I could no longer find it in stores. Happy to know I can now get what I KNOW is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! ! !  I have tried it before , is perfect for mature skins and for problems with dry skin for  all ages.</li>
    <li> I have been a Satura user for over fifty years.  Yes, that long.  I credit it with my skin&#x27;s more youthful appearance.  The jar lasts a long time.  I used to be able to buy it anywhere, but couldn&#x27;t find it for several months, then I found it on Amazon.  Hallelulia!</li>
    <li> I order this cream for my 90 year old mother because she swears by it and has used it for many years.  Her skin is beautiful and she is often complimented for her lovely complexion.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for may years and found nothing I liked better, leaving my skin very moist and never felt dry.  Then it was  discontinued and I could no longer locate it in stores.  When I found it offered online I was elated and placed my order. When it arrived I immediately notice it was not the same at all, however still has the exact label.  The formula has been completely changed and is now very greasy, is a different color, and has a little too much fragrance for my liking.  It no longer leaves my skin moist, but too oily. I might as well use Olive Oil. I called the parent company, Tee Bop, that distributed it and they happily gave me credit for my purchase. Their customers service was great. I would purchase the \\&quot;original cream\\&quot; in a flash if I could find it. Don&#x27;t mess with a good thing.    NELL</li>
    <li> Received in record time. Love the product. The only face cream that works and I can afford it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream FOREVER. I have very dry skin and this is the only cream that keeps moisture on my skin. People have always guessed my age as 10 yrs younger than I am, Really. Skin needs moisture but If your skin is oily, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Satura products for the past thirty years and cannot imagine not having this fabulous cream.  As a result of using this amazing cream, I have \\&quot;no\\&quot; wrinkles and my skin is like peaches and cream.  I always get comments on my skin and what cream I use.  I always tell folks about Satura and how great it is.  It has been amazing and I love this cream.  Everyone should know about this cream and use it...........it does miracles!</li>
    <li> I do not use this product but my 91 year old aunt has used it for many years. When her house burned down, the first thing she wanted to know was, was my Satura saved? It wasn&#x27;t which is why I ordered more.</li>
    <li> To me was so hard to found this face cream al stores both fourtunelly I found so easy trough you, and I recived before time expected. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My mother likes this cream for ultimate hydration, though fragrance is not subtle enough for me,</li>
    <li> My mother used Satura Dorothy Grey Moisturizer and I have used it for too many years to count. I use it at night and as a moisturizer during the day. I&#x27;m in my 60s and my skin is healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, I tried many other moisturizers, but my skin felt dry and wrinkled.  I was desperate and checked on Amazon.  Yea!  Thank you, AMAZON!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  It does seem shinier than it used to.</li>
    <li> Only place to find it from California, so I use Amazaon to purchase as not able to locate in Idaho</li>
    <li> Satura is no longer made by Playtex and it is NOT the same...you will waste your money.  I got stuck with 3 jars of unusable stuff....it is not Satura even though the label is the same...color is different and ingredients are different with aluminum and other bad stuff in it now.</li>
    <li> The product came a few days later that originally estimated.  One of the jars was cracked but the lid still fits to keep the cream from pouring out.</li>
    <li> I need a phone number to call about your product</li>
    <li> Good tasting and the packaging was professional. Lo-fat and no cholesterol were highlights. This will be my last review for 2014.</li>
    <li> My mother has used this cream for years and since my skin has changed I need to moisturize more.  This cream does the job.  So happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my mom.  She has been using Dorothy Grey moisture Cream for many years.  She is 88 years young.  She always has liked it and it is a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this cream for over 50 years.  Her face looks like she&#x27;s about 50 and she&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s, very soft and smooth skin unlike mine.  Maybe I should start using it.  She has very sensitive skin and this cream has never bothered her.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream,its a very rich cream.If you have dry skin,this is for you. I love the results. You can easily reduce the amount if you feel its to thick. This cream is for dry skin. The complexion is left very soft and youthful...</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. The cream is a little too oily, but I just adjust &amp; apply a smaller amount when I use it. The delivery was here by date it was promised. The packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> We use this moisturizer all the time.  Nothing like it for a radiant glow and the feeling of real skin hydration.  Spritz on a mist of water before use for a better result.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisture cream most of my adult life.  It is wonderful..</li>
    <li> I have use this for product for over 25 years. Can not leave without it!</li>
    <li> best cream there is, I am using this product for 40 years and I am not changing it for anything else, all my sisters are using it also, my darling mother started . I am 60 years old and everybody ask me why do I have such a beautiful skin...... I recommend satura basic formula to everybody, not to mentioned that I had experience several beauty treatment from all over the world, but I alway went back to my satura,</li>
    <li> This cream is heavy and oily.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to smooth it over your skin, and leaves a thick, greasy shine.  OK for a night cream, but it&#x27;s sticky on your pillowcase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom becuase she was paying twice as much at some local retail stores. She loves this cream and is the same thing on the shelves.</li>
    <li> The Dorothy Gray Satura Moisture Cream is great for dry skin. My mother used it, I use it, and my daughter uses it. Put it on your face at night before&lt;br /&gt;going to sleep, rub it in, and you will wake up with nice moisturized skin. My husband compares it to axle grease, but then he doesn&#x27;t have dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;I could not live without it! I was very happy to find it on Amazon as Walgreens no longer carries it.</li>
    <li> The formula on this product has changed considerably.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and it didn&#x27;t have paraben.  This is an altogether different formula which smells like Mennen Baby Lotion and which is mixed with Paraben.  It does keep my face moist, but I doubt I would ever buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like putting Crisco oil on your face. It doesn&#x27;t soak it but rather sits on the face. Also, it&#x27;s hard to spread on the skin..... I tried to wet my fingers to give a little slack to the product, but it appears to be waterproof. I look ridiculous with this coating of shinny lard on my face that doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin. Sending it back.</li>
    <li> I just received my jar of \\&quot;Dorothy Gray Satura\\&quot; moisturizer.  My mother and I have used it since the 50s, but haven&#x27;t been able to find any for a long time.  This, in my view, is not the original, but made to look like it.  Lots of chemical additives to go with the water, mineral oil, and bees wax.  It looks the same, but clearly is not.  I wish I had an original jar to check the ingredients to see how close, or not, this is.  I am going to try it and see how it treats my skin. Obviously, you don&#x27;t need much--it is very dense and a little goes a long way.  You might put it on your elbows, heels, or any other body part that is dry.  Not sorry I bought it--it will be fun to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this moisture cream after being without for so many years. My mom used this faithfully and her skin was beautiful. I used to come in a beautiful pink jar. Maybe a little heavier than original but I love it.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this all her adult life and she is 86 now,  She swears by it.  It must work well.  She is 25 years older than me and people think she is my sister.</li>
    <li> Awful stuff and when I discovered this cream contains &amp;#34;parabens&amp;#34; I tried to return it.  Seller wouldn&#x27;t offer free shipping back. Not worth the trip to the post office and postage so I gave it to a friend who is massaging her feet with it.</li>
    <li> Advertised as 100% original formula which it most definitely is not.  I compared ingredients and this was has petroleum jelly and mineral oil as the first two ingredients which most certainly are not the first ingredients in the older container I have.  It is very greasy and while it may not be as good as the original, it still has collagen in it which is difficult to find in a night cream.  I will use it and give it a chance even though it gets grease in my hair.</li>
    <li> This tends to be best for overnight because it is rathe greasy but has a nice scent and works well.</li>
</ol>
