      <li>Now I can sleep much better.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I first tested this mask at 12 pm on a bright sunny day, and let me tell you.</li>
      <li>pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>A great way to convince myself that I am delaying the inevitable in my kind of style and comfort.</li>
      <li>Lets light in underneath your eyes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it leaves the makeup unsmudged, but it&#x27;s comfortable and blocks his snoring.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>My husband likes the light</li>
      <li>I have no issues with light coming under the nose area,</li>
      <li>and I loved how it completely blocked out any light and sound.</li>
      <li>I own several sleep masks and while this one is not as luxurious as some others I own, it appears well made and serves the purpose to block out light while sleeping.  </li>
      <li>love that they include a set of quality ear plugs and have designed a storage area for them in the strap, so they are easy to find when you are ready to close your eyes for the night.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>Received these fast, and very smooth and comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is not awkward and easily folds to be tucked away for storage or placed in your pocket for flight travel.</li>
      <li>But the mask itself is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>He is sensitive to light and he says that this helps him sleep better and prevents light from getting to his eyes.</li>
      <li>The strap has Velcro on it to be able to adjust to the users head size, which I really like as my husband is already wanting to use this as well.</li>
      <li>I actually got a good nights sleep.</li>
      <li>This completely blocks out all light and is easily adjusted to fit.</li>
      <li>This mask is better than cheap dollar masks, in that it has an adjustable velcro strap in the back, for easy adjustment and comfort.  </li>
      <li>Also i am known to toss and turn and the strap is very sturdy and and i can adjust it to just the right size so it stays on all night!!  </li>
      <li>Also very helpful when you have migraines blocks the light and with the comfort  </li>
      <li>The ear plugs fit into a holder on the strap which is very convenient, because they all stay together when they&#x27;re not in use.</li>
      <li>Nice basic sleep mask.  </li>
      <li>I have issues with my eyelids not closing all the way when I sleep as a result of having graves disease, so when I was given the opportunity to review this sleep mask in exchange for my unbiased review, I was quick to accept Peaceful Zz&#x27;s generous offer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It would be nice if this mask came with a small bag for easy storage.</li>
      <li>It is extremely comfortable to wear, the elastic is gentle but strong enough to hold on despite my being pretty restless as a sleeper.</li>
      <li>It was soft and fit snug.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is married to a snorer.  </li>
      <li>I have Fibromyalgia and suffer non-restorative sleep and need to sleep through into the daytime every day, I also have light sensitive issues that causes pain without a mask.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This eye mask didn&#x27;t really do a great job of blocking out all the light which basically renders it useless.  </li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to any one looking for a good nights sleep with extra comfort.</li>
      <li>satin/terry sleep mask is very soft to the touch and super</li>
      <li>Easy to adjust the velcro strap, and strap still lays flat.</li>
      <li>I only need to block out the light from my husband&#x27;s night stand and or the TV.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>includes an extra piece of material that covers the bridge of the nose, thus preventing any light from getting through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also the nose area has a bit extra material to block out excess light.</li>
      <li>Nice little touch with the earplugs too.&lt;br /&gt;This are going to be my stocking stuffers for this year!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite soft and light enough;</li>
      <li>The material on the side that touches my eyes is so soft and comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t bother my long eyelashes like others have before.  </li>
      <li>I like to wear my mask pretty far down to block all light.</li>
      <li>The sun comes up early (seems to be especially early on the weekends) where I live and this helped me gain a couple hours extra sleep.  </li>
      <li>There is a soft piece of fabric for over the bridge of the nose as well</li>
      <li>Conforms to my face nicely as it is soft pliable satin.</li>
      <li>soft felt</li>
      <li>This mask is incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>I have hand washed it with mild soap and air dried.</li>
      <li>There is a silky material on the outside and a soft fleece like material on the inside.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nose piece uncomfortable,  not much material,  not worth the money</li>
    <li> i love this mask!!! i have big round eyes and unfortunately my eyelids don&#x27;t completely cover them,  so when i sleep i have to use a mask or i will wake up when the sun does.  This mask is the most comfortable i have ever used!!! The material on the side that touches my eyes is so soft and comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t bother my long eyelashes like others have before.  Also i am known to toss and turn and the strap is very sturdy and and i can adjust it to just the right size so it stays on all night!!  my favorite feature though is the special area for me to keep the ear plugs in, its perfect for me because my dog has been known to go and grab my earplugs if i just leave them on my nightstand.  now i do not have to worry about that because just wake up and put them in the sturdy pockets and he never finds them!!!  I received this sleep mask for review  purposes and my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Product has odd flap of fabric across bridge of nose that keeps it from laying snug on your face. Lets light in underneath your eyes. I&#x27;m thinking of cutting it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he uses it all the time. He is sensitive to light and he says that this helps him sleep better and prevents light from getting to his eyes. Based on that comment, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mask is incredibly soft. The strap has Velcro on it to be able to adjust to the users head size, which I really like as my husband is already wanting to use this as well. There is a soft piece of fabric for over the bridge of the nose as well so there is no gap there when the mask is being used. The ear plugs fit into a holder on the strap which is very convenient, because they all stay together when they&#x27;re not in use. I first tested this mask at 12 pm on a bright sunny day, and let me tell you. I couldn&#x27;t tell in the slightest that the sun was even out. Along with the ear plugs which reduce the noises going on throughout the day, I had one nice nap using this mask. Overall this mask is an A+ I will definitely be buying additional masks for my husband and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Since I work nites, always have hard time sleeping with the sun in my face. Now I can sleep much better. Item is as described, Thank you!</li>
    <li> This completely blocks out all light and is easily adjusted to fit. My wife has been using it at night and has been very pleased with how it has helped her stay asleep in the morning when the light comes in the window. It&#x27;s good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Comfortable fit. Total block out.</li>
    <li> I was offered this sleep mask for a great deal to try and share my honest and unbiased opinion.  It is one of the best sleep masks I have tried.  The sun comes up early (seems to be especially early on the weekends) where I live and this helped me gain a couple hours extra sleep.  It was soft and fit snug.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it coming off.  I like the adjustable strap because my husband and I have been sharing it and he has a larger head.</li>
    <li> It is extremely comfortable to wear, the elastic is gentle but strong enough to hold on despite my being pretty restless as a sleeper. I also have a large hat size and they cope perfectly with that too. There is no pinching feeling even after wearing them all through my sleep. I have a sleep disorder, and while these don&#x27;t cure it they help me enormously to get sleep in the daylight hours which I need. I have Fibromyalgia and suffer non-restorative sleep and need to sleep through into the daytime every day, I also have light sensitive issues that causes pain without a mask.&lt;br /&gt;My quality of life has improved quite noticeably because of improved daylight sleeping using this mask.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received in return for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Works well, but it slips down during the night.  The elastic is too wide for me.</li>
    <li> Nice basic sleep mask.  I own several sleep masks and while this one is not as luxurious as some others I own, it appears well made and serves the purpose to block out light while sleeping.  This mask is better than cheap dollar masks, in that it has an adjustable velcro strap in the back, for easy adjustment and comfort.  The band also comes with slots to place ear plugs, which is a nice feature so that you don&#x27;t lose your ear plugs.  There is a silky material on the outside and a soft fleece like material on the inside.  Also the nose area has a bit extra material to block out excess light. It would be nice if this mask came with a small bag for easy storage. I received this sleep mask for review and inspection purposes and my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> So soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This bad boy keeps out the nuisance called sunlight when you need it most. My husband likes the light and so we have a sunroof in our bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is like a little training bra for your eyes, #gigglez. You can open your eyes while wearing it and still not have to deal with the onslaught of the day, therefore giving you the needed time to adjust to the conditions you are about to face. A great way to convince myself that I am delaying the inevitable in my kind of style and comfort. Especially since it is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always sleep in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> Does its job for the Price.</li>
    <li> Very nice sleep mask. It&#x27;s quite soft and light enough; pretty good quality. Nice little touch with the earplugs too.&lt;br /&gt;This are going to be my stocking stuffers for this year!</li>
    <li> Perfect balance of comfort and functionality. It is not awkward and easily folds to be tucked away for storage or placed in your pocket for flight travel.</li>
    <li> Received these fast, and very smooth and comfortable. I work at night, these are perfect and light doesn&#x27;t come thru, great undisturbed sleep at day time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is married to a snorer.  She loves the mask and the ear plugs.  She hasn&#x27;t tried it with make up on, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it leaves the makeup unsmudged, but it&#x27;s comfortable and blocks his snoring.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great quality item!!! Nice satiny smooth feel and comes with ear plugs and a nice storage pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must get for all insomnia and migrane sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and I loved how it completely blocked out any light and sound. I actually got a good nights sleep. Finally!!</li>
    <li> I have issues with my eyelids not closing all the way when I sleep as a result of having graves disease, so when I was given the opportunity to review this sleep mask in exchange for my unbiased review, I was quick to accept Peaceful Zz&#x27;s generous offer.&lt;br /&gt;This satin/terry sleep mask is very soft to the touch and super comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The stitching is tight and made to last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The velcro enclosure on the sturdy elastic band held the mask in place the entire night without getting caught in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The design includes an extra piece of material that covers the bridge of the nose, thus preventing any light from getting through.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they include a set of quality ear plugs and have designed a storage area for them in the strap, so they are easy to find when you are ready to close your eyes for the night.&lt;br /&gt;Great sleep mask/ear plug combination for the price!</li>
    <li> Fits nicely. Easy to adjust the velcro strap, and strap still lays flat. Velcro is not scratchy.Nice that it comes with earplugs. Conforms to my face nicely as it is soft pliable satin. The inside is soft felt material(I think that&#x27;s what it is). I have no issues with light coming under the nose area, its conforming, just pull it down further. I have no issues falling asleep,...in the dark. I only need to block out the light from my husband&#x27;s night stand and or the TV. This is a great mask. I have hand washed it with mild soap and air dried. treat it like you would lingerie. I mean it only has 1 row of stitching around the edges. i think the fibers would weaken in the washer without a protective wash bag, like lingerie would. I am happy with it &amp; when/if it does fall apart, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This eye mask didn&#x27;t really do a great job of blocking out all the light which basically renders it useless.  I think becaase it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of protecting from a gap created by the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were you I would buy one that is shaped to go over your nose.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 3 1/2  stars if I could. The addition of the plugs and a place to store them a good idea. But...The strap annoys my ear a little bit. I like to wear my mask pretty far down to block all light. With the band that attaches to the mask...You either have to put it behind your ear or over your ear and it is too rough to wear &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; the ear. But the mask itself is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to wear letting you get a restful and good nights sleep . Also very helpful when you have migraines blocks the light and with the comfort  feeling ear plugs all sounds are blocked to help ease the pain of your headache. Would definitely recommend to any one looking for a good nights sleep with extra comfort.</li>
    <li> Works great - thanks!</li>
