      <li>Idon&#x27;t know why, but it did not work full me.</li>
      <li>Did not have the super hold I saw written in some of the reviews.</li>
      <li>This is the best thing for front lace wigs it will last you for a long time.</li>
      <li>It holds great until you perspire a little</li>
      <li>All depends on persons scalp, for me its worth it</li>
      <li>However the price is right and the product is plentiful</li>
      <li>which was the only place that i applied the glue&amp;#34; so I would love to rate this glue 5 stars</li>
      <li>and I will continue to use for all of my lace wigs ;-)</li>
      <li>If you expect this to last more than a day or</li>
      <li>Most definitely!</li>
      <li>GREAT ADHESIVE WITH LONG LASTING STAYING POWER!</li>
      <li>If directions are followed EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>The first two times I used this product, my lace closure stayed entact for one week.</li>
      <li>many layers you apply will decide how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It comes off easily with basic lace remover.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worked out very well for securing my lace front wigs.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s straight up</li>
      <li>I could apply glue and a lace wig to a cat and make it look real</li>
      <li>but this one I&#x27;m not to sure about especially if your one of those people whom take pride in your natural hair line.</li>
      <li>whats good for the goose is definitly NOT good for this gander......</li>
      <li>I have had mine for 6 months and still have more than a half of it</li>
      <li>went to beach, swam, washed, sweat, worked out, and I live in high humidity in the South.  </li>
      <li>works fine for me went out in 95 temp no problem, extreme sweating in gym in problem holding for a week now with no issues.</li>
      <li>I live on the ocean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Beware, although this product is targeted at those with sensitive skin, it CAN give you an allergic reaction!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mess free, dries clear, and holds strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>super inlove with this ghost bond adhesive,id recommend it to anyone who has allergies to all the other brands ghost bond</li>
      <li>dries totally clear.</li>
      <li>Dries clear but it&#x27;s too shiny...</li>
      <li>If I go workout and sweat it lifts completely up.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m professional</li>
      <li>the directions doesn&#x27;t really help, it took several attempts to get the hang</li>
      <li>A Must Have if you wear full lace wigs,apply let dry for 1 min then apply another coat and let dry for I say 2 min</li>
      <li>I recently read online that it contained harsh chemicals and all the info available for ghost bond says it is great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t contain all the bad stuff.</li>

<li> if wash in shower will come a little loose.</li>
<li> I feel like I am really trying with this product and some where I am going wrong.</li>
<li> Wig stays put with two thin layers, dries clear and I even swam with and no lifting after I submerged my head under.  </li>
<li> I like the way it holds down my lace front.</li>
<li> My bond lasted about 2 1/2 weeks before I tacked it down in a few places.</li>
<li> this product is a waste of money and it just messy honey..</li>
<li> This works for me because I perspire heavily on my scalp and it hold for three weeks sometimes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another lace wig adhesive!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Ghost Bond user for life.</li>
    <li> I love it; GREAT ADHESIVE WITH LONG LASTING STAYING POWER!</li>
    <li> Did not work well with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this glue lasts about a week and it works wonderfully. Its easy to clean off and I will continue to use for all of my lace wigs ;-)</li>
    <li> Great product i just received it.....i love this producr</li>
    <li> The best stuff I workout a lot and do hot yoga it stays in place no lifting only comes off when I take it off and then it&#x27;s easy....</li>
    <li> Not the best, I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I did not care for this glue. I find that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using walkers ultra hold for a long time with no issues. I recently read online that it contained harsh chemicals and all the info available for ghost bond says it is great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t contain all the bad stuff. Also that it cannot give an allergic reaction as it is water based. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this two days ago and have had a severe reaction to it. Really bad, my hairline is red raw, swollen and I&#x27;m in a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;Beware, although this product is targeted at those with sensitive skin, it CAN give you an allergic reaction!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s mess free, dries clear, and holds strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To have this stuff work well you&#x27;re going to need at least 20 minutes to spare.&lt;br /&gt;How many layers you apply will decide how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest 4 layers for 1 to 2 weeks. It comes off easily with basic lace remover.&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry for 5 minutes between each layer application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this garbage</li>
    <li> It defintely stays on but the glue is really messy and its hard to remove the residue. It does its job well though</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for front lace wigs it will last you for a long time. I have had mine for 6 months and still have more than a half of it left</li>
    <li> ghost bond is a great adhesive&amp;#34; and it is better than the ultra hold and other bonding glues in the beauty supply stores. ? But I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I had to use Googone adhesive remover plus other oils to remove access glue and I&#x27;m professional I could apply glue and a lace wig to a cat and make it look real but this one I&#x27;m not to sure about especially if your one of those people whom take pride in your natural hair line. I notice itching and irratation around my hair lines by my temples? which was the only place that i applied the glue&amp;#34; so I would love to rate this glue 5 stars but I can&#x27;t the fear of baldness from this glue rates more than 90% in my book.</li>
    <li> works fine for me went out in 95 temp no problem, extreme sweating in gym in problem holding for a week now with no issues. if wash in shower will come a little loose. Just use shower cap or swimming cap when go swimming will be fine. I will order more. All depends on persons scalp, for me its worth it</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use... bad for hairline</li>
    <li> Dries clear but it&#x27;s too shiny... I don&#x27;t want to notice on shine on my hairline.  It holds great until you perspire a little then it starts to become gummy and causes the wigs to slide.</li>
    <li> Did not have the super hold I saw written in some of the reviews.</li>
    <li> I purchased this glue based on the rave reviews I watched on YouTube. Big waste of money am so disappointed!!! I followed the instructions to the T and  it did not work it just keep lifting so I tried my own technique just using two coats n it stayed for a day longest it has stayed. I don&#x27;t suggest getting this product. And about it being waterproof that&#x27;s straight up BS!!!!!</li>
    <li> worked! It will lasts for days, if you follow the detail instructions.</li>
    <li> A Must Have if you wear full lace wigs,apply let dry for 1 min then apply another coat and let dry for I say 2 min I sat in front of a fan for faster drying then put on my lace and this was a week and 2 days ago im super inlove with this ghost bond adhesive,id recommend it to anyone who has allergies to all the other brands ghost bond does the job!!</li>
    <li> Messy as Hell...works once you get a solid bond... takes time though.  Once it holds it holds.  I live on the ocean. went to beach, swam, washed, sweat, worked out, and I live in high humidity in the South.  My bond lasted about 2 1/2 weeks before I tacked it down in a few places. Lasted 1 month total before I removed completely.  I thought it was difficult getting the residue off my skin and edges.  Bought wig remover (which is oil based), but Goo-Gone... that worked best to remove the residue</li>
    <li> This is the best glue I have used.....hold lasts for me about 3-4 days.  Best ever. I&#x27;m still looking for the glue that gets me through the week.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! Wig stays put with two thin layers, dries clear and I even swam with and no lifting after I submerged my head under.  Seller is excellent, I&#x27;ve purchased twice and had product arrive in 2 days even WITHOUT prime shipping.</li>
    <li> Sorry this product unfortunately did not work for me. I followed directions to the tee, and  no luck! Everything don&#x27;t  work for everybody. Results seems to vary on individual basis.</li>
    <li> I heard how great this was so I bought it and it did not live up to the hype. It takes time to get the nitch. the directions doesn&#x27;t really help, it took several attempts to get the hang of.it,it&#x27;s okay. However the price is right and the product is plentiful so there&#x27;s lots of room for error!</li>
    <li> This bond adhesive DOES NOT live up to its name. It is very sticky and messy. It doesn&#x27;t hold at all and the bond was loose the next day! DO NOT get this! It&#x27;s a complete waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Most definitely! I&#x27;ve been using this glue for a couple of years and it&#x27;s worked out very well for securing my lace front wigs.</li>
    <li> Great product, and much cheaper then buying it from the hair salon.</li>
    <li> Dnt believe the hype...this product is a waste of money and it just messy honey..i thought i was gone be gone with the wind fabolous ,it didnt even get me threw the day ....s.m.h..I hve better things to do then to be worrying about if my lace lifting...and I kno if you hv oily skin, or if you sweat a lot you will hve problems but neither of those things apply to muah ,I just dnt kno what the problems is???.ladies whats works for some may not work for you...whats good for the goose is definitly NOT good for this gander......</li>
    <li> If you wear a hair piece of any kind this is the best easy clean up and super hold and no gumming up</li>
    <li> I like it. strong hold and doesn&#x27;t get as gewy or sticky as some. application is easy. dries totally clear. best when use heat.</li>
    <li> What a waste of time and money this product doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectations</li>
    <li> Awesome!  This is the  best adhesive I&#x27;ve ever tried. It actually last 2 to 3 weeks</li>
    <li> I like the way it holds down my lace front. It&#x27;s easy to remove as well.</li>
    <li> This works for me because I perspire heavily on my scalp and it hold for three weeks sometimes longer.than three weeks</li>
    <li> A friend of mine did a lace closure for me two weeks and ago and its just starting to lift up. Totally invisible and holds very tight and comfortable. I&#x27;m running out to get me some more just bc I cannot wait for shipping. Excellent stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> The first two times I used this product, my lace closure stayed entact for one week. I then used it with Ultra Hold glue, and the closure did not lift for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;1. Follow Ghost Bond directions for 2-3 coats&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply 1 coat of Ultra Hold&lt;br /&gt;3. Attach unit when glue feels tacky&lt;br /&gt;4. Let glue dry for 1hr&lt;br /&gt;5. Cover with head scarf/band</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected. The holds for all of a day. If I go workout and sweat it lifts completely up. I&#x27;m currently looking for some stronger glue. I would recommend this for a night out, not anything longer than that.</li>
    <li> It works ok if your not a sweater or have oily skin which it supposed to be for people who sweat/oily skin ..not! It holds but I believe the regular ghost bond works best..I&#x27;ve tried both and it does!!</li>
    <li> I personally like it because it is not too  messi to work with .  wish there a was easy solution to remove it . My hair is very thin around the edges and some time it takes lost of rubbing to remove it . I ware a clouser around the frount it holds it well.</li>
    <li> Idon&#x27;t know why, but it did not work full me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know any product that works better</li>
    <li> Great glue, have been using ghost bond for years</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;. Felt like I was using paste. Cheap. Use the real hard bond the one that dries crystal clear and hard.  If you expect this to last more than a day or even 20 minutes yow will be disappointed. This product sucks!</li>
    <li> awesome product and when directions are followed, it does as promised</li>
    <li> Awesome!! If directions are followed EXACTLY. You can not find a better adhesive.</li>
    <li> It does not hold long enough.</li>
    <li> I feel like I am really trying with this product and some where I am going wrong. I have read reviews watched youtube videos and no real success. For some reason it leaves almost like a snail trail where my lace front ends and my scaple begins:( It is difficult for me to try to clean up the residue, but I guess I am gonna keep trying. Any suggestions?</li>
