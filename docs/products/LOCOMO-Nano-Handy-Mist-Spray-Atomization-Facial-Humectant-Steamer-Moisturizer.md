### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>i go, just a great beauty device!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my line of work.</li>
      <li>Great buy</li>
      <li>If it can come out hot steam will be perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love my nano mister!</li>
      <li>I am an eyelash extension stylist, and clients love the treatment of the nano after service to soothe and pamper.</li>
      <li>I like the product because it looks cute,</li>
      <li>Bottom line is I want more than 3 to 5 seconds before having to shake the mister and/or restart it by opening and closing the cover.</li>
      <li>Would love it if my product was working.</li>
      <li>Love the concept.</li>
      <li>Hit me up if you have any questions, I love this thing. :)</li>
      <li>I use this on my clients eyelash extensions to cure the glue, I love the ease of it and my clients love the soothing mist.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it, they work just fine - and for $17.99, it&#x27;s the best way to have an actual diffuser with you all the time.</li>
      <li>It runs out of water very quickly and it is more practical just to heat a bowl of water and lean over it.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s so easy to carry anywhere</li>
      <li>Inhaling oils in their undiffused state can be strong for some people, this is a fantastic solution.</li>
      <li>Very light weight and works very well.  </li>
      <li>I keep it in a cool place never dropped it &amp; never misused it</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m waiting in line and get irritated with people, I diffuse a little Joy in my face and all is well with the world.</li>
      <li>i really love this mist spray, that makes my skin so fresh and smooth, fills that with moisture and makes it look definitely younger.</li>
      <li>Shipping takes some time but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Great to clear your pores and for a facial away from the spa</li>
      <li>The three generous stars are for the beautiful appearance of LOCOMO Nano Mist Sprayer, as well as how quickly a mist is produced although lasting a very brief period of time.  </li>
      <li>I really like this as it is the one I was first introduced to.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really frustated about that.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Initially, a fine mist will quickly be produced, but lasting only three to five seconds.</li>
      <li>The first one I ordered broke &amp; had to send it back, once I received my new one I was pleased until a month after use it totally doesn&#x27;t work anymore at all.</li>
      <li>Was careful to use it as directed so it was not something I did just a cheap item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m professional  and use this stuffs very often...</li>
      <li>gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s not PERFECT, but it&#x27;s pretty darn GOOD.</li>
      <li>I really like the little carrying case it comes with</li>

<li> I really like the little carrying case it comes with</li>
<li> need to,open close open close a few times to get it to spray</li>
<li> Unfortunately, to attain further benefits from the LOCOMO Mist Spray, I have to shake the LOCOMO Nano several times to produce a second mist, which lasts another 3 to 5 seconds.</li>
<li> , then wait, it will start to flow continuously for 30 seconds then shuts off, which I LIKE so that I get the blast I need, and don&#x27;t run the battery out; once in a while the connection won&#x27;t happen and it won&#x27;t come on at all - slip the battery door down and roll the batteries, then close the battery door</li>
<li> These are identical and way less pricey.  </li>
<li> My experience with misting using LOCOMO Nano is frustrating rather than relaxing between the short duration of mist produced and the shaking, opening and closing the device.</li>
<li> a few weeks of use.  </li>
<li> and that&#x27;s was after having it for a few days.</li>
<li> (I would agree that the circuit connection is probably just not perfect) -- I add essential oils to mine and it&#x27;s become like my little addiction!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using three of these for the past week.</li>
<li> Not very happy with thus item</li>
<li> I doesn&#x27;t have a continuous spray and seems to run even when closed :-(.</li>
<li> just one thing that the steam is cold.</li>
<li> Hate the quality.</li>

    <li> I use this on my clients eyelash extensions to cure the glue, I love the ease of it and my clients love the soothing mist.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and works very well.  Great to clear your pores and for a facial away from the spa</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t have a continuous spray and seems to run even when closed :-(. Not very happy with thus item</li>
    <li> Ok,I bought 3 itens,2 of then doesn&#x27;t works and 1 works badlly....I&#x27;m really frustated about that.&lt;br /&gt;What can you do for me? I&#x27;m professional  and use this stuffs very often...</li>
    <li> What else can I say?  It runs out of water very quickly and it is more practical just to heat a bowl of water and lean over it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t always eject the same amout of steam.</li>
    <li> I am using water in the mister. Initially, a fine mist will quickly be produced, but lasting only three to five seconds. Unfortunately, to attain further benefits from the LOCOMO Mist Spray, I have to shake the LOCOMO Nano several times to produce a second mist, which lasts another 3 to 5 seconds. After the second shaking and 3-5 second misting, I needed to adopt another method to create the mist, which means it will not produce a mist unless I close the cover and open it once or twice, although there is still liquid in the mister. Bottom line is I want more than 3 to 5 seconds before having to shake the mister and/or restart it by opening and closing the cover. The three generous stars are for the beautiful appearance of LOCOMO Nano Mist Sprayer, as well as how quickly a mist is produced although lasting a very brief period of time.  My experience with misting using LOCOMO Nano is frustrating rather than relaxing between the short duration of mist produced and the shaking, opening and closing the device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using three of these for the past week. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned: if you have to shake it, you don&#x27;t have enough water in it; it will initially produce a one-second puff, then wait, it will start to flow continuously for 30 seconds then shuts off, which I LIKE so that I get the blast I need, and don&#x27;t run the battery out; once in a while the connection won&#x27;t happen and it won&#x27;t come on at all - slip the battery door down and roll the batteries, then close the battery door and it should work. (I would agree that the circuit connection is probably just not perfect) -- I add essential oils to mine and it&#x27;s become like my little addiction! When I&#x27;m waiting in line and get irritated with people, I diffuse a little Joy in my face and all is well with the world.

Hit me up if you have any questions, I love this thing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s not PERFECT, but it&#x27;s pretty darn GOOD.</li>
    <li> Bought these as gifts. I have one that was much more expensive.  These are identical and way less pricey.  Shipping takes some time but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Would love it if my product was working.</li>
    <li> Love this! Now can someone tell me where to get the solution! Great buy</li>
    <li> i really love this mist spray, that makes my skin so fresh and smooth, fills that with moisture and makes it look definitely younger. Also it&#x27;s so easy to carry anywhere i go, just a great beauty device!</li>
    <li> need to,open close open close a few times to get it to spray</li>
    <li> I love my nano mister! It&#x27;s perfect for my line of work. I am an eyelash extension stylist, and clients love the treatment of the nano after service to soothe and pamper.</li>
    <li> The first one I ordered broke &amp; had to send it back, once I received my new one I was pleased until a month after use it totally doesn&#x27;t work anymore at all. No matter the batteries or anything. I keep it in a cool place never dropped it &amp; never misused it so I have no idea why it would stop working but I am not into trying another one for a 3rd time. Going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> I really like this as it is the one I was first introduced to.  I purchased these for gifts, however I also wish they could have a recharger within them instead of just batteries.  I really like the little carrying case it comes with</li>
    <li> I like the product because it looks cute, just one thing that the steam is cold. If it can come out hot steam will be perfectly.</li>
    <li> The water chamber cracked within two days of use. Love the concept. Hate the quality.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend broke after&lt;br /&gt;Just a few weeks of use.  Was careful to use it as directed so it was not something I did just a cheap item.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work all the time...I have to bump it and that&#x27;s was after having it for a few days.</li>
