### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I guess it is best to use it at night.</li>
      <li>Try the multi-vitamin power firming cream it is awesome.</li>
      <li>Very good eye cream.</li>
      <li>I have tried many eye creams in my years, this is the best!  </li>
      <li>It is just one of many wonderful Kinerase products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually very interesting.</li>
      <li>I had 1-2 fine lines underneath my eyes that weren&#x27;t there before!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I started to notice a huge difference after just a month!</li>
      <li>But if you give the products a chance to do their magic, I&#x27;m betting you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Kinerase products.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this eye cream many times.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After many trials and travails with skin-care products, I have learned that, sometimes, indeed, you do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>If you do your research, you&#x27;ll learn that most scientists and dermatologists consider Peptides to be one of the most important (if not THEE most important), anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It does have a very nice smooth feel and it makes the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I think Kinerase was keeping those fine lines away</li>
      <li>Then a couple days later I saw great improvement.</li>
      <li>The products were originally devised by doctors who were seeking to rejuvenate and regenerate the epidermis and skin cells of burn victims).</li>
      <li>I hope this review is helpful for those of you looking for &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34;. :-)</li>
      <li>I am a 53 year-old woman, with very good skin (thanks to my genes); but DRY skin, with acne rosacea issues.</li>
      <li>o easily oer it and very very soothing</li>
      <li>This eye cream has been great so far (about a month), &amp; has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.  </li>
      <li>This cream really reduces the puffiness and the fine lines.  </li>
      <li>You can research the various serums and creams, and comeup with a regimen tailor-made to suit your own skin-care needs.</li>
      <li>I now use it around my smile lines.</li>
      <li>I switched to Ole Henricksen Fresh Start Eye Creme just because it was cheaper.</li>
      <li>It has kept the small lines at bay and feels great going on.  </li>
      <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and had loss of elasticity and a lot of fine lines.</li>
      <li>Upon opening the container, the product was only halfway to the top of the container.</li>
      <li>The first times I used it it made me flake or something.</li>
      <li>Some may experience some flakiness the first couple times using it as I did.</li>
      <li>and it actually works pretty good, finally my eyes look rested in the morning.</li>
      <li>If you really want to find out about Kinerase products, go to their website.</li>
      <li>Gentle on the skin yet still manages to tighten the skin all around the eyes.</li>
      <li>I removed it gently.</li>
      <li>I really like the kinerase products.</li>
      <li>other products are better.</li>
      <li>The last time that I bought the cream, the container was full to the rim with product.</li>
      <li>Kinerase products are, literally, the ONLY items I&#x27;ve ever used that do exactly what Kinerase says they will do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like it shedded the old skin and brought out the new.</li>
      <li>I also use it around my lip area to prevent those little fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I used it anyway and a week or so later I really feel the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
      <li>I tried putting on during the day under makeup and it didn&#x27;t absorb smoothly - like little lumps of wax under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Its waxy and really u can only use it at night.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old and also using witch hazel toner, OZ Naturals vitamin C serum, and arnica skin creme.</li>
      <li>I will say it is better than &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but not sure I like it enough to buy it again.</li>
      <li>The product arrived at my house more than half empty!</li>
      <li>It is a hard and waxy and does not go on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Best cold weather under eye moisturizer....nice and thick, make up goes</li>
      <li>It was delivered frozen (the temperatures outside were below freezing) and when it unthawed the consistency was a little funny.</li>
      <li>This cream has made the skin around my eyes feel more firm, less dry and smoother.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was actually skeptical about what I received in the mail since package had no wrapper and the cream had a bit of an unpleasant smell. I had never bought this anywhere else so didn&#x27;t know what it was supposed to be like. I used it anyway and a week or so later I really feel the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and had loss of elasticity and a lot of fine lines. This cream has made the skin around my eyes feel more firm, less dry and smoother. Some may experience some flakiness the first couple times using it as I did. The first times I used it it made me flake or something. Like I was shedding skin. I removed it gently. Then a couple days later I saw great improvement. It&#x27;s like it shedded the old skin and brought out the new. I now use it around my smile lines. Will consider other of Kinerase&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This item arrived completely dried out. It was unusable.</li>
    <li> The product arrived at my house more than half empty! The actual eye cream itself was dried up and waxy. Definitely not worth the $35 and found it to be a pain in the ass to return.</li>
    <li> Very good eye cream. Gentle on the skin yet still manages to tighten the skin all around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this eye cream many times.  This time it was not at all creamy but a hard lump of wax.  The jar was half full of this crap as well!  What happened? I have my last jar and it was the same item only this was not the same product. I can&#x27;t find my receipt. How can I get my money back?</li>
    <li> I am a 53 year-old woman, with very good skin (thanks to my genes); but DRY skin, with acne rosacea issues. After many years of being disappointed by skin-care products that promised everything under the sun, I finally sat down one day and did some intense research. As a result of this research, I found Kinerase. (read up on the history of this company if you are so inclined. It&#x27;s actually very interesting. The products were originally devised by doctors who were seeking to rejuvenate and regenerate the epidermis and skin cells of burn victims). So, after all this research, I decided to give Kinerase a try. As a result, I am a devoted fan of Kinerase products. I&#x27;ve been using their C8 Peptide serums and moisturizers for about 6 years now. Kinerase products are, literally, the ONLY items I&#x27;ve ever used that do exactly what Kinerase says they will do. If you do your research, you&#x27;ll learn that most scientists and dermatologists consider Peptides to be one of the most important (if not THEE most important), anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the C8 Peptide under-eye serum every morning, as well as the overal C8 peptide serum. The Restructure Firming cream for the day, and Ultimate Night Moisturizer at night.  These products deliver.  Mind you, they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;deliver&amp;#34; in 48 hours.  After about a month of using the under eye serum, as well as the under-eye firming cream, I noticed that the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around my eyes became virtually invisible.  The overall look, texture, color of my skin is vastly improved with these products.  Again -- you must be patient.  You won&#x27;t see results in 2 days.  But if you give the products a chance to do their magic, I&#x27;m betting you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many trials and travails with skin-care products, I have learned that, sometimes, indeed, you do get what you pay for. If you really want to find out about Kinerase products, go to their website. You can research the various serums and creams, and comeup with a regimen tailor-made to suit your own skin-care needs. THEN come back to Amazon (which is what I do!), and buy the products for a drastically-reduced cost, to what you will pay if you order from the Kinerase site. I hope this review is helpful for those of you looking for &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34;. :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using other kinerase products and wanted to try something a little bit stronger for the area around the eyes. It was delivered frozen (the temperatures outside were below freezing) and when it unthawed the consistency was a little funny. Have been using it for a few weeks now and it actually works pretty good, finally my eyes look rested in the morning. The cream is a little thicker so I guess it is best to use it at night.</li>
    <li> This cream did nothing for my eyes.  Will go back to Dermalogica which is what I usually use.  Try the multi-vitamin power firming cream it is awesome.</li>
    <li> Best cold weather under eye moisturizer....nice and thick, make up goes o easily oer it and very very soothing...smooths away under eye oines and adds protection. Jus wish the jar was a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other eye cream.  It has kept the small lines at bay and feels great going on.  It is just one of many wonderful Kinerase products.</li>
    <li> This eye cream has been great so far (about a month), &amp; has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.  It does seem to reduce puffiness in the under eye area, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t help with natural dark circles.  I still highly recommended this product, because I&#x27;m not sure there is a product invented that truly helps dark circles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kinerase Firming Eye Cream for about 2 years now. It always did the job but I like to venture out and see what else is out there. I switched to Ole Henricksen Fresh Start Eye Creme just because it was cheaper. That&#x27;s when I started to notice a huge difference after just a month! I had 1-2 fine lines underneath my eyes that weren&#x27;t there before! I&#x27;m 30 so I haven&#x27;t had to deal with lots of wrinkles or deep lines yet. I think Kinerase was keeping those fine lines away and once I stopped using the product, they came out. I am definitely switching back to Kinerase and sticking with what works.</li>
    <li> This cream was a disappointment. Its waxy and really u can only use it at night. I tried putting on during the day under makeup and it didn&#x27;t absorb smoothly - like little lumps of wax under my eyes. Used a gift card to purchase it so I don&#x27;t feel too bad but I&#x27;d NEVER buy it again.</li>
    <li> I will say it is better than &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but not sure I like it enough to buy it again. I have noticed a little difference, but I don&#x27;t know if it is enough to warrant the price. I tried it based on a magazine review, but I doubt I would buy again at $55 a jar. It does have a very nice smooth feel and it makes the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Not good at all  for the price...other products are better.</li>
    <li> Cakes a little bit, but my under eye skin doesn&#x27;t look as thin as it used to. Which in turn has made my under eye circles less noticeable. I will buy again. I&#x27;m 25 years old and also using witch hazel toner, OZ Naturals vitamin C serum, and arnica skin creme.</li>
    <li> The last time that I bought the cream, the container was full to the rim with product. This was almost like buying a bag of chips. Upon opening the container, the product was only halfway to the top of the container. Not sure why such a difference when buying the same product. Will not purchase from this store again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams in my years, this is the best!  I use drops in my eyes especially at night so they are puffy in the morning.  This cream really reduces the puffiness and the fine lines.  I also use it around my lip area to prevent those little fine lines.  My eye area remains hydrated all day. I really like the kinerase products.</li>
    <li> The cream arrived with expiration date scratched out.  I just opened it and the eye cream is clearly outdated.  It is a hard and waxy and does not go on smoothly.  I will never order this product from Amazon.  I tried the Kinerase product and now my eyes are puffy and I am allergic to this.  Amazon will not let me return it.</li>
    <li> I love Kinerase products.</li>
