      <li>If so, are those being offered here safe to use?</li>
      <li>ever and probably never again would I be able to buy anything like it for what it used to cost.</li>
      <li>and I get many comments about my youthful looking skin.</li>

      <li>I love Neutrogena products...</li>
      <li>Please,Please,Somebody find a way to sell this for a better price.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough how much I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>My guess is, it works beautifully for young folks too -- but most things do.  </li>
      <li>I have tried MANY products to reduce fine lines and fade aging spots to no avail.  </li>
      <li>Wow, what a great product.  </li>
      <li>my face feels more hydrated and smooth..</li>
      <li>About 7 years ago an article in a beauty magazine rated this one of the two best on the market (the other one was an Avon product).  </li>
      <li>I also had fine lines on my forehead and it reduced the appearance of wrinkles on my skin.  </li>
      <li>But I feel strongly that it&#x27;s important not to skimp on quality skin care products.</li>
      <li>If it makes her happy, I will continue shopping for it, but the price keeps getting higher and higher and higher!  </li>
      <li>This is the preferred brand of dermatologists to use for themselves, and after using this I can really understand that - I have very fair skin and thought I would somehow, magically tan when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>It never leaves me splotchy or greasy, just smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s CHEAP.</li>
      <li>There is a genuine visible difference in my skin since I began using this product.  </li>
      <li>So, I looked in the Internet and found that the product was still available.</li>
      <li>Also, GREAT on the back of your hands!  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena knew they had a fantastic product on their hands and what did they do?.they raised the price to over $140.00 and it became prohibitive to buy</li>
      <li>It such a great face lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I call it BLUE MAGIC!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty vigilant about morning and night cleansing and using good, gentle products.  </li>
      <li>I am a 37 year old man and was very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I have used the Neutrogena product for several months (Love, love, love it) and was bummed when they stopped carrying it.</li>
      <li>Ihave never written a reveiw before but this product is so good, and I have paid so much more for other products that didn&#x27;t come close to the quality of this one,</li>
      <li>I am really pleased, I am not one to go on about something, but his one really is a get what they say you will get.  </li>
      <li>My face soaks it up and appears so good the next morning.  </li>
      <li>The first order was fine.</li>
      <li>I love most Neutrogena products (adore the tinted ones) but did not like the feel of this one initially (did not seem silky)so</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but was happy that it had exceeded my expectations by so much, so getting fired wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
      <li>I had to search near and wide to find it and especially at a good price.</li>
      <li>Many retailers have discontinued stocking this item, so am glad to have finally found a retailer selling it.  </li>
      <li>The breakouts subsided when I switched to another night cream, but the new one doesn&#x27;t even compare to the Neutrogena in terms of making my skin appear more youthful.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that in the last 7 years more products have come on the market that are pretty good, but I&#x27;m sticking to this one as long as I can find it.  </li>
      <li>At least it smells good :)</li>
      <li>It really made my skin noticeably firmer and so nice and soft, but it seemed to be causing breakouts for me.</li>
      <li>The seller had a good price and delivery was faster than expected.</li>
      <li>Years ago my daughter gave me this cream as a present, and to be honest I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, because it was not Marcella Borghese, Lancome, etc, but I used ti anyway.</li>
      <li>I am blessed with good skin, but the frown lines really aged me.  </li>
      <li>The result is worth the time and effort.  </li>
      <li>and my face has never felt so smooth and look so vibrant..</li>
      <li>My skin seems to be better than before - better tone, wrinkles may be a bit less too.</li>
      <li>I was very happy when I saw that this could be purchased on Amazon as I have been unable to find it anywhere else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think they have discontinued this product - I&#x27;m bummed. Companies always seem to discontinue the cosmetics I love. Why do they always have to reinvent themselves with replacement products or new packaging?! Sometimes older is better!!! The new night cream is okay but thinner and doesn&#x27;t give same results. Bring it back!</li>
    <li> Good to find this item as it appears to have disappeared from stores, but with shipping is very expensive. I paid the price because wife really likes product.</li>
    <li> My skin is often irritated by harsh weather.  Neutrogena Visibly Firm  Copper cream clears it up fast.  This is the best thing I have ever tried for my face.  The problem being it is hard to find.  Copper is a widely recognized anti-inflammatory.  It is also anti-viral and anti-bacterial.</li>
    <li> This product is not all that is promised, but it&#x27;s not too bad.I think it would be an ok moisturizer, but not that great as a \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; cream.</li>
    <li> This is a \\&quot;must have product\\&quot; for my wife. She swears this is the only stuff that will keep her pretty face looking young. If it makes her happy, I will continue shopping for it, but the price keeps getting higher and higher and higher!  Please,Please,Somebody find a way to sell this for a better price. I did say \\&quot;Please\\&quot;!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this cream - works so well since I have been using it...much better priced compared to other creams that I have used in the past and I have definitely noticed an improvement in my face.  Second time ordering!</li>
    <li> After years of buying the wrong moisturizers, I bought this after reading Leslie Baumann&#x27;s Skin Type Solution book.  I haven&#x27;t used other moisturizers since.    I have very dry skin which is very sensitive; many moisturizers irritate my skin.  This cream doesn&#x27;t.  Because it&#x27;s a night cream it provides good moisture, but feels very light.  If you&#x27;re looking something heavy or greasy, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream years ago, and never realize how good it was. One day the store where I used to buy the cream stopped carrying it, and I tried different products. After a few weeks my skin started looking older and not firm at all. So, I looked in the Internet and found that the product was still available. I order it and started using it again. I was so happily surprised that my skin started looking younger and firmer again. It is an incredible product. All the women in my family use it. I use this cream as a day cream as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a good bit of research on copper peptides and Neutrogena has such a great track record with their products, I decided to try this cream.  I no longer find this on retail shelves, so I must purchase online.  It took approximately 21 days to really see the serious results.  The circle of tiny but deep clogged pores, came to the surface, dried up and disappeared. Lines around my eyes have disappeared, facial labial folds (nose to edges of mouth)are softened and smooth, as are the areas right and left of my chin, which is visibly firmer.I often go without makeup,using only moisture cream (Neutrogena firming, and a bit of mascara.  People have commented on my skin and that I \\&quot;glow.\\&quot;  There are other more expensive products, by Osmotics, however until this supply is exhausted, I will stick with Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> this product works great.. my fine lines have decreased quite a bit in just two weeks. my face feels more hydrated and smooth.. i use this product at nite and the i use ponds hydrating during the day.. and my face has never felt so smooth and look so vibrant.. i will definately continue to use this as my night cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  About 7 years ago an article in a beauty magazine rated this one of the two best on the market (the other one was an Avon product).  Copper is the ingredient that makes it so good.  I&#x27;m sure that in the last 7 years more products have come on the market that are pretty good, but I&#x27;m sticking to this one as long as I can find it.  The price would be exponentially greater too!  The internet is the only place I can find it right now.</li>
    <li> This product has been working for me....but it does cause minor breakouts on my face.......it works great on the  neck area.....</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t know why they would discontinue this product.  When applied it absorbs into the skin within a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like a grease ball.</li>
    <li> Discontinued item and my pet peeve is sellers take advantage of that fact....</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I saw that this could be purchased on Amazon as I have been unable to find it anywhere else. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is one of the few products that does not turn my face red. Plus, it actually does what it says not to mention my pores disappear and my skin is so soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this night creme.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and goes on smoothly.  I really notice a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s a must if you&#x27;re over 50.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin feel smoother and I swear it&#x27;s evening out my skin tone. It has helped a lot with the circles under my eyes, both the puffiness and the discoloration. I had a little red spot right under my eye, a broken capillary, and NOTHING has ever helped it. But this stuff is making it fade. It&#x27;s awesome!! I cannot say enough how much I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for my 59 year old skin. It softens so nicely and I get many comments about my youthful looking skin. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy and feels really nice. I bought 5 jars just in case the product changes. I love Neutrogena products...great prices, good results and I have used many expensive department store product lines and this beats them all in my opinion.</li>
    <li> First of all, please note that I am almost 61 years young.  This past year was extremely stressful and I noticed a fourth frown line appear.  My frown lines were very deep.  Note, WERE.  I have tried MANY products to reduce fine lines and fade aging spots to no avail.  So I got serious about researching ingredients that work. I am blessed with good skin, but the frown lines really aged me.  Then I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Firm Night Cream.  I call it BLUE MAGIC!! I am truly amazed!  I&#x27;m still on my first jar and my frown lines are minimal now.  My two quarter sized brown spots are GONE!! Any fine lines around my mouth and eyes are GONE!! My skin is very soft and translucent--I use no foundation now, only mineral blush.  I&#x27;ve been mistaken for my 41 year old daughter&#x27;s sister several times now. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t do before and after photos, because nobody would believe it! There are only a few products with this ingredient, and Neutrogena&#x27;s is by far the least expensive. I have sensitive skin and had no problem.  I only put it on at night.  Started putting it on my neck, too.  Also, GREAT on the back of your hands!  Seriously, if you want to keep your skincare routine minimal, this product needs to be at the top of your list! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Neutrogena product for several months (Love, love, love it) and was bummed when they stopped carrying it. Then I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The first order was fine. The next order I received was totally fake, the wrong color, texture, and odor. It should be a blueish color, very creamy, and a nice subtle odor. Be careful. It took over a month to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I have been using Visibly Firm for ages.  Since i have very sensitive skin, I know that I can trust Neutrogena products.  However, I alternate this cream with a very mild Retin A cream called Avene.  With both I start with a serum underneath.  The Neutrogena has a really nice feel.  I always get loads of compliments on my skin and I&#x27;m pretty vigilant about morning and night cleansing and using good, gentle products.  I was a little shocked by the $99 sticker price since I remember paying a lot less in the past.  But I feel strongly that it&#x27;s important not to skimp on quality skin care products.</li>
    <li> My wife use this product and sometimes is not easy find it in local stores. We were very gladly to find it in Amazon. The seller had a good price and delivery was faster than expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The first reviewer recommends looking up copper peptides and mmp-2. I did. There were 3 clinical studies that show copper peptides INHIBIT production of mmps, the exact opposite of what the reviewer claims. Other than those three references, I found dozens of identical reviews posted on every imaginable site. Whoever this person is, he/she is clearly attempting to discredit Neutrogena. I love this product. Two weeks after I started using it my husband commented on how much better my skin was looking.</li>
    <li> 34 y/o male, bought this for discoloration and sagging under eyes, it actually worked in 3 days of use.  I&#x27;m in shock, as I expected minimal effects - instead, I have gotten noticeable results.  Wow, what a great product.  I hope it keeps getting better, but even if it just stays this good, I will be happy!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for approximately a week and have already seen a reduction in the puffiness under one eye that nothing else seemed to help, and also smoother skin.  I&#x27;ve used Retin-A for years (and still do), but this product is a great addition to my regimen.  Like another reviewer, I researched information on Copper Peptides and found that they are restorative/an aid in healing.  If my initial results continue, I will make this product a permanent part of my routine.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream!  My face soaks it up and appears so good the next morning.  Many retailers have discontinued stocking this item, so am glad to have finally found a retailer selling it.  Great price point, great value, great results!!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money! I have used it every night for several weeks and cannot see any visible difference in skin firmness.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for year and love the way my skin feels. I don&#x27;t have to us anything else at night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and just love it, although it has been discontinued in the stores where I usually buy it here in Nashville I will keep trying to order it online.  I had great luck with my ordering from this  company on this item.  Would order again from them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a month - I don&#x27;t really notice any firming though it is a good moisturizer - but I could get the same results with some Avon at 1/3 the price. At least it smells good :)</li>
    <li> My skin seems to be better than before - better tone, wrinkles may be a bit less too. Goes on well. Smells nice ... I use it almost every night.</li>
    <li> Ihave never written a reveiw before but this product is so good, and I have paid so much more for other products that didn&#x27;t come close to the quality of this one, that I felt I had to write.  This is the preferred brand of dermatologists to use for themselves, and after using this I can really understand that - I have very fair skin and thought I would somehow, magically tan when I was younger.  All I have are some 40ish crows feet and wrinkles and some discoloration to show for all that time in the sun.  There is a genuine visible difference in my skin since I began using this product.  I have used it for 6 weeks and yes, the lines are reduced and my skin looks younger.  I am really pleased, I am not one to go on about something, but his one really is a get what they say you will get.  Is it botox, nope, but it has put my wonderings about using botox to rest for a while it has made such a difference.</li>
    <li> I love most Neutrogena products (adore the tinted ones) but did not like the feel of this one initially (did not seem silky)so I pitched it into the trash.  Retrieved it later and used it a couple more days and noticed that my face does look plumper and moist.  It&#x27;s a thick cream that forms a nice barrier on the skin.  Skin does look better and fuller and I&#x27;m using it daytime and nightime now, but I cannot undo the two-star rating or I would now give it a five.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin at all. I used the whole bottle and will not order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I think of it as a facelift in a jar -- at a price that&#x27;s not in the stratosphere.</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old man and was very pleased with this product. It is not a miracle lotion at all - I didn&#x27;t see any difference as far as dark spots or wrinkles etc, but my face was feeling better the next day. It def makes it softer with a nice smell. I have always had Acne problems and I am always a little scared to try a new product, but I had no problems with this one.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed using this but cannot find it any longer or if I do it&#x27;s very expensive!</li>
    <li> I am so bummed that I can&#x27;t use this product anymore. It really made my skin noticeably firmer and so nice and soft, but it seemed to be causing breakouts for me. The breakouts subsided when I switched to another night cream, but the new one doesn&#x27;t even compare to the Neutrogena in terms of making my skin appear more youthful.    ....Actually sitting here, I think I will give the Neutrogena one more chance because it worked so well despite the breakouts.  Maybe my skin just needs to adjust to it, so I&#x27;ll report back and let you know.    ******July 2009  I had to give up on the Neutrogena.  It was causing breakouts, and it stung, too, but I would still recommend this if acne and stinging aren&#x27;t a problem for you because the antiaging benefits were great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this first about 4 years ago. At that time, it was only $16+. By mid-2011, it was already $19.99  And now??? $28 !!!  Neutrogena&#x27;s own website does not carry this product. Seems that it has been discontinued. If so, are those being offered here safe to use?</li>
    <li> This product RUINED my skin and my life! Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t tell you that the copper peptide activates enzymes called MMPs that break down collagen and elastin - but that is what it does! (These are the same enzymes that are activated by being out in the sun - they are what cause photoaging and elastosis!) I used this stuff for 3 weeks and my skin atrophied terribly, became very dry and wrinkled, with larger pores and loss of firmness. Additionally, I have numerous spider veins caused by this stuff - and an all-over red and yellow / brown discoloration. My skin was so fragile in places that it literally ripped apart - causing stretch mark like areas... It has been months since I stopped using it and there has been little improvement. I look like I have aged at least 10 years! I can&#x27;t believe Neutrogena would sell such a dangerous product! Look up the information on the internet - copper peptides and mmp-2 / mmp-9 - they break down collagen and elastin, and cause angiogenesis!!!</li>
    <li> You know, this stuff really works. I&#x27;m very suprised with the results given that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it. A few days of use and I can see and feel the difference. Very pleased. It&#x27;s CHEAP. Try it.</li>
    <li> Copper peptides are not an overnight cure.  With everyday use, as you age, you will see that the wrinkles just aren&#x27;t happening.  Collagen  is being rebuilt and your skin tone is firm and unwrinkled over time.  Not to look for the instant cure here, this is for mature women who want a long time wrinkle free appearance.  The result is worth the time and effort.  IT WORKS</li>
    <li> The anti-Neutrogena post cracks me up- aging is a process, and even stuff the really does age you like sun damage takes years. Nothing sold OTC, and certainly nothing Neutrogena makes, will make you look like the Cryptkeeper after 3 weeks. Anyway, I use this and the Visibly Firm serum, and even my dermatologist commented on how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> it agrees with my face... I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores or anything like that.  Its excellent.</li>
    <li> It was horrible. I ended up throwing it away. I have ordered this cream in the past and it is usually a light blue and this jar came and it looked like the cream had yellowed. I couldn&#x27;t find an experation date and it had an odd smell to it so I didn&#x27;t even want to put any of it on my face. Wish I had never made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Why did they stop selling this product in stores? It such a great face lotion. It is the ONLY thing that seems to smooth out the rapidly appearing wrinkles in my neck area. I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is non-irritating. It never leaves me splotchy or greasy, just smooth. When will companies learn to stop discontinuing their best products?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this very expensive  product for about 3 weeks and don&#x27;t know yet how well or if it is working.  It was suggested by my doctor that I try using it for a bruising condition that I have on my lower arms and hands</li>
    <li> This cream has been discontinued by the manufacturer for YEARS.... It also cost about $17.00-$20.00 when it was sold on drugstore shelves.</li>
    <li> I use this, at 63; my 90 year old aunt uses it, and my 67 year old cousin swears by it.  It is gentle and leaves older skin feeling smooth and soft.  My guess is, it works beautifully for young folks too -- but most things do.  We oldsters are the ones who really need the help!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS ITEM IN THE PAST.IT PRICE ON THIS IS AWFUL.THE EYE CREAM SALES FOR ALOT LESS AND SERVES THE SAME RESULTS.I FOUND THIS ON NEUTROGENA WEB AT A BETTER PRICE.</li>
    <li> Loved the lightweight feel and little-to-no-scent but on the pricey side --- not sure that effects were worth the higher price tag.  May come back to it.  As with all neutrogena products, has not a problem for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I Found this product heavy on the skin.      Have used it for a month now, and there is not the least changes of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and it is outstanding. Immediately after putting it on, my face felt hydrated and lost the uncomfortable tightness I have after removing my makeup at night. Now, rather than looking tired when I wake up in the mornings, I look refreshed and my face looks and feels very smooth.  In as little as two weeks, I have noticed the disappearance of some of the fine lines around my eyes.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works. Coming from a humid country, I never need major moisturizing, however the weather and hard water here has dried up my skin tremendously. I can see improvement, less patchy skin on my face in a week.     Reasonable price for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I do not think it worked. There was no difference after using it for about a month.</li>
    <li> I was using Visibly firm copper for years and loved it.. Now since it has been discontinued people are charging outrageous prices for it.. Was paying it for a while until I discovered that I got the same results from Neutrogena Healthy Skin Firming Cream SPF 15, 2.5 Ounce.. for only $10..</li>
    <li> This night cream has a weird smell about it.  It is almost a fragrance-y, dull aloe vera paste that goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it works but after using the whole jar I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well as a night cream but I&#x27;m still skeptical about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone to use other brands and other types of creams.</li>
    <li> Visibily firms around the eyes after one week of use.  This product is amazing.  I also had fine lines on my forehead and it reduced the appearance of wrinkles on my skin.  Never had a product that has softened and smoothed my skin so much.  My husband noticed a difference right away!!! Would recommend this product to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the stuff!  I had to search near and wide to find it and especially at a good price.</li>
    <li> Made my face break out really bad, &amp; I use peels regularly.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Years ago my daughter gave me this cream as a present, and to be honest I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, because it was not Marcella Borghese, Lancome, etc, but I used ti anyway.My God what night cream !!! I have never. ever and probably never again would I be able to buy anything like it for what it used to cost. It was then $16.00 and the it went up to $18.00. Neutrogena knew they had a fantastic product on their hands and what did they do?.they raised the price to over $140.00 and it became prohibitive to buy and unfortunately my face has paid the price. I would advice any one who can afford this expensive cream TO GO AHEAD AND BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how much this cream surprised me! I expected 0 to minimal results and only after months of use. Instead I got big results after less than a day. Actually I&#x27;d merely opened the tube to smell it and already noticed looking noticeably younger. When I actually applied some on the following day however, is when the real miracle kicked in! First I was unable to purchase liquor despite being far past legal age. Furthermore I became bulked up, mightily! First question at work was if I had been taking steroids. Then I got the bittersweet news that I&#x27;d been fired because the boss couldn&#x27;t recognize me anymore. He told me get out of here kid this isn&#x27;t some bodybuilding show for teenagers! I had no idea that this 100% effective in every case cream also boosted muscle mass! I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but was happy that it had exceeded my expectations by so much, so getting fired wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I simply went home and started applying for the same types of jobs as when I was 20, plus some bodybuilding contests. Amazing product! Totally flawless, don&#x27;t listen to any review that as much as hints at anything but full praise for this great cream! The unhelpful raters for those who dare to are right to teach them to only praise this product, or else!</li>
    <li> I purchased this night cream because I read about the wonderful benefits of copper peptides and this cream has it in it.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin so I was a little hesitant about trying this because I usually break out when I put creams on my face. This does not break me out!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 6 months and I just love it! I really love the smell too! I put this on at night after I do a 20 minute session of my aurora sirius  LED red light therapy. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks fabulous! It&#x27;s tight and firm, my fine lines are drastically reduced and my skin is so soft! I really love this stuff and will be purchasing it again!</li>
