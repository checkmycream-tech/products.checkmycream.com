<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wears, travels and smells great - layers well and is SPF 70!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with a solid SPF sunscreen stick! It goes on a lot better than the gooey lotions I have used in the past. And Johnson &amp; Johnson is a name that I have trusted ever since my first child was born, almost 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt; I think the SPF 70 is a little much, since I think after a certain much lower number it is all your skin needs anyway so I would not make the purchase purely on the SPF number.&lt;br /&gt; Neutrogena is a great skin conditioning brand name, another I trust a lot.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stick is the answer to everything I ever hated about sunscreen. Don&#x27;t like spending ages and ages rubbing white paste into your skin? Just swipe this over your skin! Don&#x27;t like the white residue on your clothes that manages to appear every time you use said white paste? This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave residue even if you accidentally swipe your shirt sleeve with it. Don&#x27;t like feeling and looking like you&#x27;ve poured glue all over your arms when it&#x27;s soaked in (or the red bumps you, or at least I, get even if the stuff is supposedly good for sensitive skin)? Enjoy your sunscreen-wearing but still normal-looking skin! Don&#x27;t like the cloying tropical scents that usually come with sunscreen? Enjoy a light, pleasant citrus fragrance that goes with whatever else you&#x27;re wearing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint: It&#x27;s really, really hard to tell if you&#x27;ve covered an area properly, because it goes on sheer and stays sheer and just kind of sits on the surface (although it&#x27;s either gone or soaked in now, after an hour or two). I know that if there was residue or a bunch of pasty sunscreen glop to rub in, I&#x27;d be even more annoyed, but I&#x27;m doing my best to keep my skin from frying, and it would be nice if there was some way I could tell whether or not I&#x27;d applied sunscreen before I run out the door.</li>
    <li> A very convenient, no-mess way to apply sunscreen. Hard to tell where you&#x27;ve applied it, so pay attention to avoid embarrassing streaks.</li>
    <li> Took it on a trip to Peru, worked really well! Rolls on clear, no chance of it leaking in your bag, and I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn :)</li>
    <li> this is my absolute favorite sunscreen. All the others feel greasy, funny, oily when you put them on. This doesn&#x27;t. As a redhaired, freckled male with light skin, I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds. For your face, this is great! works on arms, etc, too.</li>
    <li> This is pricey stuff, but is literally &amp;#34;the best money can buy.&amp;#34; I use it for quick application while sailing on the San Francisco Bay, when I just have a few seconds to reapply and want to make sure I don&#x27;t get greasy hands, sunglasses, etc. If you&#x27;re looking for the best, this is it.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars. It provides really effective coverage where you manage to put it; however, takes some practice to apply -- since it goes on clear, you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;re covered and where you&#x27;re not. (That said, the stripes I got first-day-out provide good contrast to show just how well it protects!) Be meticulous, overlap more than you think you should, and enjoy taking your lily-white skin to the tropics!&lt;br /&gt;Not quite a perfect product, but very close: rounded up to 5 stars because it&#x27;s carry-on friendly.</li>
    <li> Great sheer sunscreen for trip to Caribbean!</li>
    <li> so much larger than I expected - kinda like a mini deoderant - so cool</li>
    <li> I love everything about this sunscreen but smell. It is not unpleasant but I wish it was fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This is great. I like it a lot, no mess and don&#x27;t need to clean my hands before applying, especially with my toddler because she hates any cream being applied on her face. I really wish all sunscreens came in a stick form.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried sunscreen in stick form. First, it was easy to travel with - through airports and internationally. No leaks, no spills - my daughter and I both carried one. Next, it fit right in my purse so I always had it. It also has a great fragrance. This sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy at all and is simple to apply. I&#x27;m really paranoid when it comes to sun exposure, but I felt confident using this one.</li>
    <li> Good  item  !  no  creamy  white  on face  ,  no  sticky .</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, non-greasy and long-lasting. I especially use it to protect my tattoo from fading, and after three years the colors on it are still vibrant.</li>
    <li> Perfect for your face.  Lightweight and non greasy. It&#x27;s my go to sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> Quality, effective sun protection in a convenient package. Very portable.</li>
    <li> This us the absolute best product to cover larg tatoos quickly and effectivly u can see the applications spots I go tanning in tanning bed and was so happy to see the larger width this is the best price I&#x27;ve found in stores!?</li>
    <li> My kids much prefer putting on block sunscreen than &amp;#34;cold and squishy&amp;#34; traditional sunscreen. It is faster too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s like that it doesn&#x27;t make their faces white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy for me to apply quick before I go outside to exercise. Or put on my husband fast before he starts mowing the lawn or gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen block can fall out of the container if you twist it up too high and it gets hot. Just to be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. So easy to use and carry.  Feels like an expensive face cream not like any ordinary sun screen. Son protection is excellent.  Use on back of hands also to avoid sun spots.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, smell is bearable not overpowering at all, doesn&#x27;t leave skin discolored goes on pretty transparently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  sort of difficult to apply- I liked the idea of a solid stick because of mobility, but on certain areas of the face or body it&#x27;s impossible to apply in a way that feels like you&#x27;re fully covered and with sunscreen is there any real way to tell until after the sunburn lol.</li>
    <li> I was slightly doubtful of this product at first, but on my most recent beach vacation it proved to work well (as I had stripes on my stomach from poor application). It is slightly greasy, but less than a traditional liquid suncreen. Bonus that your hands aren&#x27;t covered in goo after putting it on! At the beach it got very gross with sand, but you can just wipe it off.  I&#x27;m sure I looked like an insane person wiping deodorant all over my body!</li>
    <li> I love that this gives good sun protection, and isn&#x27;t greasy or smelly.  Great for little faces and doesn&#x27;t make a mess!!!!  For my purposes, it works perfectly.  However, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because my 4-year-old appears to be allergic to something in this product.  She&#x27;s never broken out from a sunscreen before, but this one gave her a fine rash everywhere it touched.  I&#x27;ll keep it for my other two, but will need to go back to our old stick or find something new for my little one.  Not sure what about this would cause such a reaction, but two days later and she&#x27;s still got an allergic rash over her face. :-(</li>
    <li> I keep these in my purse and car to have handy.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and is compact, making it easy to store in my purse for those spur of the moment trips to the park.  It glides on super easy and no sunburn!  I like it better than the spray on stuff.  The spray has to be rubbed in after you&#x27;ve applied it and then I have greasy hands.  I also despise having the sunscreen on my hands because I have a lot of allergies and almost inevitably end up rubbing my ever itching eyes, and then my eyes are not only itching, but burning!!  With this stick, I don&#x27;t have to rub it in, so my hands remain grease-free and my eyes remain burn-free and red-free.</li>
    <li> Bought this to avoid having to spray my hands with sunscreen and then rub it all over my toddler&#x27;s face. This works well, has prevented burns so far. The only problem is it goes on clear so I can&#x27;t tell where I&#x27;ve applied it to a wriggly 3yr old. I probably go over the same spot over and over. I&#x27;ve started applying it and then using my hands to rub it in to ensure complete coverage. If you&#x27;re applying it to yourself, you probably don&#x27;t have this problem. It&#x27;s much easier to get on the face and neck than the spray stuff and much less mess.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this sunscreen. I live in South Florida and I&#x27;m in the sun a lot. I use this mainly when I go out on my boat for the whole day. I can tell where I have placed the sun screen so I don&#x27;t have any surprises later that evening. It feels light on my face and is small/light enough to go in a pocket so you can reapply when you want. I can only find this online. So if your looking for a convenient to use sunscreen I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen stick. It goes on clear, goes on smoothly and does not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> I used to have a 1 ounce size tube of [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen]] that was handy for keeping in my purse. I reapply often on the backs of my hands because I had... ummm... freckles removed. If I don&#x27;t apply sunscreen, they&#x27;ll just return. This product is the closest in size that I could find. It&#x27;s not the Dry Touch sunscreen, so it&#x27;s not an exact replica. But it&#x27;s easy to apply (at a red light if I forget!) and the size I was looking for, so I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;m a little afraid it will melt if I leave it in my car on hot days, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Used this in Antigua and it kept us from getting burned.  We were usually out in the sun for a couple hours at a time.</li>
    <li> This is so handy to have in a purse , beach bag, ect. I bought this for my trip to Hawaii and it work well for my trip. I am going on a round the world trip this year and will be needing sold sun block. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like about this sunblock was because it wasn&#x27;t water proof and I&#x27;m going to purchase [[ASIN:B00HNSSV0S Neutrogena Sunscreen Beach Defense Stick SPF 50, 1.5 Ounce]] over this one because it dose have 80 minutes of swimming or sweating resistants and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> ONLY SUNSCREEN STICK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT, I PROMISE!!  I HAVE A BALD HEAD AND A LITTLE GIRL IT WORKS FOR BOTH OF US PERFECT AND BELIEVE ME I&#x27;VE TRIED THEM ALL.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, nice scent, live it:))))</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s so much more pleasant to put on the kids and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my hands sticky.  The consistency is just as nice as the liquid but way more convenient.</li>
    <li> The stick is the way to go for us fishing and do not want on hands.  Because of this convenience  I apply more often .</li>
    <li> Nice sheer sunblock. Wide stick makes it easy to apply all over. Solid form makes it great for carrying in bags, without worrying about spilling. My son likes to put it on in the morning, no fights.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know were these people are getting this has a smell to it,this does not smell at all. Please don&#x27;t avoid buying this because people say it smells. I put some on my upper arm to test first,no smell and no waxy feeling,just kind of melted into my skin,but I did one swipe. Invisible on skin. You should at least try it.</li>
    <li> Works great on hairy arms.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on but for some reason I got a sunburn right through it.&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing it sight seeing. It was hot so a little bit of glistening happening . But really? A red nose?? I reapplied every 2ish hours.&lt;br /&gt;Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased from drug store &amp; prefer this over other SF products for face because of the sheerness, no issues with causing breakouts, nor has it caused any clothes staining. I can apply my light makeup over it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t roll or pill up.</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue feeling on your face and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> very pratical and eficient</li>
    <li> So much easier than liquid.  Stays on much better, even through sweat.</li>
    <li> Best ever ! CERO grease face ! full protection</li>
    <li> The stick is too hard.  Both of my children hate it.  It&#x27;s easier to just use a lotion type sunblock for their face.</li>
    <li> easy to use but to too oily</li>
    <li> Super easy application, but really oily :P</li>
    <li> Be careful with the Oxybenzone (3%) in this sunscreen, especially for girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone can act like estrogen in the body and alter sperm production in animals. It&#x27;s also associated with endometriosis in women.</li>
    <li> great for on the go for kids</li>
    <li> So much easier then the white stuff on my face...every morning it goes on, then makeup if I want.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It goes on to your skin very lightly but I can see where I&#x27;ve placed it because of the shimmer. Exactly as described, although smaller then I would have thought.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST BEST BEST BEST sunblock stick out there, I&#x27;m stocking up! NOT sticky Not slimy and small for your purse and easy for kids to do.</li>
    <li> Much like other Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen, this one resulted in a very bad recurring rash on my young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This product listing doesn&#x27;t share the tube versions plethora of one star rash reviews, but the results for my girl was the same. DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. Don&#x27;&#x27;t buy at all actually.</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on, but does not seem to last as long as their other products.</li>
    <li> Convenient, easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Worked very well in Costa Rica and Panama where this sun is bright and hot!  Did not seem to stain clothing either.  Will look for it in lotion form.</li>
    <li> Really good sunscreen to take on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Great protection for fair skin peoples.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to apply and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic.  I have lupus and it gives me great coverage, especially on my face.</li>
    <li> It rolls on nicely without leaving too much of a waxy or greasy feel. But the smell is very strong to me. It&#x27;s heavily perfumed to mask the sunscreen smell. It&#x27;s like wearing perfume. I don&#x27;t wear perfume so I don&#x27;t care for it. I imagine a lot of women would like the smell, but I just don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Oily. Not recommended for oily skin</li>
    <li> Works well, but difficult to tell where the product has been applied.  Ended up with strips of sunburn after the first day of vacation, then spent the rest of the trip obsessively covering myself with what looks like deodorant.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I am sure I will.  Ilive in Arizona, where the sun shines brightly ober 300 days per year.  ;-)</li>
    <li> It is the size and consistency that I wanted to keep in my handbag for times I needed sunscreen--it goes on smoothly and is not greasy--no mess in my handbag.</li>
    <li> Great for travel given limits on liquids and gels.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective. I keep in the car for quick use as it can be applied without getting your hands slippery.</li>
    <li> As someone who frequently gets sunburnt, I use this on my face and the kids faces. Since it&#x27;s not messy, I keep it in my purse to have available at all times.</li>
    <li> I love that it goes on clear, no need to rub in.  My kids can apply this to themselves.</li>
    <li> Love it. Unlike other reviewers, I think it goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been having extremely hot weather here and I went to a farmers market Saturday, it got extremely hot and we couldn&#x27;t find shade during lunch, I could feel all the sun on my bare arms and was sure I was getting a burn. To my surprise I didn&#x27;t get any. Great product. I do rub it in a little after applying from the roller.</li>
    <li> Used this ony face and my children.  I reapplied after an hour while at the beach, and made sure to get noses very well.  One child got an ugly sunburn on her nose.  The stick makes it very hard to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten every place possible.  On your own face, yes, easy to know as you can feel it.  Applying on someone else, nearly impossible.  In addition to that, I put this on areas I got burned while snorkeling.  I reapplied before recommended time, and it did nothing to protect the already burned area.  I will not trust this on a other beach trip.</li>
    <li> Not greasy or sticky and does not leave residue on skin!</li>
    <li> my kids love it. me, not so much -- they like that it&#x27;s sheer and nobody will see it!  they do their own and i can do a touch-test to see where they missed.</li>
    <li> My three year old is very fair skinned, and she also hates the goopy, greasy sensation of sunscreen.  This sunscreen stick glides on very sheer and provides excellent protection.  It has a faint but pleasing smell.  This excellent product has made the application of sunscreen much less problematic in our house.</li>
    <li> This stuff is beeswax-based and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin, unlike the liquid Ultra Sheer formula. It feels super emollient when applied but soaks in extremely quickly and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. My face has a very slight sheen (less than I would get from a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; foundation) and is a bit tacky up to ten minutes after application (read: a makeup brush will drag slightly), but with a light dusting of powder it&#x27;s impossible to tell I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
    <li> Great!  and you can take as many as you want on the airplane as it is not a liquid!</li>
    <li> Worked really well and the stick makes it an easy application for the face.</li>
    <li> This is a great traveler! Glides on smoothly; only slightly miss the liquid for hands &amp; face.  It is no mess &amp; is a solid, so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about spills. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Much better than the traditional lotions and not sticky feeling like those lotions!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I absolutely hate the feel of greasy sunblock. This is great to put in your purse and take with you because it&#x27;s not messy and won&#x27;t leak in your bag. Having said that, it seems I missed a few spots and got a little pink. So now when I&#x27;m outside a lot I use a greasy lotion sunscreen before I leave the house or hotel since I can wash my hands. Then I use this stick as a touch-up since it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
    <li> great product works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Was really optimistic about this product because I HATE having greasy hands after applying sunscreen. I brought this on our 2-week vacation in the Bahamas and after just a couple days I ended up switching back to the regular Neutrogena sunscreen that gets rubbed in. Unless you rub it in, this stuff leaves a greasy feeling on your skin and I found that if you are reapplying every few hours it starts building up into this greasy layer that feels vaseline. (Eeewww) Kind of defeats the purpose of having a &amp;#34;no hands&amp;#34; applicator.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use the stick than cream or spray - I use it on my forehead and it doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes as much when sweating.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 years and I love how it makes my skin feel and I carry it in my handbag. I got it to protect my hands and arms when I drive. The sun was doing a number on my arms and this really helps and I always forget to apply before leaving the house, so there it is in my handbag ready to go and no lotion or gel to apply</li>
    <li> Goes on easily without a mess!!! I live in Southern California and am happy to have a convenient sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  Goes on very easy and seems to do a good job protecting against a burn.  The only drawback is that it feels a bit waxy on the skin.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I live in SoCal and I use this on my tattoos. Easy application, goes on clear, not greasy-- it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Really easy to apply, no smell, works well!</li>
    <li> Lives up to its name: sheer, non-greasy, glides on easily, and provides excellent protection.</li>
    <li> Nice and not too greasy!</li>
    <li> Great even on your lips</li>
    <li> good, my only issue is that the smell is some strong</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect purse-size.  I find I wear it more often than any other sunscreen because it applies easily, doesn&#x27;t really need to be rubbed in much, and doesn&#x27;t junk up my hands.</li>
    <li> Yes, it looks like an underarm deodorant.  They have taken a very strong sunscreen and somehow put it in the same type of stuff they use for deodorants.  The problem is that it is very hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; (as in &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; I mean it is very hard and does not apply well when you rub it on your skin...it does not put much product on you easily) very well.  Also, the problem with it being clear is that you can&#x27;t tell where you have just put it, so you still need to rub it around, and because very little of it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; on your skin it is still hard to tell where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Thinkbaby SPF50, the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen and this one to compare.  I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;It did not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF of 70.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well because it is made like an underarm deodorant&lt;br /&gt;The cap is poorly designed and you have to make sure that you roll it back down into the applicator or the lid will not go on.&lt;br /&gt;It is too sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF 110&lt;br /&gt;You can see where you put it&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be effective&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It blends well with face cream, which makes it go on better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something for you face, it is very very thick&lt;br /&gt;It is very white and you have to really blend it&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin shiny; but if you are wearing it under makeup and powder, you won&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clog my pores and break me out a little&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive for how much you get; it will not last long&lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it will a little face cream, but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It does not clog my pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too thick and dries too quickly like the other one, so you need more&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend well with face cream or other lotions&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too expensive&lt;br /&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to purchase any of these again.

    <li> So easy to use - I could quickly apply with no fuss, no mess.  No concern with the sunscreen getting into my eyes.  The sunscreen is light and did not clog up my sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> My Brother loves this sunscreen, it goes on fast and is not greasy</li>
    <li> Purchased this in hope of leaving it in my car for everyday use, I had read a few replies here stating it maintains its consistency even if left in say your glove compartment. The Sheer stick does melt a bit but remained useable, the downside of this sheer stick even when its cool is that it doesn&#x27;t work so good for men with arms hair. I tried it as soon as I got it and it would bunch up on arm hair and pull it off. I would then have to use my hand to rub it on defeating the purpose of using the sheer stick to apply for a no mess feeling.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to the spray options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids are very good at putting this on themselves too.  It is clean, easy to apply and offers very good sun protection.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on the skin. Has a gentle scent when compared to other sunscreens. It works well if you&#x27;ll be outside for a short time. Recently used it during a 4 hour hike and got burned beyond belief - even after reapplying half way through the hike. I&#x27;ll be going back the the SPF 55 Ultra Sheer lotion if I plan on spending any extended time outside. It doesn&#x27;t go on as lightly, but I&#x27;ve never been burned using that stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for winter activities.  The whole family is much more likely to reapply with this stick than to take off our mittens to apply a lotion sunscreen.  It is sturdy enough to toss in my backpack or jacket pocket when we sled, ski, or snowboard.  It is thick enough for full coverage, but it still has the lovely sheer, light quality of any Neutrogena product.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, does the job well.</li>
    <li> This is a little greasy but great when you are on the go and don&#x27;t want greasy hands from re-applying sunscreen. It&#x27;s nice and small too and tucks away neatly in your purse or diaper bag.</li>
    <li> Too slimy after applied.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen. I hate putting on ss and so do my kids, but this makes it so much more bearable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Easy to apply and lasts for awhile.  Does appear slightly greasy when worn.</li>
    <li> Ever since my mom was diagnosed with melanoma I&#x27;ve been diligent about wearing sunscreen daily for both myself and my son. I&#x27;ve tried virtually every form of sunscreen out there and this is the only one so far that my 7 year old son doesn&#x27;t give me grief about when applying. He can&#x27;t stand the lotions or the sprays, especially when it comes to his face and anyway near his eyes. It&#x27;s been exhausting and time-consuming to say the least. I relied on the stick sunscreens before but it was really hard to get good coverage because of how small they are. The wide stick is so much better and super easy to get everything covered. No problems with his sensitive skin either. It&#x27;s a little pricey but so worth it. I keep one at home, one in my purse and one in my son&#x27;s backpack so it&#x27;s always available. It&#x27;s not overly greasy and I like not having to get my hands yucked up when we&#x27;re out and about.</li>
    <li> Great invention - why no one thought of this before is beyond me. Great coverage, no mess. A bit on the expensive side but worth it. Neutrogena products are always good.</li>
    <li> This is a brilliant product.  Living in Florida, I have the need to reapply sunscreen several times when I am out for the day.  I tried it with liquid sunscreen with the expected results: sunscreen all over my clothing.  This doesn&#x27;t melt, goes on easily, and protects my very fair and sensitive skin from the sun&#x27;s rays (even in the car through the windshield).  In addition, it is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Neutrogena!!!</li>
    <li> Very eay to use it..... Good.</li>
    <li> Love the roll on so it doesn&#x27;t get my hands dirty when we are out and about. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pretty costly for the amount you get, but the ease of application makes this a favorite with me and the grandkids.</li>
    <li> Not sure what kind of magic this is. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena sunblock for years and always thought the dry-touch cream was great. How it manages to be effective but not greasy. Well that stuff feels like Vaseline compared to this. It&#x27;s like a solid deodorant - it goes on feeling completely dry, maybe just the tinest bit waxy on delicate skin like decollete.  But it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel cakey or like your skin can&#x27;t breathe. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take on vacation.  Never burned using it so it did what I wanted it to do.  Was easy and quick to apply.  The reason for 4 not 5 stars is that if you push it up too much, it sticks to the top when you put it back on, then when removing it the product gets pulled apart and kind of makes a mess.  The top should be rounded like deodorant tops, then maybe you could leave the product sticking up when you put the top on.</li>
    <li> I have to wear sunscreen every day.&lt;br /&gt;A fair warning: I put this on first thing in the morning so it has time to soak in before I do my makeup since the formula is a bit thick. So long as I wait about 20 minutes before I do my makeup, I don&#x27;t have an issue but if I do it too soon it is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love this product! It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;I keep an extra one in my purse, so I&#x27;m sure I look like a crazy lady when I put it on in public since it looks like a deodorant stick. I&#x27;ll get the last laugh though because I&#x27;ll still look great when I&#x27;m 80!</li>
    <li> Perfect. It doenst runt into your eyes.</li>
    <li> very Handy and good sunblock it doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky or oily like other brand , and the size is good to keep it in your bag</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably one of the laziest person out there, so when I found out there was a sunblock stick, that made my day! Not too much of a scent, which is good, because I have a sensitive nose. Like it says, it&#x27;s sheer, so you don&#x27;t need to do any extra work to rub the color away. I bought two more of these for my mom, and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> this works well.  it travels well and goes on clear.  it&#x27;s not greasy.  our daughter hates the spray sunscreen.  this makes an excellent alternative.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen for my face that doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes at any point in the day. I love that it is truly sheer (no white residue) and I have no problems breaking out. For years I have meant to wear sunscreen on my face every day but had to many issues with it getting in my eyes, looking greasy if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, etc. For the first time, I have actually started wearing sunscreen on my face, neck, and hands daily because it fits all my needs!</li>
    <li> I am so very glad to have found this sunblock. I am 31 years old and have been looking for the right sunblock for 15+ years. I have very sensitive, fair skin. I also recently had a baby, so the horomones tend to make your skin more sensitive. This stick is a heaven sent. It applies easily, soaks in without any residue, has no smell, and works for a long time. I just returned from a cruise. I would apply first thing in the morning and one more time midday on both my face and body. I never got burned the entire 5 day cruise. I did use 2 sticks during the cruise as it goes fast when using it for your whole body. My advice is to overlap the application and put it everywhere to ensure no burning. This is going to be my go-to sunblock and I am so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I throw it in my golf bag and it doesn&#x27;t melt. It works great and it&#x27;s not messy. I just hold it and spread it on my arms, face, and neck. It applies easy enough, not sticky or runny. Pleasant smell, not feminine smelling.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than expensive spray</li>
    <li> Easy to use on face to protect against too much sun.</li>
    <li> Great to use on the face! Doesn&#x27;t run sunscreen in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. Neutropenia is known for good products!</li>
    <li> i love this product for me for the beach.  a little too thick and greasy for everyday wear... but the beach protection is unbeatable</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 weeks as a deodorant before I realized something was wrong. I smelled like a goat every day but I began to notice that my armpits were not getting tan like the rest of my body as I prepared myself for the nude beach in St Maarten. Much to my wife&#x27;s chagrin, I figured it out just in time and my armpits are now a golden tan and I smell like old spice again.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the smaller sized facial stick that had a light scent to apply to my face. This was the only alternative but I&#x27;ve always trusted Neutrogena products because they are good for people with sensitive skin. My skin reacted quite badly to this product; face and arms became quite red and flushed. Product was applied before going out into cool, somewhat cloudy weather. I would not recommend this product if you have any sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> Light weight and has a very light citronella smell. Great to keep in my backpack for the family.</li>
    <li> a convenient way to have sunscreen whenever and wherever you need it. and no mess, that&#x27;s the best part! you don&#x27;t get it on your hands! yay!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank you.  A+++++</li>
    <li> I have very light skin.  Usually, I burn through my clothes.  A neighbor is a nurse and recommended this product.  I purchased and began using right away.  I have shared my skin solutions with others and actually shared at the beach.</li>
    <li> I got this after my friend let me use hers. I think this item would be really great to use for photo occasions because it doesn&#x27;t have the white tint that all the other sunblocks have. It goes on completely sheer and it kind of feels like a layer of wax over your face. I feel very protected with the SPF70. I&#x27;m getting to me later 20s and I think it&#x27;s getting more and more important to protect your skin from the sun. This does a great job, although it is slightly pricey compared to your general coppertone, etc. I think I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Super easy and convenient. No sun burns!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived open and previously used!  Nice going!</li>
    <li> Great to quickly use on arms &amp; face, especially the golf course</li>
    <li> Can be effectively applied without getting your palms messy. And nice light weight sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life? I can&#x27;t say enough about the TEXTURE of this sunscreen.  It is perfect for me.  It&#x27;s easier to apply than anything else i have ever tried.  I can even put it on my forehead (other products melted down into my eyes, causing terrible burning).  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.</li>
    <li> This handy deodorant-style stick of high SPF sunscreen is great for small areas like faces and necks. It&#x27;s a little harder to use on a bigger area, as if you miss something you end up with pink stripes. It&#x27;s clear, mildly scented, and barely sticky. My partner liked it very much compared to creams and oils. I found it a very useful supplement to my sunscreen cream.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen for my face. It doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes, it is in a stick form so it&#x27;s easy to smear on your face and really protects. Never gotten burned wearing this product. My derm. recommended this brand as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreen. It feels good to the skin, doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor and more importantly, keeps me from getting sunburned regularly. The applicator is like a stick deodorant, which makes it easier to apply and more importantly, fits in your travel carry-on bag. The price is the only thing I really gripe about, but it&#x27;s convenient and I feel like this lasts for a while.</li>
