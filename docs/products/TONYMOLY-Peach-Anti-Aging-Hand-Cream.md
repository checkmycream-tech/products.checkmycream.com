<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> smells very good!&lt;br /&gt;I love the peach smell!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
    <li> Very strong smell. Overall a good one for the price. Nice packaging as well. Perfect for a cute present.</li>
    <li> Smells delish...let&#x27;s hope i don&#x27;t eat my hand off! :D</li>
    <li> Cant get enough From the smell and the softness of it&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING , It will give you a soft hand with out a greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;repurchase in the future</li>
    <li> This thing smells delicious, but I had it sitting on top of the desk at work and one of my coworkers that it looked like a lady lump… you know what I mean? A boob. Can I say boob? I don&#x27;t mean any offense, apparently this just has that kind of shape at a distance.</li>
    <li> The cute jar automatically captured my heart when I saw it and honestly I was doubtful but it smelled exactly like peaches, extremely nice and the cream is a light pink shade. The only complaint I had was after an hour of putting it on my hands, they began to smell kind of funny though aside from that it&#x27;s a nice product and I would definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Dries fast... leading to apply more in another while later on. Overall, love the smell, hopefully the anti-aging agents are true. Tonymoly is a good product line, so here&#x27;s hoping. Cute compact design!</li>
    <li> My hands, naturally, are extremely rough, for no apparent reason. I used all types of lotions and things to soften them but this hand cream didn&#x27;t make them baby soft but some of my rough patches are starting to fade and become a little softer. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but I&#x27;m fairly impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought them lotion and I absolutely love it. The scent is so luscious that it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing an actual peach on my hands. The packaging is adorable and the product itself makes my hands super soft. I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> I received something similar to this but just in different packaging. I honestly love this hand cream and it smells like peach!&lt;br /&gt;I made a video review of this so I will put the link here :D&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/I-IO9XTJZ_Y</li>
    <li> I use a lot of hand cream since the soap at work is very drying. TonyMoly&#x27;s peach anti-aging hand cream is wonderful because not only does it look adorable on my desk (better than having various tubes or bottles about), but it smells amazing once you apply it and you only need a little bit at a time. It absorbs quickly and my hands feel so much better immediately, and they&#x27;re not slippery or tacky at all. Not sure about the anti-aging part, but my skin is not dry and my hands look fine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hand cream! It smells like a real peach and makes my hands feel great. I just started using it, but just for the smell it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells a little too sweet otherwise it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cute, it looks like a little nipple butt and smells like those Japanese Morinaga Hi-Chew candies. I really wish this was somehow edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and it also leaves my hands super soft and I just love it overall 100%&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> The sem is wornderful.</li>
    <li> I adore this cream. The shape of the box, the really beautiful smell of peach, the texture. I just wish it was more of it. I will be definitely restocking regularly.</li>
    <li> Love the peachy fragrance of this rich hand cream.  Wish it were less $. Do not purchase from elephant 24kg. It appears to be counterfeit and has no fragrance and product is pink!</li>
    <li> Adorable packaging, smells wonderful and is actually quite moisturizing! I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other scents!</li>
    <li> Although everyone had asked me if it was a nipple, it kept my hands moisturized and smelt very peachy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feel and scent. Just like peaches!</li>
    <li> My mom loves it, she told me that she felt tightening when she use it abd she is very pleased with scent. The down side is that my Mom likes to wash her hand when ever she needed to and lotion just fades away so she had to reapply it again...</li>
    <li> Smells Really good, cute packaging too!</li>
    <li> Pretty container. Non sticky, soft feel.nice aroma.</li>
    <li> I love this peach smell!!!! Although it did take longer than my expectation to receive it.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised at how thick the cream is. Smells delicious.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great!</li>
    <li> The expiration date is 2015 04 06 !!!! :(</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Works very well on my hands plus the smell is so great.</li>
    <li> this stuff did NOT smell like peaches. the packaging is cute, so i&#x27;ll scoop out the infected-smelling cream inside and put something else in it. it&#x27;s horrible. smell wouldnt even wash away.</li>
    <li> it is pretty much what I expected.  very nice</li>
    <li> Smells good. I like the package, but I think one is enough for me, there has not too many hand cream there, while I am using a lot in winter.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! I&#x27;m 30 y/o, so I don&#x27;t think I will see any changes in my skin texture with the use of this cream anytime soon--don&#x27;t have very many hand wrinkles yet, so can&#x27;t say anything with regard to the anti aging claim. However, I LOVE the smell of peach! This cream is just an absolute pleasure to put on. The container is super cute and shaped like a peach, though my husband seems to think it looks like a nipple. The cream is white in color and goes on very smoothly. I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like much my my hands, and most every hand cream out there feels just too sticky. This one does not feel very stickly at all (but I do only apply it to the back of my hands).&lt;br /&gt;Now, I wash my hands many times throughout the day (I&#x27;m in healthcare industry), so I thought this was why the smell was not lasting. However, over the last weekend I did not was my hands for at least an hour, and noticed that the scent was gone within 30 minutes. So, that&#x27;s my only complaint. Yet, I would not remove any stars from the rating simply because the cream is so nice to use, and I really don&#x27;t mind putting it on several times per day, it smells that good coming out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive thing about this cream is that it is so easy to carry around with you in your purse--it is tightly closed, so I don&#x27;t feel paranoid about it spilling while I&#x27;m carrying it in my more expensive purses.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pleasant experience of putting on lotion, and doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money--the price was just right :)</li>
    <li> smelled like peaches and rough hands intantly softer but minus one star due to the need to re-apply after handwashing.</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s okay, but not amazing. It has a slightly thicker consistency, but will still absorb into skin after a few minutes. Compared to Simple&#x27;s rich moisturizer for face (which I have occasionally used for my hands when they get super dry), Simple still does a better job moisturizing. When my hands aren&#x27;t super-dry, this lotion does an okay job. I&#x27;ll still continue using it to fade the sunspots on my hands, which I think it has managed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about it is the pretty container, and it smells wonderfully of ripe peaches.</li>
    <li> Came in two days! Such a cute package, and great scent. However, I was slightly disappointed in the amount of the product. Hoping to see good results!</li>
    <li> Really nice hand cream-smells great-wish it were a bigger container but overall really hydrating and non greasy! Loveee the packaing for TonyMoly always a great conversational piece</li>
    <li> It smells heavenly but you don&#x27;t get much hand cream so I run out of this quickly, however the smell keeps bringing me back!</li>
    <li> Just got in the mail today and I am pleased! I work at a medical care facility and whenever I enter a room I have to wash my hands. The sensitive skin on my hands are dry to say the least. Constant washing and using hand sanitizer does horrible things to your skin. I used this lotion ONCE right after I opened it and my hands FELT and LOOKED better. Not to mention it smells amazing!! The shipping time wasn&#x27;t that bad either. I got it 12 days earlier than the expected arrival date. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Definitely would buy again, but order it in the Winter months. In the summer, the cream could leak. The cream smells peachy and blends in smoothly, leaving your hands soft, silky, and non-greasy. That sealed the deal for me--non-greasy!</li>
    <li> the peach smell is nice,,but it looks like a used product..</li>
    <li> arrived early and smells great!! Wish the smell lasted longer though</li>
    <li> smells real!!!! absolutely smells like fresh peaches. smells so good you want to eat it. the downside is they don&#x27;t give you very much, but that cute little container makes it worth it i guess. i can&#x27;t wait to get more of these. i&#x27;m going to turn them into something really pretty!! some type of display thing :) i bought the lip balm too. can&#x27;t wait till it&#x27;s here :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with this adorable hand cream. I placed my order January 3rd, and the expected delivery was between January 28th and February 17th. It arrived on the January 24th, four days earlier than expected! For coming from Korea to America, it shipped as fast as possible. It arrived in a neat little package, well-padded and undamaged. There were some other Tonymoly beauty samples included! The peach packaging is the cutest, it&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and it&#x27;s sizable - about three inches around. The cream itself has the most wonderful peach scent, it&#x27;s vibrant and noticeable without being overpowering. I immediately put some on winter-weather hands, and it was so moisturizing and hydrating - my hands are already noticeable softer! The cream absorbs really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy or oily residue. Needless to say, I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;d definitely buy it again or as a present for a friend.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! Super moisturizing, and the smell is incredible. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this hand cream mostly because of the cute peach shaped container it comes in, which is a real pro for it. It&#x27;s very tiny, cute, durable and after it&#x27;s all empty, you can wash it out and use it to store change in or small misc items. Another upside to it is actually the limited amount of lotion inside. If you&#x27;re someone who likes to try new lotions and scents all the time, you&#x27;ll actually appreciate that this runs out after a decent amount of time. On the con side, if you like your lotions to last a LONG time, this isn&#x27;t for you. There&#x27;s only a handful of cream inside and the lotion, once on your hands, doesn&#x27;t last very long, and neither does the scent. The scent and texture of the cream truly make it no different from any other hand cream, except that it does seem a bit lighter. The best reason to buy this peachy cream is the cute container it comes in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you love cute things, this is a must have, but if you&#x27;re searching for quality, this won&#x27;t be it.</li>
    <li> Item came a lot sooner than estimated, and was very well packaged. It came with a few gifts.The product itself is absolutely lovely smelling and has made my hands very soft! I noticed a difference as soon as I used it. I would recommend Tonymoly products to anyone who likes things that are cute, and work well.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is a light pastel pink. It smells like peaches, and has a creamy texture.</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily like a lot of lotions and moisturizers. My hands feel subtly softer after using it, I think after continual use I&#x27;ll see some major improvements. Plus the jar is adorable!</li>
    <li> quick delivery and overall cute product</li>
    <li> I love it. Smells like peach with n grease.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I would order again.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream, it&#x27;s more moistured and good for winter time, also it smellsvery sweet- exactly scent of peach, I dont have anything bad about this product so far.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother as a birthday gift and she liked it so much she asked me to order a few more that she could give as Christmas gifts to her friends. She loved the pleasant scent and super cute peach container.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is very silky and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  The fragrance is subtle and very pleasant. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging yet because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  It does leave your hands feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> for the tangerine whitening hand cream, i use this on ny bum and its definitely cheaper than bleaching and works just as well! my boyfriend loves it because now when hes down there it smells fruity and wonderful! love it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Smells just like peaches, just what I need to smell pretty. Love the packaging and texture.</li>
    <li> This Peach hand cream comes in a joyful little peach shaped container and smells wonderful!  The cream itself is thick and absorbent and feels very nice on my hands.</li>
    <li> Seller is awesome!!! The cream smells just like a fresh peach and is incredibly thick and rich, love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I want fresh peach smell lotion. The scent is pretty artificial.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is not a bad lotion, but I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels smooth. Cute packaging and easy to get product.</li>
    <li> smells great and is exactly as depicted</li>
    <li> Great scent! It&#x27;s not oily like osme products but i have not seen any results on the anti aging part yet.</li>
    <li> This hand cream smells so good and the bottle is adorable.</li>
    <li> I have painfully dry hands due to my job as a scope tech (basically I wash my hands too much in a day that leaves my hands so dry the skin is cracking and bleeding).  I&#x27;ve tried several different hand creams, lotions, remedies to help because it was getting so bad that my knuckles were splitting open.  I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively for the past few days and my hands are so much softer and my skin isn&#x27;t cracking anymore.  The scent is light and great for anyone that has allergies</li>
    <li> Thick and absorbs immediately. Smells like a real peach.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very cute and the fragrance is very peachy!  Smells great, does not leave a greasy feeling.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and it smells like peaches which is my favourite!! But it&#x27;s a lot smaller than what I had originally thought.</li>
    <li> Sooo cute and hydrating! It smells like peach! ^-^</li>
    <li> It took a while to arrive but its exactly like the picture, small but it smells sooooo good! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> As a gift to my friend. She loves it soooooo much!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My hands can get pretty dry, and for a while it seemed like none of the lotions I had been using were working.  I happened to try this at a store, and I noticed results instantly.  It left my hands feeling so smooth!  There was no thick residue or sweaty feeling that sometimes occurs with other lotions or hand creams.  It smells amazing, too!  I will definitely be purchasing this again, and I fully recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too greasy, but smells great.</li>
    <li> smells peachy and feels creamy. easy to find in my bag.</li>
