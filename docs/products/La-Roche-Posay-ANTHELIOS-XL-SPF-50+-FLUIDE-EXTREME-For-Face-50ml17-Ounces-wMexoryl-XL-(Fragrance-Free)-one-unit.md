      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, live in a tropical climate and have experienced skin damage caused by the sun.  </li>
      <li>started looking for sunscreens after deciding I was going to start using Glycolic Acid on my face at night (great product too), just to keep my face looking pretty and healthy.</li>
      <li>and it is easy to carry in ones purse to keep it handy.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It was definitely more cosmetically elegant when worn on the face than the Bioderma was.  </li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen for my face.  </li>
      <li>I have used many others, I just hadn&#x27;t used their sunscreen until 2 weeks ago.</li>

      <li>and this is the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>It was better than the Bioderma SS in that regard.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE La Roche Posay prodcuts.</li>
      <li>This is bar none the best facial sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
      <li>figured it might be better once my face had a bit of Summer color.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Maybe it soaks into some people&#x27;s skin more easily?</li>
      <li>Excellent sunscreen with Mexoryl, available in the US only in some La Roche Posay products.</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I love the light texture of it.</li>
      <li>&quot; didn&#x27;t sound appealing to my oily skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my best pick  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on adult sensitive/ reactive skin)  </li>
      <li>Goes on easily as a  lotion and blends into your skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be very gentle but effective.  </li>
      <li>I would rather use a very effective sunscreen now and have healthy skin later!</li>
      <li>I was relieved to find it was just fine.</li>
      <li>Great service was fast and was exactly was I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, burn quickly, and develop facial sun spots and melasma that persists.</li>
      <li>I have used anthelios for many years, but this new formulation is amazing.</li>
      <li>I like that it is lightweight, fragrance free and good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re able to afford it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, smoothly blends into the skin</li>
      <li>It is smooth to apply and gives a light coated tint.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
      <li>I love the texture and it is easily absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I have only heard  great things about it</li>
      <li>I would never buy this again, and am surprised by the good reviews.</li>
      <li>I have recently read in a Wall Street Journal article that sunscreen products marketed in the US do not have the most effective ingredients against UVA rays.  </li>
      <li>I continue to use it when attending grandchildren&#x27;s&#x27; soccer games or working in the garden in full sun.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it most highly!</li>
      <li>This is a liquid that comes out quickly, so beware.</li>
      <li>Super product</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>It blends so easily into my skin, and doesn&#x27;t attribute to that much shine.</li>
      <li>Has shine so not great for photography but great at keeping skin protected; have also used the version without mexoryl but this version is better - recommend for buyers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product is easily absorbed into my skin</li>
      <li>This is worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is well known that the golden product for the face is sunscreen to prevent sun damage and aging</li>
      <li>for this kind of money I can buy 4 times the regular screens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m doing right by my skin.  </li>
      <li>I was able to put a little bronzer on top of it.</li>
      <li>Great product for those of us with sensitive skin that do not wear makeup other than moisturizer.</li>
      <li>If it should turn out that my face can&#x27;t tolerate it (it did sting on first use), I&#x27;ll use it for my hands or neck.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unfortunately not for me.</li>
      <li>I was glad I ignored them, this is the first sunscreen I have used that did not sting my eyes at all, and it worked fantastically for daily 1 hour + snorkel trips during peak sun hours.</li>
      <li>The liquid is pretty watery and comes out looking like white-out.</li>
      <li>I used to love sunscreens with alcohol in them before I had rosacea, so if you have oilier skin that isn&#x27;t irritation-prone, you may like the cooling effect and the absence of any oily texture.  </li>
      <li>second star is purely because it seems to be effective as far as SPF goes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had a VERY BAD EXPERIENCE with this sunscreen from Laroche Posay. Put it on my face and neck, I had a feelling of suffocation with red face. Also had the worst almost instant headach, I had to leave my friend&#x27;s baby shower... Also tried other suscreens for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and do not recomand so called \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreens. Watch for perfumes, hidden chemicals, hormones disruptors (oxybenzone  is in Banana Boat 50 for babies... dangerous)&lt;br /&gt;Very bad and dangerous product,  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++  Sensitive skin:  my best pick  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on adult sensitive/ reactive skin)  ++++</li>
    <li> If you have rosacea or are sensitive to alcohol, be aware that alcohol is the 6th ingredient in this product (I just didn&#x27;t notice before I placed my order).  I used to love sunscreens with alcohol in them before I had rosacea, so if you have oilier skin that isn&#x27;t irritation-prone, you may like the cooling effect and the absence of any oily texture.  This product has excellent coverage, does not create any whiteness, and dries to a matte finish.  I recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t react with irritation to alcohol.  If it should turn out that my face can&#x27;t tolerate it (it did sting on first use), I&#x27;ll use it for my hands or neck.</li>
    <li> I have severe Melasma on my face and have had for years. Though I keep out of the sun as much as possible, even a little exposure makes it worse. This is the ONLY sunscreen that stops my marks getting darker. I don&#x27;t care what \\&quot;spf\\&quot; the other sunscreens claim to have. This particular one actually works. (Please note, I have tried their other sunscreens with less success.) If you have pigmentation problems. This is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer/sunscreen because it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent melasma from worsening. Not so. I found it took too long to dry, a little greasy, and came off easily with sweat. My melasma actually got worse while using this product. I found Neutrogena sport- SPF 70 worked much better for my skin/melasma.</li>
    <li> I have vitiligo (no pigment) and have to be super careful ithe sun. Also sensitive skin. I have used anthelios for many years, but this new formulation is amazing. It goes into my skin, so i don&#x27;t feel greasy and it protects better than ever. I was just in Europe and it lasted all day...never had one bit of sunburn.  I would recommend this to everyone...great product.</li>
    <li> It is well known that the golden product for the face is sunscreen to prevent sun damage and aging signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and it is now that I am starting to give my skin the good protection it needs (better late than never, right?) I had always been hesitant about wearing sunscreen on my face. It reminded me of that \\&quot;ghost look\\&quot;--white marks all over the face, and its \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; didn&#x27;t sound appealing to my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for sunscreens after deciding I was going to start using Glycolic Acid on my face at night (great product too), just to keep my face looking pretty and healthy. But it increases the skin&#x27;s sensitivity, so a high SPF sunscreen is recommended (yes, even on cloudy days). I LOVE La Roche Posay prodcuts. I have used many others, I just hadn&#x27;t used their sunscreen until 2 weeks ago. All I can say is WOW. This isn&#x27;t sticky or oily. It absorbs very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, cakey, white or shiny at ALL, it has no fragrance and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this over and over again. Perfect to use under make-up or a moisturizer, although I use it by itself most of the times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  Almost all sunscreens now are broad spectrum blocking both UVA and UVB rays.  I bought a much better sunblock from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple of weeks, but so far it seems like it works well. It does make your skin whiter, so it is not invisible on the skin. I was able to put a little bronzer on top of it. It does not burn my eyes like Neutrogena products do, and I haven&#x27;t had any negative skin reactions. So far I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> it rubs in nicely &amp; does not feel greasy, wish it was available for less in the usa, the bottle is quite small for the price</li>
    <li> I have fairly sun-sensitive skin, with a smattering of light melasma on my forehead. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product, so I thought I would give it a try. I usually use Neutrogena Dry Touch, but my dermatologist has said that Helioplex isn&#x27;t that great. So, I went to the beach for a few hours, trying my new sunscreen out, and I got completely burnt. (And that&#x27;s in the winter sun!). I had read all the reviews, and another woman had the same problem as I did apparently. So unfortunately it looks like I&#x27;m stuck with a zinc-based sunblock that definitely gives me a white glow, but also prevents me from getting sunburned. While I&#x27;m bummed about that, I tried to retun this faulty product. The seller was ridiculous. They took forever to reply to my emails (48 hours, but compared to the usual efficiency I get on Amazon that seemed like a really long time), and essentially took 5 days to ignore my initial request, ask if I&#x27;d applied it correctly, and then finally got to the point of telling me that they don&#x27;t accept returns and would be willing to give me an 85% store credit. Which is ridiculous, since Amazon, and any other department or specialty store dealing with beauty will give you a full refund, for a faulty sunscreen. So, I&#x27;ve had to file a claim and see where that lands me.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my face.  I wear it every day, it&#x27;s light, feels great under makeup.  Super product</li>
    <li> I have been using La Roche Possay with mexoryl since I was a teen. It was recommended by my dermatologist here in the U.S. as well as in France. We live in Florida and spend a lot of time outside jogging/walking with the dogs, hanging out at the beach and theme parks. It is THE only sunscreen that allows me to go through the entire summer without any freckles appearing on my face. I also had a temporary issue with melasma while on new birth control - not only has it cleared up COMPLETELY, but, again, I went through several summers now without ANY freckles or spots while enjoying the outdoors.     I have combination skin but never had any issues with breakouts from this cream. It does not leave any white residue either. I use this particular cream for face and décolleté area and this [...]  for the rest of the body.  There are so may different options with La Roche Posay, however, I remember seeing a comparison chart and this particular fluide extreme is the highest protection for skin unable to tolerate sun exposure (I believe; wish i still had a link - it was quite helpful).  I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup and this cream keeps my skin looking great!</li>
    <li> This is bar none the best facial sunscreen I have ever used. I used it on my face during my honeymoon to the south Pacific this past summer. Knowing I would be spending a lot of time outside and in the water, I researched my sunscreen choices thoroughly. I have very fair skin, burn quickly, and develop facial sun spots and melasma that persists. I also usually develop stinging skin when I use high-SPF facial sunscreen. I used this sunscreen religiously on our trip, applying it generously twice daily and after towel drying. It felt good on my skin and never stung my face. I ignored the men at the dive shop who warned us to wash off our sunscreen prior to snorkeling because sunscreen always stings the eyes when it runs. I was glad I ignored them, this is the first sunscreen I have used that did not sting my eyes at all, and it worked fantastically for daily 1 hour + snorkel trips during peak sun hours. I didn&#x27;t even get a hint of a tan on my face (which was my goal!), and absolutely no melasma. This product is amazing, and I will use it during the summer from now on. I would use it year round but this formulation is not very moisturizing and I need a more moisturizing formula in the winter. It also gives a slight pallor to the skin, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. I would rather use a very effective sunscreen now and have healthy skin later!</li>
    <li> I only use this sunscreen ever since I discovered it.  It is not greasy and I use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
    <li> It comes out like a liquid, but really does melt into your face. There&#x27;s no dripping, streaking, or oiliness. I also liked how it looked under my makeup--it gave me a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I may not purchase it again is because of the price for a small amount. But if you&#x27;re able to afford it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this brand makes best sunscreen and my dermatologist recommended it too. So gave it a try even it is a bit pricy, but wasn&#x27;t happy with this product. it leaves white residue on the face even if you rub it into the skin pretty well. Not going to buy it again, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My hot shot NYC dermatologist told me to use this on my aging skin rather than expensive rich face creams.  She said this would protect my skin from the sun and avoid whiteheads from clogged pores.  Although my skin is dry, I&#x27;ve been using this under make-up, and it&#x27;s just fine!  It also costs much less to order it through Amazon than to buy it in a drugstore.  I&#x27;ve given it to my 92 year old mom and my 82 year old sister-in-law who live in Florida and I beg my husband to use it everyday before he goes outside!  It absorbs immediately into the skin and you do not feel it at all.  I recommend it most highly!</li>
    <li> I have recently read in a Wall Street Journal article that sunscreen products marketed in the US do not have the most effective ingredients against UVA rays.  They protect mostly only against UVB rays which are the rays that burn your skin, but UVA are the rays that most contribute to aging, i.e., they cause your skin to dry up, wrinkle and develop age spots in the long run.  All the products in the US that say \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; aren&#x27;t worth much, unless you reapply and reapply and reapply, at least every 2 hours, but really, you&#x27;d need to do it more frequently.  Are you doing that?  Seriously, does anyone reapply their sunscreen that often -- take off all of the makeup, reapply, put the face back on and do it several time a day?  Please.  As soon as I read this article, I started buying products with Mesoryl SX, one of the most effective anti-UVA ingredients mentioned in the article.  Pharmacy stores that carry Anthelios products have only regular Anthelios, without Mesoryl, so I had to go online to find the right kind of product.  Anthelios XL has Mesoryl SX and XL for a photostable UVA protection that does not expire after 2 hours (although the products still advise you to reapply often).  I have now tried Anthelios in crème and fluid form, and I don&#x27;t have a preference, and frankly, I don&#x27;t care, as long as I know I&#x27;m doing right by my skin.  These products are whitening, so I always follow them up with a tinted moisturizer or a BB cream, and I always use finishing powder (and I use a slightly darker shade than my normal skin color to counteract the whitening effect of this sunscreen).  People who worry about \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; are fools.  Chemicals are what protects us from diseases and premature aging.  Back in the day before chemicals people were lucky if they lived to the age of 40 and they were considered old by then.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen on a bay fishing trip.  It kept me from getting sun burned and was not heavy or greasy feeling.  I really like it and will use it and re order.</li>
    <li> I paid a decent amount for this and was horrified at how long it took to soak into my skin--after waiting an hour, I finally went out with still a pale, sickly tint visible. I would never buy this again, and am surprised by the good reviews. Maybe it soaks into some people&#x27;s skin more easily?</li>
    <li> I am so glad that this  La Roche Posay Anthelios XL 50 is here in U.S.  This 50 plus with Mexoryl SX &amp; XL has only been offered in Europe and Canada.  This is part&lt;br /&gt;my anti-aging regime and with the Mexoryl ingredient it is a definite must for protection and anti-aging products.</li>
    <li> I keep this product with me at all times.  My initial consideration for buying it was that it blocks the entire spectrum of sun rays, so that its not just preventing a burn but also preventing cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easily absorbed into my skin and I use it on my face, my neck and the backs of my hands.  I was particularly happy with the way it smoothed onto my hands-- no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, live in a tropical climate and have experienced skin damage caused by the sun.  ANTHELIOS XL SPF 50+ FLUIDE EXTREME was (finally) recommended and I love the product.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, smoothly blends into the skin and I feel totally confident that my face is getting the best protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I love the light texture of it. However, due to my lack of observation skills, I didn&#x27;t notice that one of the ingredients is Titanium Dioxide when I ordered it. Not only does this ingredient make me pale, but it also gives me pimples. If you have very fair skin and you don&#x27;t have a problem with acne you will probably love this. It&#x27;s unfortunately not for me.</li>
    <li> I read in MarieClaire that Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreen was supposedly one of the best sunscreens in production. I tried it out after some initial research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I love it. The liquid is pretty watery and comes out looking like white-out. It blends so easily into my skin, and doesn&#x27;t attribute to that much shine. There is some shininess, but nothing powder can&#x27;t handle afterwards. Also, the dreaded \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; look is not something to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a 4 was that the bottle is pretty small. For the price, I use up the stuff pretty fast, even though I apply only a small amount each time. Still, I think using a good sunscreen is a lot cheaper than blowing a bunch of money on wrinkle cream after the damage is done.</li>
    <li> I just started using La Roche Posay Anthelios XL SPF 50 for face.  I love the texture and it is easily absorbed.  I have only heard  great things about it and it seems to be very gentle but effective.  I will buy it again for sure.  Having used other French skin products  over the years -- I am not surprised at its superb quality.  Our   friends across the Ocean have a tradition of being innovative when it  comes to beauty products. A great moisturizer and legendary for protection  against harmful sun rays.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is weird.  Although it&#x27;s tinted, it has a ghostly quality to it....it makes my fair/medium Caucasian skin tone look sick.  I tried using it last winter and hated it....figured it might be better once my face had a bit of Summer color.  Nope.  Sick.  (Sick as in the original definition, not sick as in \\&quot;awesome\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got an oily texture that leaves the skin looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That texture means you can&#x27;t use any other product over it....makeup just won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re one of those conscientious people who apply another coat during the day....you&#x27;ll look like you are wearing a clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finally giving up and tossing the rest of this tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second star is purely because it seems to be effective as far as SPF goes.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen with Mexoryl, available in the US only in some La Roche Posay products. A little goes a long way. The matte finish is dry; not at all greasy, slick, or oily. Completely worth the price on several different levels. I also use it on my arms and top of the hands.</li>
    <li> After years of not wearing sunscreen because of my acne prone skin, I think I have found by HG!!!!  This does not have a heavy sunscreen feel and does not make me break out.  Love the European version with the highly recommende Mexoryl.  It does look somewhat shiny after application, but so much better than others I have used.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I still got a bit of redness when wearing this outdoors for several hours, even after re-applying.  However the redness wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I have fair skin that burns easily.  What I DO like about this sunscreen is the consistency and non greasy factor.  It was better than the Bioderma SS in that regard.  It was definitely more cosmetically elegant when worn on the face than the Bioderma was.  This one is also a repeat buy.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and this is the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. Other sunscreens for the face either leave my face too shiny under makeup or irritate my eyes if I get it too close. This does neither, has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and I&#x27;ve never been burned wearing it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I found this product while in Faial, Azores.  It is very humid there and my prior sunscreen felt oily and ran when I perspired.  I hesitated over the price for the bottle size, however a plus is it meets airline security 3 OZ. fluid restrictions and it is easy to carry in ones purse to keep it handy.  As someone described it earlier, the consistency is like \\&quot;white out\\&quot;.  That means be cautious when you open the bottle, a little goes a long way.  I used it on my face, neck, and exposed chest area and on the back of my hands.  It works long and well.  I used it for three weeks - NO sunburn for once.  When I returned from vacation I received many comments about looking younger and I think this fluid also did some repair work on my 70-year-old face skin.  I continue to use it when attending grandchildren&#x27;s&#x27; soccer games or working in the garden in full sun.  I still have about an sixteenth of a bottle left.  Great product for those of us with sensitive skin that do not wear makeup other than moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but after using it a few times I noticed large cystic acne developing. Also, when I was wearing it I was told my skin looked yellowish. It has a natural tan tint to it, but on my olive skin (which tends towards yellow) it just made me look really yellow, like I was wearing the wrong colored foundation.  It seems to protect against the sun very well and is definitely water resistant, as the bottle says. I found this to be annoying though because I had to scrub my skin which was already somewhat irritated from the sunscreen even after it was off. I felt like the color of it lingered on my skin for a while and took two washings to get off completely.   I&#x27;m keeping it and I guess I&#x27;ll use it occasionally if I have a day where all-day hardcore sun exposure (beach day, etc) outweighs the negatives of breaking out and being slightly discolored.   Overall though, I&#x27;d rather just stick to a lower spf and wear a hat.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used and tell my friends. Great service was fast and was exactly was I was expecting. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my sister who is a flight attendant. I use it every day including winter. It is smooth to apply and gives a light coated tint. However, the main reason to apply it is for the sunblock effect. I golf frequently and I have yet to be sunburnt. The price is reasonable for how long I have been using this facial tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> likes: thin and goes on smooth.  it doesn&#x27;t run off like the thick cremes do and stay on all day even with moderate sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dislikes: makes the face just a bit white.  and by golly, it&#x27;s expensive.  for this kind of money I can buy 4 times the regular screens.</li>
    <li> Has shine so not great for photography but great at keeping skin protected; have also used the version without mexoryl but this version is better - recommend for buyers.</li>
    <li> a bit irritates to eyes, yes leaves white film, so use it with a foundation or cream to blend the white color, thats what i did , overall  it great but small and expensive , if you cannot buy this buy vichy they have same ingredient</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was afraid it would cause me to breakout, as most facial sunblock does. I was relieved to find it was just fine. It goes on a little white, but absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily looking at all. This is a great product, I highly recommend it. My only complaint is that it is not very big, and quite expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a liquid that comes out quickly, so beware. Other than that, the tint works for me (I have a buff beige toned face), and the sunscreen rocks. Watch that the tint doesn&#x27;t accumulate in your eyebrows or at the edge of your scalp. That&#x27;s not pretty, and I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;not pretty.\\&quot; I&#x27;m in my mid 50s and have dry to combo skin, and I live in L.A.</li>
    <li> 50 years old experiencing age spots and some acne spots that were dark upon healing. This works for me, but takes time. Been using for 6 months. Also helpful during summer months to lesson spots from darkening from being in the sun.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and spreads very easily. I like it, but just so people know, it does have a slightly greasy feel and leave a little white cast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen because I have melasma.  It goes on very nicely.  It feels great on my skin and makes my skin look smooth.  I play tennis and sweat a lot and this product does a better job of staying on than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Also, this product does not burn my face when I sweat, something that would happen with almost any other sunscreen I have ever used!  And since it soaks into the skin it doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes when I sweat.</li>
    <li> I like that it is lightweight, fragrance free and good for sensitive skin. It blends right in, no white chalky residue&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologists recommended this product.</li>
    <li> save your money and go to pharmacy and get cheaper stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find this to be any better and it is too thick and has a nasty smell.</li>
    <li> Just started to use when running.  It&#x27;s not very moisturizing though, as I like that feel in a sunscreen product.&lt;br /&gt;Summertime use should determine whether the price was worth paying for that expensive suppossedly safe skin protector ingriedient it contains</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years; it&#x27;s difficult to find here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only product on the market (that I know of) that contains Mexoryl - a proven&lt;br /&gt;ingredient that helps to block both UVA and UVB rays.  Nothing like it.</li>
    <li> Very good, light weight formula, great protection. Very handy package. Absolutely perfect for my summer needs. The picture shows a small tube that I did not receive but that does not really matter to me.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on easily as a  lotion and blends into your skin. Will work if you aren&#x27;t lying out in the sun in intense heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It continually provides good protection all year long; especially in the summer at the beach.</li>
    <li> Llego a tiempo el producto era el indicado,. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. buen precio calidad.&lt;br /&gt;Llego a tiempo el producto era el indicado,. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. buen precio calidad.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, RECOMMENDED BY THE DERMATOLOGO&lt;br /&gt;ABSORB WHAT SKIN COLOR IS QUICKLY AND VERY FAST DILUTES&lt;br /&gt;IS MORE THAN A SUNSCREEN, SERVES AS BASE FOR MAKEUP</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is now my go to moisturizer.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and this makes wearing sunscreen a joy, not something you dread.  While it&#x27;s a little expensive, a little goes a long way.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Thank you Head Butler for this recommendation from your wife.  It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
