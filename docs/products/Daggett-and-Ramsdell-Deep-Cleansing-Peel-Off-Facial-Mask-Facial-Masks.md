      <li>Wish it was more stronger for the peel action</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and comes off easy, but it leaves my face rough feeling and doesn&#x27;t have the power to clean my pores.</li>
      <li>The first day i got this i had to give it a try.</li>
      <li>this product is cheap and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;it doens&#x27;t pull out black heads or get rid of hairs.</li>
      <li>This does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin</li>
      <li>Much needed...</li>

      <li>It feels refreshing and is a fun clear green color.</li>
      <li>My skin feels great, it feels cold when u first apply it</li>
      <li>After just one use I noticed my pores on my nose looking smaller and a general overall better tone and softness to my skin.  </li>

      <li>I applied it thicker - it never dried completely</li>
      <li>Off Facial Mask for the first time last week.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure its on thick enough, so it will peel off in one layer.</li>

<li> Now that I have found this product again, I purchased a half a dozen bottles and will have this stuff for years to come!</li>
<li> and u want to apply a thick coat to remove it in one piece.</li>
<li> Not very happy.</li>
<li> I have used a few peel offs, and this one is one of the worst.</li>
<li> I tried to apply this product lightly - very difficult to peel off in one piece.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin but it arrived here in a week and it was expected to get here a bit longer. But the box was a little damaged and its texture is thicker than I would&#x27;ve imagined</li>

    <li> this product is cheap and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;it doens&#x27;t pull out black heads or get rid of hairs. but it makes skin shiny.&lt;br /&gt;you get a internal glow.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I think this formula was owned by another company. I looked for it on the internet for a long time and then gave up! Now that I have found this product again, I purchased a half a dozen bottles and will have this stuff for years to come!</li>
    <li> I use this peel twice a week and I have noticed a brighter complexion, therefore I have found a peel that I plan to stick with for years to come!</li>
    <li> It feels refreshing and is a fun clear green color. On top of that, it smells amazing and peels off perfectly, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I tried to apply this product lightly - very difficult to peel off in one piece. I applied it thicker - it never dried completely and I had to scrub it off my face. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> Wish it was more stronger for the peel action</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see a diffrence</li>

    <li> I used the Daggett &amp; Ramsdell Deep Cleansing Peel Off Facial Mask for the first time last week.  After just one use I noticed my pores on my nose looking smaller and a general overall better tone and softness to my skin.  I will definitely keep using this weekly.</li>
