      <li>I love my birds and have had friends and family buy me fancy decorative feeders over the years</li>
      <li>have used this brand for many years now</li>
      <li>Love the way it comes apart for cleaning.</li>
      <li>Perky Pet \\&quot;Grand</li>
      <li>This feeder can do that and more.</li>
      <li>Ok I&#x27;m not a review writer by any means</li>
      <li>After I purchased 3 more and a replacement bottom, I&#x27;ve had  3 72 pincer up and have to refill once a week.</li>
      <li>We got rid of the quart sizes (using the 48oz) and will probably purchase two more of these.   </li>
      <li>Humming birds love it</li>
      <li>I love these hummingbird feeder, they don&#x27;t drip and six hummingbird can feed at one time.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>so my funnel would fit in better.  </li>
      <li>This is the MOST important one.  </li>
      <li>Normal feeders have to filled twice a day and this feeder is great and does not have to be filled as often.  </li>
      <li>even dropped it (full!)</li>
      <li>then you will most likely be happy with this product.</li>
      <li>We go through 10-lbs of sugar A DAY in prime feeding season, and are so happy to have found a feeder that we only have to fill once a day instead of 3-4 times or more.  </li>
      <li>Easy to fill, hang, and no drips.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean and the hummers love it</li>
      <li>We have two of these and they are easy to fill.</li>
      <li>for those looking for an easy way to clean hummingbird feeders, The best way that I have found and it works great is by taking a hand full of rock salt (i.e  ice cream maker rock salt, or salt used for a water softner) and putting it into the feeder and adding just a few drops of warm water, shake the feeder making sure the salt swirls around all areas of the inside of  the feeder, then empty out the salt rinse with warm water, and there you go good as new.</li>
      <li>Feeder worked very good in dry weather however in the rain</li>
      <li>I use a baby bottle brush for all my feeders and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The orioles are fine with it too</li>
      <li>This looked good online; and I&#x27;ve owned other hum feeders by this manufacturer which I have been very pleased with.  </li>
      <li>It is kind of a hassle filling these large feeders</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This 72 ource feeder is the largest commercially available hummingbird feeder.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>What is needed are easy to clean feeders (like the Perky Pet Grand Master) with large reservoir capacity (128 oz would be great) and numerous feeding perches (I modify the Perky Pet feeders by drilling additional ports to allow 16 hummers at one time).</li>
      <li>We prefer the first nature 32 oz feeder because it is easy to clean and easy for the hummers to use.  </li>
      <li>a little&lt;br /&gt;larger, to make it easier to fill and clean</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased the large capacity feeders.  </li>
      <li>Love the large size.</li>
      <li>Its maybe 10 cents worth of plastic (IF that), already had a dent in it and so many design flaws its not even funny.  </li>
      <li>Hummers are busy (when it&#x27;s WARM out lately!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a huge problem right now because the yellowjackets are out and swarming all over the feeder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect since we had to go out of town for 4 days and when returning had just enough left to refill.</li>
      <li>Master\\&quot; - easy to clean and relatively decent capacity.</li>
      <li>The large feeders will go 3 or 4 times longer without needing to be filled again.  </li>
      <li>BTW I love the larger feeder and my hummers are happy all summer long!!</li>
      <li>but the hassle is worth it because it won&#x27;t have to be done again for awhile.  </li>
      <li>if hung right in the sun they tend to build pressure and will drip but hang them in the shade and it will do what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I was a little reluctant to buy this feeder because quite honestly, it looked cheap from the picture.</li>
      <li>Finally a large capacity!</li>
      <li>They make the hummies land to eat, which created a more social civil environment.</li>
      <li>I had enough left to keep them happy until I could unpack and refill them.</li>
      <li>When I received it and tried to use it, I discovered there are other things more important than just capacity.    </li>
      <li>top of the feeder is not flat, which means you cannot stand the feeder on end while you fill it.</li>
      <li>In Laguna Beach I had a private deck with many plant, flowers and bushes, not I am in an apartment</li>
      <li>The first one I had cracked in the side after about a year...</li>
      <li>I suggest you avoid this feeder unless you are willing to deal with these issues.  </li>
      <li>6 or more smaller varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those who have an abundance of hummingbirds (there may be about 1000 visiting my yard at this time!), a very large capacity hummingbird feeder is very helpful.</li>
      <li>I am already using it but do not like it because I paid top dollar for such an obvious cheap rif-off.  </li>
      <li>We purchased this when going on a trip in summer because it is large.  </li>
      <li>With 25 to 40 Humming birds at my feeders the large capacity makes feeding a lot easier.</li>
      <li>Most hummy feeders have delicate bits that break easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and won&#x27;t break if a storm knocks it down!</li>
      <li>Shame on the people who ask so much for such a cheap product.</li>
      <li>The huge feeders save a lot of extra work.</li>
      <li>If you are fortunate enough to have swarms of hummingbirds around your feeders</li>
      <li>If you have a place to put this that NEVER gets sunlight it will work very well...  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this to replace a 48oz feeder I had at work. I was having to refill it 2-3 times a week. The bottle is thicker than I expected, and the hanger seems very stout. Some of the other reviews said that it took the hummingbirds a while to get used to this feeder, that the feeding holes are too close together. It didn&#x27;t bother my hummers in the least. Just as soon as I hung it up, they came and started feeding from it. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it&#x27;s hard to fill and clean, and just plain ugly. I don&#x27;t normally color the syrup, but I do with this one just to make it look a little better. Over all I&#x27;m very pleased with this feeder.</li>
    <li> I bought this feeder based upon one thing; capacity.  When I received it and tried to use it, I discovered there are other things more important than just capacity.    1.  I was disappointed in the plastic bottle.  I expected something thicker that this; it is so thin that the side collapses as the level drops inside.    2.  The birds do NOT like the horizontal feeding surface nearly as well as the feeders that have the feeding ports slanted at an angle.    3.  The birds do NOT like a feeding port area that is all one color, with no representation of flower blooms on it.    4.  This is the MOST important one.  This feeder does NOT have a removable hanger on it.  There is a molded loop on the top of the plastic jar to hang it by.  That makes it impossible to set this jar on a surface to pour nector into it.  To make it even worse, they have a large metal hook tightly closed in this loop with the OTHER end open for hooking it into a string to hang the feeder up by.  The only way I can fill this feeder is to center the jar on the drain in the sink with the loop and hook sticking down into the drain.  It is unstable this way, and frequently slips and tilts during filling.    Avoid this product.  By the time I paid for the feeder and shipping, I could have bought almost three of the quart feeders from Wal-Mart, which are GLASS bottles with a hanger that unscrews to allow the jar to sit FLAT while filling it.  They have feeding stations that are designed to look like flowers, and the little hummers LOVE them.</li>
    <li> This feeder isn&#x27;t for the typical backyard, but we are so grateful it&#x27;s available for those of us who are lucky enough to need them. We feed hundreds of hummingbirds. When you can use up a 50# bag of sugar every 2 - 3 weeks during the summer .... you need a feeder that can keep up! This feeder can do that and more. Cleaning and refilling every other day is still mandatory, but the high volume and 8 feeding ports on each feeder enable more birds to feed at the same time.</li>
    <li> While I like the larger capacity (I would prefer even larger feeders if I could find them), this feeder has serious design flaws.  The feeding angle is terrible.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t sit flat (due to integrated hook) so refilling is a needless challenge. I also think the plastic hook is liable to break easily and will make the feeder worthless in short order. Add the problems together and this feeder has serious problems that quickly relegated it to my garage - frankly I should have returned it for a refund.    I&#x27;ve tried just about every mid and large commercial feeder there is.  So far, the \\&quot;best\\&quot; I&#x27;ve found is the 48 oz Perky Pet \\&quot;Grand Master\\&quot; - easy to clean and relatively decent capacity. That said, it doesn&#x27;t have enough feeding ports (only 6 - I would like to see 16-20 ports) and I&#x27;d prefer a much larger feeder (96-128 oz) so I could reduce the half dozen feeders I have to clean and refill daily.    I am still looking for the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; feeder - why it is so difficult to design boggles my mind.  What is needed are easy to clean feeders (like the Perky Pet Grand Master) with large reservoir capacity (128 oz would be great) and numerous feeding perches (I modify the Perky Pet feeders by drilling additional ports to allow 16 hummers at one time).</li>
    <li> Large capacity hummer feeders are hard to find and we have so many birds that we have to refill every day.  We have two of these and they are easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Seems sturdy.  I have had swarms of hummingbirds this summer and have had trouble having enough nectar to meet the need.  These feeders help greatly!</li>
    <li> made out of very thin plastic. I drop the bottle on the grass lawn and the neck broke off. the bottle is paper thin. I never got to use it one time.</li>
    <li> We have between 50 and a hundred &amp;#34;visitors&amp;#34; each spring. The huge feeders save a lot of extra work. I put out four of them along with six of the smaller ones prior to a week long beach trip and when I got back I had enough left to keep them happy until I could unpack and refill them. Wish I&#x27;d had these years ago.</li>
    <li> With 25 to 40 Humming birds at my feeders the large capacity makes feeding a lot easier. Buy one and reduce your feed time.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me one for Christmas...I drilled an extra eight holes so all the neighborhood can come to eat.  The orioles are fine with it too (I take out the yellow flowers so the big birds can eat).  I got used to filling it with the hook in the drain of the sink...not a big problem.  The logo is stamped into the plastic, making nice nooks and crannies for mold to develop... The first one I had cracked in the side after about a year...UV plastic it ain&#x27;t.  They replaced it and it worked well until tonight when the tab that holds the hook broke (UV plastic it ain&#x27;t)... So now I&#x27;m dead in the water.  If you have a place to put this that NEVER gets sunlight it will work very well...  I&#x27;m thinking of using the base with a 2-liter bottle and making a net to hold it up...  But, until then...baaaad design</li>
    <li> Since I am considering purchasing my 3rd 72 oz feeder I guess I can say it is a decent product.  We usually have 40-50 hummingbirds around so filling feeders get tedious.  The large feeders will go 3 or 4 times longer without needing to be filled again.  It is kind of a hassle filling these large feeders but the hassle is worth it because it won&#x27;t have to be done again for awhile.  I wish the diameter of the opening was a little larger so my funnel would fit in better.  If you have a lot of hummingbirds and you don&#x27;t like to constantly fill the feeders then you will most likely be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It took a while for the hummers to get used to the horizontal bar, but after 1-2 days, these feeders are the hit of the row. We go through 10-lbs of sugar A DAY in prime feeding season, and are so happy to have found a feeder that we only have to fill once a day instead of 3-4 times or more.  The bees do not molest this feeder like they do the others, either.  I&#x27;d agree that the bottle could be a little heartier, but so far, that issue has not had any impact on utility.  We have had zero problems with etching or mold, and the base comes apart in a wonderfully simple way to clean.  We&#x27;re upgrading to six of these for next year.  Just AMAZING if you go through the kind of volume feeding we do!</li>
    <li> Humming birds love it</li>
    <li> Great for our large crew of birds! Only downfall is getting inside it to clean thoroughly. Otherwise, superb!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but was so disappointed in this feeder that I decided to finally buckle down and write a review to help other folks.  We have lots of hummers and always have about 10 feeders going in our yard.  We&#x27;ve tried almost everything on the market. We purchased this when going on a trip in summer because it is large.  We didn&#x27;t want out hummers to run out of nectar.  We purchased 3 of these.  Unfortunately, we immediately noticed that if they are placed in any warm location and the temperature gets above about 80 degrees (or the sun shines on them) all the nectar starts dripping out.  This is a huge problem right now because the yellowjackets are out and swarming all over the feeder. Also, I agree with a previous reviewer that the hummers don&#x27;t like this feeder as much as others with angled ports.  They will use it, but it is definitely one of the least poplar feeders we&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I suggest you avoid this feeder unless you are willing to deal with these issues.  I wish I had not wasted money on 3 of these.  We prefer the first nature 32 oz feeder because it is easy to clean and easy for the hummers to use.  When the yellowjackets get bad later in the summer we switch out the bottom from the First nature 16 oz feeder (which has the yellow flowers to restrict the opening to keep the yellowjackets off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make a wise purchase.</li>
    <li> If you are fortunate enough to have swarms of hummingbirds around your feeders you know how quickly they can empty a small feeder.  This 72 ource feeder is the largest commercially available hummingbird feeder.  It has eight nectar holes, the base separates into 2 parts for easy cleaning, and is very sturdy.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> About the only thing going for this feeder is its size. For those who have an abundance of hummingbirds (there may be about 1000 visiting my yard at this time!), a very large capacity hummingbird feeder is very helpful. But in this case, the disadvantages of this feeder far outweigh its size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle opening on this feeder is extremely small, so small that it makes filling the feeder problematic. Even a small funnel wouldn&#x27;t fit into the feeder. I had to ream out the opening to make it big enough for a funnel, into which I could then pour the hummer solution. Furthermore, the small opening makes cleaning the inside of the feeder extremely difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top of the feeder is not flat, which means you cannot stand the feeder on end while you fill it. You must either hold its small neck in one hand while filling it (not easy since it tends to slip out of your hand), or design a stand with a hole in the middle so that the feeder will stand upright during filling (which is what I ended up doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only eight holes on its small base for the hummers to feed from. Given its capacity, this feeder should have 12-16 holes or more, with a larger base. I ended up drilling 8 more holes for the hummers to feed from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear to me that the designer(s) of this feeder had very little experience with feeding hummingbirds. What&#x27;s worse, they probably never tried their design, or tried it and didn&#x27;t care about how poorly it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, in spite of its large capacity, this feeder is not worth investing in.</li>
    <li> we had around 100 hummers here this summer and the little pint and quart feeders weren&#x27;t cutting it. they were having to be filled at least once per day each x4. we put 3 of these up  and they lasted two days per fill. if hung right in the sun they tend to build pressure and will drip but hang them in the shade and it will do what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s large enough and lightweight enough to hold plenty of hummer food for at least one whole day as the season picks up.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a high capacity hummingbird feeder. The Best 1 is great to clean and doesn&#x27;t drip in the heat.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Five stars if it didn&#x27;t have to sit on a bowl or over the sink drain to fill.</li>
    <li> I needed a feeder that would hold enough food for the hummingbirds while I&#x27;m away for a few weeks.  This is perfect!  It&#x27;s easy to clean and won&#x27;t break if a storm knocks it down!</li>
    <li> for those looking for an easy way to clean hummingbird feeders, The best way that I have found and it works great is by taking a hand full of rock salt (i.e  ice cream maker rock salt, or salt used for a water softner) and putting it into the feeder and adding just a few drops of warm water, shake the feeder making sure the salt swirls around all areas of the inside of  the feeder, then empty out the salt rinse with warm water, and there you go good as new. No fancy brushes needed. Hope this helps! BTW I love the larger feeder and my hummers are happy all summer long!!</li>
    <li> Awesome  Don&#x27;t have to fill it every day!</li>
    <li> Great humming bird feeder! This is my third Best feeder. I don&#x27;t find the feeder attractive but it works. The humming birds love the feeder. Nearly indestructible construction.</li>
    <li> FINALLY don&#x27;t have to refill the feeder EVERY DAY!!  This one is great.  And for a great price.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and the hummers love it</li>
    <li> Love it!  It is very difficult to find a feeder in this size. Simple design; no problems cleaning. Best of all, it has eight stations.   We now have two of the 72 oz. We got rid of the quart sizes (using the 48oz) and will probably purchase two more of these.   Rush hour is quite a sight!</li>
    <li> Very good product that is easy to maintain</li>
    <li> Works well. Birds never noticed it was a different feeder. Love the way it comes apart for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Have used Best-1 Feeders for years, I have as many 20 birds trying to feed at sunset, and had to refill the feeder twice a day, this 72oz feeder is a welcome to my Hummingbird feeders</li>
    <li> Finally a large capacity! Unfortunately, the birds don&#x27;t really like it compared to the normal glass ones. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because there is less red, or the fact that there are no flowers; whatever, i go through the smaller bottles three times faster than this one that I only fill part way. Also, after a couple of months it has started leaking all over the deck. I can&#x27;t figure out how to stop that and it&#x27;s a mess. I&#x27;m replacing this one with something else.</li>
    <li> This is the best feeder I have ever purchased!  It holds a lot of food and it doesn&#x27;t leak!</li>
    <li> I just received the product and its as cheesy as a product can get.  I was desperate to get larger capacity feeders and needed to try what was out in the market before resorting to making home-made feeders.  Its maybe 10 cents worth of plastic (IF that), already had a dent in it and so many design flaws its not even funny.  Such a small opening that it will be very difficult to clean, and a top that will not allow you to set it down because the hook opening is built into the bottle itself.  I am already using it but do not like it because I paid top dollar for such an obvious cheap rif-off.  Shame on the people who ask so much for such a cheap product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it. She doesnt have to fill 2 hummer feeders per day.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m not a review writer by any means but when I get a good product, I like to call out the company. I was a little reluctant to buy this feeder because quite honestly, it looked cheap from the picture. I was also reluctant because some feeders allow the bees to get in it. I was surprised number one because the plastic is durable and what do ya know, no bees. I have read some reviews that it&#x27;s hard to clean. Not for me. I use a baby bottle brush for all my feeders and it works just fine. Also every time I get a new feeder my birds are a little shy. Not on this feeder! I filled it up, ten seconds later, they were all over it! I will be purchasing more of these. Kudos!  *second submission to this review. I have ordered two more as they are the BEST feeders!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this model.  Easy to fill, hang, and no drips.  Love the large size.</li>
    <li> This looked good online; and I&#x27;ve owned other hum feeders by this manufacturer which I have been very pleased with.  They are easy to clean. Rated Very Good by Warehouse Deals, I guess it was rated by a person who doesn&#x27;t know a hummingbird feeder is supposed to be hung. The one I got had very obviously had the top hook broken off; making it not very good at all.</li>
    <li> ...but they claim it&#x27;s bee and wasp resistant.  Not true. I bought too late in the season to see how the hummers will like it, but not so late to notice that it is NOT bee and wasp resistant.</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of hummingbirds these feeders are the ticket.  I have two of these feeders up at a time in the summer and have to refill them couple of times a week.  I love my birds and have had friends and family buy me fancy decorative feeders over the years but the birds don&#x27;t care for them.  they like plain and simple..... these are it.  have used this brand for many years now and they are superior.</li>
    <li> We have LOTS of hummingbirds!  During peak season, I refill three 48-ounce feeders daily; I hoped the 72-ounce would eliminate some work.  Not happening!  Birds don&#x27;t seem to like the flat perch area.  They&#x27;ll swoop in and fly off.  Nectar has spoiled for both fillings since birds are not staying to drink.  However, the 48-ounce feeder, hanging near the larger one, empties quickly.</li>
    <li> It simply is just what I wanted and works like a charm. Hummers are busy (when it&#x27;s WARM out lately!)&lt;br /&gt;I even dropped it (full!) with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this...</li>
    <li> Feeder worked very good in dry weather however in the rain the well would fill with water.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased the large capacity feeders.  I have had 8 birds on each feeder at the same time, so apparently the design enables them to feel comfortable.  At peak use I have gone from filling the feeders every other day to filling them twice a week.</li>
    <li> I have had it hung in front yard over azealia bushes for 2 weeks and thus far have seen 2 humming birds.  I made the food according to the directions on the bottle so don&#x27;t know what the problem is.</li>
    <li> I recently moved from Southern CA to Arizona.  In Laguna Beach I had 4 feeders that fed over 60 birds every day.  The feeders were made with a combination of hard plastic and glass containers with a pace for the birds to land.  I half-filled each container with sugar and mixed it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 72oz feeder hold a large amount of food for the birds and the container is a soft plastic.  It does have a very narrow neck so you will need a funnel to fill this feeder.  I was told that this feeder keeps the bees away because they cannot reach the sugar water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So har I have only seen a couple of birds stop to feed, but it has been hout and I have not been here long.  In Laguna Beach I had a private deck with many plant, flowers and bushes, not I am in an apartment building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching hummingbirds has brought me hours of pleasure I hope they come again.  It took time to get the birds to bring their friends in Laguna beach- it looks like it may take time again..</li>
    <li> Normal feeders have to filled twice a day and this feeder is great and does not have to be filled as often.  The one drawback is the plastic cracks and breaks after only one summer.</li>
    <li> We were going through about a gallon a day of hummy food and needed larger feeders. The picture of the feeder on Amazon was not impressive but we needed the capacity so we took a chance. We got 4!  They are made of heavy duty plastic all around. Most hummy feeders have delicate bits that break easily.  They are easy to clean. They make the hummies land to eat, which created a more social civil environment. I think we have had scores of feeders over the years.  These are the best we&#x27;ve owned.  Probably why they&#x27;re called Best-1.  We love these feeders!</li>
    <li> The hummingbirds at our house consumes 1-1/2 gallons of sugar water in 2 days.  I have been using quart bottle feeders and now I can put out 2 - 72 oz and 3 - 32 oz feeders with about 2 gallons for almost 3 days.</li>
    <li> very nice, last a long time, holds a lot, will last for 5 days, but we have 3 other smaller ones...but lot of birds. only wish the mouth was a little&lt;br /&gt;larger, to make it easier to fill and clean</li>
    <li> I love these hummingbird feeder, they don&#x27;t drip and six hummingbird can feed at one time.&lt;br /&gt;and i only have to fill them once a week!</li>
    <li> This is the best humming bird feeder I have owned.  We have lots and lots of humming birds, we own 4 of these and I still can&#x27;t keep up with the little critters!</li>
    <li> Biggest I have seen...works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these feeders due to the 72 ounce capacity. It&#x27;s perfect since we had to go out of town for 4 days and when returning had just enough left to refill. Our hummingbird population as increased and it&#x27;s so beautiful to see them!</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of hummers, or you plan on being away for some time or both, this feeder is the way to go.  When my wife has 20+ hummers all day every day, and we know we will be away for several days, she fills three of these 72 ounce feeders along with 6 or more smaller varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have only say 3 hummers, this is not for you, because the syrup will most likely spoil before 1/4 has been used.</li>
    <li> Great solution for someone who goes through fifty lbs of sugar a month! You don&#x27;t have to fill so often!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 last year. Gave in to a friend. I&#x27;ve had enough birds to keep the 72 ounce bottle up. After I purchased 3 more and a replacement bottom, I&#x27;ve had  3 72 pincer up and have to refill once a week. Their numbers are increasing and I  may have to use my other one soon. Love this feeder</li>
