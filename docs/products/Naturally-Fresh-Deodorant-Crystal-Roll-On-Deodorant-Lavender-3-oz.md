### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So I heard about this brand from Food Babe (she&#x27;s awesome - check her out)</li>
      <li>Works great and lasts for months!</li>
      <li>so i was very happy to find this product..</li>
      <li>Best deodorant I have ever used!!</li>
      <li>Great scent.  </li>
      <li>It took me about 6 weeks to fully detox from my anti-perspirant, but now I&#x27;m so happy I made this change.</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant!!</li>
      <li>I must say I love it!!</li>
      <li>order received quickly in good condition.  </li>
      <li>The lavender is pleasant and for the most part it works great.</li>
      <li>I like it MUCH better than the unscented!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff because it does not have all the chemicals that most deodorants have and it smells really good!</li>
      <li>Love it, and the safety factor!</li>
      <li>I use both the unscented and lavender and love them both!</li>
      <li>It has a nice hint of lavender.  </li>
      <li>Works nicely throughout the day.</li>
      <li>afterall you need some kind of deodorant.</li>
      <li>I switched from an anti-perspirant about a year ago and to be honest</li>
      <li>It did not take forever to dry, did not have that deodorant smell, did not stain my clothes and best of all it worked beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Goes on clean and has a very nice lavender smell.</li>
      <li>This is the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
      <li>The best natural deodorant available!</li>
      <li>The first (Nourish Organic) had a great smell, but I had to re-apply 2-3 times a day.  </li>
      <li>It does not stop moisture as it does not contain the controversial aluminum zirconium like most drugstore brands do.</li>
      <li>Love it l been using this deodorant for about 10 years.</li>
      <li>Not too sure about the lavender, but overall it works great!</li>
      <li>Love the lavender scent.</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing again. : )</li>
      <li>but this is second best.</li>
      <li>I think the Lavender is a nice fresh scent too.</li>
      <li>The smell of the deodorant isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to be done with regular antiperspirants full of aluminum!</li>
      <li>No natural deodorant will stop you from sweating, but the good news is we&#x27;re supposed to sweat!</li>
      <li>This one has been the most effective in eliminating odors so far without irritation.</li>
      <li>I have not had any success with smelling better.</li>
      <li>Aluminum free</li>
      <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and finally found this one, and it has been the best!</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
      <li>but well worth it!</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to find something natural that works</li>
      <li>The seller delivered quickly and item was as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical before trying this type of deodorant...but after getting excellent results from trying the fragrance-free one first, I decided to go for the scented...and its even better.  </li>
      <li>After a couple weeks I suffered a very allergic reaction (I&#x27;m not allergic to anything!!)</li>
      <li>It has a light fresh lavender smell, and is so gentle on my underarms.</li>
      <li>Make sure to hold the bottle upside down when applying to make sure the product is in contact with the roll on and comes out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very runny when applied (this is true for any roll on, so not just a flaw with this brand).  </li>
      <li>I am testing Naturally Fresh&#x27;s odor control potency and live in the cool NE:</li>
      <li>I am actually allergic to most preservatives found in all beauty products.</li>
      <li>The first I tried was Primal Pit Paste.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>, I would use baking soda only, which works better than anything bottled but it irritates my skin, some people don&#x27;t have issue like my daughter</li>
      <li>Smelled great and certainly better than Truly, a natural deodorant with baking powder that left my underarms raw.</li>
      <li>(most organic or preservative free products are more expensive)</li>
      <li>I believe the product is a better quality deodorant than Tom&#x27;s of Main (I had to re-apply that one daily).</li>
      <li>If you are interested in using a more natural deodorant you&#x27;ll need to cultivate some patience around the transition your embarking on, especially if you&#x27;ve been using an anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>Naturally Fresh works better, but I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s the right one for me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last several months and love it!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very liquidy when I apply it</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d rather have multiple applications than use something filled with chemicals.</li>
      <li>this stuff works really well</li>
      <li>but it works very well.</li>
      <li>This deodorant manages to keep me pretty much odor free which is no small feat considering I workout regularly as well.</li>
      <li>and I live in the south where it gets so hot and humid.</li>
      <li>This is the first natural deodorant I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the nourish organic is a lot better.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day, after a normal working day, I do not smell.  </li>
      <li>I returned back to this product after a few months though and am so glad it works again!</li>
      <li>I try to live my life very naturally, and my deodorant choice was something I was hanging onto.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>First off, this deodorant does nothing for wetness, it only deals with odor.</li>
      <li>Refreshing but needs to be put in several times during an active day.</li>
      <li>It works ok, but I still have odor by late afternoon (it should be noted that I live in Texas,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this brand since switching to a natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>When switching to a natural deodorant, from an anti-perspirant, there will be an adjustment period while your body gets rid of the aluminum from the chemical based deodorant.</li>
      <li>I have read that it sometimes takes a couple months for your body to adjust to natural deodorants, so I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
      <li>This is a natural deodorant and not an antiperspirant so you will still sweat, its goal is to combat odor</li>
      <li>I am also a fan of natural products.  </li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I like it so far</li>
      <li>i just got this product and have worn it once so far</li>
      <li>i have developed an intolerance of antiperspirants and could not use them any longer</li>
      <li>The only drawbacks are it goes on wet and stays wet for awhile until it dries, and by the end of the day I could use a reapplication as it wears off a little, but other than that I am thrilled with this product!!</li>
      <li>It only has 7 ingredients, all of which are very natural.</li>
      <li>I have been using natural deoderant for some time, as I break out when I use the regular antiperspirant/deoderant.  </li>
      <li>This is the 2nd all natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is when it is first applied it is VERY wet.</li>
      <li>Yes after a hard day you may smell a little, but most deodorants are that way.</li>

    <li> It goes on soaking wet and stays wet for at least 10 minutes - even after 30 it feels damp and sticky.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant out there. It actually blocks odor completely and doesn&#x27;t require repeated applications throughout the day like other products. Make sure to hold the bottle upside down when applying to make sure the product is in contact with the roll on and comes out. I&#x27;m happy to be done with regular antiperspirants full of aluminum!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised. I am actually allergic to most preservatives found in all beauty products. Preservatives are common in all shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, hair productions, deodorant, everything. I decided to give this a try because it was inexpensive (most organic or preservative free products are more expensive) and I&#x27;m tired of itching to death for odor control. This stuff works and I am not allergic. Yes, it goes on wet (but all roll-ons do) and then dries after several minutes.  It controls smell and sweat, and, I am over 40 (hormones change as you age). I am thrilled to find something natural that works and I&#x27;m not allergic!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well for me :/. And it&#x27;s very liquidy when I apply it</li>
    <li> The best natural deodorant available!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Makes me sweat more and leaves me smelling awful. The smell of the deodorant isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
    <li> i have developed an intolerance of antiperspirants and could not use them any longer so i was very happy to find this product..afterall you need some kind of deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I replaced my Ban roll on with this aluminum-free deodorant. This is a great product that keeps me dry and odor free. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It takes a while for it to dry but it works very well.</li>
    <li> The seller delivered quickly and item was as advertised.  I believe the product is a better quality deodorant than Tom&#x27;s of Main (I had to re-apply that one daily). I am testing Naturally Fresh&#x27;s odor control potency and live in the cool NE: On day two with no re-application necessary. So far so good. Odor is still gone. It does not stop moisture as it does not contain the controversial aluminum zirconium like most drugstore brands do. YaY! Aluminum free and it works for me!!  Love the lavender scent. Will be purchasing again. : )</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I like it so far but I feel like I need to take an extra one to work because it definitely needs an extra use through the day. It won&#x27;t last the entire day and night like traditional deodorants. But I&#x27;d rather have multiple applications than use something filled with chemicals.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is too wet. It takes forever to dry. I have not had any success with smelling better. Oops!</li>
    <li> Smelled great and certainly better than Truly, a natural deodorant with baking powder that left my underarms raw. But doesnt keep you dry.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all for me. I use Pit Paste but some times it irritates me so wanted to try some knew. With in a few hours I had to reapply.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before trying this type of deodorant...but after getting excellent results from trying the fragrance-free one first, I decided to go for the scented...and its even better.  I protects you and doesn&#x27;t leave your clothes stained like regular deodorants.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves the smell and how it works.</li>
    <li> Refreshing but needs to be put in several times during an active day. Still happier than putting harmful aluminum on!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it does not have all the chemicals that most deodorants have and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Works pretty well.  Just very long to dry.  Air out before dressing!</li>
    <li> This is my fav deodorant. Yes after a hard day you may smell a little, but most deodorants are that way. The lavender is pleasant and for the most part it works great. Ive tried other crystal deodorants and they dont compare to this.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Not too sure about the lavender, but overall it works great!</li>
    <li> i just got this product and have worn it once so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this brand since switching to a natural deodorant. This is a natural deodorant and not an antiperspirant so you will still sweat, its goal is to combat odor and it does that for me well . It does take a while to dry after application but I whip out the hair dryer to speed it up. I took a star away because this one is suppose to be scented opposed to the unscented ones I usually purchase so I was looking forward to a scent but after this dries, there&#x27;s no scent at all. So this ended up being a unnecessary purchase for me. I&#x27;ll stick to the cheaper unscented version I find in store.</li>
    <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have ever tried.  It did not take forever to dry, did not have that deodorant smell, did not stain my clothes and best of all it worked beautifully.  and I am a heavy sweater(?).  Has me convinced.</li>
    <li> Love it, and the safety factor!</li>
    <li> Wish it worked a bit stronger but I am VERY active so I guess I cant complain. Great coverage. I like it MUCH better than the unscented!</li>
    <li> this stuff works really well, I would use baking soda only, which works better than anything bottled but it irritates my skin, some people don&#x27;t have issue like my daughter but this is second best.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it never leaves yellowing or other debris behind on your clothes.  Plus using this is safer than the commercial products that contain alum and other toxic ingredients that are factually known to cause cancer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one as well as the nourish organic brand. Hands down the nourish organic is a lot better. This one seems to stay very wet once applied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last several months and love it! I switched from an anti-perspirant about a year ago and to be honest it was a process, but well worth it! I try to live my life very naturally, and my deodorant choice was something I was hanging onto. If you are interested in using a more natural deodorant you&#x27;ll need to cultivate some patience around the transition your embarking on, especially if you&#x27;ve been using an anti-perspirant. First off, this deodorant does nothing for wetness, it only deals with odor. No natural deodorant will stop you from sweating, but the good news is we&#x27;re supposed to sweat! It is one of the big ways our bodies shed toxins. When switching to a natural deodorant, from an anti-perspirant, there will be an adjustment period while your body gets rid of the aluminum from the chemical based deodorant. It took me about 6 weeks to fully detox from my anti-perspirant, but now I&#x27;m so happy I made this change. I have tried many natural deodorants and finally found this one, and it has been the best! It only has 7 ingredients, all of which are very natural. It has a light fresh lavender smell, and is so gentle on my underarms. Some days I do need to reapply depending on my activity level, etc. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a few natural deodorants: tom&#x27;s, Crystal, etc. This one has been the most effective in eliminating odors so far without irritation. I have very sensitive skin and I live in the south where it gets so hot and humid. This deodorant manages to keep me pretty much odor free which is no small feat considering I workout regularly as well. The only downside is when it is first applied it is VERY wet.</li>
    <li> I have been using natural deoderant for some time, as I break out when I use the regular antiperspirant/deoderant.  I am also a fan of natural products.  This deoderant actually works, unlike the Tom&#x27;s of Maine and some other kinds I have tried. By the end of the day, after a normal working day, I do not smell.  I think the Lavender is a nice fresh scent too.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!! After learning about the harm that typical deodorants do, I decided to switch to a natural deodorant. The first I tried was Primal Pit Paste. After a couple weeks I suffered a very allergic reaction (I&#x27;m not allergic to anything!!) and had to stop using. I even tried their lm&amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; but they didn&#x27;t with and stained my shirts when I swear!! So I heard about this brand from Food Babe (she&#x27;s awesome - check her out) and she recommended this brand. I must say I love it!! The only drawbacks are it goes on wet and stays wet for awhile until it dries, and by the end of the day I could use a reapplication as it wears off a little, but other than that I am thrilled with this product!! I&#x27;ve even purchased some for my parents too! I use both the unscented and lavender and love them both!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd all natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.  The first (Nourish Organic) had a great smell, but I had to re-apply 2-3 times a day.  Naturally Fresh works better, but I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s the right one for me.  It&#x27;s very runny when applied (this is true for any roll on, so not just a flaw with this brand).  It has a nice hint of lavender.  I have read that it sometimes takes a couple months for your body to adjust to natural deodorants, so I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.  It works ok, but I still have odor by late afternoon (it should be noted that I live in Texas, so any deodorant has it&#x27;s work cut out for it). Overall, I would still rather use natural deodorant (given the challenges with performance) than risk my health with the chemicals in non-natural deodorants (because even Secret doesn&#x27;t really work on me).</li>
    <li> Love it l been using this deodorant for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> Goes on clean and has a very nice lavender smell. Works nicely throughout the day.</li>
    <li> order received quickly in good condition.  Works well.  Does not irritate skin.</li>
    <li> Thankful for this product as I look to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; up my routines. I found that after a month or so of using it, my body adjusted and I needed to go to another brand. I returned back to this product after a few months though and am so glad it works again!</li>
