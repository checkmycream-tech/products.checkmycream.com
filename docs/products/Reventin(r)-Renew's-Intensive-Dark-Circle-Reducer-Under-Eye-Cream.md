<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did nothing for my dark circles. Mine are more like bruising around my eyes. I don&#x27;t have bags and I get plenty of sleep.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that actually did what it said it would, lightening my dark circles!!! You do have to use it again at night, but this is a first for me for a product to lighten circles without concealer. I do, however, use concealer also.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that is hard to judge.  I have been using it daily for a while now and I think the dark circles under my eyes are a little better but I am not sure.  It definitely didn&#x27;t erase the dark circles completely.  If I had to guess, I would say about a 25% improvement.</li>
    <li> A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ my cream smells great and so far it is working.Thank you I&#x27;m very happy with my order. And i received it very fast.</li>
    <li> I use this product for under eye circles.  So far so good on the results at this time.  Other consumers may try this product and get different results.  It depends on the individual.</li>
    <li> Just okay  Any change--  not really</li>
    <li> No results  at all for me :(</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a change as of yet. I will continue all of the product. I hope it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> It helped my dark circles a lot.</li>
    <li> been using for a month, don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> They should not be allowed to say it helps get rid of under eye puffiness.  That is what directed me to buy the product with the great reviews  - the main problem I have.  It&#x27;s the only product I have used so far that actually made the puffiness worse and also created hoods above my eyes. I researched ingredients and continued use of them has an effect that causes sagging - not firming.  Now I look like I need a facelift that I cannot afford.  Hopefully I can find a product now that will reverse the damage this product did.  Also came across information that cucumber does not help get rid of puffiness.  It is the coldness of cucumbers out of the fridge that are actually doing the job - not the cucumber itself.  Who will make this right?</li>
    <li> it is not an oily moisturizer and works well on entire face</li>
    <li> Still to early to rate this...I do like what im seeing so far. If anything ive notice less puffiness.  The dark circles are still evident.  Its only been about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I used the product for only  three nights and it breaks me out. I guess my skin is sensitive/react to the cream.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,no visible improvements to dark circles.Nothing but a moisturizer ,save your money or try some other types or brands.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It really works.</li>
    <li> This cream is also  very helpful in reducing puffy eyes. It is quickly absorbed, has no ordor, is gentle to the delicate eye area, and can be used under makeup as well as at nighttime.  From on line price comparisons, I found this seller&#x27;s price was the lowest. The order arrived ahead of schedule, in a compact,  easy to open compact box, along with a free gift for a reventin firming neck gel. I will give this a fair try, and if it is as good as the eye cream will order it separately.  Very well pleased with this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> It did not appear to help my dark circles, however, I do like the texture and ease of use. I used it also as a moisturizer for my whole face.</li>
    <li> It really works and I will definitely order this product again</li>
    <li> I think I am starting to see a difference in my circles but I have been using it for a while now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 weeks thus far.  It&#x27;s very hydrating and has a great texture.  I don&#x27;t normally have dark circles or bags under my eyes, but I&#x27;ve had recent surgery and haven&#x27;t been sleeping.  It&#x27;s definitely reduced the puffiness and made me look more awake.  A little seems to go a long way.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this even when I begin to sleep normally again, because my sensitive skin seems to drink it in.  Since I don&#x27;t have wrinkles under my eyes, I can&#x27;t speak to that.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a new eye product.</li>
    <li> Got this 4 days ago and already see a difference :) I&#x27;ve dark circles my whole life an it&#x27;s embarrassing to go out without makeup. I already feel more confident :) makes my skin feel amazing to :)</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet because I am using another product at the moment .but I let my friend use it for 3 weeks and she said it is really helping the dark circles. She said her makeup no longer makes her look old in the under eye area. Super happy</li>
    <li> It adds moisture for sure but I am not sure if it really works in reducing dark circles under the eye.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve fought with dark circles my entire life! I have only used this product for a week and can see a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;My dark circles are not completely gone but have improved dramatically almost instantly. I have tried numerous products That promised to rid me of dark circles this one does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have crows feet and under eye circles have been using this product for 2 weeks and so far no results. Based on the good reviews this stuff works and it may be too soon to see results, so I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Unsure but seems to be working slowly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, and I&#x27;ve actually developed pimples under my eyes. I don&#x27;t wear make up, so that couldn&#x27;t be to blame. I just found It odd because it claims it&#x27;s good for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Works fine ...after the first week I coul start to see differences</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone in my household that uses this a lot instead of buying in a store, it was a little cheaper here.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a definite change. Using the product for about 2 months</li>
