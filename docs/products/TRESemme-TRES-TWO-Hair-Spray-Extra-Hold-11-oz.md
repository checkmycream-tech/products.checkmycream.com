      <li>This product makes my hair stay straight for more than a day !!!!</li>
      <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
      <li>My daughter is a hair dresser, so she has access to just about any kind of hair spray out there.</li>
      <li>The smells is nice because it&#x27;s not overpowering or chemical smelling.</li>
      <li>I discovered this by accident when my own hairspray ran out.  </li>
      <li>I knew it was too good to be true!</li>
      <li>However, you will not need to wear any perfume cause this has a very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure, though, that it would work well with many hair types!</li>
      <li>A nice citrus y scent that&#x27;s just a bit overwhelming, coming from my head.</li>
      <li>I get the highest numbers because I have very fine hair.)</li>
      <li>is very cheap in wallmart</li>
      <li>It also has a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I also love that amazon will ship this aerosol, since most of the time, businesses won&#x27;t ship most liquids or aerosols.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it lastes for a day is outstanding, on top of that</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>As product, it is cheap, but in our case, adding the shipping (twice the product&#x27;s price!)</li>
      <li>But after fixing my distance of spraying, it was much better.</li>
      <li>I really love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Even if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the hold, I would keep it for the anti flaking.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a smell to it (which I don&#x27;t mind at all), but overall, for the price, it is a great product!</li>
      <li>I feel like this is for more formal looks that you&#x27;re going for.</li>
      <li>Yay! :)</li>
      <li>will be glad when thisreturnes</li>
      <li>I love this hair spray and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to spray in well ventilated area.</li>
      <li>glad</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair spray.</li>
      <li>i would love to get one</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the hold but the scent suffocates me.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the most natural/organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it could get any better for the price.</li>
      <li>Tresemme is one of the better hair sprays that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>There is no nasty smell, either, like some hair sprays have.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>more than 5 mins.&lt;br</li>
      <li>#4 is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It is very humid in the South and this does a great job all day.  </li>
      <li>it hold ok.  </li>
      <li>I think it smells mostly like the alcohol it&#x27;s made out of, it&#x27;s no herbal essences that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, light colored hair.  </li>
      <li>So my review reflects, mostly, her opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it arrived much earlier than it was planned and in very good shape.&lt;br</li>
      <li>when i tried this i was so excited to see that my curls lasted all day!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on what my wife said, the product confirms that is really very good, for both smell and the capacity to last all day, even for a hair like hers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product and it&#x27;s great hairspray HOWEVER all 4 cans were without their caps and rolling loose in the shipping box. Not 1can was full. Hairspray all over box. Nozzles damaged. Threw the entire purchase in the trash as the smell was terrible!</li>
    <li> bad sticky and lay the hair down</li>
    <li> Since I have &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; hair, no ordinary holding spray will do. Tresemme&#x27;s Extra Hold does the job effectively without feeling heavy. Nice trick! No other spray holds this well for me.</li>
    <li> I always use this hairspray but everytime I go to buy, everyone is always out or they have it priced so high I will not buy it. Found it on Amazon and was so glad to get a quantity to last me at a good price.  It is the best product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use product in my hair, but sometimes it is unavoidable.  When that time comes, I love the tresemme extra hold hair spray.  It is the best holding product that I have found.  I don&#x27;t use gels because they have a habit of flaking.  This is what I use to hold my hair up and reduce fly aways.  It usually holds for 6 hours without needing a touch up.  I also love that amazon will ship this aerosol, since most of the time, businesses won&#x27;t ship most liquids or aerosols.  This stuff is great and lasts a long time with daily use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to hairspray, but I&#x27;m liking this a lot. I&#x27;ve had lots of difficulty with hairspray, but this holds pretty well and it&#x27;s still the same hold at the end of the day for me. The best part for me though is NO FLAKING!! OMG I can&#x27;t stand those white flakes. Even if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the hold, I would keep it for the anti flaking. Yay! :)</li>
    <li> Like the product. Good packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using salon brands for years but I was at the supermarket and I saw this and decided to give it a spin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This spray is like crazy glue for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day and simply does NOT give out.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Effective.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Always a good call. #4 is my favorite. I&#x27;d much rather shop online. Does it&#x27;s job well</li>
    <li> Good product.  I have used this product for several years and like it very much.  I ordered it online to save time.</li>
    <li> My first time using a hair product, this was suggested to me by sales. Since i never touched one, i dont really know what to do with it so i simply just sprayed it over the places that i want to hold. And suprisingly thats it! thats all you need to do spray and done! well, maybe give it a little tuning to get the exact hair u want. but This hairspray was so easy, and good that even a starter like me could use it to its fullest potential! The fact that it lastes for a day is outstanding, on top of that when i had to run laps for Gym in school it still held my hair as if i was just walking! Absolutely a fantastic hairspray.</li>
    <li> I used Paul Mitchell hairspray which cost a fortune, but I loved it. I needed a little spray for my purse, so I got this hairspray in the 1 ounce size. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was almost exactly like Paul Mitchell. When I ran out of Paul Mitchell, I bought the full-size version of this. Make sure you get the EXTRA hold (4). It holds without looking like a helmet.</li>
    <li> It does not clump in your hair and holds well.  It works well in the humidity also.  Best hairspray that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I tend to style my hair with pomade for a more natural look but occasionally like to use hairspray for a more formal look. After taking a shower I dry and style my hair before spraying some of this on and I am good to go. Warning: a little of this spray goes a long way. The hairspray holds true, doesn&#x27;t smell, isn&#x27;t TOO shiny, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky finish. Overall, I am very happy with this hairspray especially at this price with free PRIME shipping.</li>
    <li> Hi    I&#x27;m an international customer who placed an order. I was so happy with the service I received. My products were shipped immediately and arrived so soon after ordering it I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I have used this product and would recommend it to everyone. It smells great and really holds hair well without making it hard.</li>
    <li> I have long but super fine, thin hair.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble using hairspray because all it ever did was weigh down my hair, make it really unmanageable and stuck together, or hard as a rock.  This hairspray I bought on a whim and I probably won&#x27;t buy any other hairspray but this from now on.  It&#x27;s so light I could spray all day and my hair wouldn&#x27;t get weighed down.  On top of that, it holds whatever style I decide to do very well.  It&#x27;s easy to brush out, doesn&#x27;t make my hair stick together and gives it so much volume.   I realized it actually improves the look of my hair in another way: my hair can get really oily after sleeping on it so I have to pretty much wash my hair right away each morning, but one night I after I had slept with a bunch of this hair spray in, my hair was SO nice looking the next day and still voluminous! Not oily at all! It wasn&#x27;t a fluke either--it happens each time I use this hairspray.   I love this hairspray and I would definitely recommend it, especially for those who have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I use it for my combover and it works well. Would buy again because of its strong hold and little mess.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hairspray often or in great quantity.  Aqua-net works fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t find it on Amazon so I gave this a try.  for the price I&#x27;m happy.  But a little goes a very long way.  If you use too much you might have to work a bit to shampoo it out.  I&#x27;d give it a C+ or B-.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds very well &amp; lasts for several hours. However, you will not need to wear any perfume cause this has a very strong fragrance. A nice citrus y scent that&#x27;s just a bit overwhelming, coming from my head. The weather&#x27;s warming up &amp; if someone decides to summon CANDYMAN I will definitely be under attack. Lol. So, I&#x27;m gonna look for this in unscented.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife, after she discovered, during our visit in US in 2007, that Tresemme is the best hairspray for her hair. So my review reflects, mostly, her opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it arrived much earlier than it was planned and in very good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Based on what my wife said, the product confirms that is really very good, for both smell and the capacity to last all day, even for a hair like hers. As product, it is cheap, but in our case, adding the shipping (twice the product&#x27;s price!) the result is somehow different. She was glad anyway and for me that really matters.&lt;br /&gt;She likes it also due to the lack of flakes or other rests from some other hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;Well recommended (by my wife!).</li>
    <li> Very good hair spray. It holds the hair quite long. Used it around 7 am, still holds up my hair when I get back home around 9pm. I run in and out of the office pretty much the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: does the job. holds the hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: cant find any yet.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this hairspray.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of spray on a day to day basis, but when I do, I like it to work.  This stuff will hold your hair in place.  This is not sold at my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> It simply works for me!  It never failed me after all these yrs.&lt;br /&gt;It holds for a whole day until you wash it away.</li>
    <li> Unbeatable performance for the price. Comparable to much much higher priced salon brand paul mitchel extra hold but under $4 at time of review.    This spray is a smooth even mist thicker and stronger than than their brown label ultra fine mist which I have also used and reviewed here on amazon. The difference between the two is huge. While this spray has a fine mist, its not as fine as the ultra fine mist version. Hold is lightyears ahead on this version over the other. Hold can leave your hair hard depending on the amount of spray making it better suited for certain hairstyles and or windy days. Hold can last all day and stand up to wind. Extra hair spray is needed on those very windy days. Unlike the ultra fine mist version, this version is not a good shaping hairspray. It is best used to hold your hair after being styled. With that being said, this hairspray is not for everyone. Depending on the amount used the hold can be so strong that it can withstand a full day of riding world class roller coasters from six flags magic mountain. At the end of that day my hair was still stiff and in style, but ofcourse I had to use plenty of spray to achieve this hold. (EDIT) This spray does not leave flakes like cheaper hairsprays.    Quality is typical TRESemme quality, PROFESSIONAL quality. It is on par with similar salon brand products and in my opinion slightly better than paul mitchel extra hold. TRESemme is unmatched in anything near its price range. For that reason this hairspray is usually out of stock along with its matching mousse at walmart.    Being a guy, I like to u use this spray while my hair is still lightly wet and style and upon drying this spray leaves your hair hard like high performance gel. I prefer this spray over gel because I can get the same results as gel and also have dry hair styles which gel cant do and still have great hold.    Also in my experience with this hairspray, I have found out that this hairspray can withstand water such as light rain and upon drying retain its hardness. However this effect is gone after being wet again.    I have used this spray for several years now and it is my favorite. I also feel the need to mention that the hold is not as strong as it used to be. Both me and my wife have noticed this. It seemed to have happened a few months before walmart started to stock the purple version of the hairspray with even more hold.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. I have decently thick, stick straight hair, so when i curl it, i like my curls to stay in tact, which is where this spray comes into play. It holds well without making your hair feel too crunchy. PLUS Tresemme does NOT test on animals, so i LOVE that!</li>
    <li> Really great hair spray! Keeps my hair in place and is touchable (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or flake when you, or someone else, plays with your hair) Strong, feminine fragrance though... and it doesn&#x27;t have the most natural/organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair after a certain length, so I was looking for a spray that would hold down the curls.  While this spray does work somewhat, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I was hoping.  About 30 min after spraying curls start sprouting which is no bueno.</li>
    <li> Tresemme products are always on point. I&#x27;ve tried the other version of this hairspray, the mega firm control (purple), and it&#x27;s just as good as this one. Honestly I can&#x27;t tell the difference. This is one of the only hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave residue in the form of those white dandruff-esque flakes. It holds all day (and night) and washes out easy. I use it mainly for getting rid of flyaways. Spray then brush through quickly because it sets fast. Yes it will make your hair crunchy and stiff if you use a lot but that&#x27;s to be said of every hairspray. The smell, hm... it&#x27;s hard to describe. Someone said citrus-y and I don&#x27;t really agree. I think it smells mostly like the alcohol it&#x27;s made out of, it&#x27;s no herbal essences that&#x27;s for sure. I didn&#x27;t find it to be too strong at all though.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, light colored hair.  Most Hairspray&#x27;s dry out my hair, make it sticky, and don&#x27;t hold my style long.  It is very humid in the South and this does a great job all day.  Only thing I would change is the scent, I don&#x27;t care much for it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for the humidity or holding your curls. I knew it was too good to be true! Never getting this product again !</li>
    <li> Sometimes a quick order on Amazon beats driving to CVS and when I got this hair spray, I was really happy because it&#x27;s now my new favorite.  Smells so good, and works so well.  Bottom line, I&#x27;m going to be hiding this one from the rest of the family and keeping it all to myself.</li>
    <li> Now THIS is some powerful spray. I can take shower in the morning, go through a full day of business work where my hands are yanking at my hair, and this will still hold in place. Many times I&#x27;ll wake up the next morning and my hair will still be presentable, even if I only spray a small amount.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this spray, but of the handful of other hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the most tolerable AND it holds my hair like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best use is for short hair that you can spike up, but even when I grew out my hair longer it&#x27;s still a solid hold.  I think it even adds some volume to my hair, too.</li>
    <li> I have super fine and thin hair--this hairspray provides body and hold without weighing my hair down or creating a &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> The spray has a extremely strong hold, the spray holds your hair in a style even a day after applying it. It has \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; smell to it, and it makes your hair look darker, gets rid of frizz, and only costs 3 dollars... its a steal. I buy at least one bottle a month, it really works!</li>
    <li> i have used tresemme for probably 10 or 12 years or more and it works great on my fine hard to hold hair</li>
    <li> Description says two extra hold bottles, if you scroll down it says pack of one. Quite misleading. I paid $9 for one hairspray when they are really about $4.</li>
    <li> Daughter purchased when purchasing wand....holds her curls great and lasts all day through.  Would definitely buy again and great service.</li>
    <li> This hair spray has great all day hold; it is not stiff; it can be combed through; it is not sticky; it is buildable- you can use more or less, depending on the degree of hold you desire; can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. I have used hair sprays that were almost ten times this price and still like this one so much better. Will never use another hair spray- LOVE!</li>
    <li> I can sometimes find the Tresemme locally for as good a price as online, but I believe I was trying to find a low price &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; for a $35 order (and save shipping). This seemed like a good item to put in my order. Have used the TTTEH for years and never buy anything else now. I get the highest numbers because I have very fine hair.)</li>
    <li> This hairspray is a fine mist and doesn&#x27;t go on sticky. It&#x27;s great to spray on then brush through. I use it daily and it lasts well all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair spray. Helps keep hold even when it is hot, humid, muggy, etc. I use it in combo with a matte paste, and the result is great. The spray can seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair stay straight for more than a day !!!! I would definitely buy again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good !</li>
    <li> Both sprays leak down your hand when button is pressed.</li>
    <li> Only one can, not two. I was ripped off</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with hairsprays, so I relied on the reviews of others to find a spray that would not weigh down my very fine hair.  This is a great product, it holds hair in place and seems very light.  I tend to spray, let it set and then run my fingers through my hair so it has some natural movement but still holds its shape.  Great for the price, too.</li>
    <li> This product really holds your hair in place! I have thin hair though so that&#x27;s what customer I&#x27;m speaking to. I&#x27;m sure, though, that it would work well with many hair types! If you are looking for something super lightweight that doesn&#x27;t look like your hair has hairspray in it then this might not be for you. I feel like this is for more formal looks that you&#x27;re going for. If you want beach waves that are natural looking then you might want not as strong a hold like this one. At the same time, you can spray it in your hair and wait for it to dry and then run your fingers through or lightly brush through your hair and it will definitely soften your hair a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good long lasting hairspray to use when I straighten my hair I have naturally curly hair, but straighten and then curl the ends. This will hold the volume I add for hours and keep the flyaways at bay. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried does that. You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> It does provide a strong hold, something you may want on a windy day or in high humidity.  I can recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use hairspray, but when I do, I think I&#x27;ll stick with this product. It&#x27;s light, dries quick, and keeps the hair in place for easy styling. There&#x27;s a smell to it (which I don&#x27;t mind at all), but overall, for the price, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I really love this hairspray. I used it to hold my flyaway hair when I put my hair up in a bun. It smelled really good and the spray gave some areas of my hair a \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; feeling, which was fine with me because it let me know that this product was indeed a firm hold. My only concern which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that after being outside for about 10 hours my hair was no longer holding in place. The hairspray says that it is a 24 hour hold which it is not.</li>
    <li> Made my hair crispy. But after fixing my distance of spraying, it was much better.</li>
    <li> I just buy this stuff because it works and is not expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy spray with super hold. Not for every day. For up do&#x27;s and days when you need to break out the big dogs. Will hold my style for 2 days. love it.</li>
    <li> Good hold good smell good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for a long time and never really thought about ordering this online. However, the price is great, so for now on will just tack it on to another order whenever I need it.  This is a great hairspray at a great price. I used to use the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; sprays and paid a pretty premium for it - upwards of $15 a can. But no more...</li>
    <li> I was initially impressed with all the good reviews that this hair spray got and, being that it is not expensive, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Holding power...just average.</li>
    <li> will be glad when thisreturnes</li>
    <li> My daughter is a hair dresser, so she has access to just about any kind of hair spray out there. Her choice is always Tresemme when she is doing her hair at home in the morning. I would say that is a good testimonial to the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I use this hair spray all the time, and even at the most expensive places in town, it is only $4.50.  I miss-read the info and thought it was going to be a twin pack based on the fact that it said &amp;#34;Tres Two&amp;#34; and based on the fact that the price was twice as much as I&#x27;ve seen it before. One can of hair spray was almost $10! Great product, but shop elsewhere for a better bargain!</li>
    <li> Another great value from Amazon: it takes little of this spray that holds perfectly and has a nice but not overwhelming fragrance.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray and have used it for years.  That is not the problem.  The Amazon title to this product says Tresemme Tres Two Extra Hold Hair Sprays!  I thought there were two, not one.</li>
    <li> It works. Might need to spray extra for korean hair, or other thick hair. The smell is pretty strong. gives me a headache. Make sure to spray in well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> This is great, but only as a style locker. I use the Big Sexy Hair Volumizing hairspray for volume, and this for holding the style. Used alone, this is too stiff, but in combo, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This is one of my main stables in the rotation. You see, I have held the record going on about 16 years now of &amp;#34;most awesome hair in the galaxy&amp;#34; award. my style steadily progresses and adapts as it see fits. and this hair spray will come through again and again no matter what my current style is. oh and it helps that the price is usually fabulous which further makes it a no brainer purchase. It also has a lovely scent. All in all - provides just the right amount of control, not too stiff unless used excessively, which i might do anyway sometimes. I tend to use a bit of mousse before applying this as a finisher. I like it.</li>
    <li> Bought this expecting it to be a travel sized bottle of hair spray, but ended up with a bigger bottle than expected.. I love the smell, and it holds really well, so there are no complaints about this hairspray!</li>
    <li> I miss read the description and thought I was suppose to receive three cans only received ONE can.  Be careful reading the Amazon product details so you won&#x27;t purchase something at a MUCH higher price than what you could purchase it at a regular retail store.  I love the hairspray just wasn&#x27;t happy overpaying for it.</li>
    <li> just a perfect hairspray when you are using topik holds it like a glue and never let you  down.. i recomend for topik users</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time it lasts 1-2 months. It holds hairstyles just the way you want , the only disadvantage is of you use it to close it smells like alcohol otherwise you&#x27;re good</li>
    <li> Another cosmetic-related product which I&#x27;d been looking for, it seems like, forever. This is excellent hair spray AND in a nice large size. Thanks again Amazon!</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting two for this price, but only got one.  I can buy it a lot cheaper in the drug store, but it&#x27;s not worth the shipping cost to send it back.  Won&#x27;t make this mistake again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for years now and I just cant have enough. I use it daily, and its perfect for me since I have thick, wavy, and frizzy hair. And it gets the job done!!! REMEMBER this is #4, so its a little more stronger than other selections Hope this helped!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received my hair spray its been over a month!&lt;br /&gt;so they just took my money. i would love to get one but i can&#x27;t even get ahold of them....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair spray that really tames my hair.  It holds curls really well and keeps hair shiny.</li>
    <li> As the label indicates, this hairspray does have a strong hold with a touchable feeling, indeed. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of hairspray or doing too much to my hair, however, it drove me crazy that my boyfriend would criticize the baby hairs on my forehead standing up tall every time I&#x27;d wear a pony-tail...Problem solved! This spray can hold my stubborn baby hairs for over 6 hours, easy. I also like the fact that the smell is not so strong as other I&#x27;ve experienced in the past (at hair salons).</li>
    <li> Nozzle clogged after a couple of uses.. Never sprayed again even after cleaning, etc.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold hair as I expect. It created the problem of dandruff. Since I used it my hair started falling more than the normal and lots of dandruff appeared.  I stopped using this. Before using this my hair was nice and it is impossible to wash hair everyday after using this. Not a good product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Holds my wife&#x27;s hair in place all day and she wouldn&#x27;t use any other hairspray. It seems to work for her.</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray. I don&#x27;t think it could get any better for the price. It was a lot larger than I expected. It holds my curls nice and feels natural.</li>
    <li> Great product, way better price than buying in a store.</li>
    <li> Great product. We love this in my house  also big size for a small price will use again thank you</li>
    <li> Use this everyday. I love it. Strong hold and gives you that wet-hair look. I buy one of these every month.</li>
    <li> Holds on hair really good, so far it&#x27;s better than Garnier and Alberto vo5. Has an extreme hold that I haven&#x27;t seen so far with other hair sprays. And like all of them, it is sticky but not that much, it is easily washable with shampoo and hand soap for sticky hands. The price is good for what you get compared to other brands. The hold lasts longer than other brand&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used. I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I used this the first time I used a curling wand on my hair.  My hair looked absolutely FABULOUS - like Veronica Lake&#x27;s - but as soon as I went outside in drizzly weather (with an umbrella!) my hair fell flat.  Absolutely flat.  All that time spent on the waves was wasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, it makes my scalp itch like crazy.  Not sure which ingredient doesn&#x27;t agree with me, but it&#x27;s not super attractive to go around scratching your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it gives me a white residue build up.  Other than that it hold ok.  The smell is ok too but not the greatest.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does the job nicely!  Nice price!  I am very dissapointed that this product and so many others have been taken off of the subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> This hairspray bottle is very large and will last a long time... for less than $5 as an add-on, it&#x27;s much cheaper than the grocery store. My hair tolerates it well and stays in place without looking sprayed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair spray. It was delivered quickly and is exactly as described. It is the best hair spray for the price for sure!</li>
    <li> This product has an excellent hold on my hair. I have stick straight hair naturally, so whenever I try to curl my hair it is a battle and i cant get it to stay for more than 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;So when i tried this i was so excited to see that my curls lasted all day! I absolutely love the hold but the scent suffocates me. It so so strong and im not a fan of it, but i love the hold so much that im willing to deal with it. Can someone please tell me if they make an unscented version? Thanks! Over all its a great HairSpray.</li>
    <li> I have really fine, thin, stringy hair that gets crispy with many hairsprays. I received a sample of this in one of my monthly makeup bags and almost instantly fell in love. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair all clumpy, yet it lasts all day long, at least 10+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;I use my flat iron every morning and then immediately follow up with several sprays of the Tresemme extra hold hair spray. The smells is nice because it&#x27;s not overpowering or chemical smelling. It doesn&#x27;t hang around for a long time after I spray it either which my husband absolutely hates.&lt;br /&gt;I really like everything about this hairspray and will continue to use it and recommend it to those with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered this by accident when my own hairspray ran out.  I liked it enough to purchase some for myself.  It holds well, and adds body to my hair.</li>
    <li> Very Nice product no complaints ! My girlfriend likes them.</li>
    <li> Works as promised and not tested on animals.  For the price and the word “TWO” in the title, I thought I was getting two cans.  Please be aware that you will only get ONE can.</li>
    <li> Makes hair stiff and sticky</li>
    <li> Came totally broken and unusable.</li>
    <li> is very cheap in wallmart</li>
    <li> I use this every day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 yrs now and it is my absolute favorite ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff really stinks (scent-wise). That said it gets the job done, it lasts and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I have soft wavy hair. Holds my hair professionally for the entire day.</li>
    <li> This is a great spray for women who like big hair but their own hair is thin. It sprays on with a light flow, not weighing your hair down just when you want it to stay fluffy and full. So a little backcombing, a spray, then lift while it is drying...my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> Never again! It throughs liquid. It doesn&#x27;t SPRAY!!!!!!!!}</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for several years now.  I discovered a can in my mom&#x27;s bathroom and became an instant fan.  It holds my very thick hair very well but never feels sticky.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the name, their products are supposed to be high quality and right up there with salon products. the spray holds well but the smell is very unpleasant and because of that I will not purchase again. You would think for the money they are charging for these products they would spend some on developing them with pleasant scents.</li>
    <li> Great, salon type hair spray at a good price.  I was using Big Sexy Hairspray but will not pay over $20 for a can of hs.</li>
    <li> The lid to my hairspray was totally broken</li>
    <li> I have always used a very expensive salon brand for volume, extra hold in humidity-this worked quite well at 1/3rd the cost. I will NOT be buying the salon brand anymore</li>
    <li> Tresemme is one of the better hair sprays that I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky with that unnatural shiny look.  It works really well.  It does need to be reapplied during the day, but that is a small trade off.  There is no nasty smell, either, like some hair sprays have.  It holds my hair in place and looks natural.  I really like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use too much, and your style won&#x27;t be going anywhere, even in humidity</li>
    <li> I have used Tresemme  Extra-Hold hair spray for sometime now and appreciate the hold it gives, yet brushes right out when I am ready.  It leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.  I prefer the spray to the other type as the nozzle does not get clogged.</li>
    <li> Always my go too. Great spray for guys hold but doesn&#x27;t make your head into a helmet. Inexpensive and easy to find.</li>
</ol>
