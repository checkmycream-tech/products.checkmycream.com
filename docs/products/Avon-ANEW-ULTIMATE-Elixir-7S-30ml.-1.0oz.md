    <li> Great product....always love this!</li>
    <li> No where near as good as its predecessor , which to my horror has been discontinued in favor of this product. No longer see the results I did from its forerunner  which I miss and search for all over Amazon.</li>
    <li> As soon as you smooth this serum on your face you will see a softening of your wrinkles.  I love it and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my fine wrinkles after a 30 day use.  I have been having much better results with ROC.</li>
    <li> I am 56-years-old. With age comes skin changes that we don&#x27;t like. I have spent a lot of money trying many, many products out there. I finally tried Avon Anew Ultimate Elixir and what a difference. I will admit I have been coerced into trying other facial products a couple of times, but I gave those away and returned to my Avon. The only thing I wish is that they would sell more of this product in a bigger bottle. Maybe they don&#x27;t do that because the product may expire.</li>
    <li> I used Anew Ultimate 7&#x27;s Elixir sometime ago and tried to switch to other products.  None have compared to the way my skin feels.  You must try it!</li>
    <li> This Elixir is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Ultimate  7s Day cream and Night cream.&lt;br /&gt;It helps with firming and lessening those lines that are so alarming.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many products over the year to slow down the lines that suddenly were appearing so fast.  Until then, I hardly had any.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was working.  or, I should say, was working for a few days then, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;this keeps working.&lt;br /&gt;The lines between my eyebrows and around the mouth are smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;And its not at all greasy.  Just melts into your skin&lt;br /&gt;I am curious about the Anew Genics serum and may try it.  But, I will continue to keep this on hand no matter what.</li>
    <li> the best serum I have used for the price</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It smells great and keeps my face moisturized. I also love the price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used other Avon Anew products but this by far exceeds the others.  My face has never been so soft!</li>
    <li> Used forever!! Got a better price from amazon!! Love It</li>
    <li> I like this product, however I have had other moisturizers that were just as good, so I am not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks really nice.  I am going to continue using this cream and the other Ultimate 7s Elixisr.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough for appearing to be such a large bottle.  I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing any more.</li>
    <li> Just O.K. - it is likely moisturizing my skin, but I see no difference one way or the other.</li>
    <li> Very good product .  I have been using this for the last 2 years.  It makes my face smooth and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is mild, yet effective for an old gal.  No funny smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  This really does seem to work.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I will recommend to others.  It could be used with moisturizer or by itself. Leave the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> ALLEGEDLY LIFTER FOR FACE, SYMMETRICAL FORM OF FACE RENEWED.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> My skin is luminous and moist in appearance  I&#x27;m in my late 70&#x27;s and everyone asks if I&#x27;ve had cosmetic surgery</li>
