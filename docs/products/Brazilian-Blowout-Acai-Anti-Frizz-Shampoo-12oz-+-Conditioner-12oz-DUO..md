      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>My hair is smoother and feels great.</li>
      <li>EVEN IF YOU THINK ITS A GREAT DEAL.</li>
      <li>Great value for a great product</li>
      <li>I did the brazilian blowout at my salon and it worked fabulously!!!  </li>
      <li>My hair is consistantly smooth and shiney!!!  </li>
      <li>- I looked everywhere for a good price on these</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it just my hair, but this time the products don&#x27;t seem to be working as good as before.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, it smells great</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product at the salon and was very happy when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Keeps most of the frizz away!</li>
      <li>Love the brazilian blowout treatment!</li>
      <li>I have used many anti frizz products before and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend the money on a Brazilian Blowout, make sure you get the shampoo and conditioner that will maintain it.</li>
      <li>Since the humidity kills my hair, I purchased this shampoo and I love   it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>Great product, I will continue to use as my hair os so soft and not friszzy anymore</li>
      <li>Your hair is healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I received in very timely manner and am very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair smooth and shiney.</li>
      <li>It really is very good, and it smells wonderful, but I am switching back to Abba Pure Moisture since it is also sulfate-free and entirely plant-based, and ounce per ounce, costs about half of what the Brazilian Blowout products cost.</li>
      <li>I only saved $0.50 in purchasing this from Amazon rather than getting it at my beauty salon, I probably lost a couple dollars worth of product that leaked out of the poorly-secured top, so I would have been better off getting it from my hair dresser.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner are good products--the texture is a little different, but both the shampoo and conditioner do a good job of extending the life of my Brazilian Blowout treatment.  </li>
      <li>Came packaged right and on time.  </li>
      <li>However, the lid on the conditioner apparently hadn&#x27;t been secured, because there was a leak out the top and conditioner oozed all over the bottle, losing quite a bit of product.  </li>
      <li>That is exactly the thing I was working against.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s normally pretty pricey.    </li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I havent had the frizzies all summer</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered anything but books at Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference with the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>It really helps to get the optimal results after the Brazilian procedure.</li>
      <li>It is silky soft and manageable!!!</li>
      <li>Also use a sulfate free leave in poduct before you flat iron.  </li>
      <li>and I live in Florida!</li>
      <li>, you need a small amount and your hair is clean and fresh.   </li>
      <li>But it also works greqt what treatment is completely gone.  </li>
      <li>I would not normally spend this much for a shompoo or conditioner.</li>
      <li>THE NEXT TIME SHE TELLS ME \\&quot; DONT EVER PURCHASE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS</li>

<li> It is easier to blow dry my hair and it stays sleak and shines.  </li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all for serious lather.</li>
<li> Definitely extends the life of your blowout for an extra few weeks.  </li>
<li> I have coarse thick hair and frizz is a major problem for me.</li>
<li> I know you are supposed to change products ever so often, so I think I will take a break for a few weeks and then return to the use these...seems to be a build up on my hair and it looks very dry, :  </li>
<li> The shampoo and conditioner maintain treatment a little longer.  </li>
<li> Will let you know in a few weeks.</li>
<li> ALSO I WOULD BE AFRAID WHAT IT WOULD DO TO MY HAIR!!</li>
<li> WHY BE SO STUPID AND TAKE A CHANCE!!</li>

    <li> I recently had a brazilian blowout so I have to use a shampoo &amp; conditioner w/out sulfites. I would not normally spend this much for a shompoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, it smells great, you need a small amount and your hair is clean and fresh.   Also use a sulfate free leave in poduct before you flat iron.  Your hair is healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have coarse thick hair and frizz is a major problem for me. I have used many anti frizz products before and this is by far the best. My hair is smoother and feels great.</li>
    <li> I AM AMAZED THAT I EVEN PURCHASED THESE ITEMS ONLINE! ALL THE BRAZILIAN BLOW OUT ITEMS DID NOT LOOK,SMELL OR WORK PROPERLY IN MY HAIR. I HAVE LEARND MY LESSON &amp; NOW WILL TRUST MY STYLIST THE NEXT TIME SHE TELLS ME \\&quot; DONT EVER PURCHASE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS ONLINE OR IN ANY GROCERY STORE\\&quot; IF MY STYLIST CANT EVEN GET THESE PRODUCTS AT WHOLESALE FOR THE PRICE THAT AMAZAN SALES THEM FOR, THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO RECONSIDER NOT WAISTING A DIME OF YOUR MONEY EVEN IF YOU THINK ITS A GREAT DEAL. ALSO I WOULD BE AFRAID WHAT IT WOULD DO TO MY HAIR!! WHY BE SO STUPID AND TAKE A CHANCE!!</li>
    <li> This product was $11 cheaper per bottle than the salon.  It came within a week of the order.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great value for a great product - I looked everywhere for a good price on these and this was the best value.  It really helps to get the optimal results after the Brazilian procedure.</li>
    <li> Definitely extends the life of your blowout for an extra few weeks.  Love this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all for serious lather.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased the Brazilian Blowout products through Amazon.  Came packaged right and on time.  I don&#x27;t know if it just my hair, but this time the products don&#x27;t seem to be working as good as before.  I know you are supposed to change products ever so often, so I think I will take a break for a few weeks and then return to the use these...seems to be a build up on my hair and it looks very dry, :  That is exactly the thing I was working against.  Will let you know in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Received when promised. Would order again great product if you have the Brazilian Blowout on your hair. Makes hair smooth and shiney.</li>
    <li> Love the brazilian blowout treatment! The shampoo and conditioner maintain treatment a little longer.  But it also works greqt what treatment is completely gone.  Keeps most of the frizz away!</li>
    <li> Great product, I will continue to use as my hair os so soft and not friszzy anymore</li>
    <li> I had the Brazilian Keratin Treatment and have selected this brand of sulfate-free hair care products to help preserve the life of the treatment. It really is very good, and it smells wonderful, but I am switching back to Abba Pure Moisture since it is also sulfate-free and entirely plant-based, and ounce per ounce, costs about half of what the Brazilian Blowout products cost.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  I received in very timely manner and am very satisfied.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at the salon and was very happy when I found it on Amazon.  Now it saves me a trip to the salon and keep my stocked with the products needed to maximize my Brazilian Blowout service!</li>
    <li> I did the brazilian blowout at my salon and it worked fabulously!!!  I then purchased the shampoo and conditioner and it has prolonged the effects of the blowout from the salon!!  Even if you don&#x27;t do the salon treatment the shampoo and conditioner are great for your hair!!  My hair is not frizzy!  It is silky soft and manageable!!!</li>
    <li> I recently had the brazilian blowout done and that&#x27;s why I purchased this product. I really didn&#x27;t see a difference with the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product. If you&#x27;re going to spend the money on a Brazilian Blowout, make sure you get the shampoo and conditioner that will maintain it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ordered anything but books at Amazon.com.  The shampoo and conditioner are good products--the texture is a little different, but both the shampoo and conditioner do a good job of extending the life of my Brazilian Blowout treatment.  However, the lid on the conditioner apparently hadn&#x27;t been secured, because there was a leak out the top and conditioner oozed all over the bottle, losing quite a bit of product.  I only saved $0.50 in purchasing this from Amazon rather than getting it at my beauty salon, I probably lost a couple dollars worth of product that leaked out of the poorly-secured top, so I would have been better off getting it from my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Since the humidity kills my hair, I purchased this shampoo and I love   it.  It is easier to blow dry my hair and it stays sleak and shines.  I also purchased the conditioner and they work well together.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. It makes my hear feel like I just had a Brazilian Blowout! For the first time in my life I havent had the frizzies all summer and I live in Florida! My hair is consistantly smooth and shiney!!!  I saved about 40% buying through Amazon. It&#x27;s normally pretty pricey.    Hope this helps,  Patti</li>
