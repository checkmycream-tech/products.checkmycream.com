<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this color! and all colors i have purchased from this particular brand! most definitely will buy again! thank you!</li>
    <li> Not raspberry as shown, but Princess Fairy Sparkle Cotton Candy Pink. Seriously, this is not a color for grown-ups. Dislike the color enough to pay to get it changed, since I don&#x27;t want to look at it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Not a solid color. Not transparent either. I was hoping for it to be a solid, so I just applied over another color. Nice amount of glitter! Never had any issues with this brand.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish good buy!</li>
    <li> High Voltage is the perfect summer pedicure color.  It&#x27;s bright, sparkly, and fun.  It is a hot pink with tons of sparkle to it.  To get the full effect I apply three coats of color.    Gelish in general is an all-around amazing product.  Easy to apply, and lasts FOREVER!  My last pedicure lasted 5 weeks with no chipping.  I finally took it off because of noticeable growth at the cuticle.  i will never go back to regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> This color is very fun &amp; sparkly!  I can&#x27;t say enough about the Gelish polishes, they are much easier to apply then Shellac &amp; cheaper!  The colors are also a lot prettier then Shellac.  I just applied the High Voltage last night &amp; have already received tons of compliments on it today.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s bright and has a pink tone to it with lots of spakle! I wore it during the holidays and have received compliments from both men and women.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Looks nice too.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish products in general because of the lasting performance and the color selection. When I saw High Voltage, I knew I had to add it to my collection. It&#x27;s a great jelly fuchsia that packs a lot of punch with pink and silver micro glitter! If you wish to see more info, please visit my Beauty Channel on YouTube. Here is the LINK to my tutorial and color swatch of High Voltage:    [...]    Thanks for watching &amp; subscribing!</li>
    <li> I love the product...the only thing is you have to apply several coats to get the dark pink.  It has the sparkle in the polish and does not feel &#x27;lumpy&#x27; on your nails.  I really am happy with the Gelish products.</li>
    <li> The other reviews are correct.  I love the gelish polish, but this is very sheer.  3 coats and still looks like really sheer bubble gum.</li>
    <li> I really liked this color.  I expected it to be more red looking at the picture online, but it is slightly more pink than expected.  With Gelish it&#x27;s hard to tell what the actual color will be when you get it home due to the variation in monitor capabilities.  However, it is very sparkly and got more red the more layers I put on.  The polish has definitely lasted as long as it said it would.  I find myself changing colors because of boredom before I have to because of chipping.</li>
    <li> I had this color done in a salon and loved it. I had been debating DIY gel polish and delved in with a gelish starter kit (that I recommend) and this color.  I personally call this princess pink. ;)</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted! Thanks to the previous reviews I was able to read! I love the gold flecks.</li>
    <li> This color appears to be a solid pink with a ton of sparkles, when in all reality it is a pink sparkle polish. 3 coats or a pink under with this on top would be best.</li>
    <li> I agree with Nail Queen.  In the picture (Gelish picture) this polish looks like it&#x27;s a pink version of Good Gossip.  But it&#x27;s not at all.  It&#x27;s a really runny light pink with silvery glitter in it.  The picture that someone submitted of their manicure is exactly how it looks.  It looks nothing like the Gelish photo.  I wanted this color to be like the color shown in the Gelish photo.  Mine is also very very runny and thin.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love the gel polishes from Gelish. My regular salon was closed for a week and the new one I went to suggested I try it. I am completely hooked. They were beautifully and are super dry when you leave the salon so little care is required while driving or shopping after your mani.</li>
    <li> Great color and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I purchased the UV light and the Harmony products to do my own manicures.  The whole system cost $127 and I have already done 3 manicures which would have cost me $100.  This color is bright redish pink with sparkles in it.  It is fabulous if you like bright colors!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Gelish before, I suggest you do! I will never put regular nail polish on again! Absolutely NO chips or wear on the edges for TWO WEEKS!! I purchased this beautiful sparkly color and I bring it to my nail salon for them to apply because Gelish needs to be cured with a UV light. I have gotten so many compliments when I wear it. Try Gelish today, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This color is a bright pink with silver glitter. Looks amazing in the sunlight, really sparkly! Was a little a little nervous to purchase the product but it was much easier than expected. Goes on like nail polish, feels durable like acrylic nails. Going to purchase more colors. Don&#x27;t know if I can go back to regular polish. Love, Love, Love it!</li>
    <li> I will only buy this product line of gel nails.  I really liked the color and have purchased more since.</li>
    <li> I received the product in good condition. A little was spilled around the opening. I would recommend to other gel nail users. I have used and love this product many times.</li>
    <li> Receive constant compliments. This color is a little darker than the photo... still a gorgeous color. Absolutely recommend for someone who wants a little shimmer on their nails yet still professional enough for the office</li>
    <li> this is one of the best colors that I have.  It shines in the sun, and looks amazing.  It is better than I expected</li>
    <li> Great color. Only need an application or two. Will defiantly purchase again. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with any Gelish products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Love this polish. It&#x27;s still on way after a week. Shine stays entire time. I love.it have received soo many compliments on the color and shine.. a great polish..</li>
    <li> I love the color and the sparkle of it.  really stands out.  I would buy it again if I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Very vibrant! I was worried that it would be sheer but it was not. I also love the price. The same product is much more expensive at Sallys</li>
    <li> The name says it all! great flashy, sparkly hot pink color. I love this on my toes and my daughter puts it on her nails every time. I just put this color on top of the IBD mango polish and I love the way it looks. It is brilliant and fun and with the mango color under it, it makes it a great fall color.</li>
    <li> This is a fun bright pink glitter, pretty close to what it shows in the picture, and you only need two coats perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> an excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much .. greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> Very pretty color on top of another color or just alone.</li>
    <li> The item arrived sooner than I expected. The color was exactly what I thought it was going to be. I love it and I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This works very nicely when used over another shade.  For instance, I have dark brown gelish (don&#x27;t remember what the color name is, but very dark brown).  I actually did not order that color, but it was sent to me by mistake.  I wore it plain, and my DH, who had never commented on my nail color, told me he liked it!  Then I played around with the High Voltage, and used it over the dark brown.  It is amazing!  It looks like a purple glitter color when applied with 2 coats of dark brown, and one coat of High Voltage.  I have also used HV over some other solid shades of pink, and this looks nice, too.  So if you don&#x27;t like the polish by itself, use it with another color and check out the results.  Happy manicures!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! Bright and sparkly, and very good coverage. Perfect for both my fingers and toes. Only 2 coats for a nice deep color.</li>
    <li> This is a very bright pink that is loaded with silver glitter.  It is definitely a summer color.  It went on smoothly and covered fully in two coats.  It also came off very easily with soaking.</li>
    <li> Love this polish.  I was initially hoping for a hot pink, this is really pink - bold and sparkly.  I got complete coverage in two coats (most other colors take 3), but it is very pink.  My friends and I are experimenting with mixing and matching.  We HIGHLY recommend using this over other colors.  For instance, 2 coats Red Roses and then 1 thin coat of High Voltage.  Knocks it out of the park!!!  Another (my be my new favorite) is 1 coat Red Roses, 1 coat Samuri and then 1 coat of High Voltage. Because the pink is lighter than the others, it&#x27;s mostly the sparkly that remains.  Definitely dresses up the matte colors.  Because it does go well over so many other colors, we&#x27;ll likely have to reorder this before the other colors.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! Lived it so happy with the product! Will try another shade! Thank you gellish! Very reasonable price</li>
    <li> This color is fun! I bought it for my eight-year-old nieces. They think it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s something I would wear too.</li>
    <li> Amazing Pink! Love the glittering pink and high shine that Gelish Polish provides. I received so many compliments with this polish and it lasted 2 full weeks!</li>
    <li> This color looked exactly on as it did in the picture!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1PE3OJE3L7U5D]]My wife loves to use gel polishes on her nails and she does them at home in her LED UV nail curing lamp.  She loves the gel polishes from Harmony and they have become her favorite brand to use.  She gets professional results and beautiful colors.  We buy them on Amazon as the price is good and you get a lot more polish in a bottle that you do at the local beauty supply stores.  We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses at about $15 for a 0.3 ounce size and they were out of a lot of colors. We checked Amazon and the prices were lower for the 0.5 ounce size for the same product and you can find a broader selection of colors. Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This High Voltage color is really beautiful and it contains a lot of sparkle highlights in the color.  My wife likes the gels that have sparkles in them as she gets a lot of compliments on her nails whenever she uses them.  I have added a brief video just to show the color and as you will see it is a medium pink with a lot of flash.  High Voltage is the right name for this beautiful polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found that the Harmony Gelish polishes are the best quality and my wife recommends them highly to everyone she meets who asks about her nails.  I have listed below some simple instructions on how we use the Gelish polishes in a UV LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels in a LED curing lamp:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape the nail using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball. Make sure you remove all cotton fibers.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish pH Bond to nails&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 10 to 15 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV cured gel polish to the nail surface and to the nail edge.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color. (We used 30 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the LED UV lamp for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (If any exists) of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail. (Conditions your skin)&lt;br /&gt;* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nailsunder LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV cured gel polish to the nail surface and to the nail edge.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color. (We used 30 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the LED UV lamp for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (If any exists) of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail. (Conditions your skin)&lt;br /&gt;* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails</li>
    <li> I got it on time, a very nice colour! very good quality  and texture, I recomand it for summer fun!</li>
    <li> Very long lasting and by far one of my favorite polishes. Very pretty color as well with the perfect amount of sparkle!</li>
    <li> This is a great color. It didn&#x27;t require too many coats. I really like it and I will wear it often.</li>
    <li> If you like your nails to sparkle, you will love High Voltage!  Every time I wear it my nails get noticed and people tell me how much they love the color.  I agree with them.</li>
    <li> Glittery,  not really strong color, i use it with other color ( pink, red, ...) and looks good, more shiny and glittery, but still not too much.</li>
    <li> It had leaked down the side of the bottle. Also it was thick not able to use. I was not happy with product at all.</li>
    <li> Great color!!! I get so  many compliments from it.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews i hesitated on buying this polish! I love it! Other reviews stated you needed a lot of coats to get the dark pink color and that was not true, after two coats my nails looked great, I added a third just for drama but nothing additional was needed! Gel held for two weeks looking great!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful except it&#x27;s a little lighter in person, but I was okay with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing this now!! Very pretty for the holidays and they lasted through the holiday season, and more!!!!! So easy to do when you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time.</li>
    <li> Love this color, use it as a top coat .  I bought it to take to the salon, then I would have the matching color at home when needed</li>
    <li> Gelish soak is the best gel nail polish. High voltage is a beautiful color &amp; my favorite. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the color, and how long it lasts!!! Perfect product!!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more in the near future</li>
    <li> Love this glittery polish</li>
    <li> Amazing color!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and fun gel polish! I have received constant compliments especially when outside. The consistency is great and only required 2 coats to really pop.</li>
    <li> If your looking for glittery, bold, and bright, this is for you! Works well with just 2 coats, and the same as all other &amp;#34;Gelish&amp;#34; polishes.</li>
    <li> Lots of sparkle great color.  It is now one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I purchased this color and other colors and Harmony Hand and Nail Gelish products.  I have been completely satisfied with all the products.  I would recommend the gelish nails if you like your nails to look good for 2-3 weeks and you don&#x27;t mind taking an hour to do them every 3 weeks.  It is very easy to use but you must follow the directions exactly and be precise.  The products were shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it! My favorite polish yet! Dark, bright pink with tons of sparkle!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite Gelish color.  It is fun,sparkly and just stunning!  I love the way the sparkles dance in the light!  I gave myself a pedicure with this polish.  I first applied the PH Bond, then the Foundation.  I only applied one coat of the High Voltage and it covered my nail perfectly.  It wasn&#x27;t as sheer as others made it seem.  I only required one coat of it before finishing up with the Top it Off.  The result was a magnificently shiny and sparkly pedicure.  It looked just like the product pictures.  I highly recommend this color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2-3 other nail colors in salons and those I&#x27;ve purchased myself and I just keep coming back to this one as my favorite.  I love the sparkles. It gives good nail coverage in two coats.  I&#x27;ve had other colors that I have to put three coats on to get a &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; coverage.</li>
    <li> This gel polish is opaque and the color that is shown is how it looks on the nails! Very happy with the way it applies and the way it wears! Good product!</li>
    <li> my favorite polish of all time.  Love the color and easy to apply</li>
    <li> I order this because i LOVE pink, and I&#x27;m really starting to like sparkles in my polish. The order arrived on time, which is awesome! But - when my package arrived, the polish had been severely damaged in shipment. I couldn&#x27;t even take any of it out of the envelope!! It was not only all over the envelope it was shipped in, but it leaked out of that onto my other mail, and my mailbox. I wasn&#x27;t concerned with the leakage as it cleaned up. I did contact the seller and they had a new bottle shipped out to me and I got it all within a week. Thank you for being a seller customers can count on.I will absolutely shop with you in the future. I wanted this mentioned because I want potential customers to know that this is a seller worth your time and money.&lt;br /&gt;The Polish!! It FAB! It is a gorgeous pink, what I like to call a berry pink, because it is not a light pastel nor is it a deep Fuschia, although it is close! I was able to apply 2 coats and it was perfect! With the added clear top coat - this stuff SPARKLED like CRAZY!!! I got compliments every day that I wore it - which was 16 days!! YES 16 DAYS it lasted without chipping, wearing down at the corners...it looked just done for 16 days! In lots of other polishes with sparkles, I always feel the sparkles through the top coat - not this one! Smooth, beautiful nails for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this polish, and this seller! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gelish color. I really only need one coat to make it the shade I want. I have also tried it over Starburst and it makes it a darker shade of pink, but keeps all of the sparkles! It is definitely a loud and fun color, if you want a more muted pink this one isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> This is one that would look good over another color. This particular one takes alot of applications to get to the color you see.  It also runs really bad.  This would be best used as a top coat for the sparkles.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty, sparkly pink- I get compliments all the time. Great coverage too!</li>
    <li> My favorite Gelish color! It is very pink and glittery, but looks so professional when you put it on. It&#x27;s also very forgiving of a polish, unlike the reds and blacks that can stain your skin if you mess up. Two coats is what I normally put on, but one coat looks great as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and hard to apply neatly...</li>
    <li> I have a fasination with bright colors and this one is nothing less than fantastic! Lots of glitter super shiney pink! I am so in love with this! Two coats and its a thick super shiney glitter pink!</li>
    <li> Love Gelish polishes... This is too vivid for my hands but beautiful for my feet... And that&#x27;s exactly what I purchased it for! Don&#x27;t forget to go over the edges of your nails first and then paint your nails... Don&#x27;t worry about working quickly... This doesn&#x27;t work at all like standard nail lacquer you have plenty of time to work with it.... Without all the funky smudges! GELISH is my new favorite cosmetic item!</li>
    <li> High Voltage is an intense, almost chrome-like pink with pink and silver microglitter (not holographic). My favorite feature about the polish is that the glitter feels glassy smooth once applied. Many traditional glitter polishes require topcoat after topcoat to get that gritty glitter feeling to settle down. Sidenote: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this polish for layering or as a glitter topper. It&#x27;s quite dense and doesn&#x27;t let base colors show through! But that is fiiine with me ;)</li>
    <li> This nail polish color looks NOTHING like the one I received.  It&#x27;s still nice but it&#x27;s more tan, not as thick and has hollogram like sparkles.  It&#x27;s cute but not as nice as the picture.</li>
    <li> Gelish is perfect and the price of these polishes is half of what you&#x27;d pay at a salon. You NEED hp bond or their base coat or it won&#x27;t cure when using a lamp. Color is so pretty and sparkly and it got to my house fast.</li>
    <li> Have gotten many, many compliments on how shiny and pretty this is, I love the sparkly effect, I am hoping Gelish continues to make colors this sparkly and pretty</li>
    <li> works with my red carpet gel manicure kit perfectly! I used about  two coats of it on top if a light pink color but you really dont need to use a base color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shimmer. This nail gel is used with a special nail dryer using UV light. Flawless and sparking shimmer finish!</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE COLOR &amp; THE WAY IT APPLIED.  IT STAYED ON FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS SO I WAS VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Love the sparkle of this nail polish, it looks great on top of another color.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear it by itself, you need to put on at least 3 coats.</li>
    <li> This colour has a lovely pink base but is full of glitter and yet the lovely usual smooth finish that Gelish does so well.  It is really pretty</li>
    <li> The polish is not as thick as the picture appears. The polish shows up lighter but I suppose if you do about three layers you can get the result of the picture.</li>
    <li> The polish is good quality and lasts longer than other brands I have. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not quite the color it looks like in the circle of the pic. It&#x27;s a little more sheer than I had hoped. After I tried it out I came back and looked at the listing and saw the customer photos that were posted and they represent the color much better. I thought it would be hot pink so I ended up putting a hot pink color on then the high voltage sparkle color over and it was perfect for what I needed. It&#x27;s still a nice color on it&#x27;s own just not what I expected. The bottle is pretty big which you don&#x27;t always find with the gel polishes. I was also able to soak it off easily enough. All in all I am very satisfied with the Harmony Gelish brand of gel polish.</li>
    <li> Leaked everywhere that&#x27;s how I got it</li>
    <li> I just received this color and I love it! I can&#x27;t wait to paint my nails! It is a awesome color!</li>
    <li> This is a fun color if you like pink. Takes about 3 coats to get it to where I like so it is a little time consuming,  but worth it once you&#x27;re done with the process.</li>
    <li> Great transaction&lt;br /&gt;Great transaction&lt;br /&gt;This was a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was fast and it was just like they said&lt;br /&gt;So it was good</li>
    <li> I love pink and this a good color.  Goes on nicely.  Only needs 2 coats, which is great because many dark colors need 3.  The color is a little lighter than the picture.</li>
    <li> Great color, great coverage.  Can be worn for any occassion or for no occassion at all.  Hot pink; can&#x27;t go wrong with pink, period.</li>
    <li> This is SO glittery!!! It&#x27;s amazing!!!! Bright and fun, perfect for spring and summer. Only downside was how thin and runny it was, made it hard to apply. I did 3 coats to get full coverage.</li>
    <li> The sparkly shades from Gelish are nice and deep.  The more coats that you put on the deeper the look.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color. It is on my toes right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Harmony Gelish Polishes and this is a must have for any collection!</li>
    <li> I have this on my nails right now! I prefer Gelish&#x27;s glitter polishes. I think they go on easier. The colors with glitter never seem to bubble up. I have has that problem with some of the colors that do not have glitter.&lt;br /&gt;This color makes it almost impossible to mess up your manicure! I only have to put on 2 coats. Good Gossip is another Gelish color with lots of glitter that you should try as well!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. One of my favorites!  It can go on a little thin at first, just make sure you do at least 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Love this product. Would definitely buy again and again. Will recommend this product to other gelish users.</li>
    <li> Love this color. And look very good. On my hand and my feet. I&#x27;ll buy some more if this one gone</li>
    <li> High Voltage is my favorite color gel polish by far! Such a pretty dark pink and perfect amount of shimmer.  The color does not fade.  Very pretty!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color!  I love gel polish.  This brand has been a favorite of mine.  It goes on well and stays well.  The variety of colors is very good to chose from and when choosing from online or in person, you can rely on first impression.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Super cute color and full of glitter. Wish I could find more colors with full glitter like this one. The seller got this to me super fast also.</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own gel manicures and have been going to Sally&#x27;s to buy the Gelish polish and I fell in love with the product.  The polish that I was buying at Sally&#x27;s was half the size (only 0.3 oz) and more expensive.  Amazon has WAY more selections and delivery was quick!  I will no longer be buying any of my Gelish nail polish from Sally&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> Love this color; will be my go to toe color ;) might add a large type of sparkle on the top next time ;) recommended seller.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color - favorite to wear for Holiday Season!</li>
    <li> I have now fallen in love with this brand name and type of nail polish. Regular nail polish wouldn&#x27;t even last 12 hours on my nails with being a mom and my hands always doing thing, especially with harsh chemicals/soaps. I have had the same nail polish on for a 1.5 weeks and it still looks great. Just make sure you get everything you need to do the application properly. I used the gelish website and under their tab that says application to teach me how to do it properly and what all i needed. Make sure you pair these nail polishes with the foundation, top coat, uv gel lamp, and gel cleanser or you will not get the results you want. Make sure you do THIN layers, the first time i did it i put it on like normal nail polish and it was too thick and caused it to peel faster than it should. The second time i took my time and make sure i had little polish on my brush for each step to do thin layers and it turned out 100% better. Also make sure you wipe off all excess nail polish that might get on your skin around your nail after each step before you put it in the lamp or it will harden on your skin and than when it peels off it will peel off the nail polish from your nail and ruin your good looking nail polish. The gel cleanser you need because after you dry the top coat it will still feel like its wet and sticky but once you do the cleanser step you will have perfectly harden and smooth nails. It seems werid to rub something onto your nail when it feels wet still but it won&#x27;t ruin your polish like you would assume it just takes off the sticky stuff some how. Awesome stuff and i can not wait to grow my color collection. Saves tons of money since i don&#x27;t have to go to the salon for my nails anymore. Also its VERY nice to go right to doing things like washing the dishes like mins after finishing your nails, its amazing no more waiting 24 hours to make sure it is set properly before you do anything with your hands or put shoes on. I have instantly after doing my nails did dishes and folded laundry and my nails would still be perfect afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It works wonderflly and I have had so many complaints on this that I can hardly wait to try other colors from Gelish.</li>
    <li> I have had this color applied in the salons and love it!! I was happy to find that the color was exactly what it should be and last almost as long as when professionally applied! Shipping was fast and the bottle of polish was even a little larger than I had expected!</li>
    <li> Its a very pretty sparkley color and lasted an entire two weeks :) I was impressed&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It does not peal the nail as it is washed off with acetone, leaving the nail intact.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love all my gel polishes. Stay on for 7 days +. I work in solvents etc. and they stay strong through it all. Love the vibrant colors too. Would definately buy this product again. A + to who ever invented this stuff.</li>
    <li> First let me point out that this polish must be applied by a professional because you&#x27;ll need that UV light to get it to dry/harden.  I just take mine to my favorite salon and have them use it instead of what colors/types they may offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this polish is wonderful!  Beautiful, long lasting color.  It has a high glitter effect, but is very smooth and wearable.  I receive many compliments on the color and shine.  Extremely durable.  I have never had a chip and I am very hard on my nails.  A definite \\&quot;must buy!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really like this color of polish.  It has a shimmer sparkle.  Its BEAUTIFUL!  I would recommend this any day.</li>
    <li> There was a hole in the envelope with no nail polish inside. Typically love this brand but was very unhappy with the shipping method and cheap packaging and obviously no polish inside...</li>
    <li> This color is very pretty, a hot pink/magenta like color with fine silver sparkles. The color is different from what is shown. I&#x27;d google the color and look at images of it before ordering. Only downside is that it needs an extra 30 seconds to one minute under the LED curing lamp. I never had a problem before with this brand but when I went to wipe my fingers with alcohol it took the whole top later off. I was very upset.</li>
    <li> This color is one of my top FAV! It&#x27;s SO GIRLY, and I&#x27;m normally not the type haha, but I must say that every girl should have a color that makes them feel completely &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; ^_^</li>
    <li> This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved, either the polish looks and performs as it should or not.  This one does!  A good product and a good seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing off of my boyfriend&#x27;s account, this is a perfect color, goes on smooth, no issues, looks great, timely shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this color, really pops.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this gelish polish with my CND base coat and it melted right off &#x3D;( do not try and use with other brands</li>
    <li> the color is a little lighter than the picture (seeing as its being viewed on a comp) but the color is fantastic! the glitter is a little less intense than the picture (i only used two coats), but is perfect.</li>
    <li> This color is more translucent and needs 3-5 coats for a good coverage and because of that I would suggest this color as a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of sparkle to it though which I love!</li>
    <li> Polish is a great color.  Only problem it takes three coats to cover well.  I would recommend to others.  Quick shipment.</li>
    <li> I received the product as per schedule. I used this color with Gelish base and Top coat. I have learnt that before the basic I need to use the cleaner on my nails so that the nail polish does not peel off. Color is like showed picture. So far I have used it only on my feet. In the office I&#x27;m allowed only to natural color for my hands.</li>
    <li> I love this color pink! High Voltage is such a pretty hot pink glitter polish that is a solid color.</li>
    <li> I love this colour, it goes on very nicely and stays on. The Gelish company makes some pretty fantastic products.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I received was great but the second one must have been prepared wrong. The polish has a watery consistency and will not adhere to nail properly. I hope the. Next one I purchase will b like the first.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty glittery pink. You&#x27;ll need to do about 2 coats to get it to a full coverage of pink sparkle, as it goes on a bit thin and transparent.</li>
    <li> This color looks like it would be a bright summer color, but rather it is a light pink color.  It would be great for a little girl.</li>
    <li> I love fun sparkly colors, especially for spring.  This one is a nice sparkly pink but doesn&#x27;t look too immature.</li>
    <li> Just my opinion but maybe if you have long nails it would look better.  But this polish seriously looked CHILDISH...it appeared to be too much on all the fingers and I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it off to apply another color.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous medium rose color. I can not wait to use it. Great experience, looks better than in the computer picture.</li>
    <li> I love the color. Very bright and vibrant with just enough sparkle.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s a bright, sparkly pink.  I get a lot of comments on this one.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to purchase any other bright pink polishes (gel anyway!) because this really fits the bill.  It&#x27;s a great pink!  Plus I love the glittery sparkle.  If you don&#x27;t like sparkle, this is not the polish for you.  Wear is typical of the other Gelish colors.  (So are the compliments!)</li>
    <li> I love this color! It looks so amazing on and looks just like the picture shows! If you don&#x27;t shake the bottle before applying the sparkles will sink to the bottom and it won&#x27;t be true to color but after shaking it up a little before applying it works great! I only needed two coats to get the true color but I did a third coat anyways to make it more sparkly. Then after applying your top coat and drying it just rub your nails with rubbing alcohol and your nails are ready to go!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come. They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this HOPING it would be like a pink version if Good Gossip.  I read the reviews saying it&#x27;s not but thought it still looked like a good color.  It&#x27;s a fun, worthy color but Good Gossip it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I know how to describe it is to compare it to Good Gossip as these are the only 2 Gelish colors I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Gossip is a true red with small glitter flakes that is AWESOME.  It&#x27;s a light glitter until you get it under light and then it explodes!  High Voltage a pink but the glitter content is heavier.  You don&#x27;t need to be under light to see the full glitter effect.  Also, Good Gossip looks like red polish with reddish glitter giving it an even color family.  High voltage is more of a pink with silverish looking glitter effect giving it more contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Good Gossip better because it comes across as more classy/professional and is more \\&quot;stunning\\&quot;.  People noticed Good Gossip.  Nobody said a word when I had High Voltage.  High Voltage would be good for special occassions.  Say NYE or Prom.  High Voltage is over the top,in your face, fun/glitter.  Good Gossip says more with less.  The two are a difference between fun and BAM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a bright colour person but bought this because I thought I would like it.  Well I do but it&#x27;s not one that I would wear a lot.  It has lots of sparkle which doesn&#x27;t show up in the picture.  If you like a red with some bling then try this one.</li>
    <li> Love the color!  It&#x27;s just as pictured..a pretty pink with glitter. Goes on very nicely in two thin coats. Easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on Gelish nails when I was looking for sparkly polish.  I usually use CND nail polish but I was looking for something sparkly and fun for the summer.  CND didn&#x27;t have anything sparkly, so I googled it and decided to try Gelish.  I bought this color and a sparkly red, too.  I haven&#x27;t used the red because I just love this color so much!  I&#x27;ve had it on now for just over a week.  There is a slight chip on one nail but the rest of them look beautiful!!!  CND started lifting after about 4 days and it would bug me enough to start me picking at it.  This color is beautiful and I get compliments all the time.  Best of all, it&#x27;s not lifting!!!  I don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong with CND but this polish seems to be better for my nails.  I still use CND base/top coat but will buy the Gelish when I run out of that!  They have such beautiful colors and free shipping, too!</li>
    <li> This is probably my second favorite color that Gelish sells. A friend of mine got this color and I was so jealous that I knew I had to get it for myself. It is very sparkly which is Perfect! for me. And it went on perfectly and I had no trouble with it!!!</li>
