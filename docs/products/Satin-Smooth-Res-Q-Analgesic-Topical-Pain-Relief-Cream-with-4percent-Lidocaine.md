<ol>
      <li>Great value !</li>
      <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>and I received in return a no questions asked refund :D</li>
      <li>I bought this to lessen the pain of giving myself a brazilian, I sat with it on the area for an hour to get the best effect (based on others reviews)</li>
      <li>Works Great !  </li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>I am happy to find a seller who takes care of customers.</li>
      <li>I have tried Burn Gel 2.5% and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great Product at a Great Price . .</li>
      <li>this does a great job taking the sting off</li>
      <li>works great, also takes the redness out.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>It was easy, it was excellent.    </li>
      <li>I did shake it up really good before using to.</li>
      <li>I am debating whether to use it before I go for my laser hair treatments (underarm) because those hurt a good amount for me</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>I bet it would be good for poison ivy or bug bites too.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this is also a go-to in my camping/hiking prep bag because it is absolutely magical at eliminating the itch of bug bites.  </li>
      <li>The product itself isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>I tried this one and it seems to be more effective.  </li>
      <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>(beware, they turn up the laser power on you if your hair is light!).  </li>
      <li>I feel better now.</li>
      <li>THIS DID MORE THAN THAT.</li>
      <li>Cream is more liquid-like.  </li>
      <li>Helps arthritis pain, achey bones, joints, and muscles like Bengay but better.</li>
      <li>Glad this product was suggested to me.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it works better for abating pain rather than preventing?</li>
      <li>It works okay, though.</li>
      <li>Of course the longer you have it on the better.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be okay though.</li>
      <li>I thought 4% would work even better, but this product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>I also put it on afterward to easy pain</li>
      <li>Either spend more money on more powerful analgesic creams or deal with the pain.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;; the expiration date was fine.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t mind a little pain, so this was perfect.  </li>
      <li>put this on and within 10 minutes I was pain free after rubbing it in thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Available without a Rx&lt;</li>
      <li>This product works better than anything I have used for Rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;You rub it in well and then rub in some hand lotion so that it is absorbed into the tissue deeper.</li>
      <li>I bought this originally to use with the Derma Roller.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it for tattooing yet, but for waxing on any part of the body, it does indeed take away a significant portion of the pain.  </li>
      <li>The product came on time, was not expired and in original packaging.</li>
      <li>I got this to experiment with different topicals on my hunt for a good one to use with waxing and tattooing.  </li>
      <li>But this product is really runny - more like runny lotion.</li>
      <li>Either I do it superfast, or I don&#x27;t get a good feel that I did it properly.</li>
      <li>Still full sensation.  </li>
      <li>So runny in fact that when I opened the lid the first time and tipped the bottle, a ton pored right out!!</li>
      <li>Wiped off the huge glob I put on and could tell right away</li>
      <li>Quick relief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, but I had no pain relieving results with it.</li>
      <li>The smell is mild.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this product is good for any kind of topical or musculoskeletal pain such as sprains,</li>
      <li>it is Satin Smooth and  Gentle on the Skin . .</li>
      <li>well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I bought this particular product because it says &amp;#34;gel.&amp;#34; I thought that would go on easily and be sort of cooling on the skin.</li>
      <li>It does not completely numb you</li>
      <li>After seeing that people had had some success with waxing I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several analgesic creams over the years of waxing and plucking, but have never been too thrilled with BikiniZone and peers.  </li>
      <li>I rarely review items</li>
      <li>So far I have been comfortable during treatments and haven&#x27;t experienced any extreme pain or irritation from it.</li>
      <li>Right before waxing, use soap and water to remove the residue, because it will interfere with the waxing process otherwise.  </li>
      <li>However I had a torn ligament injury in 1994 and my knee has not been right every since.</li>
      <li>This product may be good, I just was unsure if it was from manufacturer, as it had no seal, and the date on it was several years old.</li>
      <li>I usually leave it for about 10 minutes to set and after that I can roll my dermaroller much slower and it kind of feels better.</li>
      <li>For an added treat, put it in the fridge to get chilled --- very soothing for any musculoskeletal pains!</li>
      <li>After reading mixed reviews for this, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me</li>
      <li>Remember this product if you eat too many hot peppers and your ass hurts later!</li>
      <li>I am using dermaroller pretty often.</li>
      <li>Res-Q does exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>5 STARS AND THANKS TO THE SELLER!</li>
      <li>This really helps!</li>
      <li>I applied to product heavily before waxing and waited for the wax to heat up with it on which took a good hour or so.</li>
      <li>Great results and far less pain.</li>
      <li>but I really appreciate this seller&#x27;s commitment to make things right and respect their business ethics.</li>
      <li>Thinking that this was a better value for it&#x27;s purported 4% lidocaine solution, I&#x27;m fairly confident it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness after seven years.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to hopefully help the ease of bikini waxing: the normal sting was a tiny itty bitty bit better</li>
      <li>Thanks to this creme, however, my next attempt went smoothly.</li>
      <li>I gave him some Ibuprofen and put alot of Satin Smooth on his back and shoulders.  </li>
      <li>Also the stuff comes out too fast, not a lot of control</li>
      <li>If I find the product that actually really works for epilating/derma-roller/waxing I&#x27;ll update the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so much for the bikini area</li>
      <li>was much easier to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to look for the spray version of this product because it seems much easier to apply than the lotion.</li>
      <li>It was great the bottle was big enough for several treatments.</li>
      <li>I suppose I was just expecting a bit too much.</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I had to apply SO much on the skin</li>
      <li>I was planning on using it to take to the edge off eplilating and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to all my friends!</li>
      <li>This product really did take the edge off.</li>
      <li>I frequently practice many \\&quot;painful\\&quot; beauty routines, such as epilation, and routinely using the derma-roller.  </li>
      <li>it has to be the lidocaine, there are other lidocaine products on Amazon for more, but this does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That made my skin pretty sensitive.</li>
      <li>The first time around I was nearly in tears from the pain and sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I have put it on as little as 10 mins prior with good results.    </li>
      <li>The gel formula is kind of messy and its easy to use too much because a lot comes out at once which is a waste.</li>
      <li>I checked for numbness at 15, 30 &amp; 45 mins and never had anything more than minor tingling in one tiny spot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First of all this product was very thin and runny, not the consistency you&#x27;d expect in this kind of tube. I applied a generous amount to my face and waited...I checked for numbness at 15, 30 &amp; 45 mins and never had anything more than minor tingling in one tiny spot. I purchased this as a prep for a derma roller but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  Based on the consistency and complete lack of effectiveness, I&#x27;m wondering if I received a bad batch.</li>
    <li> It dont work dont wast your money.</li>
    <li> works great, also takes the redness out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream with both brazilian waxes and laser hair treatments and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It didn&#x27;t even numb my fingers after I forgot to wash my hands afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that works for me are lidocaine shots at my derm&#x27;s office before the laser treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to numb the basic bikini area for a laser hair removal treatment.  I was skeptical at first because I did a trial test on my arm and it didn&#x27;t seem to work.  Key is to apply this cream and cover it with saran wrap.  Wait about 45 minutes and voila, no pain!      Con:  Cream is more liquid-like.  So it can get a bit messy.  Although with the saran wrap, it helps to keep the cream in one place and not get all over yourself.</li>
    <li> I got this to experiment with different topicals on my hunt for a good one to use with waxing and tattooing.  Haven&#x27;t tried it for tattooing yet, but for waxing on any part of the body, it does indeed take away a significant portion of the pain.  Waxing has never been easier!  Well-worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Just remember: apply about 15 minutes before you wax so the medicine soaks into your skin.  Right before waxing, use soap and water to remove the residue, because it will interfere with the waxing process otherwise.  Wipe your skin down with alcohol, then proceed with waxing.  Great results and far less pain.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use with my epilator.  After seeing that people had had some success with waxing I thought I would give it a try.  It did nothing for me.  That being said, I was trying to epilate my armpits which are notoriously painful but it didn&#x27;t dull the pain in the slightest, didn&#x27;t even take the edge off. I applied several rounds of cream and waited, testing at the fifteen minute, thirty minute, forty five minute and hour marks to no avail.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. There must be something out there that works but this is not it, at least not for armpit hair removal. I&#x27;ll will comment and post an additional review if something else occurs as I finish out this tube of wasted money.</li>
    <li> While ResQ is advertised for an off label use of numbing the pain from waxing, laser treatments and tattooing, it didn&#x27;t begin to live up to that billing.  I heavily applied the thin cream about an hour before my Brazilian waxing, covered it with plastic wrap and hoped.  But after the technician wiped me down and applied the first strip of wax, I knew I was in for a rough ride.  The 4% lidocaine had no impact on me whatsoever, and I just had to grit and bear it through the painful waxing.      After the procedure, I tried ResQ for its labeled use as a post-waxing soothing cream that&#x27;s supposed to also lessen problems with traumatized skin and ingrown hairs.  But the pricey cream worked only as well as any ordinary moisturizer.  I tossed the remainder of the tube, and I won&#x27;t be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t numb as it should..</li>
    <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t very strong. The smell is gross, the texture is runny, and takes forever to soak in. The product came on time, was not expired and in original packaging. I was planning on using it to take to the edge off eplilating and it didn&#x27;t do much. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Glad this product was suggested to me.  I didn&#x27;t use kit for waxing but rather something else. Remember this product if you eat too many hot peppers and your ass hurts later! Haha.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hopefully help the ease of bikini waxing: the normal sting was a tiny itty bitty bit better but my girl was also using a new type of wax so hard to say which one helped with the sting.  Either way it wasn&#x27;t the amount of numbing that I was looking for - I wouldn&#x27;t buy again for the purpose I bought it for. I gave the item a 2 partially because the packaging was absolutely horrible!!</li>
    <li> Applying cream 45 minutes before Derma Roller use . Works Great !  Almost feeling nothing !   Great value !</li>
    <li> Great Product at a Great Price . . . .   Res-Q does exactly as stated. Non Irritating . . .and it is Satin Smooth and  Gentle on the Skin . . . 4% Lidocaine is just right for topical pain relief.  I had been searching for a product such as Res-Q for quite a while.</li>
    <li> and I did not really get it. I applied to product heavily before waxing and waited for the wax to heat up with it on which took a good hour or so. Having waxed with no numbing agent before I suppose it aided a little bit but nowhere near what I was expecting. I suppose I was just expecting a bit too much. If you are sensitive to topical analgesics then this will probably work for you, but for me it was only so so. Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> This cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, but I had no pain relieving results with it. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I will stick to bikini zone if I need a product like this in the future.</li>
    <li> Res-Q Does NOT work, no refund given either! I have requested a refund and have NOT heard a thing from anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this just before my second brazilian waxing. The first time around I was nearly in tears from the pain and sensitivity. This time I used the product sparingly about 45 minutes before my appointment, put some saran wrap over the area and took some max strength tylenol. I washed it off just before the session. The lady waxing me also used this same product but she had a spray form which I right was much easier to apply. She sprayed it on the area just before the waxing. Though trial and error, I figured out the warm wax for sensitive skin hurt much less than the cold wax. This product really did take the edge off. Of course it didn&#x27;t completely numb me, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any product out there that will do that. However, the pain was minimized to when she immediately ripped the strip off and maybe one to two seconds afterward, if that. The anticipation was the worse part, really.   Waxing is never a pleasant experience, but this product really helped me to experience far less pain than going it alone. I&#x27;m going to look for the spray version of this product because it seems much easier to apply than the lotion. Either way, I recommend giving it a try 45 minutes beforehand along with some tylenol and it might help you too. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Thinking that this was a better value for it&#x27;s purported 4% lidocaine solution, I&#x27;m fairly confident it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness after seven years.  Left on skin for an hour, and nothing but a slight tingling.  Still full sensation.  There are plenty of other products around the same price point that do a much better job of numbing the skin/pain relief.  Wasted money, poor value, expired product.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I am using dermaroller pretty often. Description says to use it about once a week, but I am desperate for quicker results so I use it 2-3 times a week. That made my skin pretty sensitive. Either I do it superfast, or I don&#x27;t get a good feel that I did it properly. This ointment seemes to help a lot. I usually leave it for about 10 minutes to set and after that I can roll my dermaroller much slower and it kind of feels better. It helps a lot to reduce pain and discomfort. I haven&#x27;t treied it yet for waxing, but I will at my next appointment.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to ease the pain of using a epilator, and it did not help at all. I also put it on afterward to easy pain and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wax, and I don&#x27;t do anything of that sort - However I had a torn ligament injury in 1994 and my knee has not been right every since. I have a medical background and I am familiar with the active ingredient (Lidocaine), which has all kinds of analgesia uses. It is the same or similar they use before they do dental work, sutures etc - You are numbed up with Lidocaine or Novocaine - though more dentists are using lidocaine as it is less likely to have side effects. The label use is for pre-waxing etc, but lidocaine is lidocaine - a topical anesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in my left knee, and sometimes the pain is crippling and horrible where I will be up for hours at night just waiting for something-  anything to kick in (oral meds, cream etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and within 10 minutes I was pain free after rubbing it in thoroughly. For an added treat, put it in the fridge to get chilled --- very soothing for any musculoskeletal pains! In comparison with other OTC cream products (Theragesic, Myoflex, Bengay, etc) this far surpasses them all.... it has to be the lidocaine, there are other lidocaine products on Amazon for more, but this does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Good Price&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Non Greasy&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Available without a Rx&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Quick relief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Very thin, but on the plus side it goes further&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; &gt; Big Tube, small amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is good for any kind of topical or musculoskeletal pain such as sprains, strains arthritis etc.... If you suffer from arthritis pain or any chronic pain, this stuff works-- save yourself some money and get it.... well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> At my first brazillian wax, I was in such pain that I literally could not complete the service. I ached for a long time after, and though no blood was drawn, i was terrified for years.    Thanks to this creme, however, my next attempt went smoothly. I almost felt nothing at all, not even the slight pinching sensation people tell you to expect. It was easy, it was excellent.    However, I did let the product sit for 45 minutes before the waxing began, and I absolutely doused myself in it, probably a quarter or third of the tube, as I was very paranoid.    Later uses with less amounts of the creme did not seem to dilute it&#x27;s numbing effect, though.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this for pre-hair-removal numbing, forget about it. Pick up the spray instead.  Maybe it works better for abating pain rather than preventing? Well, whatever it&#x27;s meant to work for, it&#x27;s not for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this to help numb my skin when I use the epilator in my bikini area. I had to apply SO much on the skin and then it wouldn&#x27;t really work until about 1 hour later. Not really worth the buy but it was one of the cheaper topical pain relief creams. My use for it probably wasn&#x27;t what the product was meant for but I know others are probably looking to use it for the same reason.     Also the stuff comes out too fast, not a lot of control so it gets a little messy.     A 3 star rating is probably unfair but that&#x27;s how I felt about the product since it&#x27;s just sitting in my closet. I won&#x27;t return it because I do use it and it does help if I have the patience to sit with it on for an hour before hair removal.</li>
    <li> Helps arthritis pain, achey bones, joints, and muscles like Bengay but better. Lasts long enough to fall asleep with much less pains. Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this to wax my bikini line for the second time - the first time was such a nightmare I thought I would never do it again, but decided to give it another go with this product.  I rubbed a little in and a few minutes later waxed away - it really took the edge off, which was all I needed.  I don&#x27;t need to slather it on and wrap it in Saran wrap for 45 minutes, I don&#x27;t mind a little pain, so this was perfect.  I am debating whether to use it before I go for my laser hair treatments (underarm) because those hurt a good amount for me (beware, they turn up the laser power on you if your hair is light!).  I&#x27;ll update if I end up giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> This product works better than anything I have used for Rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;You rub it in well and then rub in some hand lotion so that it is absorbed into the tissue deeper.</li>
    <li> I frequently practice many \\&quot;painful\\&quot; beauty routines, such as epilation, and routinely using the derma-roller.  No matter how much of this stuff I put on, or how long ahead of time I put this on-it still seems to have no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to epilating, I tried using this to numb the area-and I noticed no difference whatsoever.  I epilate my underarms, legs, and bikini area.  These are very painful areas-especially the underarms and bikini area mostly.  Well, unfortunately after epilating again-I waited until after I was done to use this, and had the same effect.  Of course, you are literally ripping hair from the root when you epilate, so there will be some pain afterwards-unfortunately I noticed no difference when I used the cream before, after, or even didn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the derma-roller:  Again-no change whatsoever.  I literally noticed nothing.  I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it might just be that I have tough skin (doubtful) and it might work for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What usually works for me is a numbing cream (can&#x27;t remember the name at this moment...) and it comes in a little bottle that actually numbs the whole area.  I&#x27;m always careful to wear gloves because it numbs my hands/fingers as well.  If I find the product that actually really works for epilating/derma-roller/waxing I&#x27;ll update the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you, and pass on this stuff unless you like to just throw money away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannah</li>
    <li> I have been getting laser hair removal on my entire face (chin, upper lip, neck &amp; sideburns) for a year. As the sessions progressed they turn up the laser strength so by session 4, I knew it was time for me to start using something to dull the pain. After reading mixed reviews for this, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me but I decided to go for it and I am glad I did. It works great. So far I have been comfortable during treatments and haven&#x27;t experienced any extreme pain or irritation from it. I have used this for approximately 5-6 of 12 laser treatments. It does not completely numb you but it definitely dulls the pain. As with anything it depends on your pain threshold to begin with. Also, I don&#x27;t think laser is as painful or rough as waxing (torture that is!).    The smell is mild. However the formula texture is a weird very liquid-like gel (like aloe) which seems like it wouldn&#x27;t be effective as it is a little awkward to use (I actually thought it&#x27;d be a cream for some reason when I ordered). The gel formula is kind of messy and its easy to use too much because a lot comes out at once which is a waste. Minor inconvenience though.    How I use it: Approximately 20-60 mins before my appointment (usually in the car en route), I apply too much and rub it into the skin on the treatment areas like lotion then wipe away the excess. No plastic, no extras. Of course the longer you have it on the better. I have put it on as little as 10 mins prior with good results.    I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not only did I not experience any pain relieve, it came out like water. I was expecting a cream, not a liquid!</li>
    <li> Lidocaine needs to dry in order to work. This product doesn&#x27;t dry so it doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried Burn Gel 2.5% and it works great. I thought 4% would work even better, but this product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I had an itching on the soal of my foot. Went to the doctor and he said it was athlets foot. I tried all kinds of foot fungus products on it and the itching would not go away. I applied some Res-Q cream on it for about a week and the itching stopped. I feel better now. I bet it would be good for poison ivy or bug bites too. They give you a big tube not a small amount like those other products.</li>
    <li> Ok, this does NOTHING to numb a place. I got it to use for epilating. I first tried to put some on my upper lip. I put a ton on supper thick and let it set for an hour. Wiped off the huge glob I put on and could tell right away NOTHING was numb. I did shake it up really good before using to. NOPE no numbing. I tried the same thing on my leg again nothing. Good thing was the epilator wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it was going to be so didn&#x27;t need this after all. BUT if you are wanting this for numbing it wont work. It DOES work on bug bites though to take the itching away. Itching yes, numbing no!</li>
    <li> This cream is really watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the other brand I had been using.  I doubt it actually has what it says it does and even though it was less expensive I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to lessen the pain of giving myself a brazilian, I sat with it on the area for an hour to get the best effect (based on others reviews) and I didn&#x27;t even get past the first strip because I was no more numb than I am every other day.  Waste of my time and money....I have no idea what to do with them now because I bought two.</li>
    <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE AWAY SOPME OF THE PAIN OF WAXING. THIS DID MORE THAN THAT. I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE. I READ SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;S REVIEW AND WAS LIKE I WONDER IF THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH? YES! THIS REALLY WORKS I HARDLY FELT ANYTHING. I PUT IT ON ABOUT 30 MINS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT. I HAD TO WIPE IT OFF WHEN I GOT THERE AND THAT SCARED ME BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T AFFECT IT AT ALL. ILL BE BUYING THIS ON A REGULAR!</li>
    <li> It was great the bottle was big enough for several treatments. i used it before my treatment and also after.</li>
    <li> Regret buying as it had no impact for me. I didn&#x27;t even try giving it away as I questioned what I even bought.</li>
    <li> Was a waste as there was no numbing whatsoever. Save time and money and just go to the doctor to get prescription-strength anesthetic cream if you need topical numbing.</li>
    <li> not much product for the price</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product had no numbing qualities- it may have been I. Stock too long and had list it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have used this too, as I am a professional roof cleaner and pressure washing contractor too. I am in contact with soaps and chlorine all day and it dries my skin out. This really helps!</li>
    <li> When I opened the seal on the tube and turned the tube toward my hand to squeeze out the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; a lumpy liquid ran out of the tube over my hand and onto the floor. I am an RN with over 30 years of practice and understand how topical medications are to be manufactured and labeled. Most products are ointments that have a thick oily base, gels which are a thickened liquid, creams that are thick but smooth that stay where you put them and lotions that are thickened liquid that move like warm honey. The weird stuff that ran out of the tube and splashed over my hand that seemed to have small clots in it was unlike anything I have seen. Since I bought several products to try I did not open the tube for 3 1/2 months well past the return date. I wrote the the seller NewvoBeauty to let them know that the product the sold was not usable and not what it was supposed to be. I did not really expect a response after this amount of time and I received in return a no questions asked refund :D I think what I received was a no star product but I really appreciate this seller&#x27;s commitment to make things right and respect their business ethics. There are too many people who don&#x27;t stand behind their products or their businesses when problems arise. I am happy to find a seller who takes care of customers. 5 STARS AND THANKS TO THE SELLER! no stars to the people that put the mystery runny glop in the tube.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I applied this product 40 minutes before my brazilian wax appointment and it definitely took the \\&quot;edge\\&quot; off the pain.  Would highly recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> this does a great job taking the sting off</li>
    <li> Bought this product hoping it would make waxing less painful. I tested it on my hand the night before to see how long it took to work, it didn&#x27;t numb at all. Either spend more money on more powerful analgesic creams or deal with the pain.</li>
    <li> 5 because this product does what it is supposed to do:  topically to relieve itching, burning and pain from skin inflammations, injected as a dental anesthetic or as a local anesthetic for minor surgery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several analgesic creams over the years of waxing and plucking, but have never been too thrilled with BikiniZone and peers.  I tried this one and it seems to be more effective.  I&#x27;ve used it in combination with a Tria laser and waxing.  Surprisingly, this is also a go-to in my camping/hiking prep bag because it is absolutely magical at eliminating the itch of bug bites.  I used it the first time on a whim because I was out of my cortizone cream, and now I think this actually works faster at getting rid of the itchy-scratchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the consistency were slightly less liquid, because I always forget to open it with the cap completely straight up, and usually end up with a bit of overflow in the cap.  Open with caution and you&#x27;ll be okay though.</li>
    <li> Box showed up looking very old and like it has been wet.&lt;br /&gt;The gel was watery, waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Tossed it.</li>
    <li> Sorry, didnt work for me... does not mean it is not a good product, everyone is different and reacts differently.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with an epilator, and it did not numb enough. It barely numbed at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally to use with the Derma Roller.  I used it once before rolling but since the needles on the roller never pierced my skin I didn&#x27;t actually need the topical analgesic gel.  I did take it with me to Hawaii though, and used it when my little boy and I got sunburnt.  I gave him some Ibuprofen and put alot of Satin Smooth on his back and shoulders.  After about 5 minutes he wasn&#x27;t complaining anymore.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the Ibuprofen or the Satin Smooth.  Might have been the combo.</li>
    <li> This product may be good, I just was unsure if it was from manufacturer, as it had no seal, and the date on it was several years old. I wasn&#x27;t going to take a chance.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a zero I would. I rarely review items but I want people to be warned that this product does not work at all and it&#x27;s a waste of your money. I bought the cream to numb my upper lip before threading hairs and this product is a hoax, no effect, doesn&#x27;t work, you might as well rub thickened water on yourself and you will get the same exact effect. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this particular product because it says &amp;#34;gel.&amp;#34; I thought that would go on easily and be sort of cooling on the skin. But this product is really runny - more like runny lotion. So runny in fact that when I opened the lid the first time and tipped the bottle, a ton pored right out!!</li>
    <li> I purchased to help with the pain of laser hair removal.. I applied to my face and bikini area, it doesn&#x27;t completely numb the area but I feel no pain after the procedure.. I would recommend it for areas were the skin isn&#x27;t very dense or thick like your face.. Not so much for the bikini area</li>
    <li> This is not a gel...or a lotion...it&#x27;s like a thick liquid and runs out of the tube. Not sure if I received a &amp;#34;bad batch...&amp;#34;; the expiration date was fine. It works okay, though.</li>
