      <li>Make sure the sprayer has a FINE mist</li>
      <li>Make sure you purchase a fine mist spray bottle as it helps with even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is not a bad smell, but it is very strong.</li>
      <li>It has a reeeeeeealllyyy strong smell...</li>
      <li>The mist isn&#x27;t as fine as it could be; perhaps therein lies the problem.</li>
      <li>I ordered Final Seal with great expectations.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product.</li>
      <li>but this is a lot more reasonable in price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t have higher ratings, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is by far the best for the price.</li>
      <li>Smooth and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I am now on a search to find one to fit that particular bottle.</li>
      <li>it keeps your makeup in place thru sweat, tears and even some exuberant sexy time.</li>
      <li>I went with the big bottle as I get much more product for a couple more bucks, spent $4 on a fine mist spray bottle...</li>
      <li>First off it didn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle, which is probably my fault for misreading  the description.</li>
      <li>Better than Urban Decay or anything in Sephora.</li>
      <li>It feels like tingly mint when you first spray it on and can burn if it gets into your eyes.  </li>
      <li>Great in summer and even Hawaii for long lasting makeup wear.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used, I did not have a good spray bottle</li>
      <li>This is a MUST have for anyone who wears makeup in humid or hot environments.</li>
      <li>as one of the first ingredients is alcohol.</li>
      <li>make sure you find the lightest misting sprayer possible as it will breakup your makeup</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Some days I will blot a little towards the end of the day depending on how hot it was, and if I have any stops after work, but most days im completely fine without blotting.</li>
      <li>I reserve it for more special occasions because I&#x27;m not sure my skin loves this stuff; I have super sensitive skin and the high acohol content and strong</li>
      <li>Besides all that amazingness, it also helps keep my super oily face softly matte!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>product I received appears to be real</li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>really sets the makeup in place all day</li>
      <li>Just costs twice as much.</li>
      <li>the pros FAR outweigh the cons!!!</li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii and the weather is usually hot and humid and my makeup holds up.</li>
      <li>: The smell is a little strong (mint) and takes some getting used to, but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>500% better than other finishing spray I&#x27;ve used before</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY spray that didn&#x27;t discolor my makeup and set it right!</li>
      <li>By the time I get home there is pretty much no make up left on my face.</li>
      <li>I also live in the humid South.</li>
      <li>A couple of the reviews on here were confusing as the smaller 2 oz bottle has great reviews, but this big bottle doesnt...</li>
      <li>This is Owen&#x27;s wife: I purchased this product because when I had my makup done for my wedding the professional MUA used this to set my makeup, and that makeup was bulllet proof!</li>
      <li>lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t come with a spray bottle, so you will have to purchase one or use an old bottle (I used a mini body spray bottle that I had).</li>
      <li>I have noticed that I have a bit more dry skin after using, but its nothing a little lotion wont fix.</li>
      <li>normally I use skindanavia or urban decay</li>
      <li>I have since used it on myself with my less than stellar skils and normal-wear (vs. longwear) products and can attest to the fact that it does indeed keep your makeup on AND makes it tear proof too!</li>
      <li>have VERY oily skin and even the most expensive makeup</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s just a regular setting spray.</li>
      <li>Its apart of my professional kit and my personal kit.</li>
      <li>As a professional Makeup Artist, my clients want their makeup to last for hours without having to use powder or blot oil.</li>
      <li>Also, the product has not interfered with my acne, made it worse [or better for that matter].</li>
      <li>However, when its first applied, it is a little sticky when drying</li>
      <li>(looks and smells exactly like my previous Final Seal) and was sealed when it arrived.</li>
      <li>Not forever (and in the summer for less time than in the winter for obvious reasons) but defnitely much longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>The only con is that if you spray it too close or spray too much you will have little dots in your makeup that make you look like you got sprayed with water</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Holy Grail makeup product.  This keeps my makeup from coming off in heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and glad to find it conveniently on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The product I received appears to be real (looks and smells exactly like my previous Final Seal) and was sealed when it arrived.</li>
    <li> moisturize moisturize moisturize!! the first few times i used this is gave me peeling dry skin you have to over moisturize to use this. also this is a refill so it does not come with a spray...make sure you find the lightest misting sprayer possible as it will breakup your makeup and you&#x27;ll have to start over due to blotchy makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and does keep my make up in place all day! However, when its first applied, it is a little sticky when drying and I don&#x27;t use it for everyday use. But it&#x27;s great for special occasions and partying, or even an outdoor bbq!! Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve found that really works in humid weather. Makeup doesn&#x27;t budge!</li>
    <li> This setting spray is no joke! Your makeup will stay put all day. The only con is that if you spray it too close or spray too much you will have little dots in your makeup that make you look like you got sprayed with water but you can&#x27;t get them off.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, really strong mouthwash scent</li>
    <li> Your makeup doesn&#x27;t  move at all love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s just a regular setting spray. Just costs twice as much. I&#x27;ll still use it since I did buy it but repurchase?? No.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product. The first few times I used, I did not have a good spray bottle but now that I have a good spray bottle, it has been quite amazing! I have very oily skin and it is so frustrating when my makeup transfers when I hug people at church, etc.  So, when I have a big event I use my spray!</li>
    <li> A bit sticky when it first comes in to contact with the skin, but a great setting spray!!</li>
    <li> This is Owen&#x27;s wife: I purchased this product because when I had my makup done for my wedding the professional MUA used this to set my makeup, and that makeup was bulllet proof! I have since used it on myself with my less than stellar skils and normal-wear (vs. longwear) products and can attest to the fact that it does indeed keep your makeup on AND makes it tear proof too! Besides all that amazingness, it also helps keep my super oily face softly matte! Not forever (and in the summer for less time than in the winter for obvious reasons) but defnitely much longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it. I reserve it for more special occasions because I&#x27;m not sure my skin loves this stuff; I have super sensitive skin and the high acohol content and strong (mouthwash-like) fragrance of this irritate it just a little I think. Hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, but then again I&#x27;ve never worn it multiple days in a row. 500% better than other finishing spray I&#x27;ve used before</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have for anyone who wears makeup in humid or hot environments. MY MAKEUP STAYS ON.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to think we just didn&#x27;t care because you can&#x27;t tell from the audience. I keep trying it with varying makeup applications, but it just keeps making everything clumpy where the spray pattern is. Booooo.</li>
    <li> In my daughter&#x27;s own words, &amp;#34;Mom, this stuff is fantastic &amp;#34;.  Smooth and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I use it daily it works great lasts a good 6-8 hours on my oily skin</li>
    <li> First off it didn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle, which is probably my fault for misreading  the description. So I went out and bought a spray bottle for it and every time I use it, it leaves little white spots on my face, messing up my makeup.</li>
    <li> This setting spray kicks the crap out of any others including urban decay! A must buy! Nothing compares</li>
    <li> It has a reeeeeeealllyyy strong smell...it is not a bad smell, but it is very strong. When i applied it, it left my face feeling stiff and a little shiny. It kinda works...</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works as described. I was not shiny for long amounts of time and it didn&#x27;t transfer. Four stars because I has a little breakout after use.</li>
    <li> I loveee this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day- but when I&#x27;ve got a date (when I&#x27;m going to be kissing or some such thing) and don&#x27;t want my makeup to rub off or smear, or when I&#x27;ve got a all day event- this is my go to stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say I use probably about six sprays to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; my face for the day. Sometimes I give my eyelids an extra spray if I have heavier eye makeup, or just reallyyyy don&#x27;t want my eye makeup to budge.&lt;br /&gt;It has a minty smell that a lot of people seem to have a problem with, but I like it and the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to hang around long.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff- I have ordered and reordered many times!</li>
    <li> Works great I mist more then 3 times.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to using this product, but it is required to spray it over your face after applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I received the bottle, but no spraying device attached??  I am now on a search to find one to fit that particular bottle.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again it works well</li>
    <li> I live in Texas humity and this is perfect for keeping make up set.</li>
    <li> My makeup stays on all day with this spray, it was everything I expected it to be</li>
    <li> DIDNT COME WITH A SPRAY NOZZLE???</li>
    <li> The best makeup sealer out there! Better than Urban Decay or anything in Sephora. I have used this stuff religiously for a year and would never go back!</li>
    <li> Great product for refilling smaller bottles, arrived quickly and excellent price for volume. highly recommend! Made it through a week at DisneyWorld at national pageant without failing my daughter or I</li>
    <li> Ive been using Ben Nye Final Seal for years. As a professional Makeup Artist, my clients want their makeup to last for hours without having to use powder or blot oil. Final Seal gives my clients the security of their makeup lasting until they take it off (some take it off the next day with the makeup still in tact). I use this myself as I hate when my makeup comes off on my collar or when I hug someone. This stuff is swear-proof and smudge proof. This is like my 8th bottle. Its apart of my professional kit and my personal kit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. It works well, if you know how to use it. This doesn&#x27;t come with a spray bottle, so you will have to purchase one or use an old bottle (I used a mini body spray bottle that I had). Make sure the sprayer has a FINE mist sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When spraying the sealer on your face, hold the bottle UP, and spray your face at an angle 8-10 inches away (like you&#x27;re taking a &amp;#34;selfie&amp;#34; to avoid an ugly double chin pic). It looks dramatic when you do it, but trust me, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY oily skin and even the most expensive makeup will slide off my face, even with a primer! I also live in the humid South. This is the ONLY spray that didn&#x27;t discolor my makeup and set it right! This is inexpensive, too, compared to other sealers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The smell is a little strong (mint) and takes some getting used to, but it goes away quickly. The spray does have alcohol so it may have a tingle. Face might feel sticky while it&#x27;s drying, but goes away in 30 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. the pros FAR outweigh the cons!!!</li>
    <li> Lol I love this stuff normally I use skindanavia or urban decay but this is a lot more reasonable in price. It def freezes your makeup on your face. I live in texas and we have serious heat. I say beware because I sprayed my face before I blended out a spot on my face and could NOT for the life of me remove it without taking my makeup off lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I ordered Final Seal with great expectations.  When I received it and opened the bag I was sorely disappointed that there was no spray pump with it!  So I have this bottle of liquid that I can&#x27;t use until I go out and BUY a spray pump.  They don&#x27;t mention in the description that &amp;#34;oh by the way this liquid does NOT come with a pump&amp;#34;!  So irritated!</li>
    <li> It burns my skin when I sprayed it. So I don&#x27;t use it, it was a waste of my money!!!</li>
    <li> really sets the makeup in place all day</li>
    <li> Keeps my makeup on thru sweaty workouts</li>
    <li> Keeps my wifes face together</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see if this stuff blows me away. I&#x27;ve now used it three times and haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. My makeup still smudges, still fades about halfway through a workday. I use it with a small glass fine-mist spray bottle. The mist isn&#x27;t as fine as it could be; perhaps therein lies the problem. I&#x27;m still hopeful.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It keeps your makeup looking matte for hours and helps prevent your makeup from smearing if you sweat. I used mehron barrier spray before this product and I will never go back.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did before this stuff. My face sweats and this keeps my makeup on. It&#x27;s basically hairspray for your face. I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t have higher ratings, I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is by far the best for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  It seals your make up in so that you are set for the day.  I recommend applying mascara after misting.</li>
    <li> If you want all day wear of your makeup can&#x27;t beat this product. I use it when I have heavy makeup on while cosplaying and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! This produce stings your face and after you spry it on your face (following the direction), it leaves spray marks on your face! I tried many different brand (name brands like Make Up Forever and Urban Decay), and I was sorry I got suckered into buying because it was cheaper. You get what you paid for!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m a makeup queen. Great price, works perfectly....it keeps your makeup in place thru sweat, tears and even some exuberant sexy time. This will be in my beauty arsenal from now on.</li>
    <li> Great in summer and even Hawaii for long lasting makeup wear. If you wear a hat and get sweaty, the spray will glob up on your forehead after a while but it never shows on me, I can only feel it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have abnormally oily skin [all over oil, not just T-zone]. I blot every couple of hours religiously, and my makeup ends up looking very dry and flakey [for about an hour or so, and then I get oily again]. By the time I get home there is pretty much no make up left on my face. So I have been looking for products to combat this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magic. After I do my face, I mist myself with the Final Seal and im done. I don&#x27;t have to re-apply my make up, and my makeup is actually still there after I get home from work [surprise!]. Im not worried about how greasy I look... its great. Some days I will blot a little towards the end of the day depending on how hot it was, and if I have any stops after work, but most days im completely fine without blotting. I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this bottle does not come with a pump. A couple of the reviews on here were confusing as the smaller 2 oz bottle has great reviews, but this big bottle doesnt... even though its the same product. I went with the big bottle as I get much more product for a couple more bucks, spent $4 on a fine mist spray bottle... i bought this one:  [[ASIN:B000NIY7QM B000NIY7QM]] and voila more bang for my buck. Make sure you purchase a fine mist spray bottle as it helps with even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have the mint smell [like mouthwash] that everyone refers to. Its really not that bad. It goes away in a couple of seconds after sprayed. It also can have a bit of a tightening/drying sensation... as one of the first ingredients is alcohol. I have noticed that I have a bit more dry skin after using, but its nothing a little lotion wont fix. Also, the product has not interfered with my acne, made it worse [or better for that matter]. Will continue to purchase and use. 5 stars hands down.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product, keeps my make up on for hours, I have tried so many products that don&#x27;t work as well as this!! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It feels like tingly mint when you first spray it on and can burn if it gets into your eyes.  It tightens but then after that I don&#x27;t know I have it on for the rest of the day!  Holds my makeup great in humid, sunny Florida!</li>
    <li> I used this as a high school theatre geek, and now it&#x27;s saving my crazy oily face in this hot-as-Hades South Carolina summer. Seriously. It&#x27;s the best. No makeup lover should be without it in their arsenal.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> This product seriously does wonders to keep my makeup on my face all day! I live in Hawaii and the weather is usually hot and humid and my makeup holds up.</li>
    <li> Awesome at making makeup waterproof. Smells like Listerine LOL. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Will buy again and again!</li>
