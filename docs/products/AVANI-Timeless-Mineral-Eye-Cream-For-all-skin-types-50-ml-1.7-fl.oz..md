      <li>I love this eye cream!</li>
      <li>Love Avani anything!</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love Avani products!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say, there is no difference</li>
      <li>Another EXCELLENT product that you don&#x27;t hear much about is The Lab Room - a must try for</li>
      <li>The scent of mine was nice.</li>
      <li>I always use Avani for my body and face and have tried many, many products in my lifetime!</li>
      <li>I feel like I have reduced the bags and fine lines, it smells great , and feels nice and smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great but worth considering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly</li>
      <li>Plus, the cost is very cheap for what you get.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the cream it had a protectant seal just sitting on top.</li>
      <li>I love the cream inside but wouldn&#x27;t order from this supplier again.</li>
      <li>and I heartily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for a better bargain, order it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>However, I buy eye cream for moisturizing and firming because I feel I have more of a problem with sagging eyelids and crepiness under the eyes than I do wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to feel like I have coats of creams on my face, which is way I love Avani products.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Basically, this is an OK product.</li>
      <li>I also, bought this for my sister and she love it as well ..</li>
      <li>The skin around my eyes have never been softer or looked better.  </li>
      <li>I have since using this up started using a Burts Bee&#x27;s Age Renewal eye cream which I love as well...</li>
      <li>Plus, most eye creams hurt my eyes....</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I was using this more as a preventive than anything else.</li>
      <li>This product feels absolutely fabulous under my eyes!  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eye.</li>
      <li>I used Lancome eye cream before purchasing Avani, and I feel that Lancome&#x27;s product was much better.  </li>
      <li>I love love this product.</li>
      <li>I do know that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it feels okay when I put it on.</li>
      <li>Amazon prices much better than at&lt;br /&gt;the mall.  </li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with the eye serum--am loving the results, and it&#x27;s a super value--most eye creams and serums cost considerably more.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not liquid, more like creme and smell is fine.</li>
      <li>Very light weight and a super buy for the price.</li>
      <li>the fine lines around my eyes are almost invisible.</li>
      <li>I saw improvement in the fine line appearance around my eyes.</li>
      <li>This is a great eye cream and all around facial cream.</li>
      <li>All the popular brands feel good to put on, but seem to be too thin in textuure to do any good.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Avani!!!</li>
      <li>But what is awesome is the HUGE size (1.7 oz) vs the usual size eye creams</li>
      <li>You will see significant changes.</li>
      <li>I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face.</li>
      <li>This is my first purchase of a product from this company and I am really satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I checked amazon and they had the peel and moisturizer, then I also saw this eye cream and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is rich and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pain to pull it off and on, but it keeps it super fresh!</li>
      <li>I think the product is great and the price for that generous size is unbelievable:)</li>
      <li>Bought it for a friend by request, she say the product is not so good ,that&#x27;s why the price is low</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting all that much, it was more of &amp;#34;I want to try everything&amp;#34; and hadn&#x27;t tried this brand yet</li>
      <li>Still not a bad price for eye cream...</li>
      <li>Ok let me start by saying that the ONLY reason I gave this two stars is because I actually do love the product inside.</li>
      <li>The eye cream was easy to apply, blended in very well.</li>
      <li>The product really help smooth everything out.</li>
      <li>I received the eye cream in a gold box that was dented, torn in more then one place, and was so old had dust all over the inside and the words on the box had started to fade away.</li>
      <li>I also put on my smile lines , forehead and neck..</li>
      <li>and i Love this product So far.</li>
      <li>I could see results immediately - it tightens the skin under your eyes right away</li>
      <li>but I did notice the difference right away.</li>
      <li>so far its worked fine for me.</li>
      <li>(OK, well, I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my 20s, but it definitely has helped.)  </li>
      <li>things first:  </li>
      <li>I am an avid buyer of top shelf brands when it comes to caring for my skin, I&#x27;ve tried 100&#x27;s, but to my surprise this actually works.</li>
      <li>Feels so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>And the fact that I found so many Avani products at such a deal is to die for!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have kept buying this eye cream for a year now after I tried it first time.</li>
      <li>Love the jar and it is big</li>
      <li>It does have a fragrance to it, so if that is a concern for you this might not be the one.&lt;br /&gt;Before this eye cream I was using a French eye oil which was ok, but considering what I paid it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Avani.</li>
      <li>the jar is bigger than most eye creams.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, light fragrance but very soft scent..</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, and pretty realistic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and feels pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>When I took the lid off, some of the cream had seeped out and it was kind of a mess.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to give a complete rating, but I love the fact that it has a very light smell and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this eye cream! the consistency of the cream is perfect.  not too thick and not too oily.  and it feels so wonderful on my skin and dries fairly quick.  Plus, the cost is very cheap for what you get.  I will definitely get another bottle once it finishes. Just ordered one for my boyfriend too</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I was using this more as a preventive than anything else. I do have dirk circles and it seemed to make those a good deal better, but it was a little hard to tell. I do know that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it feels okay when I put it on. It moisturizes well. I do have some fine lines and didn&#x27;t notice any change in those, but I bought this a while back and haven&#x27;t noticed them getting worse either. Basically, this is an OK product. Better than nothing, not as good as others, but for the price it&#x27;s a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy it, I recommend keeping the white plastic cover under the lid. It&#x27;s a pain to pull it off and on, but it keeps it super fresh!</li>
    <li> Best part of this product is the complements I received once I started using it. Absolutely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get this eye cream. but it doesn&#x27;t agree with my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are so sore when I use it, I wanted to use but I gave up.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream and all around facial cream. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend by request, she say the product is not so good ,that&#x27;s why the price is low I guess</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very thick, so you only need to use a little. It&#x27;s a large jar that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> eye cream perfect to my skin. works very well!!!!!!!the amazing results after few uses. eyes looks perfect, no blackness under eyes. rally anti aging cream!!!</li>
    <li> Might work for other people but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Only use half and threw away the rest.</li>
    <li> Good creme, gives hydration and refines wrinkles. I really like texture, it&#x27;s not liquid, more like creme and smell is fine. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store. Always check before purchasing elsewhere! The Avani products are unbelievable. You will see significant changes. I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face. I&lt;br /&gt;switched immediately.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of cream in the package, so you&#x27;ll have it forever! Even for me, I use eye cream at least twice a day, but I&#x27;m having this for a couple of months now! however I&#x27;m not sure about the quality, I would like something greasier, in that way I feel more like that my skin is nourished, with this I&#x27;m like meeeh, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> kinda thick. It works good but too thick for my  taste. Will buy again and again.Love the jar and it is big</li>
    <li> Wanted to see if this really worked, so I&#x27;ve only been doing one eye since I got this.  I can honestly say, there is no difference</li>
    <li> Ok let me start by saying that the ONLY reason I gave this two stars is because I actually do love the product inside. I feel like I have reduced the bags and fine lines, it smells great , and feels nice and smooth to apply. BUT would I buy this product again? Not from this seller. I received the eye cream in a gold box that was dented, torn in more then one place, and was so old had dust all over the inside and the words on the box had started to fade away. When I opened the cream it had a protectant seal just sitting on top. It was in no way actually connected to the container and not protecting anything, I have no idea why it was there other then to make me take notice to the fact that it looked opened. All in all I love the cream inside but wouldn&#x27;t order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Very Nice!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a product from this company and I am really satisfied with it. However,it is so thick it is a bit difficult to get the product out of the sloped sides of the jar.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream. Makes your eyes soft and help with wrinkles</li>
    <li> Love Avani anything! This stuff does what it says it will do. I always use Avani for my body and face and have tried many, many products in my lifetime! There is no better for me!</li>
    <li> Product line is wonderful.  Feels so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I have kept buying this eye cream for a year now after I tried it first time. it is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream twice a day.  I like the feel and texture of the product and ease of application.  I have use the product for one month and feel it is maintaining the appearance of the skin around my eye.  I do not see improvement in the existing lines.  I used Lancome eye cream before purchasing Avani, and I feel that Lancome&#x27;s product was much better.  I saw improvement in the fine line appearance around my eyes.</li>
    <li> To hard of a cream to work with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really very good and I heartily recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for a better bargain, order it from Amazon.  The difference in price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love Avani products! I have oily skin and black heads are my major problem.  I don&#x27;t like to feel like I have coats of creams on my face, which is way I love Avani products.  I moisturize with out the heavy gunk.  And the fact that I found so many Avani products at such a deal is to die for!!&lt;br /&gt;I am using these products to maintain my youthful look. I am 33 and my goal is to look 10 years younger for the rest of my life.  Don&#x27;t wait till you get wrinkles to start fighting them off.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my eye area. I used it for almost a year and nothing ever changed. I still had wrinkles and dark circles. The eye cream lack&#x27;s the moisture that my eye area desperately needs. In an hour&#x27;s time, my eye area was dry and had shown my visible wrinkles.  The eye cream was easy to apply, blended in very well. And you could use it under makeup. Just make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eye. Because it will burn and make your eyes tear!</li>
    <li> Purchased the eye cream with several other Avani products and they are good. Amazon prices much better than at&lt;br /&gt;the mall.  Eye cream did seem to firm.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great but worth considering.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the eye serum--am loving the results, and it&#x27;s a super value--most eye creams and serums cost considerably more.</li>
    <li> I learned the hard way that a little goes a long way... this is a excellent eye cream.  The skin around my eyes have never been softer or looked better.  Thanks Avani!!!</li>
    <li> I had samples of avani dead sea skin peel used at sam;s club. the price was high. I checked amazon and they had the peel and moisturizer, then I also saw this eye cream and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is rich and absorbs well. But what is awesome is the HUGE size (1.7 oz) vs the usual size eye creams less than half that amount!&lt;br /&gt;So I think the product is great and the price for that generous size is unbelievable:)</li>
    <li> Bought this through a website for less than $20 and would buy it again. Very moisturizing, light fragrance but very soft scent.. Have used it for a couple of days morning and night and already see a lightening in my dark circles. The skin around my eyes feels tighter, smoother, and the lines are less defined. I am 22 years old and i Love this product So far.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 because I wish it worked as well as the anti aging face</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to give a complete rating, but I love the fact that it has a very light smell and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have tried to use it every night but I really can&#x27;t say it if works yet because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. Will update at a later date.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time with minimal packaging. When I took the lid off, some of the cream had seeped out and it was kind of a mess. Have used it 6 days, but haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 and have a few fine lines.  However, I buy eye cream for moisturizing and firming because I feel I have more of a problem with sagging eyelids and crepiness under the eyes than I do wrinkles.  That said, this cream feels heavy but absorbs completely, and is fairly moisturizing.  Makes my eyes feel tight, which I first mistook for dryness, but perhaps it is the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; effect of the cream.  The scent is not great but not too strong either.  I do notice a bit of stinging sometimes if I use it around my occular bones, but I&#x27;m assuming this is a result of my using a face cream with retinol, and the two have overlapped a little.  I do prefer to use this at night because if I use it twice a day, I notice flaking on my eyelids. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, and pretty realistic.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin since high school, toning, moisturizing, washing, etc and I&#x27;ve used night cream and eye cream for 10+ years....it&#x27;s never too early to start. This product is great! You get so much for your money.  Plus, most eye creams hurt my eyes....come on now, they all say &#x27;avoid getting in your eyes&#x27; but seriously....for someone that thinks water hurts when it gets in your eyes.... This one rocks! This is one of the few creams that has not irritated my eyes. I love it. Very light weight and a super buy for the price. Give it a try, what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eye cream that works for so long.  All the popular brands feel good to put on, but seem to be too thin in textuure to do any good.  AVANI Timeless works!!!  It has a thicker texture, but absorbs wonderfully, and in 1 week I can see a difference in the lines around my eyes.  There&#x27;s another jar in my cart to buy again!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my mom, and she said it made her eyes puff up a little and the surrounding skin turn red. Her skin type is dry, and easily irritated so that is something to consider- although I was hoping that eye cream of all substances would be more on the tame side.</li>
    <li> I love love this product. the fine lines around my eyes are almost invisible. I also put on my smile lines , forehead and neck.. just a touch.. I also, bought this for my sister and she love it as well ..</li>
    <li> WOW!  This product feels absolutely fabulous under my eyes!  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days so I don&#x27;t know what the results will be, but it is the perfect consistency.  It has a very light fragrance that is pleasant and not distracting or bothersome.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am tired of the pricey eye cream I used from a certain brand and thought I should look for a eye cream with great reviews on Amazon, and the reviews for this product seems to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was really disappointed when I open the package, this product is very badly wrapped, there were some leakage too, the bottle was made with cheap plastic and the ingredients said on the package was rather unbelievable from a scientific point of view, for example, like&amp;#34;dead sea abstract&amp;#34; , what does it even mean? highly concentrated salt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product doesn&#x27;t seems to absorb very well, but it doesn&#x27;t give me irritated eyes either, so I will just give it a 3 star</li>
    <li> This is not cream- it&#x27;s some sort of gritty gel that doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waist your money. I would send it back but shipping would cost too much.</li>
    <li> I have recently started getting crows feet and fine lines under my eye. The product really help smooth everything out. I have since using this up started using a Burts Bee&#x27;s Age Renewal eye cream which I love as well...BUT...I am going back to this. Not only do you get more product, but I noticed that my dark circles creeped right back in after I stopped using this. Also, the ingredient list is really reassuring.  The only con is that it does dry out rather fast in the jar because you use so little that it sat around for about 3 months before I finished the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> love this product my eyes appear smoother and not as dark,  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly</li>
    <li> I ordered this some months ago for $13; received confirmation and notification that it shipped; then received notice my account had been credited.  When I checked my order status, it said the package had been recalled and I&#x27;ve continued to receive requests to rate both the product and the seller ever since.  If I check that package status today it reads &amp;#34;package undeliverable.&amp;#34;  Whaaaa?  Today I receive this request to rate the product and I notice the price has gone up a few dollars to $15.68.  Still not a bad price for eye cream...but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering it from this seller.</li>
    <li> No complaints. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations and I don&#x27;t expect a miracle. Its like insurance policy. Maybe I will have less wrinkles, maybe I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It was the least expensive eye cream I was able to find and it did work okay, but not great.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend for puffiness and dark circles.  Love this product.  Hurry and get yours,  don&#x27;t wait another day.  Hurry, hurry.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting all that much, it was more of &amp;#34;I want to try everything&amp;#34; and hadn&#x27;t tried this brand yet so I bought it. After seeing the prices on Amazon being so low I thought I wouldn&#x27;t lose much if I did. I am an avid buyer of top shelf brands when it comes to caring for my skin, I&#x27;ve tried 100&#x27;s, but to my surprise this actually works. I could see results immediately - it tightens the skin under your eyes right away and you can feel it. It&#x27;s not miracle worker by any means but I did notice the difference right away. My dark circles we less noticeable after one use. It is a little on the thicker side and you don&#x27;t need much. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s a 10 percent of the original on Amazon, it did make me skeptical, but my batch was fine. I saw others complain it was old and smelly. The scent of mine was nice. It does have a fragrance to it, so if that is a concern for you this might not be the one.&lt;br /&gt;Before this eye cream I was using a French eye oil which was ok, but considering what I paid it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Avani. Another EXCELLENT product that you don&#x27;t hear much about is The Lab Room - a must try for all you skin care  lovers! I&#x27;m hoping Amazon will start carrying that brand also (fingers crossed).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with how well this works.  Over the past few years, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelids have lost some of their elasticity.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find an eye cream that works but haven&#x27;t found anything that helps.  Much to my pleasant surprise, this cream has helped restore some of the youthfulness to my eyes.  (OK, well, I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my 20s, but it definitely has helped.)  Very impressive stuff!</li>
    <li> paid $17 for this here on amazon. I was a little hesitant since some reviews said it didnt work, but i really like it. so far its worked fine for me. no miracle, but i like to apply at night before i go to bed. This will be my go-to eye cream from now on. the price is great and you get a lot for your $. the jar is bigger than most eye creams. Cream is thick and a little goes a long way. Before i was using either Avon, Garnier, or oil of olay, and for the price this is the best. and in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> I am not usually sensitive to skin products, but this one really bothered me. It made my eyes water and burn. Unfortunately I cannot return the item.</li>
    <li> I adore Avani products and live by them</li>
    <li> I have only been using the eye cream for a few weeks and see dead skin rolling off and expect to see greater improvement as time goes by.</li>
    <li> Avani Eye Cream is superb.  It is also economical, as it comes in a large quantity which does not require replacement as frequently as all other eye creams.  Try it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> To be upfront I&#x27;m always skeptical when I see an item that is 10% of its original price especially when that original prince is $100 and up.  I had a gift card and figured, &amp;#34;What the heck?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first:  You need VERY little of this cream to apply.  A literal dab will do ya.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy and feels pretty darn good.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and before bed and there is a HUGE difference in under-eye puffiness and dark circles.  Despite the instructions explicitly saying not to, I even put some on my eye lids.  The results?  Insta-face lift for saggy upper-eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this product.  At this price, why not give it a try?</li>
