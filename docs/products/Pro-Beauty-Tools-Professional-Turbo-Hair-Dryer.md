      <li>This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I love this dryer.</li>
      <li>It would be better if the cord was retractable.</li>
      <li>This was such a great deal!</li>
      <li>Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better</li>
      <li>but does everything it should and a bit more.</li>
      <li>it is a lighter weight, and has more power.</li>
      <li>Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Originally purchased elsewhere for $10 more!</li>
      <li>but it works better.</li>
      <li>We love the 3 temperature settings and the diffuser.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Its ok though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better for ur electric bill.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>and I love the attachments that cone with it.</li>
      <li>I also needed a dryer with a long cord, the 9ft cord on this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>Very happy to have this after trying two other dryers.  </li>
      <li>I also love the cool setting feature on the dryer.  </li>
      <li>Low power, but with patience it does a beautiful job</li>
      <li>Used this and seems to do fine.</li>
      <li>Everything worked fine</li>
      <li>It blows no air and is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Definitely needed an upgrade and this is a great buy.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
      <li>I purchased this a while back and still works great.</li>
      <li>Not as light weight as I had hoped</li>
      <li>It makes my hair shinier and looks smooth even after I straighten it.</li>
      <li>Everything was going great till my mom and cousin used it one day and suddenly when I turned it on it went out!!!!</li>
      <li>It works great and it is quiet</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars only because it did a great job when it was working.</li>
      <li>Its very powerful for its size</li>
      <li>Volume of air is barely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good.</li>
      <li>Dryer is Great for the money, It is quiet gets hot and seems to compare to the Chi dryer we also have in the salon.</li>
      <li>The diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody!</li>
      <li>how well it dried my hair as good or better as the Chi.  </li>
      <li>Bought this dryer a year ago for under $40 hoping it would be better than most regular $20 ones.</li>
      <li>High-ish heat and the high speed is more like a medium speed.</li>
      <li>Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn&#x27;t even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort.</li>
      <li>dries my hair pretty fast &amp; gets nice &amp; hot on the highest heat setting.</li>
      <li>This new one better last more than a year!</li>
      <li>My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did!</li>
      <li>I thought for the money it was worth a try</li>
      <li>I used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room.</li>
      <li>but if it is, I am very glad as I had the VS750 for 14 years and hope I have this one for a long time.</li>
      <li>I received it quickly and it was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot but still drys my hair quickly</li>
      <li>, the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls.  </li>
      <li>but one I picked up (a turquoise coloured model that looked too cheap despite the high price tag).  </li>
      <li>Super fast delivery</li>
      <li>It comes with the two attachments and the different heat settings are great if you need to dry your hair quickly or if you are taking your time to style.</li>
      <li>I definitely would recommend to buy this product, worth the money and the item shipped fast! :)</li>
      <li>Also the COOL SHOT is actually cool, most models give you slightly cooler...</li>
      <li>She likes it pretty well and said it dries her very long/thick hair pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>but it is definitely a strong current and very hot (variable temp)</li>
      <li>The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I&#x27;ve never seen before with a blow-dryer before.</li>
      <li>It does not blow hot air anymore.  </li>
      <li>I was really dispointed!  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time tonight...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has a quiet motor, a long cord, and dries great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s veryyyyy hot on the hot setting.</li>
      <li>After a dizzying hour looking at hairdryers in the store aisle I finally bought this in favour of many higher priced models.  </li>
      <li>which are 3 times the cost of this at first</li>
      <li>I used it on medium which was plenty hot.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Good hair dryer but kinda heavy</li>
      <li>The motor is quiet but it takes a longer time to dry hair and then the hair is fly away  - not what I wanted at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Volume of air is barely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good.</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal! My mom will love getting this as a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> It is not as powerful of a blow dryer as I thought as I had previous products from the same brand. It works like any other standard blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Works very fast and is very quiet! I love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how this hair dryer made my hair feel so soft and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> These are nice hair dryers.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband - they&#x27;re great.  Every time a guest has used mine they comment on how nice it is.  Feels like your at the salon.</li>
    <li> Low power, but with patience it does a beautiful job</li>
    <li> Very good Quality Hair Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I think this hair dryer dries well and the motor is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use this hair dryer with the diffuser on.  I find that it is not particularly ergonomic or light-weight.  Sometimes while holding the dryer, I accidentally change the heat setting.  Perhaps I just need to use it a little longer to get used to it (my previous hair dryer was smaller and didn&#x27;t have a diffuser attachment).</li>
    <li> Motor does not blow hard enough or hot enough.  On the plus side, chord is very long.</li>
    <li> New to hair dryers but does everything it should and a bit more.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I purchased a defective dryer, but the first time I used it the motor started making a high pitched noise, and the air stopped coming out in a steady stream.  I thought maybe it was just \\&quot;warming up\\&quot; but the next time I used it, it did the same thing, with the air only coming out in puffs.  The motor was so loud, it sounded as if it were going to start smoking.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer won&#x27;t turn on!!!!! Didn&#x27;t have a problem last time I used it! Bought Jan 2014!!! Lasted a year and I probably use it 2-3 times per week!!! Waste of money! Should last longer than that!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a little over a year now and it has worked well. I would say it&#x27;s made my hair feel a bit softer and less tangled, but it&#x27;s not a huge difference. I like that it&#x27;s not very loud, and it does do a good job of drying my hair faster than other hair dryers. That&#x27;s saying a lot, because my hair can take a very long time to dry. The cord is really quite long, which doesn&#x27;t seem entirely necessary to me, and it takes a little extra time to wind the cord back up when I&#x27;m done. It would be better if the cord was retractable. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great value for hairdryer....quiet and quick.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. It&#x27;s very quiet and drys thick hair very fast. Small money with big results. Hightly recommended!</li>
    <li> i had this blow dryer for about 2 months and it didn&#x27;t work after that. i was very disappointed, it worked great until the day it didn&#x27;t turn on. i tried different plugs and still nothing. Luckily i had an old blow dryer to use! i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I had it Chi blow dryer for 10 years  and I loved it. Always worried about when it would finally give out and I would have to shell out the expensive cost to replace it. Well that day finally came and I was just about to purchase another Chi when I came across this blow dryer.  I thought for the money it was worth a try and if I didn&#x27;t like it I can always send it back. This blow dryer is awesome!  I was so surprised how well it dried my hair as good or better as the Chi.  It&#x27;s very quiet as well which I like.  The cold feature is better than any dryer I have ever used.  I would absolutely recommend the dryer and I will absolutely buy it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to find a quality hair dryer at an affordable price. it was priced well but it took forever to dry my short, thin hair and is a bit heavy too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an older women friend of mine who said it was just too heavy to work with. Thought maybe she was being dramatic but I agree 100%. This hair dryer is much heavier than any other hairdryer I have ever owned which by the way has now taken residence in our guest bathroom because it cost too much to return due to it&#x27;s weight.. Ahh the irony</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews on this hair dryer everywhere I decided to buy it &amp; I love it! This hair dryer really is SUPER QUIET! This dryer runs so quiet you won&#x27;t believe it, seriously!  If your like me &amp; can&#x27;t stand the dryers that have that high pitched loud noise then this is the dryer for you. I also needed a dryer with a long cord, the 9ft cord on this one is perfect. I have long thick hair &amp; this dries my hair pretty fast &amp; gets nice &amp; hot on the highest heat setting. It is also a little lighter than my old hair dryer which is nice. I love this hair dryer so much that I&#x27;m buying a second one for my Mom.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this last September and it just broke. Did not last even a year! And I only truly use it to blow dry my hair straight once a week. It started with me having to wait about 30 seconds between turning it off and back on, and then in the middle of my blow dry, it wouldnt come back on. I tried different outlets, waiting longer, but nothing. Its dead! I am truly disappointed because the same exact thing happened with the one this was replacing (the white model). I gave it 2 stars only because it did a great job when it was working. I am now going to bite the bullet and spend more on a Rusk to see if it will at least last a little longer! *sadface*</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. It works great and it is quiet</li>
    <li> Product is just as described. Super fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about six months ago and it already is faulty.  It does not blow hot air anymore.  I&#x27;m going to buy a different brand to replace this one.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations - returning for refund.  The motor is quiet but it takes a longer time to dry hair and then the hair is fly away  - not what I wanted at all.</li>
    <li> Dryer is Great for the money, It is quiet gets hot and seems to compare to the Chi dryer we also have in the salon. Thank you so much. the final test will be life span.</li>
    <li> It is not light weight, and does not blow dry hair fast. The only thing it has going for it is it&#x27;s quieter than the one I have.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good lightweight blow dryer. It does not compare to the T3</li>
    <li> Great! Quiet! Love it! Bought 2 immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly in San Antonio, TX</li>
    <li> BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &amp;#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&amp;#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn&#x27;t seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn&#x27;t work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a &#x27;Pro Beauty Tools&#x27; item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn&#x27;t even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I&#x27;ve never seen before with a blow-dryer before.</li>
    <li> Its quiet and it dries my hair pretty fast (no faster than my old cheap conair one) but this thing is SO HEAVY. There is no way it weighs 1 pound like this listing says. It&#x27;s so heavy that the nail I hung it on that my old hair dryer had hung from for some five years BENT and got pulled out by the dryer. So now it lays on the floor until I can find a new one to replace it. That and the arm cramps I get blow drying my thick hair (takes a good ten minutes) is not worth it, even for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased elsewhere for $10 more! Returned that one and got it here cheaper! Been using for a few weeks and loving it. Definitely needed an upgrade and this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This does not have the power I thought it would have.  Its ok though.</li>
    <li> Love this blowdryer, had it several months so far, it&#x27;s very quiet and the diffuser is fantastic!  Doesn&#x27;t get too hot but still drys my hair quickly, this is nice because I have super thick hair and it usually takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. My friend had it and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself. It comes with the two attachments and the different heat settings are great if you need to dry your hair quickly or if you are taking your time to style.</li>
    <li> Great Seller!  Shipped as Promised!  Would definitely Recommend!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I have ever used .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer since mid January and have already had to replace it. The drying time wad taking forever!  Not worth the buy</li>
    <li> hair dryer is too noisy and clumsy&lt;br /&gt;does not have enough power to dry thick hair in a short amount of time</li>
    <li> The dryer as advertised on this picture is the one I have. The wats is 1300 which not 1875 like other dryers. It&#x27;s better for ur electric bill. It&#x27;s veryyyyy hot on the hot setting. So I think medium setting is best where it&#x27;s still hot but bearable. The cool setting feels mediocre cool. And the burst is actually cold. Let me tell u. Ive had this dryer at least 2 yrs. I used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room. It ran 6 hrs straight every day. N the motor died at the end of the season. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this b done. It&#x27;s was just my experience with this dryer. Just letting u know its a strong dryer long lasting if used the correct way. It&#x27;s not light weight. But very well built. It&#x27;s had many hard falls to the floor over the yrs. Also it has a safety feature on the plug housing to not turn on if theres an electrical feed interference in a socket. To reset it just press the bottom on the plug.  Im shopping for the same one.</li>
    <li> perfect for curly hair.  High-ish heat and the high speed is more like a medium speed.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer for my daughter. Funny enough, the only thing I can comment on is because I&#x27;ve only seen her use it to dry off her cat when she gave it a bath. I&#x27;m not saying  she hasn&#x27;t used it herself. I just haven&#x27;t heard anything from her about it?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, has a quiet motor, a long cord, and dries great.  We love the 3 temperature settings and the diffuser.</li>
    <li> My CHI hair dryer had just broken after having it for less than a year and I went to buy a new one at walmart. This one claims to work as well as CHI but it works better. Im obessed with it, it drys my hair faster and makes it so much smoother. It makes my hair shinier and looks smooth even after I straighten it. I highly reccomend buying it.</li>
    <li> Great Value and the best diffuser!</li>
    <li> The dryer was, dare I say it, GREASY. I thought as long as it works, fine. Nope, does not work. The seller, hottest deals, should be ashamed of what they sent for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer a year ago for under $40 hoping it would be better than most regular $20 ones. It didn&#x27;t disappoint, I actually loved it. I also thought it was very quite even on the highest speed. The heat is so hot it dried FAST!! It&#x27;s not light weight but since it dries my really thick hair quickly that was not a problem. Everything was going great till my mom and cousin used it one day and suddenly when I turned it on it went out!!!! Everything worked fine BUT the high energy speed!  It stayed on medium despite pressing the button to switch it. I was really dispointed!  With my thick hair and a baby on the way, I was not going to keep using it on medium speed, it would take me double the time to dry my hair!!! So I returned the damaged one and replaced it with a brand new one. That was my only option with my local store. This new one better last more than a year!</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have ever owned.  It&#x27;s quiet and very efficient.  I like the long cord, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter when her old drugstore hair dryer expired. She likes it pretty well and said it dries her very long/thick hair pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would pay this much for a hairdryer but I was tired of the cheap ones going out so quickly. I love how quietly this runs and it really does dry my thick hair faster without just blasting out hot air.  Definitely recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> This dryer is nice and quiet and is very similar to my old Vidal Sasson Quiet Style VS750 dryer.  I like the controls as they are easer to use with the push style versus the slide style of button.  Very happy to have this after trying two other dryers.  The other two were either too loud or to strong.  I have very fine hair and I don&#x27;t need a hair dryer that can basically blow my head off of my shoulders.  I don&#x27;t see anywhere on the box that it is by VS but if it is, I am very glad as I had the VS750 for 14 years and hope I have this one for a long time.</li>
    <li> Not as light weight as I had hoped</li>
    <li> After returning to Amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not, this one delivered on its promise.  Also, the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don&#x27;t have to line up anything to put it on or remove it--it&#x27;s a simple push on and pull off.  Have just started using this, so can&#x27;t speak to its durability.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while back and still works great. I definitely would recommend to buy this product, worth the money and the item shipped fast! :)</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight and performs well.  I received it quickly and it was very reasonable.  I like the added concentrator nozzle.</li>
    <li> I love it! I am a hair stylist and I was looking for a decent one just for myself at home, and boy were my standards exceeded! Its very powerful for its size and I love the attachments that cone with it. Great price for a great blow dryer! Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after about 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> This was not the hair dryer that I expected to receive, and perhaps I ordered the wrong one. This one is silver, heavy, has only two drying speeds, and does not have enough power to dry my long, thick hair in a minimal amount of time. I thought I was ordering the white one, which I was trying to replace...it is a lighter weight, and has more power. I could only recommend this to someone with very short hair.</li>
    <li> 6 months later and the motor is lagging. i keep the vent cleaned to no avail. It&#x27;s also not that quiet. Revlon makes a much quieter one. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> After a dizzying hour looking at hairdryers in the store aisle I finally bought this in favour of many higher priced models.  Why? It was the ONLY one that had ALL of the features I wanted.  I wanted CERAMIC/IONIC and LIGHTWEIGHT and QUIET.  It is much lighter than all but one I picked up (a turquoise coloured model that looked too cheap despite the high price tag).  I used it for the first time tonight...it is MUCH quieter, and to all the reviewers who were confused about the reason for the lower decibels...its to protect the hearing of the USER. (not the family of--sorry).  At first I thought the dryer was not strong enough but it is missing that crazy blast of undirected air that just throws your hair every which way but it is definitely a strong current and very hot (variable temp) I used it on medium which was plenty hot.  I believe it is PRO (can get hotter than my last model).  Also the COOL SHOT is actually cool, most models give you slightly cooler...this one is definitely the &amp;#34;coolest&amp;#34;.  So far...Im happy and was prepared to spend upwards of $100.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! Does exactly what it says...dries fast with less frizz! Lighter weight and quiet motor, too. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace the one that got stomped (by accident). It is of a very professional quality, without the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser and unusual buy chi  which are 3 times the cost of this at first I bought 1 to see how I liked it. .I LOVED THIS DRYER needless to say I bought another. been extremely  happy with it..</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  I have curly hair and have found that the diffuser that comes with it is the best for making my hair have the best curls.  I had actually purchased two other hair dryers (one specifically for curly hair) and they didn&#x27;t work at all!  The diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair.  Not only that, the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls.  I also love the cool setting feature on the dryer.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Used this and seems to do fine. I only wish it had a little more of a powerful blow. May order one for my daughter. Great price and quality.</li>
    <li> Has no power.  Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a horrible whine sound when I use it and takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer but kinda heavy</li>
    <li> She bought a second one so she have one at home and one at our vacation house.  This is the first hair dryer she thinks actually works well.</li>
    <li> Only last for one year.</li>
