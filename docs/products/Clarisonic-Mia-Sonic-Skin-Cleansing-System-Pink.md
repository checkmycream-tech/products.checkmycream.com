<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> can&#x27;t really live without it now bc you skin gets used to the deep exfoliation.if you stop using you will notice it right away. I think my skin def is better more buffed looking . It&#x27;s pricey but now they make knock off heads for cheap so it don&#x27;t end up costing as much. i have the 2 now and gave this to my sis. I only use once a day but it&#x27;s def a staple in my skin care and I&#x27;m glad and spent the money.</li>
    <li> i have a pore problem. it does not really help to minimize my pores, but i do feel very clean after i apply this brush every night.&lt;br /&gt;once a day is good. my face gets very dry after words. the attached cleansing gel was not useful.</li>
    <li> it is better than I expected . Going to get one for my daughter !!  it is easy to use and the charger works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My friend recommended I get one. After reading the reviews, I did. It&#x27;s just too harsh for my skin. I can&#x27;t even use it once a week. The only exfoliate that works on my face is Mary Kay Microdermabrasion. I use that once a week.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Mia directly from THIS page, May 2013.  After a few uses, it stopped working. I charged, recharged, but it finally died.  I called Clarisonic and the instant I read the serial number,  the customer representative informed me that my unit was counterfeit and essentially, Sorry Charlie. The rep also said she gets a couple of calls each day from Amazon customers who also got stiffed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with Amazon, either. I got  pick-pocketed here. Doesn&#x27;t Amazon police this stuff? I could understand getting shafted had I bought a used product. But I purchased the Mia \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; and \\&quot;by Clarisonic\\&quot; just as it says here on this page!  Makes me question the authenticity of the products here sold with the Mia, namely the cleansers and toners. Could be dollar store dish soap for all we know, right?! And the brushes -- I don&#x27;t even want to think...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still believe the Mia and all her variations are good products but will have to hit a retail store for the real deal, a place where I&#x27;m backed by a return/exchange/warranty policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rave reviews on this site, they have to be bogus, too.  If you can make a fake, can&#x27;t be hard to drum up a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it. It it high quality, not a cheap knock off.  Give a 4 because it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, it is perfect and I love the way my face feels now.</li>
    <li> Love love love still using it after 5 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these for my daughters at Christmas time. They were thrilled as it was an item they would not typically purchase for themselves. Price was great &amp; received it in record time.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. She really likes it. She says it exfoliates and cleans her skin, and makeup is easier to apply after using the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> This product worked fine for about 2 weeks. When we had an issue we simply called the manufacturer (under warranty) only to find this company was not an authorized dealer and the serial number on the product was not legit. Clarisonic to be fair was very understanding ,reasonable, and simply explained this has happened in the past matter of factly.&lt;br /&gt;We were given a hard fought refund (and ate the shipping) through Amazon, and then proceeded to purchase directly from Claisonic for the true product. I highly recommend going directly through Clarisonic to avoid my headaches.....it is a great product when forgeries are not invloved.</li>
    <li> I got my Clarisonic March 15th, and I love it unfortunately it quit working today June 24th. Three months seems a little crazy for a device to break; at least it&#x27;s suppose to have a year warranty! I am not sure I&#x27;m very happy since I just found out this unit I purchased from Amazon was not manufactored by Clarisonic; so I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to have a hard time getting a new one!!</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers have pointed out, this item is not from Clarisonic and stops working after a few months and rusts underneath the brush. I was happy when Amazon allowed me a refund past the regular return window but they charged a $21.20 restocking fee even though it should be their error that they were stocking fake items from other sellers under the guise of authenticity!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia skin cleaning system is a great product, but PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT OFF OF AMAZON! only because there is the potential possibility that this item is a very well made FAKE clarisonic (which will break on you in 6 months) I purchase mine from the seller RobRobie Robin 6 months ago and the cleaning system started to break down on me and eventually stopped working completely. This should not happen to a REAL clarisonic Mia. I was informed that the one I had was fake when I tried to contact Clarisonic themselves to see if they will replace it since there is 1 year warranty, I was then told that mine was fake and that amazon is not an authorized dealer which means there is absolutely no warranty on it at all. So please if you are considering buying a Clarisonic, I do highly recommend you purchasing it at either Nordstrom or Sephora (it only costs $20 dollars more-- retail price $119-- and comes with a 1 year warranty and won&#x27;t break on you in 6 months) Don&#x27;t waste your money buying a fake Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are feeling a bit risky and want to purchase it off of amazon, I also highly recommend you registering it ASAP to find out if your Clarisonic is fake or not. That way you can contact amazon to get a refund.</li>
    <li> My friends had told me how great this worked for cleaning and making your skin glow. I totally agree.I would have liked a stand to keep it on.</li>
    <li> I totally love my Mia and wish I would have purchased it sooner. Instead I purchased the Olay version and there is no comparison. It does bring up a bunch of yuck you didn&#x27;t realize was there. But it&#x27;s worth it. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. People say I look younger and well rested.</li>
    <li> After spending an hour on the phone with the actual Clarisonic company because the one we bought stopped working after 2 months, they informed me these were not under warranty because they are not made by their company.  By only from authorized dealers!  $100 for 2 months of working and Amazon nor company will stand behind them!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I feel like it really cleans &amp; polishes my skin.</li>
    <li> Every woman should own one of these. My skin has improved dramatically and will hopefully stay looking younger longer.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;m a African american woman,in my late30s. Who has suffered with acne all my life. But the Mia is truly wonderful. My skin is clear, glowing and baby soft. My acne has cleared up, and it&#x27;s only been 4 weeks. I love it! If your thinking about buying it? You won&#x27;t be sorry. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it gets your makeup off. But so would a wash cloth. The brush head is not really exfoliating, and if you have dry skin that peels or flakes off, this won&#x27;t do anything to help that. It does lather up your normal face wash, and I guess it is a hands-free way to wash your face, but other than that I don&#x27;t really see anything special. The dry spots on my face still get little peelies, my pores at the same, my skin looks the same, everything is the same except I paid a ton more money for this little device. The charge on it is also really minimal, no way you can use it more than twice without having to recharge the batteries. The charging also takes forever, you can&#x27;t plug it in an hour before you want to use it and expect it to turn on and work for you. You also can&#x27;t use it while it is connected to the charged, so you are just SOL.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia for almost one month now - every day for one minute. Never has my skin looked so luminous and felt so soft! The difference in my skin is really amazing. It is true that moisturizers and serums work better after using the Clarisonic. I have been troubled with milia pretty much my entire adult life, and they have definately been reduced. I purchased the delicate brushes; I have not used the sensitive brush that came with the Mia, but I may try the sensitive brush when it&#x27;s time to change the brush head (probably in about another 2 months). Once a day is enough for me. I don&#x27;t want to over exfoliate my sensitive skin. It removes make-up thoroughly. Every second day I wash the brush head with anti-bacterial soap. All in all - a fantastic product. I only wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> Am so happy I bought this - my aging and acne-prone skin has never looked better.  Have a Clarisonic Plus - I keep the MIA at my fiance&#x27;s - works quite well.</li>
    <li> Cleans very well, but it&#x27;s more difficult to make sure it dries completely.  Have to take the brush head off... Not a huge deal, but a very minor inconvenience</li>
    <li> This product is great. Made my skin very smmoth-I use it twice a day. Bought one for my daugter which has cleared up her acne. I would highly recommend it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have had acne prone skin since i started college 4 years ago. I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything (Proactiv, Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Biore, etc.)...most products work for a while and then I&#x27;m back at square one. I take hair, skin, and nail vitamins, drink lots of water, and drink lots of water, but I still had oily breakouts/blackheads --especially around that time of the month. I&#x27;d call it moderate acne, not severe. From popping pimples (I know, I know lol) I also had quite a few dark spots.   I had been eyeing a Clairsonic for a few years and finally justified the $100 purchase. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day (morning and night) with a Clinique cleanser for the past 3-4 weeks and my skin is in the best condition it has been in a LONG TIME. I had gotten used to having at least 3-5 pimples on my face at all times, and most days, there are wayyy more than that. I washed my face this morning and realized that I didn&#x27;t have one single pimple. My pores are MUCH smaller, my skin is far less oily, and blackheads are almost completely gone. Dark spots are fading too! My skin is not over dried or anything like that, but I do use a nice moisturizer after each use.  I read comments about a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; process, which I did not have. I usually remove my makeup before using the Clairsonic, but there&#x27;s always residual make up on the brush when I&#x27;m done. I guess that goes to show how well we THINK we&#x27;re cleaning our skin lol.  I will say that I rinse the brush with alcohol every other day to avoid spreading bacteria.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and always interested in new products for skin care.  I have had the Mia for about a month and a half and notice a vast improvement in my skin. I have sensitive skin but have some comedones (blackheads) on my nose that have been there my whole life. Two years ago I had a laser peel which took care of the blackhead problem for about 6 months, but then they returned.  The Mia is slowly dissolving them to the point where they are not nearly as noticeable. I believe with continued use of the Mia they will completely disappear.  Extremely pleased with this product. Just make sure to keep your brush sterilized or you will defeat the purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Mia for over a year now without any problems. I use it a couple days a week to give my face a good exfoliation. In the past year, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed the change in my skin. Before my face was red, dry and just plain unattractive. Within a month I started noticed how much better my skin looked with regular use of my Clarisonic. I can&#x27;t live without this now. I use my own face wash and haven&#x27;t tried the one that came with the package yet. If you have issues with redness or dryness, give the Clarisonic a try!</li>
    <li> Acne sufferers don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re searching for a miracle because you will be disappointed. I have been suffering from acne for a few years now and have tried so many different products Murad, Pro-activ, Neutrogena, peels and facials. The Mia is not what I hoped it would be. It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne or fade my scars. All my skin&#x27;s imperfections still exist. I think it&#x27;s great if you wear foundation/make-up regularly because it really does cleanse thoroughly. But, ultimately this is just a brush that vibrates.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great and I would recommend it to anyone, especially for those with oily skin like myself.  I never liked all the chemicals companies put in cleansers and other products for oily skin- they always dried me out too much so i was either too oily or too dry. I use this with Dermalogica&#x27;s Special Cleansing Gel and it is the perfect amount of exfoliation and just plain aaamazing!! My face feels so clean and fresh after each use, I can&#x27;t go overnight anywhere without it! I would like to add though that if that you have stubborn acne, this may take some time (about 5 months in my case) to really clear up those stubborn areas. BUT on the other hand you will have improved texture and softness after the first few cleanings. I still give it a 5 because nothing else has given me such improved results (and improved confidence!), so for me it was absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> i love this item and glad i didn&#x27;t wait to order it.  i have had problems with the skin on my face since adolescence and using this product has really helped clear it up, in only a few days!  the brush is super soft and in combination with the vibration, it feels great on the skin.  it&#x27;s almost like getting a facial every time you use it.  how did we go so long without this product???  simply a MUST HAVE!!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have fought with sporadic acne (just on my chin) for the past 10 years. I get facials - it gets worse. My skin is dry, so all the \\&quot;acne\\&quot; medicated soaps make things awful. I purchased the Clarisonic Mia and have used it every day for about two months - guess what? Totally clear skin. I haven&#x27;t changed face wash, lotion - nothing else in my usual routine has changed, I just started using the Mia. I went to the Clinique counter this weekend and the saleswoman remarked at how clear and smooth my skin was. It is for faces what Sonicare is to teeth! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this I use it everyday. I use it in the shower. You do not have to use their cleansing product I use my own product with it saves money. I have used Dove soap for 30 years and use this with this product. This is my second one and I bought the travel one. I am also buying one for my mom for the holidays. A+</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have this 20 years sooner. I&#x27;ll never be without it. It&#x27;s an easy and efficient way to deep clean my face. It saves me money on pricy cleaning lotions, since it works fine with just normal grocery store products. And it makes my pores nearly invisible. It even reduced the size of a couple of little bumps I&#x27;ve had under my eye for ages. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing ALOT and I ordered it on a Friday afternoon and no kidding it was here on Monday!! Unbelievable, great distributor! I use it with Purity by Philosophy and love it for my combination, acne prone, 26 year old skin!</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia after reading all of the great reviews, and I was not disappointed. It&#x27;s like having a facial every day, since it leaves my face so clean and smooth. I live in a hot, humid country and have had a lot of issues with my face feeling very dirty and grimy -- but now that I use the Clarisonic, those issues have gone away. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! This product has done wonders for my skin. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> My brother got me my Clarisonic Mia for my birthday and it&#x27;s the best gift I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It has completed changed my oily, acne prone skin. It&#x27;s so much clearer and smoother. I still have the occasional breakout but my skin is tremendously improved. I&#x27;ve even gotten complements on my skin which has never happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the results you can see, my skin feels so smooth, soft and clean after using the brush. The magnetic charging system is ingenious! Plus the timer allows you to know exactly how long you should be washing your face. It&#x27;s practically fool-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might seem a bit pricey but the Clarisonic Mia really is an investment in your skin and I feel that it more than pays you back with results.</li>
    <li> Was not authentic! So when it quit working, Clairsonic could do nothing for me. Had to repurchase another!!</li>
    <li> Like other people said have already said, I purchased this item in February. In July it stopped working, and I discovered that it is NOT A REAL CLARISONIC PRODUCT. Don&#x27;t buy this and waste your money!!</li>
    <li> When i first got the Clarisonic Mia (CM), I had mild-to-medium acne problem so I waited for my skin to clear up a little bit before I started using it because I was worried that the brush might carry the bacteria from the affected area to the unaffected area.  I don&#x27;t know this for fact but thought I&#x27;d stay on the safe side and waited.  Good thing my skin got a little bit better (thanks to AZTEC SECRETS Indian Healing Clay from Amazon) then I started using CM for twice a week.  The experience has been positive and quite pleasant I have to say.  I haven&#x27;t had as much break-outs and even if there are a few bumps here and there, they go away pretty quickly.  My skin feels cleaner, softer and smoother.  It&#x27;s easier to apply makeup on now than before and the result is great, i don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup but my skin still looks healthier and natural.      The improvement on my face is definitely visible. Although I think it might be the result of using both the CM and the mask twice a week (not the same day). I&#x27;d definitely recommend these two products to people who suffer from acne.  One other thing about this device is that it does not need to be charged constantly.  I charge mine around once every two - three weeks. Although I guess it depends on how often you use it.   Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using clarisonic on and off since january without probs then yesterday after leaving it charging for a whole day it wouldnt turn on. I was at first puzzled but now i come to see that other people have experienced same problem. I buy a lot from amazon and rarely leave comments unless its something thats worth mentioning but this made me so mad i had to write something. What a waste of money. Dont buy it from here!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I have sensitive skin and was a bit concerned about irritating it with daily use.  I only use the Mia once a day (as opposed to the recommended twice).  My skin was fine to start with, but there were a few clogged pores here and there etc.  Since I&#x27;ve started using the Mia, everything has gradually improved without irritation.  Now my skin can really glow.  Love it!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  This little cleansing system has made my skin  so soft and glowing in just a little over two weeks.  This system is like giving your face  a massage without using your fingers.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular washcloth   and hand method of washing my face.  Thanks Clarisonic for making such a wonderful  product.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic Mia does exactly as it promises. My skin feels softer and looks smoother. I definitely see an improvement by using the mia instead of a washcloth for exfoliation. Even with acne the mia doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or add to the breakouts. Actually, my products work better and my breakouts have diminished significantly. I&#x27;m thankful for the price as well. Originally I bought it from Sephora for 164.00 after taxes (NYC) and it did not sit well with me. I returned it literally within a few hours. When I found Dermstore I jumped on the product and felt so much ease with my decision. Imagine, 40.00 more to buy it from Sephora. You know I took myself out an enjoyed a great meal with that difference and had money left over to save. - Also Dermstore is a pleasure to work with. I received it in a just three short days.</li>
    <li> If you want the cleanest face you will have, besides paying for a facial, buy this product.  It is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> Where has this thing been all my life?    I can&#x27;t imagine being without it now  that I have it.  My skin could not be  cleaner, I love the Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. It&#x27;s not because of the product itself, which has done wonders for two of my friends, but unfortunately, it had the complete opposite effect on me. I have combination skin prone to the occasional hormonal breakout, nothing too scary - using the skinbrush for 5 weeks made my skin break out in a way it NEVER had, and two weeks later, I&#x27;m still nurturing it back to its normal state. I got weird bumps on my forehead I&#x27;d never had before (usually my forehead breakouts are minimal to none, and the pimples look different than they did here), and I got breakouts on my cheeks and chin (basically everywhere I used the skinbrush).   Adding to that, when I woke up every morning, my skin would be slick with oil, and I&#x27;d never had oily skin in the past. A facial therapist I saw had a theory that the skinbrush was drying my skin out so much my sebaceous glands were oversecreting oil to make up for the dryness. Not sure if this is true, but as soon as I stopped using it, my skin slowly started to get better (and it certainly didn&#x27;t get worse).    Seriously, I&#x27;m very disappointed, because pretty much 9 out of 10 reviews are glowing. I&#x27;d warn anyone with very sensitive skin to avoid this product, but of course, everyone is different. If you notice breakouts within a week or two of using it, I&#x27;d suggest not waiting it out like I did - just stop using it.</li>
    <li> This is not as miraculous as most ppl describe it but is highly practical. I bought so many beauty products over the years that I havent used. This one is unlike them all. I use this in place of my old way of face washing and it does its thing. My face is smooth all the time and that is priceless.   I must say though I&#x27;ve used other microderm abrasion kits that&#x27;ve smoothed my skin better. But the clarisonic brush beats it because of its usability.  The best thing about it is you can use it with whichever cleanser. I&#x27;ve used mine with cetaphil cleanser.</li>
    <li> As the years pass by so they are etched on our faces.  Being a believer in exfoliating and cleansing I&#x27;ve tried many products and services.  On reliable advice I purchased a Mia.  No facial product compares.  The circulatory stimulation together with increase efficiency of products used is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical at first, but after reading so many rave reviews, I decided to give the Mia a try.  And I am very impressed!  The Mia is very gentle but so efficient - this little baby cleans off makeup and grime like a champ, and exfoliates at the same time.  I am amazed at how soft and fresh it leaves my skin in just 1 minute.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product - I use it every day.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Use this product at least 2x or 3x per week and you&#x27;ll notice clearer, smoother skin!  The key is to be consistent.  The size is great and very effective.</li>
    <li> I first heard of Clarisonic back in 2007 while working at a major dept store at the Estee Lauder counter.  During Christmas, as soon as we would stock the counters w/Clarisonic, they were flying out the door at $300 a pop.  Recently, it came to my attention of the smaller version (Mia) and felt I would give it a try.  Clarisonic really holds up to their claims.  I&#x27;ve always been a believer in exfoliating the skin at least 3 times a wk.  I use Mia daily w/my Lauder cleanser and I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
    <li> Yep, this is expensive. But if you are sick of suffering skin problems like I was, get over it and just buy it. When I first heard about the Clarisonic, I thought it was just some fancy pamper tool for women who were wealthy and stupid and didn&#x27;t know any better. I&#x27;ve always had \\&quot;fairly good skin\\&quot; but in recent years it has gone haywire. The last several years I&#x27;ve suffered acne but managed it with products like Proactiv. As I headed into my 30&#x27;s the acne became much worse and responded to nothing except prescription products (oral antibacterial meds, birth control, and retin A). Skin was clear for about a year, then acne came back with a vengeance except this time it brought a couple of ugly, unwanted friends too: flaking, dry yet oily, dull, and clogged pores. My face was a mess.   This was a week ago.   In complete desperation and lack of faith in topical facewashes and other products (the retin A cream makes my skin sensitive, so everything harder that CeraVe made things worse), I ran out and bought the Clarisonic to fix my skin issues.   My skin peeled after the first two times I used it. It peeled off in big flakes, felt dry, and burned a little. This was annoying, but i realize now the Mia was doing what it does best- powering through all the gunk that keeps you from having good skin. Over the next few days I began to notice that my skin looked brighter, felt softer, pores were smaller, and acne was improved. I think my acne scars are fading as well. My skin seems much more balanced and my makeup looks fresher. This is all after one week, using Mia 2x per day.</li>
    <li> After reading about the clarisonic mia and the rave reviews, I had to try it myself. I love it. My skin is nice and smooth and feels so clean after using it. it is now a regular part of my skin cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> I bought this skin care system for my girlfriend last Christmas and she loves that&#x27;s its waterproof and can use it in the shower and being rechargeable instead of batteries is very convenient and saves money she said she notices a difference in her skin since she has been using it and she likes the way her skin feels after using it. I do have to say I wish I bought the plus model with the extra speeds also the plus has separate buttons to control speeds.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and struggle to find skin care I can live with. I use this with my Proactive and it makes my skin look and feel amazing. Plus, while using it, it is is relaxing. It feels great. It is expensive, but so are night creams and serums. It is made very well.</li>
    <li> This product is all I had hoped it would be. Do I look 20 years younger? No, but I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and my skin is smoother/softer. I can live with that. I appreciate the vendor - nice price and no problem with the shipping and condition of the product.</li>
    <li> after reading all the glowing reviews of this product I was more than willing to pay so much $$ for it...however I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now and notice no difference in my skin. I&#x27;m disapointed.</li>
    <li> After hearing about the Mia from a friend who said that her skin feels amazing since using it, I thought I&#x27;d check into it.  I read several reviews, including a few negative ones, and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I noticed a difference after the first time I used it, and after the second time, my skin felt and looked amazing!  It&#x27;s been two months now that I&#x27;ve been using it and my skin has never felt so smooth, and it looks smoother as well. I never realized before just how rough it was!  I also have fewer pimples than I do now.  It&#x27;s really remarkable.  This is kind of gross...but after the first few times I used it, I noticed that the pimples I had were brought to the surface more, so that they were easier to, ah, purge from my face! lol  And strangely, after I popped them, they didn&#x27;t leave a red mark like they always had done before.  My boyfriend even uses my Mia and loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the Clarisonic cleanser that you can buy for the Mia.  Really, it seems like any cleanser should work so long as it&#x27;s not paste-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use it for X many seconds on your forehead, X many seconds on your nose, etc.  I just do it all over my face for two minutes (it automatically shuts off after a minute, so I just run it twice).  Seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to the Mia is that every three months you have replace the brush heads, which aren&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s still worth it.  I suppose I should replace them even more often since my boyfriend uses it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the regular brush head that comes with the Mia, but as I have large pores, I recently ordered the deep pore cleansing brush head, so we&#x27;ll see how that works.  I absolutely love my Mia.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am sooo happy that I purchased the Mia.  I researched before buying it and have a few friends who were sold on it.  I can&#x27;t wait to purchase another for my daughter for her bday.  It cleans very well, makes skin very soft and pores do seem smaller.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to order this for her. She has been through many products over the years and this is a revolutionary one! She is extremely happy with the results this cleansing system produces. It&#x27;s a ticket to great skin. Nothing has ever come close to it and if the technology improves then I am sure she will be incredibly amazed as she already is. The Clarisonic has already been recommended to friends by my wife and no doubt they will see incredible results. Do yourself a favour and buy one!</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves the Mia.  I do not have to nag her to wash her face.  She loves the way it cleans and feels.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic Mia....I think I agree with the other reviewers about this skin care brush. Its nothing more than a fancy rip off. I bought it as a Christmas gift to myself because I love buying beauty products! I&#x27;m 27, have normal skin with small pores and very minor acne. I use Benzamycin( benzoyl peroxide and erithromycin) at night for any blemishes. I wanted pimples underneath skin gone (on forehead and some on cheeks) and for blackheads because those are my favorite to pick. I don&#x27;t take the time to exfoliate so I thought the Mia would be perfect for that purpose. I made a visit to Clarisonic&#x27;s site a few times before ordering. Originally, I was planning on getting the Clarisonic Classic b/c it has a charging cradle but I ended up going with the Mia. Not to mention I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $195 on one product. Upon arrival, I followed the directions to a T. I wet my face to begin, then applied cleanser ( I use Mary Kay). Afterwards, I usually wipe my face down with a warm washcloth to make sure all residue is gone. Bottom line: Not impressed, skin has stayed the same. Knock on wood, I haven&#x27;t seen any out of this world breakouts so that&#x27;s a plus or I would absolutely be returning it. The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; part is such b.s. Its just a gimmick to make you think your skin is getting cleaner. All it does is vibrate and make noise. After first use, I looked at the brush head and its stained from removing my foundation. It makes it look dirty. I wish Clarisonic could have made a stain resistant brush head. :( I&#x27;ll admit is nice to have and it looks pretty but not really worth the money. (Also I did not get mine from Amazon).</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying that the only time in my adult life that I had what most people would call \\&quot;beautiful skin\\&quot; was during my pregnancy. I&#x27;m in my 30s, and believe me, I have tried just about everything out there from prescriptions to over the counter acne products attempting to have nice skin. I have very oily skin and suffer from those \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; breakouts - nothing really bad, but I&#x27;d get 4-5 pimples in the T-zone, and around my mouth. Plus, I always seem to have the tiny bumps along my jaw and some blackheads along my hairline. Some products would work short-term, but nothing ever gave me the clean, clear, glowing skin that everyone wishes they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the Clarisonic skin brushes a couple of years ago in department stores and magazines, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending the $200+ for what I thought would be yet another gimmick that promised better looking skin. Then they came out with the Mia and I started considering the $120 price tag. I scoured the internet and read so many reviews about this product. I spent 3+ hours just looking at Amazon&#x27;s reviews alone. I figured after spending that much time researching, and considering the probably thousands of dollars in products I&#x27;ve bought over the years, well the $119 price tag was worth a shot. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Mia for one month and not only have I seen a difference in my skin, other people have noticed too. Now, I am not saying that all my skin troubles have gone away. I did get the \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; breakout of a few pimples, however, they were very small and easy to hide with makeup. They also disappeared in a few days! This was NEVER the case in the past. I have noticed my skin is softer and smoother.  The dull, dry skin that always sat on top of the oily areas of my face is gone. The blackheads and tiny bumps that I&#x27;d get along my jawbone and hairline are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have not used the cleanser that came with the Mia. I have verysensitive skin and find new things tend to make me break out even more. I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions products with my Mia. Anyone who has suffered with problem skin and has pored over reviews questioning whether or not to spend the $$$ - just do it. Clarisonic has a 90 day 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product, so what do you have to lose? The only regret I have now is I didn&#x27;t buy my Mia sooner.</li>
    <li> I love it, my skin feels so smooth. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks. The lines from my mouth to my chin are least noticeable because my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> This product is a vibrating brush. Not a spinning brush, not anything more than a VIBRATING BRUSH. There is no secret to this. Ever hear of the Neutrogena Wave? It&#x27;s 12 dollars and I promise you it does the same thing. I had this for over a year and I ended up selling it because I feel like it was way overpriced for a.... yeah, vibrating brush!  I&#x27;m sure this review will get overshadowed by all the wonderful \\&quot;my skin has never been so amazing\\&quot; reviews but if you want the truth, it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using for over a year and the results are evident.  I tell eveyone I know to try it.  It is pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE!!! The pins on the inside rust and it does not work well with the official clarisonic brush heads! DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin silky smooth!  I have definitely noticed a reduction in pore size using the Deep Pore Cleanser and brush, maybe 25-50%. I only use it in the evening to take off my make-up on the advice of a make-up artist, but am really loving how it makes my make-up apply smoother and helps my skin absorb moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but: What a bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Clarisonic Mia in hopes that it would help keep my adult acne under control. My skin isn&#x27;t terrible, but I break out fairly regularly, and a friend of mine (who does not have acne) recommended this product to me. After two weeks of use, I am finally ready to admit that this brush is making my face much, much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has broken out in places that it has never before broken out. Like, for instance, the side of my nose.  I have several large, cyst-like pimples under the skin on my cheeks (I vaguely remember these from when I was a teenager). I think it&#x27;s going to take at least a month to clear up the horrible, painful mess that my face has become. If you&#x27;re reading this and you have acne or sensitive skin, I strongly urge you to place your hopes in another product. I had a bad feeling about this product because it didn&#x27;t make any claims about its ability to clear up acne, but I was too hopeful to heed them. If you&#x27;re in the same boat, at least go read the other reviews on acne.org before making a decision.</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic!  It makes my skin so clean and glowing!  Service was great, I received it very quickly.  Totally happy!</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re a kid with acne it might be too much for a 30-something&#x27;s acne free face. I like it fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Mia about 4 months ago, and I love it. I originally bought the Olay system, but that seemed to be too harsh on my skin. I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money, but I did. My mature skin was starting to look so tired and droopy. For me, it actually seemed to tighten the skin up a bit. I think it does that because of the vibrating head. I think you really need to change the heads more frequently if you use it daily. They aren&#x27;t cheap either. It is so easy to use. Just charge it up and go. The charging cord does not always stay in if you bump it.  Not a big deal for me. The one thing it did  not do for me is diminish a few of my brown spots. It did seem to shrink my pores a little. Over all I really am enjoying it, and I can see a difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> This review is not on the effectiveness of the product, but rather a warning against purchasing any Clarisonic on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me start by saying that I LOVE Amazon.  Anytime I am in need of anything, Amazon is the first place I search.  So when my husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday I told him to get me a Clarisonic Mia.  I had done some research and found that Amazon was by far the cheapest at $105 (now I know why).  I can&#x27;t recall who the seller was, so this review is not made against this retailer (I know it was not directly sold by Amazon, but by a third party).  In general I wanted to make sure that customers were aware of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not an authorized retailer of Clarisonic.  That means that Clarisonic will not offer any warranty service for a Clarisonic you purchase through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month after receiving the Clarisonic Mia, I started noticing that the prongs holding the brush were starting to rust.  Considering the manual says you can take the unit in the shower, it seemed odd that the prongs would be rusting.  I contacted Clarisonic to see if they had other complaints.  They asked me for an ID number located on the bottom of the handle, which my unit had.  She told me that that ID was not valid and asked where I purchased it.  That&#x27;s when I found out that they would not honor any warranties against units purchased on Amazon and that likely what I received was a counterfeit unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then contacted Amazon and although it was past the standard 30 day return time frame, they offered to take back the unit and credit my husband&#x27;s credit card.  They did charge me a restocking fee, which is odd, because I really hope they did not restock that counterfeit unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still LOVE Amazon and have purchased many things since this incident about 6 months ago.  Their customer service was prompt and nice when I made the return, and although I did not receive 100% of the refund, the 80% I did receive was better than nothing.  Just be forewarned that if you need to make a warranty claim, Clarisonic may not accept it.</li>
    <li> my clarisonic mia lasted less than one year.  That&#x27;s right. for 125$, I got less than one year of use.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic!  It gets my skin incredibly clean and has helped clear up some acne I was experiencing.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m a broke college student, the clarisonic was a great purchase for me. I feel confident that I&#x27;m really cleaning my skin every night, and my products like moisturizer really sink in. In terms of a large skin difference, I haven&#x27;t seen huge dramatic results (I don&#x27;t have two much acne, just a lot of uneven skin tone and large ass pores). It really is more for lazy people than anything else, just like the sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s fun to use and its less of a hassle. Because it lightly exfoliates, my skin has become a bit brighter. Last, it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of cleaner, so don&#x27;t leave it in the bathroom where it can collect all the little fun microbes that drift in there. I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing some sort of antibacterial brush spray just because I&#x27;m afraid that a dirty brush would lead to more acne. Clarisonic-great for skin maintenance and cleanliness, but if your looking for a miracle worker to fix acne, wrinkles, sun spots, ect. I would buy a home microdermabrasion kit and put that together with a glycolic peel instead of buying the Clarisonic.  OH and if your looking for a cheap way to clean your clarisonic, there are a couple tutorials online, or you can just buy some sort of makeup brush cleaner from Sephora or online. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day and she absolutely loves it.  She says it&#x27;s like going to the spa every day.  Our 10 yr old daughter uses it every now and then to \\&quot;keep pimples away\\&quot;.  Well worth the money from my perspective.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I read prior to my purchase, I was very excited to receive my Clarisonic.  I love the way it makes my face feel after I have used it.  The issue I have for my face/skin type is that I am experiencing a bit of a rash with flakey sking on certain areas of my face in addition to several breakout areas.    The jury is still out for me. I&#x27;m hoping my skin gets acquainted with this device and ends up having a nice long standing relationship!</li>
    <li> Like the item. Impressed by the service on time and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to my friends and continue to focus on this;</li>
    <li> I was encouraged by a skin specialist to purchase a Claisonic Mia. My 33 year old daughter also owns one and loves it. After a month of using my Mia with a delicate brush (an extra purchase) it has produced red spots on my checks that have not gone away. My skin feels clean &amp; soft but the red spots are not acceptable so I will stop using my Mia. I gave it two stars. One for cleansing &amp; the other for how it made my skin feel. If it weren&#x27;t for the red spots I would have given a glowing review like so many have.  Another disappointment is  I purchased it through Amazon and now cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  It makes me look forward to washing my face before bed.  Just be careful to not apply too much pressure with it; you really don&#x27;t need to, it does all the work for you!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! Instantly saw results the first time I used it. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but this smaller version of the original is easier to take with you for travel and works just as well. Skin feels soft and smooth each time it&#x27;s used. Would never go back to using old methods for washing the face ever again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Skin is smoother with first use and keeps getting better. Soft feel, not rough but best exfoliation I ever get. I purchased to try to minimize breakouts (at age 38). Really helped me! I also discovered it is helping me to reduce dark spots through exfoliation of the discolored layers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend this much money on skin care products but this was definitely worth it. When you use the Clarisonic you immediately notice how much firmer your skin is. It also gives your skin a softer shinnier texture, almost like it&#x27;s been buffed. I used the soap that came with it at first but then I noticed that there were other less expensive liquid soaps that seemed to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer K. Lafferty&lt;br /&gt;Author of Offbeat Love Stories and More</li>
    <li> This broke after one month. I called the number and they said it was a knock off. Don&#x27;t buy here!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a spare to bring with me whenever I travel.  Like the regular size, it does a great job.  The only difference is the body size.  The brush heads are the same.  I will definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was a teen and about a year ago I consulted with a dermatologist.  I had tried Proactive when I was younger, but it dried out my skin, making my skin more oily and made my breakouts worse.  I tried TONS of different facecare products from Neutrogena to Clinique but nothing worked.  So my dermatologist put me on two different medicated face products one after another (differin and atrolin) but both made me break out more as well.  Because I was really concerned about clearing out my pores and getting rid of the blackheads in my T-zone (in addition to ridding the cystic acne), my derm recommended the clarisonic.  I went for a couple months debating whether or not to buy it since it was so pricey.  Plus, I didn&#x27;t know whether I wanted the original, plus, pro, or mia.  After reading TONS of reviews on all of them wherever I could find them, I decided to purchase the mia because of it&#x27;s smaller size.  I absolutely LOVE it.  I can&#x27;t imagine myself ever going without it again.  It makes my skin SO smooth and removes every bit of makeup so my skin absorbes my moisturizer so much better!  And if I use it on a regular basis (2x per day), my pores look SO much smaller and my face is acne free!!!  I didn&#x27;t use it with the enclosed cleanser, I use Origin&#x27;s checks and balances cream face wash and then use Origins A Perfect World moisturizer.  Nothing has ever worked before Origins and clarisonic.  This does.  I cannot recommend it enough!!!  So far, two of my friends and my grandma all tried using mine since I rave about it so much and they IMMEDIATELY all bought their own.  All of them have different skin concerns (aging, dryness, dark circles, etc) and ALL of them are now in love too.  Whether you have acne or not, you will LOVE this product.  Buy it now!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would make my skin look better. I see no difference and still have the same amount of clogged pores and more breakouts than before. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> This purchase made quite the dent in my wallet, but it was completely worth it! The first time that I used it, I already noticed a glow in my complexion. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, morning and night, and already my acne is clearing up, my scars are fading more quickly, and my pores look smaller. The main purpose of this brush is to bring whatever dirt and oils are in your pores to the surface and it allows your skin care products to absorb better! I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that they don&#x27;t make a body brush attachment for the Mia, but I do hope to see one in the future. I would highly recommend this if you have problem skin!</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of good things about the Clarisonic cleansers and decided to go with the MIA because it was relatively inexpensive as well as compact. I have now been using the MIA daily for the past month and the results have been nothing less than amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, my skin is in pretty good shape. However, I spend a lot of time on the beach and I use a cream sunscreen with an spf of +50 or above and I recoat every two hours when I am outdoors. The effect of frequent sunscreen applications has left me with a build-up of the product on my skin. Complicating matters is that I have a build-up of dead skin cells nder all that waxy sunscreen and my skin looks drab. I normally get an exfoliating facial every 2-3 weeks, but since I&#x27;ve been using the MIA I haven&#x27;t needed a facial.&lt;br /&gt;The MIA gently vibates against the skin&#x27;s surface and removes dirt and debris (those dead skin cells). My skin&#x27;s texture has improved and my skin cream seems to absorb quicker. My skin looks fresher and has a nice glow. I&#x27;m not exagerating on this since I&#x27;ve gotten several comments on how good my skin looks. One friend who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a few months asked if I had \\&quot;work done\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The MIA is easy to use. Apply your favorite facial cleanser to the wet brush head. Dampen your face and neck with a little water and turn the unit on. It is timed to run for 60 seconds and turns off. Rinse the brush head as well as your face and that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the regular brush head and have not encountered any irritations.&lt;br /&gt;The unit needs to be charged for about 24 hours before you use it, but one charge lasts a long time. I have yet to recharge in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an easy-to-use product that really does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  I have one and she has used it and loved it so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas gift and it was.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Buying the Clarisonic Mia was the best $115.00 I have ever spent. As someone who has suffered from mild to moderate hormonal acne for the past 14 years, I can honestly say I have tried almost everything to clear up my skin. Ive owned my Mia for a month now so I feel I can write an honest review. I don&#x27;t use any special cleansers with my Mia. Ive found that regular Dove bar soap works well for my face. I run the Mia over my face for about 1:30-2:00 minutes at night followed by Ziana Gel (prescription from my dermatologist). I didn&#x27;t get the awful cystic breakouts some women describe and perhaps that&#x27;s due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t switch cleansers, moisturizers, or acne medications. It did take a few days to get used to and although I didn&#x27;t break out after I started using it, I did notice some dryness/slight irritation within the first few days. This only lasted a couple of days, at most, and I hardly noticed it. I occasionally use the Mia in the morning just to get that extra clean feeling. My face feels amazingly smooth, my pores look smaller, and 3 people have commented on how amazing my skin looks. As someone with problem skin, hearing those words almost brought me to tears. I highly recommend this product. I love the Clarisonic Mia and I am a little irritated with myself that I didn&#x27;t purchase it sooner.</li>
    <li> I got lucky.  I&#x27;d wanted one for a birthday present, and my mom wanted to get it on Amazon. I figured that I&#x27;d just try to register it the second it arrived and if it didn&#x27;t check out as authentic, I&#x27;d send it right back to Amazon.  I literally felt like I hit a small jackpot when the code on the Clarisonic worked and I was able to register the product on the Clarisonic website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people probably won&#x27;t get lucky though, and I wouldn&#x27;t take the gamble.  Buy from an authorized seller only!</li>
    <li> i used to use this brush once a week, and the result was great, i have acne and pores, this brush makes my skin feel smooth and new, but.....it just stop to work! i called to that company hundreds times, no one answered, i was waiting on the phone for 45 minutes  each time , still no service.</li>
    <li> I do love this.  I had wanted one for months, and Amazon&#x27;s prices were the lowest I found anywhere.  I usually use two cycles every time I wash my face because it doesn&#x27;t seem like one is enough, but I do think it gets my face cleaner than a wash cloth and leaves it softer.</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail as a gift from my husband for my birthday. I have wanted this facial brush for a long time after reading all the positive reviews... I will have to agree that after JUST ONE USE the pores on my nose and around my nose on my cheeks are DRASTICALLY smaller. I do not think my face has EVER been this clean unless it was after a professional facial! I am amazed at how smoothe my face was after just one use. Best gift I have ever been given! HIGHLY recommend! Will post after I have been using for a month to give another review.</li>
    <li> She loves it...the directions say that you will see a difference in two weeks buy mama noticed that her skin felt much softer after 3 days of use. She also liked the fact that it was not bulky and she liked the pink color.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received this product.  However, it suddenly stopped working.  When I contacted Clarisonic they said from the serial number it wasn&#x27;t their product. Buyers beware that this is not a genuine Clarisonic sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic stopped working 4 months after I bought it - I called clarisonic as my Amazon return window has expired &amp; was told that my unit is a fake.  It&#x27;s a great looking fake, but covered by no warranty ;(</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised and does a great job - wish I had gotten it sooner.  Does a great job, is easy to store, etc.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and was intrigued by facial cleaning using sonication therapy. I have combination skin and large pores. Always a skeptic, I decided to use the Mia on exactly one half of my face and neck. I used the same facial wash on both sides and left the lather on the non-treated half for the same amount of time. After the first use, I was pleased that the treated half felt noticeably smoother. I used the Mia for a total of 3 weeks twice a day. While the treated side was smoother, there was no reduction in pimples or blackheads. In my experience and on my skin, a cheap exfoliating scrub, or even a washcloth, would&#x27;ve had the same effect. I returned the product with disappointment because, at $140, I had expected better results. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mia for about a month now and already I see a difference in my skin. I have oily acne prone skin with a few little breakouts and bumps. Since using the Mia my skin is smoother with fewer bumps and breakouts. This wont completely get rid of all your acne problems but it does help alot. I use makeup almost on a daily basis and I feel much better after I cleanse with the Mia.. no makeup residue on the cotton ball after using toner! I get the same clean feeling after using a washcloth, but the difference with the Mia is that it isn&#x27;t harsh and abrasive at all like a washcloth can be.. and it doesn&#x27;t turn my skin red and irritated. I use it daily at the end of the day with my own cleanser, but instead of using it once for that one minute I use it for about 3 minutes. I can&#x27;t imagine my skin care regimen without it. I still get breakouts once in a while but not as much as I used to. It isn&#x27;t going to give miracles, but my skin is definitely clearer since using it. So if you have acne problems, I suggest giving the Mia a try.</li>
    <li> Since I was a kid I had the horrible habit of constantly picking at blemishes on my skin. The result at 23 years of age is uneven tone and ugly scarring. I also have very large pores on my nose and on the apples of my cheeks.     My mother and sister have the larger version of the Clarisonic (the one that can be used for face and body). I did not notice any change in my sister&#x27;s complexion, but my mother&#x27;s complexion changed drastically, and her skin not only looked healthier, but her pores seemed more minimal. After reading reviews extensively I decided to give it a shot.    I did not experience the \\&quot;6 feet under\\&quot; rash of pimples after a week or so of use, which seems to be a common trend. This may have had something to do with the fact that not a week before I received my MIA I had a facial at the salon. I charged it for 24 hours before I used it. My first use was very pleasant - I was happy I could incorporate the process into my shower and my face felt brand new afterwards.    I have had my MIA for about two months now. Since beginning usage, my skin tone has improved and looks decidedly less patchy. I am now comfortable wearing only the sheerest foundations on a hot day with some simple eye makeup, whereas before I was careful to layer on concealer and foundation to cover the discoloration. My skin is much softer. I still break out occasionally around my period, but the breakouts are not bad and my skin is clear for the rest of the month. My pores are shockingly diminished. I also notice that after using the MIA, my moisturizer is absorbed much more quickly and effectively. Even the scarring seems less.    I love my MIA for all the above reasons, and on top of that it is perfect for travel - I would not leave home with out it. The only potential con is that the MIA does not hold a charge when not plugged in. If you charge it all the way, and then unplug it to put in a suitcase or away in a cupboard, it will not have a full charge when you retrieve it for use. Also I stopped using the Clarisonic cleanser that came with it because it was causing itchiness and dryness, and went back to my Boots No. 7 skin care line.    Replacement brush heads are a tad expensive (usually $20 apiece) but if you take good care of them they last a long time and the cost is negligible compared to the great service you&#x27;re getting for your face.    This product is worth every penny and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I actually love this but it  broke after a couple months of use. It will no longer charge. Going to try and get my money back.</li>
    <li> Have been eyeing it for awhile at the local Neiman Marcus and walked into SAKS where they had a special on the pink MIA along with a full size cleanser (it comes with the travel size version of same). From day one I I thought I noticed smoother application of my foundation, but the first week I had no less than FIVE PEOPLE tell me how great I looked...and they had no idea of my Clarisonic purchase! That was all the convincing I needed. As I suffer from Rosacea, I find it better personally to only use it in the morning even though they say you can use it morning and night; however  I never miss a morning as it does affect my makeup application if I skip. I pair it with DIOR Capute Totale super serum and I know my face has never looked better!! I feel like I get a wonderful facial every day!  Would go out immediately to replace it if this were ever damaged or lost.  A favorite purchase to be sure!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia has done great things for my skin. My skin looks smoother and fresher each morning.  It has also cleared up problem areas in my T-zone.  I haven&#x27;t quite gotten down the time I&#x27;m supposed to spend on each area but it seems to work ok anyways.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I think that I love this.  I get facials on a monthly basis and this product is highly recommended. Although I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning my face, apparently it is.  In fact, it is supposed to get down in there 6x deeper than a wash cloth can do.  I bought the normal/dry head because the sensitive just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.  My skin is good and I like that with this product I know that I&#x27;m \\&quot;washing\\&quot; for at least 60 seconds. I wish the Mia had 15 second beeps like the bigger one has.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and BUY this product!!  I have never, ever had any cleaning product work as well as the Clarisonic Mia.  It has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> OK...so it&#x27;s a $120 face brush that vibrates. I did not notice a difference after several days of use and took it back to the Clinique counter [where I had paid $150!! on impulse]. I&#x27;ve also heard that Olay makes a simliar product for $20.</li>
    <li> I work in a spa and have been hearing rave reviews about the Mia for a long time now.  The price tag always made me hesitant to purchase it but I finally gave in after a particularly nasty breakout on my chin.  I am so far thrilled with this product (though admitedly have only just started using it so I&#x27;m not sure of any long-term effects yet).    After letting charge a full 24 hours before my first use (torture!), I used it before bed and woke up to much clearer skin.  It was incredible, and nothing I have ever used has had that effect before.  I have very sensitive skin and am always nervous to try something new and drastic, but with the sensitive skin brush the Mia works with my skin, not against it.    The price may be high, but it is an investment in your skin.  Definitely will be getting one for my mom for Christmas and recommending to guests of the Spa.</li>
    <li> The clarisonic is great, however I was sent the wrong color. I ordered a pink one and was sent a lavender one. Not the biggest deal, but then what&#x27;s the point of choosing a color at all?</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, which is prone to spots and has always been plagued with blackheads (especially on my nose, cheeks and chin).   Anyway, I am obsessed with trying anything and everything out there on the market to improve my skin, sooo...I saved up the money and got a Clarisonic Mia ;)  Now, firstly my skin did break out, BUT this is simply because the Clarisonic is lifting so much dirt up each cleansing session- obviously after a little patient, this breakout resolves itself (because there is no longer any dirt deep in your pores!). After all this; within a month or so..my blackheads (which must&#x27;ve been present for, oh let&#x27;s see.....5 years?) have gone. No joking..I mean, I was hoping for improvements of skin texture and reduced breakouts but really did not believe it would get rid of my blackheads.   LOVE IT.  I feel alot of people who have invested in this product need the following tips to get the most out of their clarisonic!!:  -After every cleanse, remove brush and wash with something non-soap based.  -When washed efficiently, ensure the brush dries fairly quickly- I place on a towel on top of a radiator (otherwise it can get a little damp and smelly&#x3D;bacteria central!)  -After cleansing your face with Clarisonic, rinse cleanser off thoroughly as leaving any trace of soap etc will just clog your pores up again (I recommend using a gentle toner).  and...that&#x27;s all I can think of right this minute....!!  I need to say, I can appreciate that it may not work for some people (after all you can&#x27;t really just presume it&#x27;s amazing for everyone) but do recommend for sensitive skin (use the delicate/sensitive brush) and spot-prone/blackhead prone ..From my own experience.  I really do love my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> My skin glows. It&#x27;s also really soft, feels clean, looks younger, fresher...I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3VYXYEK3KSCDW]]Here is a video of a fake Clarisonic that was purchased off Amazon and given to me as a gift. It shows how I identified it as a fake, and a couple things to look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy a Clarisonic off Amazon I highly suggest you do what I didn&#x27;t----register it with Clarisonic!!  That would be a quick way of checking its authenticity, as they&#x27;ll let you know whether or not the serial number is valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of things off Amazon, and this experience definitely has me thinking twice about buying anything brand name from this website.</li>
    <li> I had much higher expectations for the Clarisonic Mia, especially after all the rave reviews and friends&#x27; recommendations.  I expected a high quality product but this was actually my 2nd order, the first broke after a couple of months - just randomly stopped working.  The second just stopped working properly.  The battery won&#x27;t fully charge and the Clarisonic Mia itself vibrates randomly and struggles to function.  Super disappointed as it took me a year before I committed to spend the money on this product and each one just works for a few months.  Guess it&#x27;s back to just washing my face with my hands again.</li>
    <li> Ive had the Mia for three months now and overall I really like it. It does make your skin feel so clean and smooth and absorbs your products better. I have pretty dry skin and I still use the Mia twice a day but I make sure to spray moisturizing toner and use a strong moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first month I was definitely breaking out where I never had before. I have fair dry-ish skin and I will randomly get huge hormonal zits on my chin, nowhere else. The other breakouts lasted less than a month and were minimal. What I noticed about the Mia was that I was still getting those big zits on my chin, but instead of taking a week to develop (agonizing) they were there within one day and were easy to get rid of. I think the Mia speeds up the process, which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now started using benzoyl peroxide every day on my chin, plus moisturizer on top, and my Mia twice a day, and so far, no breakouts for the last month. So I&#x27;m hoping! I&#x27;m in my 30s and those pesky hormonal breakouts have been a real pain, and I&#x27;m crossing my fingers the Mia plus my whole regimen will do the trick. Either way it really is a good product, I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia (pink) in March 2012 after all the positive 5-star reviews.  Let me say, I don&#x27;t get the hype.  I barely feel any scrubbing with the system.  You can get as good of a clean just using facial cleanser and rubbing with your hands.  Why spend over $100?</li>
    <li> After research, Clairsonic makes the best product of this type.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheaper brands that don&#x27;t work for long.</li>
    <li> I have been using clarisonic for a couple of years - it really makes a difference in texture and sheen of skin - helps keep pores clean while nurturing the skin with a gentle massage. The basic Mia is all the clarisonic you need in my opinion! I have had the Mia 2 and could tell no distinct advantage with the second speed. This product was delivered exactly as ordered and at least $20 less than you would pay retail!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from Amazon, I got mine from Sephora who had the best deal at the time. I went with the Mia because I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary to have an extra speed setting or extra anything for that matter after doing a ton of research, other reviews agreed the Mia was the bare minimum model, and works just as good as any other models.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for this long. I am 24, and was starting to get an uneven skin tone. I hardly ever wear make-up, but when I do the Clarisonic along with Purity Philosophy cleanser works it&#x27;s magic to get all of my makeup off. I was impressed with how clean my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a week once a day, and I can already see a difference. I had to be careful not to purge my skin, because I was so tempted to use it 2-3 times a day. I did one day, not a good idea when you&#x27;re first starting out. Once a day, or every other day is enough to start out...and during my second week I will try twice a day and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is already better, it&#x27;s a lot smoother and is allowing my other face products to work more effectively.  My skin is a lot brighter, and overall feels healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in April and it worked wonders to shine up my 40 year old complexion.  After 5 months, the charger stopped seating properly and would not charge even if propped in place.  I called Clarisonic because the product has a one year warranty.  They looked up the batch number and said that the product was sold by an unauthorized dealer and that I should have known better than to buy it online.  They admitted that it was a genuine Clarisonic product but that the parts were not warranteed.  I could not get them to explain whether they are putting inferior parts in the unauthorized clarisonics or if I just got a lemon.  Either way, Phillips is controlling the manufacture and distribution of these products to sell en masse online, with their name on it, and not warranteeing them.  And they treated me like scum of the earth for buying their product on Amazon.  They have no repair center.  She said I could try buying a new charger, but it would be at my own risk, and they have no technical service group to help me troubleshoot the problem to see if a new charger might help.</li>
    <li> I used this 2 nights ago and not only is my face tight and cracking, it is bleeding, red and raw!! I can&#x27;t open my mouth to eat anything baecause it&#x27;s so tight and dry!! I am suggesting that people with sensitive skin DO NOT USE!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Clarisonic Mia as a gift from my husband for Christmas. So far, I really like using it. It only takes 1 minute in the shower.  My skin felt smoother after just one use. It&#x27;s no miracle by any means, but I have noticed less clogged pores and a drastic reduction in cystic acne (which I struggled with before).  You could use any gentle cleanser with it.</li>
    <li> This is one of those rare products that is so much better than you expect.  I have developed cystic acne late in life and have spent thousands of dollars trying to control it.  I have had this brush just a few months and have seen a noticeable improvement.  I use the deep pore cleansing brush.  It has evened out my skin tone in the short time I have used it.  I went from bare faced blotchy with acne breakout to, on some days, looking like I already have makeup on.  I have not had a cystic acne outbreak in months.  If a blemish comes up, it usually goes away within a couple of days.  In the last month I have notices that several raised bumps that I have on my face (they look like white moles but are not) are losing layers and getting smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this with my own gentle skin cleanser and the Obagi line of skin products (Clear, Blender, and Tretinoin).  After using this brush, I bought one for my mother and my best friend.</li>
    <li> After turning 30 (and having 2 kids) I noticed my body started changing. Specifically my face. I began breaking out on my forehead and a little around my nose, chin, and cheeks. I never had a problem with my skin before until recently. I tried everything from face/nose strips to cleansers to simply not wearing makeup and growing out my bangs in hopes that my face will clear up. I heard about the Mia and it seems to get great reviews almosy everywhere. This was the cheapest one I could find and I decided to just go for it. After the first use I noticed a difference! I used it for about a week and my skin is completely cleared up! I feel like a teenager again! It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and my face looks and feels fabulous! The best part is that it only takes 1 minute. I absolutely recommend this product! It&#x27;s fantastic and totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is the one of the those facial related product that I used most frequently. When I am in rush, I even use soap with the brush just clean my nose. If it&#x27;s not used for a couple of days, I get breakout back on my nose. I bought it because sonic toothbrush works very well for me. By same theory, this should be good too. And it turned out to be a really useful gadget.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Clarisonic (gave my 1st one to my mom)...and it started going wonky 4 months into owning it and finally gave out in October. The &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; is no longer working so I am just using it as a manual brush because I love the brush so much. This one seems less sturdy and flimsy than my original one. Disappointed at the lifespan BUT I have been a Clarisonic user for 4 years and I love it...when it works.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. I bought it. I used it. And my results are the same as if I used a fine micro-grained facial scrub product. I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy it but I think you can get the same results with something you don&#x27;t have to plug into the wall. Just saying. ...............LATER: This is now an update comments you just read. I have had considerable breakouts on my face since using this appliance. I am over 50 and have that light European skin that is fairly sensitive. Not overly but fairly. I haven&#x27;t had this number of zits on my face in many years. And they are sore at the onset. I switched to a super gentle cleanser on the brush but no change. Then I did an online search and found that many people are reporting the same results. I believe this is not something that will happen to everyone but if you have sensitive skin I would be very cautious. I&#x27;ve been using the regular brush and I&#x27;m considering buying the sensitive brush but hate to throw more money away in case that is not going to change things. My face doesn&#x27;t feel raw or abused after use, but I definitely think the cleansing thingy is doing it. I&#x27;m going to stop using it and will report back if the blemishes stop coming.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the rave I heard and watched on TV and youtube. I was very intrigued about this product. Some claimed that it actually cleared their acne and it was one of the reasons why I wanted to buy this product. Although this product was so expensive I was determined to buy it and then my sister said that this was reviewed by someone on the news and that person was impressed by the results. I bought this for my sister as a gift and then I bought myself a delicate head brush because my skin is sensitive and most of the youtube gurus were saying that the sensitive brush head was too much for their skin. I bought this the first week of February and I can say I&#x27;m actually impressed. This product did not under any circumstances clear my acne. I still have acne, I&#x27;ve read that some people were fortunate enough that this product cleared their acne, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. This product deep cleansed my skin that even though I removed my makeup with makeup remover, when I use this I still get makeup on my brush. This product cleaned my skin so well, which may be the reason that the products I use on my face were able to penetrate effectively. Although, it did not clear my skin, I will still recommend buying this just because it will really make your skin clean which will help whatever product you put on your face work to its optimum capacity. So yup! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I love that it is rechargeable.  I can have a relaxing facial any time I want.  I can use soap or any cleanser I buy.  I also use it on my neck and chest and some times on my elbows and shoulders.  If I want, I can purchase other head parts and even do my feet.  That&#x27;s next on my list!</li>
    <li> Please respond. I ordered on Amazon the Clarisonic Mia one speed cleaner. This product has a one year warranty. The product has stopped working and will no longer keep the charge. It is still under warranty and it appears I am no longer able to return or even exchange the product. Please advise. This is false advertising from the seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for the wife&#x27;s birthday (here request) and she loves it.  So does our daughter.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with my Clarisonic.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost three months and I can&#x27;t say enough about what the gadget has done for my skin.  I have suffered from acne since I was a teenager (I am now 28) and finally I have a non-prescription way to clear skin.  I did experience a little bit of a breakout at first but it was worth enduring for the skin I have today. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my fine lines and also darker spots on my skin from old scars have lightened considerably.  I also find that my skin more readily absorbs any moisturizer and products I apply now.  It&#x27;s a bit of an investment, but totally worth it.  If you aren&#x27;t sure - get the Mia, its the least expensive and just has a few less bells and whistles than the other models.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much better since Christmas 2010 and its only a 5 days into Jan! I would buy this and never tell a soul. Thats how great it is. People will ask you what you have been doing everyday. This should be one of those secrets that only members of the Clarisonic club know about! But since you are reading this just buy it use it once and you will understand. You do not have to use the cleanser that comes with the system. I use my own cleanser that I had been using. It makes your serums and creams work so mch better. They quickly absorb and start working. Its like that Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep movie with Bruce Willis where she drinks that potion and never dies and always looks 20. Thats this machine!  I have the pink mia. I don&#x27;t desire the more expensive one because I don&#x27;t see how this could possibly get any better.</li>
    <li> I see that olay now has a version of this at $29.99. [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System that should have been a link! Cut and paste.) And it looks identical - so I&#x27;m guessing it works identically.  I find that my Clarisonic exfoliates well, and since I hated the mess of in a tube exfoliaters, I like that.  It also cleans better than my washcloth does.  That said, I&#x27;d go with the 29.99 version from Olay since the cost is so much less.  I bought my clarisonic when it was just introduced and paid something like $250...that&#x27;s what you get for being an early adopter of new technologies!  When they introduced their toothbrushes they were ungodly high priced too, years ago, and now there&#x27;s hundreds of equally effective \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes.  \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; is a gimick, I am told, and adds nothing to the efficacy of the products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was the real Clarisonic! It is not! About 4 months in, it completely stopped working, even when it said it was fully charged. I called Clarisonic customer service assuming I would get a new machine, however I did not. They said that my serial number is not an authorized number, therefore not real. I am very upset and still waiting for my refund. I would buy from the actual website and spend a little more.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and hoped she wouldn&#x27;t be offended.  She always had great skin but I knew these were gaining popularity so I got it for her anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE LOVED/LOVES IT.  Guys, this thing is a magic maker.  She uses it two or three times a week and is always excited to do so.  If you are looking for a good gift that isn&#x27;t cliche, this is it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cleaning system. It sounds a tone when it&#x27;s time to move on to another part of your face. I appreciate the reminder. It has helped with my cleansing routine and I&#x27;m so glad I finally &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; for this investment.</li>
    <li> I did so much research on this before I bought it. I loved it at first. My skin didn&#x27;t completely freak out and purge like some people claimed but it definitely looked a lot more shiny for the first few weeks that I used this. I used it day and night with the sensitive brush head that came on it. Then, last month I ordered an acne deep pore brush head (don&#x27;t know why, I read the awful reviews on them) and ever since then my face has been a mess. I wish I had splurged and paid a little more money for the sensitive brush head again. I have stopped using my Clarisonic and will resume use once I buy a new sensitive skin brush head and my skin clears up. This is a great little device, just be careful which brush head you order with it.</li>
    <li> Nice way to exfoliate and renew your skin cells. Wish I could be totally comfortable using in the shower, but am worried about batteries under water. Otherwise, very nice product.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia!  My face is much cleaner after using the Clarisonic than it is when I wash my face using just my hands. I use my regular face wash with the Clarisonic, and it works great.  I have less break-outs now and highly recommend this product to anyone looking for clearer, healthier skin.</li>
    <li> Oh ya -oh ya- oh ya! I am a licensed esthetician and I have tried every skin care product and done it all when it comes to skin care methods and this clarisonic product is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the mia on Amazon becuase they had best price and I wanted a smaller device for home use. After 2 uses with sensitive skin brush head my skin glows and is so beautiful. Use your own skin care products Obagi, Image whatever pick your \\&quot;skin care poison\\&quot; and def use your own products and watch your skin improve after as little as 2 uses. If you are seeing a dermatologist and being prescribed a facial cleanser for acne like Benzac wash or proactive this clearsonic will rock those out also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it 2x&#x27;s and I had to look a few times in the magnifying mirror  because my skin looks that good. Products and makeup will apply better and you will see immediate results no joke. I use air brush to apply my make up and having this as part of my skin care regime now I am not so sure I will have to do so as much since clarisonic really makes those pores invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Only draw back- I am a clean freak and I especially like sanitary when it comes to anything used on my face or in my bathroom and the fact the brush head doesn&#x27;t have a sterile case to put in or a sterilizer in general *like a sonicare toothbrush head sterilizer that uses infrared to clean between uses (are you listening clarisonic folks?) is not cool. So I have the cap on the brush head for now until I figure out how to make this work for me to keep that sterile. A good soak of the brush between uses in alcohol solution is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you have other ideas to sterilize let me know as I don&#x27;t like a unsterile brush head touching my face defeats the purpose so I cap it and put it in my make up drawer for now but I like the idea of clarisonic coming up with a infared cleaner for between uses like sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product it will work on any skin type and do use it on your *chest area also ladies helps to make that area glow as well. !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tool you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to good skin and good health!!!</li>
    <li> So far, I love this cleansing system!  It really seems to clean thoroughly, but yet gently.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to keep their skin clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Complexion looks brigther and smoother, now i can say that i would never go back to cleaning my face with washclothes or hands.. Totally love it!!</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia but it seems my husband loves it more! It has done wonders for smoothing out his skin and helping minimize ingrown beard hairs. He uses the deep pore (blue) cleansing brush. Honestly, the Mia now resides in his shower so unless I remember to grab it from his bathroom, I never get to use it anymore!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a real Clarisonic. I had been using for about 3 weeks and it was working well, then it died in the middle of using it. I just assumed it needed to be charged, but when I plugged it in, the LED light that lets you know it&#x27;s charging never came on and it never charged. I called Clarisonic customer service and when I told them the number on the handle, they said it was not one of their numbers, which meant it was not a real Clarisonic. Needless to say, I&#x27;m returning it. Thankfully it quit working before the return deadline. I&#x27;m guessing this company knows that these things will probably crap out but they bank on them crapping out after it&#x27;s too late to return it. Now that I look at the reviews, I see the same thing that happened to me has happened to a lot of people. I really don&#x27;t understand why Amazon hasn&#x27;t done anything about the fact that this company is selling counterfeit products and claiming them to be genuine.</li>
    <li> I just bought this a couple of weeks ago. I had been eyeing it for a while but was reluctant to shell out $100+ for it. I finally decided to take the plunge and does not regret it. The only regret is not buying it sooner. I have noticed my face is much smoother and my pores are definitely smaller. My makeup now goes on much better, I don&#x27;t even need to use makeup base. You can hardly see my pores with makeup on, and I use Bare Minerals. I really look forward to using it everyday! The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because of the price.</li>
    <li> The best!  This thing has changed my life.      I was in love with this thing the very first time that I used it.  However, I decided to wait several months to review it just in case it was a fickle love affair.  It is not a fickle love affair.  Six-months later, and I&#x27;m still in love.      I&#x27;m a 40-year old woman who has had acne since I was 12.  I have done everything -- every medication including THREE courses of ACCUTANE (which is medically unheard of!).  And yet I still have acne.  Long-story short, I discovered in my 30s that I have a severe dairy intolerance.  This reaction to dairy is what gives me the acne.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t eat dairy.  After that I stopped having cystic acne.      However, it&#x27;s hard to avoid all dairy (things worth eating have butter!); and even eating like a vegan does not give me beautiful skin.  Even under the best conditions my skin is congested and lacks a healthy glow.  I also have these small white bumps over much of my skin. However, after decades of cystic acne, my skin is so much improved that it seems just fine to me.      Until I found this thing!  This cleans my skin to a degree that I never understood was possible.  It seems to break up the congestion and leaves my skin in a state that I never would have imagined as possible.  This was evident from the very first use.  My skin never looked better!  However, over the six-months of use my skin has gotten better and better and better!  The white bumps have gone away one by one.  It&#x27;s as if it cleans at such a deep level that the congestion has released from the very depths of my pores.      I cannot adequately describe how wonderful this thing is!  Since my skin is so sensitive, I do use the sensitive brush head and almost no pressure.  I am very, very gentle with the device, and yet still it cleans so wonderfully.      I highly recommend this.  (And if you are an adult who has suffered with acne for most of your life, try eliminating dairy from your diet.)</li>
    <li> I read practically every review about this Clarisonic Mia because I HAD to justify spending a couple hundred dollars on something that is supposed to be so incredibly great.  I don&#x27;t have much time, but I feel a sincere obligation to tell people who are thinking about buying this to PLEASE save yourselves a good chunk of money and not fall for it like I did.  I swear, my face getting steamed while taking a hot shower, then gently massaging it with a warm washcoth and a cleanser, gets more of a soft, clear skin, noticable result than this device.  I wish, I wish, I wish I had listened to one of the reviews I had read and just bought one of those \\&quot;Buff Puff\\&quot; scrubs.  Then I wouldn&#x27;t feel so sick to my stomach about wasting so much money on something that I, not only can match with a simple washcloth, but beat it with that washcloth.  PLEASE don&#x27;t fall for this.   Massage your face with a damp washcloth for a few minutes every other day with your ideal cleanser.  It&#x27;ll save you time, money and a \\&quot;I-want-to-kick-my-own-butt\\&quot; moment because you bought this, used it and can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Like everybody else said, this item is not authentic. It broke recently from normal use. Since it is still under warranty, I should be able to get this fixed. However, the costumer service representative said that this item is not authentic and is a knock-off. I don&#x27;t know why Amazon would sell a knock-off, but this is pretty irritating since I spent over $100 on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody have any suggestions on how to get this fixed?</li>
    <li> This product worked fine for about 3 months and I didn&#x27;t even use it that often.  Like other reviewers here, I am very disappointed to spend almost $100 and then find no one will be responsible for this when it breaks.  Buyers beware!!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had problems with the product not working.  It worked great for a few months - I love how clean-feeling it leaves my skin!  After maybe two or three months of use, the on/off button started getting hard to use.  I could fiddle with it and it would turn on, though, so I kept going with it.  I&#x27;ve had it about five months now and the on/off button is seriously just not working.  I&#x27;ll try to dig out the contact information for Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m not hopeful given the fact that other reviewers were told that Amazon is not an authorized seller and that the product is a knock-off.  I&#x27;d definitely buy another Mia, but I&#x27;ll research authorized sellers first and not likely purchase it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know, got this for my daughter so guess it worked ok.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to have  a lucious skin but my face has never felt so clean.  After I use it I moisturize and I&#x27;m sure that the lotion really gets where it needs to be.</li>
    <li> This is a phony clarisonic, it broke and when I called clarisonic to return it them told me. I did not get all of my money back either.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and can easily say it is awesome. I suffer from occasional cystic acne (on average 4 or more zits a month) and since using this have not had any new breakouts.  The massaging feels great on my skin; also my skin feels super silky soft and the size of my pores are minimized. I used this with both the clarisonic cleanser that came with the unit and with Loreal Skin Genesis pore minimizing cleanser. The clarisonic cleaner smells good and works well but using Loreals Skin Genesis with the clarisonic made my pores virtually invisible. Its a shame that Loreal decided to discontinue it..  All in all, this is a fantastic product and I am sure you will love it as well.</li>
    <li> I was always interested in the original, full size Clarisonic. The premise was great, but the price was way too much. I first saw the Clarisonic Mia in Sephora several months ago, and ever since, I wanted one of my own. I went back and forth trying to justify spending that much money on the product, but ultimately, I went for it. I found the Clarisonic on a website for 20% off that original $119 dollar price. I ended up purchasing it for around $95 dollars. It was a great deal. I purchased it in the color \\&quot;tangerine\\&quot;, and I love it!  I have been using the Clarisonic for less than a week, and already, it has done wonders for my skin. My skin is incredibly smooth and soft. The overall tone of my skin is much more uniform, and I have noticed that many darker areas of my skin have gotten lighter. I always had dry areas around my nostrils and under my bottom lip that I could never seem to get rid of. Now, they are slowly disappearing and getting smaller every day. One of the biggest thing I have noticed has to do with something that not many people think the Clarisonic would work on.  A few months ago, I got my nose pierced. I developed a red, shiny bump right next to my piercing called a keloid or hypertrophic scar. Basically, your body does not know when a wound is healed and keeps on building up scar tissue. This resulted in an annoying bump that would not go away. This bump on my nose has been there for months and has been RELENTLESS! I tried several remedies such as placing tea tree oil on it and apply hot salt water to it, but nothing has worked. Initially, I was afraid to use my Clarisonic over my piercing because I was afraid it would irritate the piercing and thus further enlarge the keloid, but I decided to try anyways. After only three days of use, I noticed a dramatic decrease in the size of the keloid! To my surprise, it continues to get smaller, dry up, and now it is barely noticeable! I am absolutely thrilled.  Clarisonic solves all sorts of skin dilemmas.Anyone who is even considering purchasing this product, just GO FOR IT! Buy it from a store or website with a great return policy, and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, than you can return it without questions. But if you find amazing results after just a few days like me, then maybe you will be so happy that you just went for it! The Clarisonic is aboslutely INCREDIBLE, and it is worth EVERY penny!</li>
    <li> This little device is awesome at cleaning my face.  My skin feels so much softer and refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is bad, I&#x27;m going to through the website to repair, but the product serial number  is false, that is to say, the goods are counterfeit goods, urged the Amazon refund</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so nice and clean!  I saw a difference in how my skin looked and feels within a short period of time.</li>
    <li> You got to get one of these!  This hand-held skin cleansing system is easy, relaxing, and leaves your face feeling like you just paid $100 for a facial!</li>
    <li> I bought the clarisonic mia for my little sister for her birthday and was told today that the product lasted the duration of the charge that the product was shipped at and never would take a charge again. She called clarisonic and was told that the product number she gave them was for a product that was just made and therefore could not be correct. When told that the product was not bought from a clarisonic store they informed her that it was counterfeit. $106.00 down the drain. what a dissapointment</li>
    <li> From the first use, I have noticed a difference in my pores.  Even my daughter noticed my complexion a little softer.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using my Clairsonic. My skin feels clean and refreshed after use. It removes makeup that is left behind from regular washing.</li>
    <li> best in vention ever made i use it every day my daughter uses it we love it so easy to use</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it claims to do; it cleans your skin well. I haven&#x27;t experienced any abnormally great results claimed by some Clarisonic users but my skin does feel cleaner after use. Honestly, some of the results people say they see are probably placebo effects because there is no scientific explanation for a lot of the ridiculous \\&quot;results\\&quot; so I&#x27;d read some of 5 star reviews with a grain of salt. I feel that people just want to over-justify spending &gt;$100 on a face exfoliating cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great. I can go almost a month without having to recharge it. The head is relatively sturdy and since I don&#x27;t wear much make up, I won&#x27;t be replacing it as often as it is recommended. The design and color options are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was cheaper, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. I would recommend it just because your skin is too important to not clean thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I have had my Clarsonic Mia since January, so I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2x a day since then.  Like others have said, it will NOT perform miracles on acne.  I still break out from time to time, but it is a tiny bit less frequent, and the issues seem to resolve a tiny bit faster.  That said, the clarity of my skin has definitely increased since I started using this.  I think I started seeing this in the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple with this, though I also have used Burts Bees Sensitive Creme Wash and even The Body Shop stuff, and it works fine.  Just nothing with exfoliating stuff in it, since the brush does that.  Also, don&#x27;t hold it so tight to your skin, and make sure you get replacement brush heads.  I am being cheap and replacing every 6 months instead of the recommended 3, though I really do feel that the performance is not as great when you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting this, I have packed it almost every time I&#x27;ve traveled because I feel that my skin gets icky without it.  So I would definitely say this is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it really makes my skin feel baby-soft and super clean. Love it.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed that system only has one speed!  Charge takes too long!  Wish I would have paid a little more to get the 2 speeds</li>
    <li> She takes bathes everyday...never was my money better spent..it&#x27;s tough...it&#x27;s been dropped..holds charge well..I know there is cheaper but I doubt better...</li>
    <li> i gave this to a friend for her 30th birthday and she said this was the best present and made her look 10 years younger, I have had one for 5 years and never miss a day of using it. It truly will make one look younger and skin healthier</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of your skin after its cleaned by my clarisonic. But it&#x27;s only 3-4 weeks old and already has a different feel then when brand new, which that&#x27;s too quickly to have to buy replacement heads, I financially couldn&#x27;t keep up if that&#x27;s what it needs already?</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It makes my skin feel refreshed and helps to remove dry skin and makeup leaving my face feeling fresh.  I have used it with regular face wash as well as with facial scrubs.  It is important to take it apart from time to time and clean it.  If you don&#x27;t the vibration will not work properly.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to clean my face properly without leaving a foundation residue. The Clarisonic is everything I hoped for - gentle and effective. My face feels truly clean and it can be used with any face cleansing product. I highly recommend the Clarisonic.[[ASIN:B002XURD32 Clarisonic Mia(TM) Skin Cleansing System - Pink]]</li>
    <li> Love my Clarisonic.  Keep it in the shower and use it daily.  Really gets my skin clean and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this Clarisonic despite reading the negative reviews because I&#x27;m one of those people who never believe sh&#x60;lt is going to happen to them. I took my chances with this purchase, but it turns out that I really shouldn&#x27;t have. This product worked for a couple weeks or so, and it was fine while it lasted. I didn&#x27;t notice any drastic changes but I suppose it was cleaning my face and all that, so it couldn&#x27;t have hurt. But then it came time to charge the brush. That&#x27;s where the problems started. No matter how freaking long I charged that thing, it didn&#x27;t hold charge for more like 10 seconds. Three months later, at a time when I was no longer covered by the return policy, my stubborn self finally came to terms with my situation. There was a moment. I was in the shower. I&#x27;ve pressed that stupid button a million times over and as hard as I possibly could with no luck and I thought to myself, \\&quot;The thing everybody warned me about that I didn&#x27;t think would happen to me due to probability, happened to me.\\&quot; So I&#x27;ve come to warn you all, don&#x27;t let that thing happen to you. When people say \\&quot;sh&#x60;lt happens,\\&quot; they are referring to this product.    Of course, I called the manufacturer and like everyone else, received confirmation that my product is a fake. When I bought the item, I knew full well that there was a high probability that the item that is being sold on this page is a fake. But I&#x27;m Chinese, so I can deal with fake s***, I just can&#x27;t deal with broken s***. Long story shorter, I complained to Amazon and demanded a refund despite it being 3 months later, and Amazon customer service made an exception and gave me a partial refund because they are just so amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My skin looks healthier, smoother, with a mild rosy color on my cheeks.  The cleansing gel which comes with it is also a great product.  I have real sensitive skin so I was a little leary about buying it, but saw that it was highly rated, so took the plunge for $100.  Am really glad I did!</li>
    <li> Did not get rid of blackheads even though I bought very nice face wash and change my pillows every other day.</li>
    <li> This little machine really gets the dead skin and debris off of your face.  It removes makeup you think is already gone.  It brings life to your skin tone.</li>
    <li> my wife love it. the product is strong, fell dow, a few times and its just wonrking fine, totally recommended. its ease to byu separated brushes too</li>
    <li> Just rating 4 star as it was given as gift. Recipient loves it, using nightly. Someone wrote that it is a fraud product and that Clarisonic does not sell on Amazon. Product serial number was called in to the company verifying that this is authentic product.. Maybe it was the fraud company saying that? Will know in time if it holds up and does not rust as others said it would. Waiting to see, before ordering one for myself and another for gift.</li>
    <li> I am so sad. My money went away. I bougth the product, the results were good, but the joy of having it didnt last. Suddenly one day before 6 months of using it it just didnt work anymore. It would not charge. I live overseas and returning it will be expensive for me. I am just fustrated. It is so expensive and a lost my money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product months ago and it just stopped working recently. I tried to register it on the clarisonic website in order to use my warranty, but the code at the bottom of the handle was invalid. I called customer service and they told me that my \\&quot;clarisonic\\&quot; is not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer of CLARISONIC products, not any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to all the authorized distributors: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by how authentic this product seems, its not!</li>
    <li> I was given a Mia for Christmas last year, as a gift from my sister. Never once did I think it was a fake. I had no idea this was even an issue, until I recently stumbled upon a you tuber, who had said there was a problem with knock-offs. All of the tell tale signs that mine was a knock-off, I had. The biggest being that the pins that hold my brushes in place, rusted (and they rusted within the first month, I never really thought to look into it, because I really only use it once or twice a week). I do however, because of the rust issue, remove my brush every time I use it, to wash it and also to prevent further rusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There ARE resellers on Amazon, that could very well be authorized to sell Clarisonic, but seeing the seller being listed as &amp;#34;Clarisonic,&amp;#34; is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tell tale signs that you could have a knock-off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is hard to remove or put in.&lt;br /&gt;- There should be even spacing between all of the letters on the logo. If you have an uneven space between the Cl and the a in &amp;#34;Clairsonic&amp;#34; (Cl arisonic), it&#x27;s a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;- If you have a space in between your serial number, it&#x27;s probably a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;- If your pins rust, you get the idea. The pins are the biggest red-flag. They shouldn&#x27;t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to tell, is to call Clarisonic to register your product. They will let you know, when you register the serial number. This was my biggest mistake. But my busy life doesn&#x27;t lend to me remembering to do these sorts of things.  Better yet, the best way to assure you&#x27;re getting an authentic product, is to either purchase directly from their website, OR, an authorized seller, which are all listed on Clarisonic&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> It seems to have worn the hair off my brows!</li>
    <li> Works as expected for better price</li>
    <li> I broke out really bad at first so I started using it just once a day in the morning and that helped dramatically. It took about 2-3 months for my skin to finally get used to the extra exfoliation. You just have to be patient and give your face enough time to get used to it. I absolutely love it, and I have never received so many compliments on my skin my whole life. I never had acne growing up, but had pretty consistent breakouts. I&#x27;ve also found my dark/sun spots have faded dramatically as well. I&#x27;m sold and would hope that people stick with it and just try adjusting because it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia ($98) almost a year ago and the pins to connect the brush rusted.  I contacted Clarisonic and they said their products don&#x27;t rust.  I gave them the serial number and they said it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; so they won&#x27;t warranty it.  I will think twice next time I order something this expensive on Amazon.  It&#x27;s probably worth it to pay a little bit more at an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations for an excellent product.  I gave one to my sister, and as soon as I can scrape together the funds I am getting another for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Had my Clarisonic for 1 year 6 months when it started vibrating constantly when charging without holding a charge. After searching the internet for a solution, I learned that I am not the first owner to experience such a problem. When I called customer care, they told me that because my purchase was made over a year ago that it was no longer under warranty and that they DO NOT have a repair for it and that they DID NOT have any other options for me to replace it at a discounted price even though it was a manufacturer&#x27;s defect. Possibly one of the MOST UNPRODUCTIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT calls I have ever made. Essentially I was told that the company is only responsible for their products for 1 year and 3 months (grace period). What kind of reputable company doesn&#x27;t stand by it&#x27;s product and support it&#x27;s customers past 1 year and 3 months!??!?! I wish I would have known this prior to purchasing and recommending to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the Clarisonic Mia after reading and watching reviews all over the internet. Having ridiculously dry and sensitive skin, I was reluctant at first, but it was on sale and I thought it is worth the shot. I&#x27;ve had decent skin to begin with except for the drama that happens after a rosacea breakout. A couple of months of using Mia once a day (some people use it twice, once was excellent for me), I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin was getting clearer, and somehow it helped lessen the times I get those rosacea breakouts! (please note lessen, not cure). This purchase was well worth it, and I recommend it fully.</li>
    <li> I bought my Clarisonic in December of 2012. I registered it at the time, but that registration was \\&quot;lost\\&quot;... so I registered it again when it started to short out after 11 months. When I contacted customer service, the response I got was that Clarisonic units are made to be waterproof, but not repairable, nor the batteries replaceable. In other words, they are fragile and are going to break. Regardless of when you buy and register your Clarisonic, the serial number you provide determines whether or not your unit in covered under warranty. Mine was not covered. I can&#x27;t begin to express how disappointed I am in Clarisonic. I paid nearly $200 for the unit, brushes, and cleanser. You would think that the Clarisonic company would want customers who felt valued and had pleasant things to say about the company. I was shocked that after only 11 months of use, the unit was going out, and even more shocked that the answer I got when I contacted customer service was \\&quot;so sorry... but that&#x27;s just tough!\\&quot; I will be buying a different brand to replace my Clarisonic and I plan to stay far away from the corrupt Clarisonic company.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic mia!  This is my 2nd one.  I bought this one to travel.  It goes with me everywhere (I take a ton of business trips).  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is I was not able to register the product.  If I would have been able to register it, I would have gotten some specials, but when I entered the serial number, it did not let me finish the registering process.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted less than a month and then when I tried to contact customer service they told me that Amazon is not an authorized dealer and would therefore not do anything for me. Absolutely a piece of junk! If I could rate this as less than one star I would.</li>
    <li> Hello，This is Ricky,I bought this product a few months ago.But Now I got a issue with the charger.This product can not be charged anymore.Could u pls help me with this problem?Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> I am giving this one star, because it&#x27;s NOT a real Clarisonice system. I tried to submit my new &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; to their warranty program to receive a coupon back- yet, received an email back from their customer service dept. saying that it didn&#x27;t come up in their system and that the product that I have is NOT one of their products. I feel like it does do similarly what it&#x27;s supposed to, but the fact that they package it in a Clarisonic box and lead you to believe this is the real product is pretty bad business.  Be careful buying electronics on Amazon for knock offs.</li>
    <li> I use this system almost everyday. It definitely helps cleanse and exfoliate the skin and is easy to use. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I debated on whether or not I should purchase the Clarisonic system for a long time until I finally caved and bought it (don&#x27;t worry - I didn&#x27;t purchase a counterfeit &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; and made sure that the serial number fit a genuine product). I&#x27;m extremely glad that I purchased it, as it has become a daily staple in my skincare routine. I use it on a daily basis (sometimes morning &amp; night) with a gentle cleanser and it works extremely well. It definitely cleans my face better than a wash towel and gets deep in the pores to remove oils and dirt. This product is entirely waterproof - I love how it could be taken into the shower and/or bathtub. The only things I really don&#x27;t like about the Mia is that it takes FOREVER to achieve a full charge and it dries out the skin a bit. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from the Amazon site. It stopped charging after less than a year. I asked Amazon for a refund. Amazon refused. Now I am stuck with an expensive piece of plastic. DO NOT BUY this item. It is a waste of money. As I am reading the comments, I see that I am not the first one to have a problem, so Amazon must know that there is a problem yet they are still selling knockoffs. I buy from Amazon to avoid this kind of problem...or at least I did. I am disappointed in Amazon and Clarisonic. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to receive this item. It was charged when I received it and much cheaper than it was in stores. It is an amazing product! My skin felt very smooth and soft after one use! It is a must have :)</li>
    <li> Everyone should own a clarisonic Mia! The color is perfect! My face has never been this smooth and pretty. I use it twice a day as directed and charge it accordingly.  It is more expensive than other drug store face cleaners but worth every penny</li>
    <li> After two years, my Clarisonic is still going strong. It really cleans the gunk out of your pores and removes bits of dry flaky skin. I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I ever bought for myself.  Turns out my 13 year old daughter loves it too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed to discover that this item is not, in fact, manufactured by Clarisonic as the seller lead me to believe.  After many many defects, I contacted Clarisonic, and they informed me that this is not their product, but an imposter.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed to hear this, and I will be requesting a refund since the product is not what it is advertsided to be.</li>
    <li> This product stopped working after a few months of using it.  However it says I&#x27;m ineligible for a refund.  Now, I need to call Clarisonic and work with them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Clarisonic Mia.  Im thirty four and have always had mild acne and my skin was starting to look and feel dull.  Adding the Mia to my skincare routine has made a huge difference in the texture and clarity of my skin.  After three months of using once a day to cleanse my skin my breakouts have drastically declined and my skin is more vibrant and youthful.  I was using the facewash that came with it in the beginning which wasnt ideal for me but once I switched to a milder cleanser I started to see results.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have to update my review below after the Clarisonic I bought here for my sister broke and the company said in a letter to us that because Amazon is not an authorized reseller, they won&#x27;t honor any warranty and they made it sound like the device wasn&#x27;t manufactured by them either. Amazon says it&#x27;s investigating, but buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  March 7, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: Product purchased from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Amazon&lt;br /&gt;We understand that Sarah Webster attempted to purchase a Clarisonic product from Amazon.com.  The purpose of this letter is to state that Clarisonic is not affiliated with Amazon.com, nor is this website an authorized reseller of Clarisonic&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tashiana Tyus&lt;br /&gt;Customer Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this sweet, darling little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let me start here: I had ok, combination skin to begin with. I&#x27;d get breakouts if I don&#x27;t take good care of my skin. I&#x27;m also 40+, so I&#x27;ve started to get little dark spots, white spots and general unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a baby late in life which sort of sent my skin through a lot of weird changes. For example, clogged little bumps on my forehead that weren&#x27;t exactly pimples but were just, well, little bumps, milia, I think. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to get rid of them, which led to a lot of research, which led to this Clairisonic, which i had heard about before but never really bothered with until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOWEE! ... This device has truly transformed my skin in an amazing way. I followed the directions (and didn&#x27;t overdo it) ... within a week, days really, the change was amazing. One morning, I woke up, looked in the mirror and was pretty stunned at how amazingly fresh and youthful my skin looked. (The bumps were also gone) I now have clear, even, glowing skin that lights up a room and makes people ask ... what do you use, eat, do ... ??? I also routinely go without makeup now, or extremely minimal makeup. This is something I rarely did, and often couldn&#x27;t do, before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, wait, there&#x27;s more! ... I already used fantastic, effective skin products, and while I think those have played a role in my great skin, this device makes everything work better -- allowing me to use less of my expensive serums, creams, lotions and potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, this thing is. Everyone I love will get one next Xmas!imal makeup. This is something I rarely did, and often couldn&#x27;t do, before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, wait, there&#x27;s more! ... I already used fantastic, effective skin products, and while I think those have played a role in my great skin, this device makes everything work better -- allowing me to use less of my expensive serums, creams, lotions and potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, this thing is. Everyone I love will get one next Xmas!</li>
    <li> I use this every night when I take off my makeup. It has given me a clearer complexion and I feel like my skin glows! I&#x27;ve always suffered from minor acne, a blemish here and there, but I find I have less break outs since I&#x27;ve been using this. I haven&#x27;t used the cleanser that came with it, but the brush is great!</li>
    <li> I really expected this to be a good product.  I purchased it and did not even keep the shipping information because I thought it would be great.  The Mia slipped out of my hand and into the sink (it gets wet with use) and immediately stopped working.  It was a gentle fall and not even a foot down.  It is an expensive, the cheap piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I loved my Clarisonic till it stopped working.  For the price I paid it shouldn&#x27;t stop working after 4 months.</li>
    <li> Really great.  The past few months my skin has been so congested and just hasn&#x27;t felt clean at all - no matter what wash / scrubs I have used.  I could feel a difference the first time I used it.   It&#x27;s been less than one week but my face looks and feels better than it has for quite a while.  I highly recommend this.  I like the compactness but I&#x27;m not crazy about the charger.   There is no  good way to place it; it just lays down and won&#x27;t stand up.  I guess if that is a bother to you, you might want to think about the larger unit.   It&#x27;s been great for cleaning up my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave in and bought this product months ago because of the reviews. I do not use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;If I use it too often I get a red, bumpy, irritated look to my skin. I don&#x27;t think people should be exfoliating twice a day as clarisonic suggests! If I use the clarisonic for just a few seconds a few times a week -- like a flash facial, my skin feels cleaner, looks brighter and my pores appear tighter. The key for my sensitive skin, is not to over do it. I also try not to press the brush into my skin, but just hold it gently on top as I move around my face. You&#x27;ll want to press it into your skin, but don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth it, I have seen the same results with my clarisonic, as when massaging with my cleanser for a full minute or two -- as suggested by an aesthetician, or when using my wash cloth, in small circular motions, or scrubbing with a micro-bead cleanser. Exfoliation is exfoliation. I think it is just a matter of finding the right kind for you, that is non irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the clarisonic does feel good on my skin and is much quicker and easier than manual scrubbing. It also feels like I am getting a uniform clean all over in just a few seconds. So basically it works, in my opinion, because it&#x27;s convenient and takes less time than other methods, NOT because it&#x27;s the holy grail of all exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it on your back or body to help with breakouts as well which is a plus.</li>
    <li> My friends recommend me to clean it for my pimple skin. It helped, I think, but not that much. Do not put too much expectation into it.</li>
    <li> I love using the Clarisonic Mia Skin Cleansing system and love this product!  I have bought two others for gifts because it is so good!</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas of 2012 and it recently quit turning on. I called Clarisonic because there is a one-year warranty on this product but after speaking with them they informed me that if the pins on the inside were rusted (which mine were) then it wasn&#x27;t manufactured by Clarisonic! I was even able to register mine on the Clarisonic website! Please be DO NOT buy Clarisonic products through Amazon. Go through an authorized dealer, it will save you trouble in the long run. I&#x27;m really disappointed Amazon would sell a knock-off product.</li>
    <li> BEWARE: This is not a real clairsonic..works fine for about a month or so and then rusts and stops working. I even bought replacement heads and they do not fit on this clairsonic! DO not buy from this buyer or trust them you will lose your money in total!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon because of the reviews saying the product was not the real one. I purchased mine at Macys and I love it!! My face already feels so much cleaner and healthier. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup and don&#x27;t have many concerns with my skin but wanted something that would get me to wash my face more often. This is perfect! It is easy and quick!</li>
    <li> The seller was prompt and fast with shipping and they might be unaware that they had unauthorized Clarisonic products.  The pins holding in brush are rusting.  Clarisonic said serial number is not authorized and they will not replace.  the Mia has been used only 6 months and the pins should not rust according to Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Please do not purchase this item as it is a FAKE!!  After mine malfunctioned after about six months of use, I called the number provided in the paperwork included with the item to request a replacement.  When I read the serial number off the base, the people at Clarisonic informed me that my Clarisonic was fake and not manufactured by them!!  I contacted Amazon, and they were kind enough to refund my money, but I am astonished that they are still selling this fake item.  Please spend a few extra bucks and purchase directly from Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> This makes my face and neck feel so smooth and my make up goes on better.&lt;br /&gt;Fits in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> After I received it, I compared it with the old one I bought from Clarisonic website and found several differences. Then I went to the clarisonic website to try to register this new product, it said the lot code is invalid, which meant this product is fake!!!!!! I am so disappointed!!!! I wanna my money back!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first to spend this much money on a brush, but I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts so I decided to give it a try. The first week, I started breaking out and I assume it&#x27;s from all the gunk that was coming out of my pores. Fast forward one week later, and my skin was really clear. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now and am getting compliments on my clear skin. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> The unit is not waterproof and rusted after 6 months of use.  I called Clarisonic and was told it is a counterfiet product.  They could not help me.  They said if I see a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; on a Clarisonic product in the future to contact them and make sure that an authorized dealer is selling it.</li>
    <li> After 6 weeks I&#x27;m still not sure.  My skin does feel very clean, but it&#x27;s an expensive gadget.</li>
    <li> I bought each of my daughters this product and they say they like it very much. Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Mia after reading all the reviews here and at Sephora.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month now.  My skin is combination - small breakouts in the T zone and some dryness.  I&#x27;ve been trying to stop using medication meant for teenagers and use gentler items now that I&#x27;m in my 30s.  I wanted to try the Mia as a non-chemical way to clear my skin and to make my skin look overall brighter.  I like using it a lot.  It is easy to use in the shower.  It makes my face feel really clean but does not scrub harshly.  I use it twice a day, once with Purity Made Simple and once with the Microdelivery exfoliator from Philosophy.  I think my mosturizer works better now and there is no dryness at all on my skin.  My skin is definitely softer and smoother.  My skin has cleared; so far pimples have been smaller and go away much faster (in a day) and no deep painful ones at all.  I believe that with continued use my skin will continue to get more clear and healthy.  I am definitely wearing less makeup now.  I did not experience a crazy breakout in the first few days of using it as some others have commented.  I did not use the cleanser that came with the Mia so cannot comment on that.  My only complaint is that it takes so long to charge.  I charge it once a week (so after about 15 uses) and it takes all day.  I think the Mia is worth the money, especially if you are prone to trying lots of different skin creams that over time will cost just as much.</li>
    <li> Although the price tag was originally a bit intimidating, the other reviews and feedback from a friend who uses the Mia Sonic were enough to entice me. After a bit over a month of use, I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up! My face feels clean and fresh after each and every use and I have noticed a reduction in break-outs. The cleaning process itself feels like a gentle face massage (and is a part of my morning shower I&#x27;ve come to look forward to). I use mine an average of three times a day (morning, after work, before bed) and find I only need to recharge the unit once a week. When considering how often I use the Mia and the positive results I&#x27;ve seen thus far, the price tag was more than worth it!</li>
    <li> My wife uses regularly, she would by again, great product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used the older model when it first came out as it was recommended by my skincare specialist.  When I went to replace it, I ordered the Mia, love it since it is smaller and easier to handle and to pack when traveling. I am buying one for my daughter as well. It does help to reduce the size of the pores leaving the skin soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item back in January. Already I noticed a few things that didn&#x27;t seem right but I chose to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There were bristles stuck under the vibrating part of the unit. I took tweezers to pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;2) The inside of the box was REALLY dusty when I opened it. (I pinned it on the item sitting on a shelf for too long since it&#x27;s a Mia, not a Mia2)&lt;br /&gt;3) The charge lasted a lot longer than I expected after using it daily. 3 months into using it, and nothing came on to tell me the battery was low. Then started to question if the indicator light was even working. Charged it for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;4) The three prongs started to rust. THIS IS NOT WATER PROVE. Once the rust started, it got harder and harder to put the brush-head on.&lt;br /&gt;5) Purchased an AUTHENTIC replacement brush-head from Sephora and noticed it was significantly SOFTER than the brush-head provided.&lt;br /&gt;6) AUTHENTIC brush DID NOT fit properly onto this unit, therefore didn&#x27;t oscillate much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Clarisonic and they said I have an counterfeit product because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Please, spend full price at Sephora, Ulta, Nordstroms for the real thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  Feedback from her is that she absolutely loves it.  I have used this product for about 2 years now, it not only cleanses my face better than anything I have ever used, but it helps control the exzema that erupts on my chin occasionally.</li>
    <li> Fake product so disappointed  Used it for a few days and broke  not under warranty because its fake SCAM!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This system arrives in Clarisonic packaging and mine worked great for three months. Then the power button broke and I could no longer turn the electronic brush on and off. I called the number on the original packaging to ask Clarisonic for a replacement. When they asked me to read them the serial number they informed me that they did NOT make the product I had, they said it was a &amp;#34;knock-off,&amp;#34; and they refused to honor their warranty. I don&#x27;t know if this was Clarisonic&#x27;s way of &amp;#34;punishing&amp;#34; me for not ordering directly from them, or if the product really was fake, but either way they would not honor a warranty. I called Amazon and they said I could return for a refund, but when I did, Amazon deducted a $20 &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34; from my refund. DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Love my new Mia! I really feel my skin is much cleaner using this product! Use it at least once a day, sometimes twice, and its great to use in the shower!</li>
    <li> This cleaner works very well. I received it for Christmas (it was on my wish list!) and I am very pleased with how well it works.</li>
    <li> This product got rid of my adult acne and people made comments about how much better my skin looks. UPDATE;This product only lasted 3 years. i think that $100 is too much for a product that lasts only three years, especially when there are electric facial cleansers for $20. All of a sudden the clarisonic justs pulsates when plugged in and won&#x27;t charge. I called customer service and they recommended charging it for 24 hours; it didn&#x27;t work. Customer service claimed that this probably happened because the clariso9nic should be charged after every other use and not when the low battery indicator comes on as I had been doing. Nowhere does it state this in the manual. I googled the problem and it seems many people have had to throw the clarisonic away for the same reason after 2 years.The company offered a 25% coupon, but i can&#x27;t pay another $75.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic Mia helped with my skin by brightening it and cleaning out my pores. The acne which used to ravage my skin cleared as well as some of the scares. I was skeptic before buying it, but really one must try it. The best part is that its water proof, and chargeable so no need to change batteries. For every charge you get 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!  I used the original for a few days (purchased from Sephora) and returned it because it was bulky and awkward.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!  Gets into the nooks and crannies...and not difficult to maneuver.  My skin looks great after just a week.  I use origins \\&quot;checks and balances\\&quot; with it and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  My only concern is that the battery life is 20 minutes, so, that&#x27;s 10 days at 2 cleanings/daily.  I&#x27;d prefer to just leave it in the shower!  Also works on European voltage, just get the pig-tail.  I&#x27;m stationed in Germany, so I can use it where ever I go!  - 50% reduction in blackheads on my nose  - 100% tighter skin...making makeup go on easily and stay on!  - within a week, almost all blemishes are gone on my chin    I&#x27;m fair, a mom, in my 30&#x27;s with sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me \\&quot;red\\&quot; or blotchy...  A must own!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now, once a day. I have very combination skin -- oily in parts, dry and flakey in others. I also have a tendency to break out and get black heads. Since using the Mia, I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in black heads, acne and my skin feels like a baby! It&#x27;s so soft and my makeup goes on seamlessly. Would totally recommend. Easy to use, quick, light, works like a charm. Will try to start using twice a day and see how that goes :)</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia is a fantastic little product; it does a wonderful job of cleansing the skin, unlike any other product I&#x27;ve encountered.  Since I was a teenager, I&#x27;ve been told that I have nice skin, but I always had tiny pimples around my nose and chin that really bothered me; I have been trying to clear them up for YEARS!! I was also recently upset by having enlarged pores on my forehead that came with getting a little older. No matter what I did, these skin problems really plagued me.  After less than a week of using the Mia, the blemishes cleared up (something I was unable to accomplish after years of trying many different skin care products) and my pores are decreasing in size. My daughter tells me my skin \\&quot;glows\\&quot;, our criteria for really great skin care.    It is a cleansing product, so I can&#x27;t imagine it woulld decrease wrinkles, but for what it is, it can&#x27;t be beat.  It is also light-weight and small enough that it travels really well. When I travel, I just like to take carry-on, so I am very selective in what I pack. The Mia is well worth the small amount of space and weight that it takes in my small suitcase.  I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia after reading hundreds of positive reviews.  My skin was very clear with zero breakouts, but since everyone was raving about it I thought maybe it would give me that extra glow.  Three days later I have an acne like breakout all over both of my cheeks and a little on my forehead.  It is HORRIBLE and I am distraught over it.  My skin was so clear and I had just had an esthetician comment on how beautiful it was and now it is completely RUINED!  So for me I&#x27;m going back to get my $150+ and keeping with the old saying of \\&quot;if it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought the Mia as a graduation present to myself.  Before using it I had very good skin with the occasional small pimple that went away in a few days with diligent application of benzoyl peroxide and some large pores on my nose and forehead.  The first time I used the clairisonic (for the recommended time and not applying too much pressure) my skin felt dry and tight, and I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  After a few days of using it 2x a day, I had a quite a few pimples crop up in places I never break out and some cystic ones as well.  My skin become an odd mix of tight and oily.  I&#x27;ve read of blogs about the clairisonic and I learned that a lot of people break out during the first few weeks of use, but it should get better.  Well, not for me.  My skin looks worse than it has in years and I am definitely returning it.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product because of the price, but i am so glad that I did! If you use liquid makeup you will notice that you don&#x27;t have to use as much after using this product, which is great. You will also notice just a difference in the way your face is. I have really oily skin and have a problem with blackheads and this little machine helps so much. I find that my face isn&#x27;t as oily later in the day and I am having less breakouts. I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days too. One of the best things about this is if I do get a pimple, after washing with the Mia, it helps it heal faster. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I thought I would always have bumps and whiteheads but honestly, with the clarisonic my skin has been looking much better. It&#x27;s a big enough difference that other people see it and asked me what I used so they can use it... It cleanses your skin really well. I use cetaphil face wash with it and that works well. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks so it hasn&#x27;t reached it&#x27;s full effect but I expect it to soon!! Also, I use the delicate brush since I have acne. DON&#x27;T use the normal brush with acne because it made me breakout badly. Now if you have normal skin then go ahead and use it. Plus the mia is really cute! So overall the clarisonic is a great product and I suggest using it!!</li>
    <li> I love my new Mia Clairisonic and wish I had just paid the price and gotten one years ago.  I am 62 years old with dry skin so I ordered replacements in \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; which is working better for me.  Glad I got the Mia because I like the compact size.  I use it twice a day and the charge lasts quite awhile.  It tells you when it is time to recharge.  Just get it!</li>
    <li> Hi, I bought a Mia Pink cleaner  which was defective. A loud noise and vibration when charging. The salesladies told they were &amp;#34;defective batch&amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;I exchanged it for another one,  then a third one, with always the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to buy one, but but to be sure I will not have to return it again. I already out of patience for what is supposed to be a quality item.&lt;br /&gt;Do Clarisonic have quality checks ? How come stores carry &amp;#34;batches of defective brushes&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reassuring me, I began to doubt in this product... Even tough I have already a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one at my other house.</li>
    <li> After every use I&#x27;m amazed of how smooth my skin is. i&#x27;ve had microdermabrasions before and my skin feels better with this brush.</li>
    <li> I loved it while it worked, but it died after 14 months. The warranty is only for 12 months, so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t splurge for the newer version, I don&#x27;t think I needed to and I&#x27;m really happy with it. I love the brush and the magnetic charger. I&#x27;m not sold on their cleanser though, it didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave the Carisonic a try as it had rave reviews. Unfortunately, it just did not work for me.  I used it for over 6 months hoping it would start to improve my skin, but it only made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, their customer service is fantastic. I purchased my unit on Amazon.com and after a few months it stopped charging.  No questions asked they shipped me a replacement and I received it within a few days.</li>
    <li> This works well! I love the way it makes your face feel, and exfoliating the skin. I registered it with the website, no problem, it&#x27;s the real deal from Clarisonic itself. So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> SO this apparently is not a real clarisonic. I called clarisonic to get the warranty and they said they did not manufacture the unit I received. So I am not sure what to do at this point. I am not sure if it going to do the same job as the real thing but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> It has cleared my skin up so much and made it feel so smooth and minimized my pores.  Definitely worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This item performs great.  Will it eventually get rid of small lines &amp; wrinkles?  I don&#x27;t know but I do know that my skin feels &amp; looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the MIA system for about 1 month know, with somewhat noticeable results. After using my skin feels very clean, and absorbs moisturizers better.  Face is left with more vibrant after cleansing.  Maybe with more use, the results will be more noticeable.</li>
    <li> So, about 5-6 years ago, my mom splurged on a Clarisonic Pro and I was ecstatic because I got to pay 25 bucks for my own brush head and still get the awesome benefits of the cool new gadget. Since it was still officially my mom&#x27;s, I used it off and on - and always felt a difference when I did use it consistently. Fast forward to a few months ago, I got married, moved away from my family...and the free Clarisonic access. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally talked myself into splurging and getting my own little beauty brush - especially when I saw I was saving about $20 over department/makeup stores! Love me some bargains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - Yes, it&#x27;s a sizable wad of cash to drop on a battery-operated face brush. I say if you have the means to do so, it is worth the investment. You only get one face and I know I&#x27;m taking care of it with the Clarisonic - and I do find that my products work better when I use it, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? - With all the life changes happening, my face (mainly forehead) went into a fit of breakouts...treatments for that left the rest of my face dry and scaly. By the time I received my Clarisonic, I was pretty bad. Total makeup removal &amp; sweet exfoliation to the rescue! This helped so much (clear and glowy once again!) and I fell in love with it all over again. (I should mention that my results have been in conjunction with cleaning up my diet, avoiding chemical-laden beauty products, and taking quality supplements. What&#x27;s going on with your skin is a reflection of what&#x27;s happening inside your body...so while the Mia brush greatly helps the outside, the inside has to get healthy, as well, for long-term results. ;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the other Clarisonic models - Having used the Pro, I can say I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. I always ignored the beeping and never fiddled with the settings/speed changes of the Pro, anyway. The Mia was less than half the price and a cute, small size awesome for travel. HOWEVER...and this is probably my one and only complaint - battery life is not awesome. You get 20 minutes of use out of a full charge. It shuts off after one minute, but I usually go for two - I usually use it morning and night, weighing in at 4-5 minutes a day. Basically, depending on how much I&#x27;m using it, I end up having to charge it every 3ish days and the magnetic pLink charger is not as convenient as plopping it in the cradle charger. BUT, this is really a small compromise for saving some major dough and I don&#x27;t mind that much...except when I forget to put it on the charger. :) (It does have a varying number of beeps go off when you first start the brush to let you know how much battery you have...so, I shouldn&#x27;t complain!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution - Don&#x27;t get carried away. :) I&#x27;ve always heard this and thought &amp;#34;yeah, yeah, that won&#x27;t happen to me&amp;#34; but you can accidentally over-exfoliate. It feels so good, sometimes I just wanna push the little button again and let my face stay on the magic carpet ride a little longer. Delayed ouch. It took a few days for my raw, red cheeks to fully recover. Now, sometimes I&#x27;ll only do it at night or skip a couple days...I try to pay attention to my skin&#x27;s mood a little more and not get distracted by the foamy massage-y goodness. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I alternate between the sensitive brush head and the acne-prone brush head. Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SUPER ITEM I USE EVERY NIGHT WHEN I SHOWER....MY FACE LOVES IT</li>
    <li> It is really great. I have bought one for myself, one for both my daughters, and one for my best friend. It is addictive. Sometimes  i will think I won&#x27;t use it at night, then I just can;t go to bed without using it. My daughter also bought one for her daughter.</li>
    <li> After using the Olay Pro spinning brush for 2 years, I finally asked my boyfriend for the Clarisonic for Christmas. Despite his disbelief in the powers of a &amp;#34;face brush&amp;#34;, he came through and gave me the Mia 2 this year. I have been using it for a week, and so I figured it was time to do a proper review.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, anyone who says that the Olay brush is a comparable product either has not used both of these brushes or is lying to you. There is simply no comparison. The Mia just glides over your skin as it does it&#x27;s magic, whereas with the Olay brush you really have to press into the skin in order to feel it working. Additionally, the Mia has timed cycles that prompt you when it is time to change to another region of the face.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin looks and feels so much more clear and clean after using this! Immediately after, my skin feels as smooth as glass and looks glowing, albeit slightly red (the redness fades in less than 30 minutes). I use the sensitive brush head because that is what came with the device, even though I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. One week after starting using the Mia twice a day, my pores appear smaller, and there is definitely less &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in them. I used to say my nose looked like a strawberry (ewww, I know) because of my huge clogged pores, but this magic little machine seems to have started dislodging whatever was trapped in there.&lt;br /&gt;The fine lines on my forehead also seem to be getting less deep and smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;Two years of using the Olay brush on a regular basis doesn&#x27;t compare to the results I have seen in one week of using the Clairsonic Mia 2. Also, the charger is really cool! It is magnetic, so no worries about getting water in the device. I leave mine in the shower on a slatted rack to dry out between uses.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to graduating to the acne clearing brush heads, but in the meantime, this is one of the best gifts I have ever received and I am so happy I asked for it. At $150, this is an investment, but it is one you will probably have for many years. Another bonus is that you can use a basic cleanser with it. I was buying a special exfoliating cleanser to use with my Olay brush, but now I realize that I can use any old cleanser and the Mia will do all the work. The Olay brush will now be relegated to my elbows and chest area!this is an investment, but it is one you will probably have for many years.

    <li> It stopped charging after 14 months. I would have thought  it would last longer, since they are not cheap. I was told by customer service the warranty is only good for one year. BEWARE! I will not buy another one.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this.  Got it for my wife, and the first one did not work out of the box.  It did not charge at all.  The second worked for less than 6 months and died.  Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I just turned 28 and decided that I was going to finally make a commitment to my skin...I have always been very lackadaisical about washing my face before bed (in the shower--not a problem) and I know that as I age sleeping with make up on is only going to make the aging process worse.  So I asked for a Clarisonic Mia for my birthday.  Best present ever!  I have used it faithfully every day since receiving it and can say my face has never looked-or felt-cleaner!  I wish I had one years ago!  If you are considering a Clarisonic purchase of any kind-BUY IT!  You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and it worked great for my skin for about 6 months and then the button became hard to push until eventually it quit turning on all together.  For a $100 I would hope it would last longer than that!  Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because of the rave reviews but was skeptical when it was delivered and actually saw how it worked.  So I decided to conduct my own unscientific experiment - Clarisonic Mia on half my face, the usual washcloth on the other half.  Thirty days later, no noticeable difference.  I&#x27;ve continued to use the Mia (full face) for another 45 days; still no noticeable difference.  Maybe different faces get different results; I happen to be extremely oily with very mild acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;s convenient.  Feels good.  Leaves your skin feeling extra smooth (but that only last for a few minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No noticeable change in skin, pores, oil, or acne.  Overpriced for what it gives you, a $3 washcloth seems to do the same thing.  Replacement brush heads are very expensive.  Charge time is nuts, it takes 18 hours to charge, that&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion.  Since I&#x27;ve already spent the money, I&#x27;ll continue to use it but I&#x27;ll never replace it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.  I think if you are somebody who gently massages your cleanser into your face, you might see a difference using this.  But if you are somebody who gives your face more of a scrub, this product won&#x27;t do anything for you.</li>
    <li> Caveat: I bought this product yesterday from Nordstrom but my experience with the product has already been amazing. I used the Mia this morning for the first time and my skin is already glowing! It has made my face so incredibly soft and glowing. Now I have never really had a huge problem with acne, just a few troubled spots here and there, but have had a problem with my skin being both oily and dry and just overall dull. After using the Mia, my skin looks visibly brighter and glowing! I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face in the mirror.    I am still wearing make up, mineral power, to cover up the unevenness, however, I look forward to the day, in the next few weeks, where I can go sans make up!    I&#x27;ll be sure to rewrite my review in a few weeks with my updates. I just felt it was necessary to share my positive experience.</li>
    <li> This little machine has made my face feel cleaner than ever before and I am well over 60.  I may not look any better, but I surely like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. In fact, I got one for my mom the week after I got my own.     When I have first debating over this product, I was on the fence about forking out so much money for it, but after hundreds of rave reviews from users on Sephora, here, and my personal friends, I decided to give it a try.     I am SOOO glad I did. This product is really life-changing! It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s promised to be and more. After using it just for a day (AM and PM), my skin was glowing and looked noticably healthier.     Also, I have noticed that my products have worked better since using Clarisonic!   Yes, it is expensive, but if I&#x27;m going to spend so much on my skin products (moisturizers, eye creams, exfoliants, anti-aging creams) every year, I want to make sure I get the most of them by having the cleanest skin possible.     Everytime I use this, I feel like my skin can breathe (no need to get expensive facials anymore!). I have also noticed my blemishes heal about three times as fast as they did before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since high school but it for some reason got much worse when I got to college - bad hormonal acne around my chin now for almost 10 years. I don&#x27;t think I can COMPLETELY credit my mia with my clear skin but I think it played a huge part. It was introduced to me when I got an acne peel. The aesthetician used it to clean my face prior. I was intrigued but held off because the price seemed a bit much. Eventually I purchased it (I believe retail is around $150. I found it for $120) and initially just used it with cetaphil. Immediately my skin felt so much smoother. Prior to buying it I felt like I needed to wash my face multiple times and still could not get all my makeup off. This made my skin feel so much cleaner. Since my purchase I have added other things - I just got my second obagi blue radiance peel at a doctor&#x27;s office and I have been using the obagi clenziderm skin care system. All of these things are on the pricier side but after 10 years of using multiple things that didn&#x27;t work I was tired of wasting money on cheaper options. You have to make the investment if you want to see improvement. Like I said I am using more than just my mia to get the skin I always dreamed I could but it&#x27;s a BIG part of my improvement and I look forward to washing my face everyday bc I love using it!</li>
    <li> I have always heard good things about the clarisonic brushes, but never really understood the point in buying something that was worth over $100. I mean honestly, can&#x27;t we all just take just a random soft brush, apply facial cleanser and do the work ourselves? I took the chance and bought one anyway to try out this \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; cleaning tool.     I was impressed after the first time using it. I didn&#x27;t really have bad skin to begin with, but I definitely felt a difference after using it. My face felt like it was cleaned to the extreme and refreshed. Skin was super smooth and didn&#x27;t experience any of the initial breakouts that most of the other people experienced after the first use.    All in all, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone, whether you have bad skin or good skin it&#x27;s definitely a product everyone should have.</li>
    <li> When I went on line to register the unit and claim my $25 in coupons for future products I was told the&lt;br /&gt;item is a counterfit!! I called Clarisonic directly and they verified that the unit WAS NOT THEIR&amp;#34;S!&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to the seller and he ignored me.&lt;br /&gt;I am disputing the sale with my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;If I have to return it, I want the seller to pay for that!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very angry</li>
    <li> I love my new Clarisonic Mia.  It was affordable, is easy to use, and, best of all, works great!  I&#x27;ve been using the Mia for less than 4 weeks, but can already see great results.  I get a facial monthly, and did not expect to see much of a noticeable difference in the clarity of my skin.  However, my skin has a new glow!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those who have had acne issues.  I understand it is also good for lessening wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My wife is the owner of a Clairisonic PRO. She used this device for a short time and things were fine. We moved and the device stayed packed for a while. After she decided to begin using it again it did not work properly. She thought it may be the over priced $25 head so she asked for one for X-mas. When she went to change the head the part of the device that holds the brush head came off with the brush. Now it no longer works properly at all. When she called Clairisonic she sat on hold for 24 minutes before I told her to hand up. I called back and selected the option for skin care professional or doctors office and was put right through to a customer service rep that handles professionals. The rep informed my wife that since it is no longer under warranty they could replace it for a mere $140. Then she was transferred to the customer service for retail customers and found herself on hold longer than what anyone would find acceptable. This product is in no way worth the money and the poor customer service will leave you with the feeling that you have been ripped off. There are other products out there that cost much less that do the very same thing.</li>
    <li> I lightly used my Mia over the last two years(maybe once a month at most), and not at all for the last 3 as I needed to get a new brush. When I finally charged it 24 hours and got a new brush, the cycle stopped early. I put it back on the charger and it constantly beeps. I call customer service who told me I was using the mia wrong because I didn&#x27;t charge the product 24/7!! &amp;#34;it needs constant charge to work properly and works the opposite of most electronics!&amp;#34; There are a ton of questions on the actual Clarisonic website about this problem and they only take care of the ones that luckily failed within the one year warranty. When so many people complain of the same problem, I think you should check your manufacturing processes. They also recalled a batch once in 2007 for a similar issue.  All the &amp;#34;great service&amp;#34; Clarisonic rep could do was offer the mia at a &amp;#34;reduced&amp;#34; price. Why would i continue to buy a product that lasts two years or less, especially with my light usage?</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic website says:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Clarisonic product warranties are only valid when products are purchased from an authorized retailer. Please be aware that if you purchase from an institution not listed as authorized the product(s) may be counterfeit, diverted or expired. They may not be safe to use or perform as tested and Clarisonic will not take any responsibility for the purchaser&#x27;s dissatisfaction.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Then it says:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Please be aware that online auction and marketplace sites (such as Amazon, eBay and Groupon) are not authorized retailers of Clarisonic products.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder whether an &amp;#34;authorized retailer&amp;#34; is one who agrees to some kind of price-fixing arrangement.  Nevertheless, Amazon and Clarisonic should work this out so that the warranty is valid.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that it doesn&#x27;t time usage. ie.30 secea for forehead and chin etc. I had a full sized clarasonic and it bit the dust. This is a replacement and I thought the size and charger would be the main difference. Just disappointed. I thought that was the main difference between clarasonic and other less expensive products on the market</li>
    <li> I was definitely cautious to spend the money on this item because there are other other systems on the market for much less, but I am very glad I went with the Mia.  It is easy to use and has already made my skin look and feel better after only 5 days.  It is amazing to see how much cleaner my skin is after using this product, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product come out, the first thing I thought was why? Why would someone pay over $100 for a face cleansing brush that spins, when a facial scrub or an ordinary face brush would do the same thing? Then I started seeing the reviews on Youtube saying how well it cleans and exfoliates. I noticed that even when I use a scrub, there&#x27;s still a lot of makeup left on my face after washing. So I went ahead and bought it at Sephora, thinking I probably just wasted a lot of money. I tried it that night, and I was really impressed. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as harsh as using a scrub, and it gently massaged while cleaning and exfoliating. Afterwards, I didn&#x27;t see any traces of foundation and my skin was glowing. I felt like my moisturizer absorbed better as well. The next day when I applied my makeup, it went on a lot smoother and didn&#x27;t look as cakey, and I didn&#x27;t notice any flaky patches of skin I had gotten before using the Clarisonic. I&#x27;ve been using it almost everyday for the past 6 months and I can honestly say it was well worth the $150 I had originally paid for it. I rarely get breakouts, and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin. I feel like if I go a day without using it, my skin just feels gross and dull. Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> Wife uses it every week. Good price vs. department stores, and definitely helps smooth skin for a more radiant look.</li>
    <li> After two years my wife still loves it. Just recently she started complaining the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for a month like it used to. That&#x27;s not bad though, not many batteries can withstand repeated use.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to buy this MIA last December but it was broken and not charging within 6 months. Looks like it&#x27;s not under warranty either because when I bought it I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying from an unauthorized retailer. What a bummer. Sucky skin here I come.</li>
    <li> I had been reading about this device for years.  I finally decided to make the purchase.  Over the past two weeks, I have noticed a huge difference in the feel of my skin.  Granted, my complexion does not seem to have made any visible improvement, my skin feels amazing.  And as the other reports have said, I use less product and have noticed a smoother application for my makeup.  I have extreme hyperpigmentation that has resulted from previous breakouts.  Wherever I breakout, I scar.  This product helps to control breakouts (although I do still breakout) and it helps me to heal faster.  I was going to reorder the facial wash that came with it, but apparently the company has changed the formula and it is getting horrible reviews online - consistenly 1 star.  So, I purchased the Clanique system instead and I am really enjoying combining use of my Clarisonic Mia with their products.  A 5-star experience for me!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a rotating brush unfortunately this one vibrates only. It feels like a skin massager only. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love love love it !!!!!! This is the best thing I have ever bought. It has made my skin young again.</li>
    <li> The product as a whole is very nice, however, when the battery dies - that&#x27;s it.  They made it where you cannot change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;At least it lasted for a few years.  But I&#x27;m not willing to spend that much money AGAIN just for a battery.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic stopped working after a year, I am soooo incredibly disappointed. It will not charge and just gave out on me!! What a SHAM! I seriously regret buying this on amazon because at least a store would have allowed me to replace the product! WASTE of money and will NOT repurchase this garbage even though it was awesome when it worked.</li>
    <li> great little machine... has failed twice but seller replaces immediately</li>
    <li> Charger stop working. Got new one new. Won&#x27;t buy again from them.</li>
    <li> After five months of using the Clairsonic Mia every day, I have experienced no improvement in the condition of my skin, so it&#x27;s now been relegated to the closet.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles from beauty products, but I expect to see SOME noticeable difference from a $100 device.  I&#x27;m unlucky enough to have oily, acne-prone skin that also gets dry and flaky.  I have to exfoliate my skin with a wet washcloth prior to cleansing in order to reduce flakiness.  The first time I used the Mia, it was obvious that it would provide nowhere near the level of exfoliation that my washcloth provided, and it did not help with flakiness at all, so I continued to use the washcloth first.  Because the exfoliation from the Mia is so minimal, it did nothing for my acne, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I would give 3 stars to a product about which I feel neutral (2.5, if possible), but $100 is too much to spend for neutral.  The only benefit I can find to this device is that it forces you to cleanse for a full minute, and as result, I&#x27;ve become more conscious of the time when I wash by hand.</li>
    <li> The first time is used the Clarisonic Mia I loved the clean feeling my skin had.I&#x27;ve now had the the Mia since march 2012 and it will not hold a charge and when I put it on the charger it&#x27;s on. I can&#x27;t turn it on or off.The only time it will come on is when it&#x27;s on the charger. It also dried my skin to the point where my nose would shed and this is after I used a skin moisturizer. I am sad but I will be returning the Mia to JCPenny and get my $126dollars back.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m NOT the kind to spend $100 on a face scrubber but this recommendation came from my spa.  i&#x27;ve never had better skin since using this, and trust me about having skin issues.  i use morning and night and the results were evident within a day.  i would never use with a lower quality product, rather a good spa product like Aveda.  AND, after use it&#x27;s designed to open your pores so don&#x27;t just use and then not moisturize or anything because you will dry out.  again, use a good quality product after and you will be one happy camper.  i&#x27;m not far away from simply not using make-up at all...it&#x27;s THAT awesome!</li>
    <li> I have had my Mia for 6 months. At first, like others, it did bring up a little more acne while it cleaned out my skin. Now my skin looks younger and my own mother asked me what I was doing since it looked so much fresher!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months using it every other day it suddenly had a problem charging. I called customer service and they are sending out a new unit. Make sure to register your product!  Poor customer service is a deal breaker for me but now after such great care I am a lifetime customer. I am even having withdrawls since I have to wait for the new one to be delivered!</li>
    <li> I think this product probably best suited for those with a skin issue.  I read reviews about it and being a little OCD about keeping my face clean I was mortified to think that there was a possibility that my face was not as clean as it could be.  I asked several ladies at several different cosmetic counters what they thought of it and with the exception of one who said if you have a problem then use it they all had raving reviews and used it themselves.  It has been several weeks now and I can&#x27;t honestly say I see any difference at all.  My advice is to save your money unless you have a specific problem/issue.  I also note that the charge will only last me 2 weeks or 14 uses, not the 20 they claim and the annoying thing is that you cannot use the device while it is charging.  The only thing I can say visibly improved my skin was when I started using Reversa products.</li>
    <li> Would never purchase a Clarisonic again. Spent $100 and the device no longer holds a charge. Called Clairsonic to see if they could repair and the best the could over was 25% off a new purchase. Why would I want to waste $75 dollars on something that won&#x27;t even last a year. Terrible company...terrible device. I will be going to one of their competitors.</li>
    <li> irritated my skin maybe its just to harsh for me</li>
    <li> For those with acne prone, thin, sensitive skin - I would NOT recommend this tool. I had terrible irritation problems with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I took the plunge and purchased this. Yes, it is a bit pricy, but worth every penny. I heard of the Clarisonic a while ago and recently decided to see what the hype was all about. I read so many positive reviews. So here is mine. After only 4 days using the Mia I can see and feel the difference. I am using the deep pore brush. I have oily skin and using this my skin stays soft and clean without feeling greasy. When I cleanse at night and wake up in the morning my skin is still oil free. It&#x27;s true that your skin lotion absorbs better too! I have been washing with clinique facial soap for years and using the same wash with the clarisonic gives a totally different result. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long term use will help reduce pores and help with age spots. Also I always felt the little black and white heads on my nose and now it&#x27;s so smooth. I LOVE USING THE MIA CLARISONIC. I wanted to point out that the other clarisonic products that cost more, like the Original Clarisonic and Mia2 have more options like they beep when you need to switch areas on your face and have more than one speed. But honestly you don&#x27;t need that to get the same benefits. Sure you may want the extra perks if you can afford it, but if not the Mia will definitely not disapoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;It is 8 months later and I still love my MIA just as much and yes it did help with my age spots! Also I don&#x27;t need to scrub and mask anymore so I don&#x27;t need to spend money on ton&#x27;s of products just facial soap. This really cleans your face and is not harsh. If I washed my face without it I would not feel clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this upon a friend&#x27;s recommendation to take the place of more expensive regular diamond peels, and I am very happy with it. It works best with smooth cleansers, making it a great option for dry skin. The improvement in pores, fine wrinkles, and overall skin quality is almost immediate; makes you realize how badly we clean our faces! I keep mine in the shower so I don&#x27;t get lazy. Just be diligent about cleaning the brush to maintain the unit, and I wish the charging time wasn&#x27;t so long (18 hours), but otherwise, this product saves you a lot on facials and visits to the dermatologist!</li>
    <li> I love this product i had very large pores and they are so much smaller i love it. I can honestly say it does work with my skin. I get how it doesnt work on anyone but i bought it and took a chance cause its a little more expensive and i love it. I just wish it was alittle cheaper but still great for a gift.</li>
    <li> My wife is really happy with this product.  It is easy to use and she has seen nice skin improvement after only a few applications.</li>
    <li> Wonderful machine.  My face never felt better or cleaner!!  I would recommend it for anyone.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a cord (attached) makes it even easier to use.</li>
    <li> I am really into gadgets but not when my face is concerned. I get breakouts and my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle different things tampering with it. However, I have been wearing makeup a lot more and want to make sure my skin is as clean as it can be. I use a organic lavender, milk cleanser with it and  my skin feels so wonderful! I also use Simple night cream and can honestly say I saw results immediately. My skin is silkier and smoother. This is really a must have for my skin care regiment. I just have to try the different heads to see what is best for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I am enjoying the Clarasonic Mia. My skin has never been cleaner and smoother. I have not stopped telling everyone about the fabulous results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Mia for three months now and the other day my husband (who never notices anything!) remarked how good my skin was looking.  I am 34 years old and I must say that my skin has never looked better.  All through my teens, 20s, and 30s I have battled with zits, blackheads, and large pores.  In my 30s sun damage in the form of brown spots and wrinkles has appeared as well.  I usually wear foundation and powder to cover up all this but lately, I haven&#x27;t had to.  I still don&#x27;t have radiant beautiful skin (and unfortunately never will!) so the Clarisonic doesn&#x27;t deliver miracles, but if it&#x27;s improvement you&#x27;re after I think the device definitely delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have bi-monthly facials with extraction because my pores were very clogged and I used to break out pretty badly right before my period.  Now that I&#x27;ve started using the Clarisonic once a day I&lt;br /&gt;- no longer have major breakouts(not even pre-menstrual).  If a zit does pop up it is small and will dissappear within a day.&lt;br /&gt;-my pores are still there but they are cleaner and I have about 70% less blackheads than before.&lt;br /&gt;-my skin feels softer and smoother and the sun damage is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;-a rough patch I had on my cheek has also smoothened out a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the cleanser that came with it but I use Garnier Skin Naturals Pure 3 in 1 Wash.  I also only use the CLarisonic once a day, instead of the recommended twice a day, and I think that is probably more than enough for most people.  You don&#x27;t want to dry your skin out or scrub too much of that natural oil away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an expensive device but now I no longer feel the need to have a $60 facial every two months so I am actually saving money AND have better skin on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have good skin to start out with it&#x27;s probably not worth the splurge, but if you&#x27;ve been battling like I have, the Clarisonic Mia is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! love the way it cleanses my skin leaving it squeaky clean! Great product! Definately recommended! Clean away people!</li>
    <li> I have had my Mia since January and love it. I was skeptical since I have rosacea but my dermatologist said she also uses it for her rosacea. I must say my skin has never looked better, no more dry or flakey areas and I can wear makeup withou it looking crusty on the dry areas.  It is not drying at all. My skin is so clean and I use cetaphil antibacterial soap with my Mia which also helps my rosacea. I am happy, happy, happy!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to my friends...it makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed.  Don&#x27;t know how I ever got along w/o my Mia!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Really gets most of the gunk out. I wish I would&#x27;ve known that they came out with a Mia 2 before I bought this though. I usually get the replacement brushes on groupon</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Clarisonic Mia! I&#x27;ve had a problem with really deep hormonal acne for the last two or three years. And even when my acne started to go away, there was always a buildup in my skin that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. But the Mia has helped to break up the congestion and smooth out my skin, making it look more fresh and brighter. Definitely a worthwhile investment!</li>
    <li> Fortunately Amazon makes it very easy to return defective items.  I love the Clarisonic Mia, and this would have been my second unit. But it didn&#x27;t work.  It wouldn&#x27;t charge, no matter how long I left it in.  :(</li>
    <li> My face gets really clean, I love how well it exfoliates without feeling like your skin is raw afterwards!  Love it!</li>
    <li> You should ask your derm about a prescription called Spironolactone. You sounded just like me until I began taking that.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Not only is it adorable and the perfect size for travel, it works like a charm! I have been using it for about 2 years along with Chanel Mousse Douceur Cleanser and I have only had 4 zits. I love it and I think it is a skincare item every woman should have!</li>
    <li> Clarisonic is the very last products that I chose for my facial.  Experimenting with Chemical peel, I wondered why alcohol soaked cotton balls stains when wiping skin of freshly washed face.  Used Nutrogina Wave Sonic, it is the same.  It seems like nothing can beat Clarisonic, but is it true...?  I chose this for only cleaning purpose but for &amp;#34;a 61% better absorption of Vitamin C&amp;#34; as the maker claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to know how true it is about removing makeup more, I did an experiment.  First, used makeup wipe, then washed manually as I usually do, and wiped with a clean towel.  Then, I used Clarisonic for a min. to wash again.  I knew it does the work when I see soap foam left on the brush being not white but the color of my foundation.  The brush that I thought it would be rough is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  It feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Clarisonic while using facial steamer (Panasonic NanoE) and Super Hyaluronic Acid massage/ cleanser cream (Naris Up).  My routine after cleansing is applying Vitamin C serum, Super Hyaluronic serum while using  micro-current (NuFace), and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement in my skin almost immediately.  This great device is gentle, but effectively cleans my skin leaving it fresh, smooth and much cleaner than just cleansing lotions alone.  Nice and compact for travelling too.  I would totally recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted! I heard so many great things about the Clarisonic so I decided to try one! I am so glad I got the Mia because it is perfect size and I can&#x27;t imagine how big the regular is if the mia is already big. After using the Mia for the first time, my skin was instantly smooth! Love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, I kid you not. My kid said Mom you have no wrinkles after it used the Mia twice. She did not know I purchased it!  I am not a sponsor for Clarisonic products to let you know. I have had facials all over the world, and this brush works wonders.  In two days it has diminished sunspots, dry skin and toned up my face. The skin is clearer and softer. I love it. I purchased the  Deep clean brush, but for most people the brush that comes with it will do especially if you want to use this device twice a day.    I did also purchase the olay brush to compare. The Olay brush is very good too but works by mechanical spinning, versus the Mia which is the sonic technology. For the price the Olay does a great job and where it beats the mis is the size. The Olay brush is half the size of the Mia and works better for around the nose. If blackheads and clogged ported in the nose area are your biggest concern, get the Olay.    If you want anti aging, and sunspot removal get the Mia. Look at it this way. I figure two facials in NYC downtown are at least sixty dollars...I can have a facial everyday with this gizmo.    Tip! Use any moisturizer for the skin, it can be inexpensive. Coat your face with cream, wet the brush and use the Mia!  Works super well.    I wish I purchased this sooner! Would love for Clarisonic to make one even smaller Olay size and then it would be super great for travel and small areas.</li>
    <li> If you don’t want to spend the extra money on the professional grade version this is a good alternative.  High quality at a good price point.</li>
    <li> I was vaguely familiar with Clarisonic. I figured like most new toys, I&#x27;d use it for a week and never get the consistent use that would justify the expense. Well, I was having a great beauty shopping day and decided to take the plunge, in spite of my previous bad tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it takes three weeks to form a habit, so I think I can say I&#x27;m hooked on Clarisonic. I love my Mia! I am excited about washing my face now (even at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my best skincare investment ever! It has made me a reformed occasional-sleeping-in-makeup person. But more importantly, it is really getting my skin cleaner than I&#x27;ve ever done alone. I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and in just three weeks, I&#x27;m starting to get rid of those entrenched blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin with large pores. I started with the sensitive brush. I think I would&#x27;ve gotten faster results with the normal brush, which I started using this week. My deep pore brush is on the way and I can hardly wait until it arrives. I think it will be just the ticket. I had to learn to think of this as a way to help cleanse my skin better, it would not be an instant replacement for exfoliation. I wonder with extended use, if it could be a replacement.  I&#x27;ll update the review as time progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is super easy to use. Wet your face, wet the brush, apply cleanser to either your face or the brush and go. Its self timer is set for one minute. Until I step up to the deep pore brush, two minutes seem to work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recharging is a snap (almost literally because of the magnetic charger). The unit buzzes to let you know when it needs to be juiced up. If I were being picky, my one complaint would be the 18-hr charge time. That is ridiculously long.</li>
    <li> This item was a fake Mia, nails rusted after using for a couple months. Model number on the bottom was also a fake after talking to the Clarisonic company.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia is a great skin cleansing system.  I purchased this for a friend of mine, and I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months.  My skin is clean and clear, and it&#x27;s easy to use!  Love it, love it!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter has wanted one of these for a long time. I decided to get her one for her Christmas and she loves it! She used it last night for the first time and she said it made her skin feel so soft! I had to feel her face several times. It&#x27;s a gift hit for certain!</li>
    <li> I was a bit iffy buying my Mia at first because of the price and because I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react to it, since it usually dries out and acts really crazy when the weather gets cold. It has been amazing though; my skin is softer and smoother than it has been in a LOOOONG time. I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying it from Sephora or the actual Clarisonic website. The package came to me completely destroyed. The outside of the box looked as if it was smashed inside out. The actual Clarisonic, as well as the cleanser looked dirty. There were some sort of black streaks all over it. There was noticeable rusting on the screws behind the brush. Did Amazon really just sent me a used face cleansing brush....?</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to my Mia and so disappointed after using it. The bristles of the brush do not ROTATE but VIBRATE. I had purchased a battery operated fifteen dollar model from Walgreens which vibrates. Thought I would upgrade with the Clarisonic which plugs in and was presented as having a ROTATING brush. Not so. I even got the opinion of five other people. The Neutragena fifteen dollar model even vibrates more than this product.  I tried to call the company, but after waiting several minutes gave up for the third time and called Amazon for a return. Thanks Amazon! This is one of THe many reasons I shop with you. Joan</li>
    <li> Once my skin turned 50+ I realized I could no longer get away with the washcloth and a promise so I began my search. I have been using my Mia once a day and later twice a day since I got it. It makes my face feel and look much cleaner and is also good for gentle exfoliation without the drying effect of some of the \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; types of machines. My skin looks more radiant and I can see the gradual improvement. It also feels wonderful to use it with its gentle massaging effect. The charger is the easiest thing I have ever used and is much more water friendly than any plug system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used it with my previous facial cleanser. Later I tried it with the Clarisonic foaming gel cleanser that comes with it. I like both for different reasons and use one in the am and the other in the pm. However, if you are using topical spot treatments with stronger products, you should use them afterwards to avoid spreading those all over your face. Thanks to Clarisonic my search is over!</li>
    <li> I just love my Clarisonic. It is one of the best things I have purchased. I do not even need my toner any longer saving me money, whoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia for 2 weeks, and my skin is so clear!  I have had large pores since junior high (I am 32 now), and now my pores are hardly visible.  My skin has never looked this good!</li>
    <li> I will purchase this product again if I have to.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for little more than 3 weeks, and it really helps you clean your face better.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to try this product by my cousin and I have to say I love it! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and firm, great product.</li>
    <li> First day and I can tell my skin feels cleaner! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this it is better than I expected. Its size is perfect and I can tell it helped my skin absorb moisturizer better.</li>
    <li> The serial number ... When u register ur clarisonic it tells u the serial number doesn&#x27;t match... Even do it does work</li>
    <li> A couple issues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) clarisonic company issue - I registered this item with the code on the product with clarisonic for a coupon.  There was no problem doing this, however over a month later when I realized that there was rust under the brush head.  I contacted clarisonic and they said that they did not believe it was authentic.  My complaint to them was that they had allowed me to register it, which in my mind means that they are believe it to be theirs and will cover the warranty.  Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) I am not completely sure it is a fake but clarisonic won&#x27;t stand by the warranty.  It may have something to do with it being sold by an unauthorized dealer.  They did say that the numer associated with the item did not fit their batch code,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, amazon was amazing and allowed me to return the item!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a new one straight from the company...I will be interested to see what differences, if any, that I find.</li>
    <li> I should say first that I purchased this item straight from the Clarisonic website. I had read too many reviews of people getting ripped off with bogus products that don&#x27;t work when you register it with Clarisonic, normally the bogus ones don&#x27;t come with the trial soap, so I made my order with the company. It came with trial-size soap (which is VERY nice) and two brush heads, a deep pore and a normal brush. It also came with a handsome carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final straw happened a couple months ago when a colleague thought that I was sweating.  It was my oily face, not sweat!  I have tried every product every known - even that Buff Puff from the 1980s. Every time I see a commercial about the latest face wash that promises an oil-free day, I purchase it and I&#x27;m always, always disappointed.  After that comment I decided to buy the Clarisonic; I had been hearing raves about this product ever since it came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second use, I noticed the difference (I use the deep pore brush).  I rinsed off my face and in the split second that I looked at my wet face in the mirror before I toweled off, my face looked like there was a light bulb above it.  It was so clean and glowing!  My goodness my complexion was beautiful! What on earth has been in my pores for decades that only now my skin glows???  My boyfriend touches my face and he constantly comments on how smooth it is.  For the very first time ever, my face stayed oil free ALL DAY.  Why didn&#x27;t get this years ago? I can finally wear makeup without the fear of it soaking into my pores and looking like a shiny ball of grease.&lt;br /&gt;This is the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; part - I have to moisturize for the first time in my life.  After a week or so of use, my skin began to get very dry to the point that I had dry patches on my cheeks below my eyes.  I admit that I used the Clarisonic twice a day so maybe I overdid it, so now I&#x27;ve gone down to once a day and I moisturize with Alpha Hydroxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get breakouts once ina while so obviously I&#x27;ve got other things going on, but a dab of bag balm under a band-aid for two days zaps it right away. I digress - if you are on the edge about this produce, I say GET IT.  Oh and since the one I purchased came with two brush heads, my boyfriend uses the other one.  He uses it before he shaves and his shave is so close now, like baby skin.  He was normally a soap only kind of guy, so he gets a big kick out of it and announces that he has \\&quot;exfoliated\\&quot; for the day.</li>
    <li> My clarsonic quit turning on after having it for three months. I called the 1-800 number for clarsonic, and after giving them the serial numbers on the device, they told me it was not an original. I&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy from this site again.</li>
    <li> There is a scam on Amazon where sellers that are posing as Clarisonic dealers but indeed they are selling fakes. I bought my \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot; from RobRobbie Robin (even though it looked like it was being sold by Clarisonic) and it broke. When calling Clarisonic to find out about the warranty they told me it was a fake and that Amazon is not an authorized seller of Calrisonic product and that Amazon was aware of the vendors selling fakes. I would not purchase a Clarisponic product from Amazon dealers. Amazon&#x27;s customer service response thus far has been great they have sent a label for the item to be picked tomorrow for return. They have already processed the return. As always Amazon provides good customer service but I wish these dealers could be screened before selling on the Amazon platform.</li>
    <li> I had the product for three months when it stopped working. It just would not turn on. I contacted clarisonic and they asked me to remove the brushes and tell them what I saw. I saw three metal prongs that were rusted. The representative told me that I did not have a clarisonic then because their product does not rust!!  Stay away from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> .This really gives me a great face wash at the end of the day.  This is my 3rd one I have bought.  Two were gifts, highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> i LOVE LOVE LOVE the Clarisonic product, i dropped my original handle 6 months ago and finally saved up enough to buy one again. I am only rating so low because my kit did not include the trial sized cleanser like advertised so I am very disappointed with ProTronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the product a 5/5... ProTronics a 0/5.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy, it works very well and i use it almost every day now&lt;br /&gt;skin looks and feels so much cleaner and brighter, its worth the investment in taking time on your cleansing regime!</li>
    <li> After 2 months my Mia stopped working. I assumed it needed to be charged. I plugged it in and charged it overnight and it still didn&#x27;t work. I tried 3 different outlets but none of them worked. I called Clarisonic customer service and they said it was \\&quot;not a valid lot code\\&quot; and therefore not a valid product. Amazon is not an authorized dealer and have been selling  knock-offs. This is the first problem I&#x27;ve ever had with Amazon. I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the Mia is a great product but do not buy this one! It will break and you will have to return it. Save yourself the trouble.</li>
    <li> This Pink Clarisonic Mia  was for my younger daughter and she is very happy with the fact it is rechargeable!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!!!! So in love that I had to get my mom and sister to join the team. I am the type who would go for facials once every 2 weeks and so far, this product has replaced my daily spending on facials-- highly recommend!</li>
    <li> it makes my skin cleaner and softer.. it cleans my skin so deep&lt;br /&gt;i used it only after foundations.. first using makeup wipes then clarisonic&lt;br /&gt;oh my skin like babies afterwards lool&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> Thanks to clarisonic, I really feel like my acne no longer flares up like it used to. My pores also stay clearer longer. When I skip days and forget to use my clarisonic, pores become clogged and I can feel the bumps forming again. Now I&#x27;m scared to go without my Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> I love my Mia! It has changed the way I feel about my skin.  I have adult acne and this has made my skin supple and smooth. My esthetician even asked what I was doing different. I recommend that you first apply a pea to pearl sized amount of your cleanser all over your face and neck, then use your Mia to scrub. You will just waste your cleanser if you apply it directly to the scrub brush. This is a must have for thorough skin care system.  I am just so happy that I finally have been able to use little to no foundation for the first time in my life! I am not embarrassed anymore!</li>
    <li> I bought my Mia after much research and debate, and finally decided to take the plunge. My skin did break out the first 3 weeks *very badly* but I was expecting this and pushed through. It has now been about 5 weeks of nightly use and my skin is not totally clear, but it feels very smooth and I have very few blackheads. I cleanse with Purity facewash by Philosophy before using my Mia to remove most of my makeup and then I use the Purity again with my Mia.</li>
    <li> my sister in law got me to try this and i&#x27;m so glad i did my face as never looked so good. i&#x27;m 30 and have been getting little lines where i wrinkle my forehead all the time anyway they&#x27;re gone. yeah i said gone i can only figure because they are fine lines not deep set in but even so i would think it would help diminish deep set lines too. i use my own cleanser YES to.... and love the combination. it really cleans my face fantastic i did a test to see when i just wash my face with my hands and then with the clarisonic i used a cotton ball with toner on it to see if it pulled any dirt. sure enough when i washed with just my hands for same amount of time i had dirt still on my face then when i used the clarisonic the next night i had nothing. only thing is i want the one with different speeds and times this one is just one speed set for 1 minute so i think i&#x27;ll upgrade eventually no rush since it works fine. wouldn&#x27;t mind having the all over one for my feet too :)</li>
    <li> Since January when I purchased it. It stopped charging a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was our old electrical outlets, tried them all. No Luck. It just stopped charging.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t return it. I was ripped off. more than a hundred dollars down the drain</li>
    <li> So I saw such awesome reviews for this product...bought it thought it cost a LOT more than similar items.  I&#x27;ve had this time for less than 2 months and it stopped working.  It buzzes as if it&#x27;s charging but then nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Could not register the product when it arrived....invalid number.  Contacted clairsonic and it was not their product.  Broke after 4months of use approximately of once a week.  Very disappointed in amazon for allowing the sale of product that is not original but a knock off and the consumer has no way of knowing.  Never given a bad review and felt so strong about this..... this is not right.</li>
    <li> Your skin will feel AMAZING after even your first use! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week 2x a day (my skin is oily so I can get away with frequent use) and it feels softer and smoother than it did before. I feel like it&#x27;s really getting into my pores and am hoping it will help to clean up my skin with more use. It&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My face is so soft and smooth now that I am using it. It has gotten rid of my breakouts (I use it with proactive cleansers) If you break out a lot the clarisonic really helps BUT just so you know the first week or two you use it your skin does break out a little extra but its cuz its cleaning deep down and removing all that c*** from your skin. After about 2 weeks my skin looked great! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was anxious to purchase this because of all the great reviews and though its not a miracle product I am happy that I purchased it.  I have combination skin with occasional hormonal breakouts. This product didnt eliminate all my problems but my  skin is properly cleaned and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using it as part of my daily routine, it gently exfoliates and gets rid of all my make up.My pores are NOT smaller but are less noticeable because my skin itself is dewy and glowing (not greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lotion absorbs nicely into my skin and make up looks smoother. I have heard people say that you can get the same results with a washcloth, maybe you can, but most of us dont use a cloth effectively enough, long enough or often enough to make a difference. The clarisonic makes it convienent and quick. The Mia actually times you !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hopeful that it helps me with some old acne dark spots but it may be to early to tell.I will post an update in a couple months if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt give it a full five star review because I do think its overpriced. Dont give me wrong, its a nice item but I&#x27;m sure if does not have to be over $100.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am still in love with the Mia, I had 2 very small pimples since using it and they cleared up very quickly. It has not really helped with the old acne darks spots but it does allow my facial products to absorb quickly so hopefully they should go soon. Overall I am happy with the benefits to my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I can tell my skin is looking much better.  I use it with philosophy products and my skin really is in much better condition.  I used to have a hard time even getting moisturizer to soak in.  But know I have no problem and my skin is smoother and I do not have blackheads which were a problem no matter how much I cleaned.  I use it twice a day and I really like the results.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic was great while it lasted, which was a month.  Now, I charge it all the time and when I try to use it for more than 5 seconds, it turns off on me.  I contacted Amazon about a refund and never received an email or phone call back.  Very disappointed.  For the price tag, I expect something to last longer than a month.</li>
    <li> I have had the Mia a week now and I am so impressed with the difference in my skin!  It&#x27;s amazing that something so easy could make such a big difference.  I used to have tiny blackheads around my nose area and they are completely gone now.  My skin is so much smoother so my makeup goes on more evenly.  I waited to buy this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for something that just washed my face...but this does so much more!  I am 50 years old and this one product has done more to make my skin look younger and healthier than anything and everything else I have combined!  Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> Skin is improved.  Less flaking and blemishes.  It is a great product.  I struggle with blemishes and I think my medications work better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on reviews I had read in magazines and other places.  It&#x27;s not that it isn&#x27;t a good product, it&#x27;s just that I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin. Nor do I see any difference than if I use any other cleansing system.  I don&#x27;t think the high price equates with the results.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend recommended this product and so I decided to give it a try.  Hard to believe, but after just one cleaning I noticed how smooth my skin felt.  I was hooked!  Can&#x27;t go a day without it.  Within a few days I noticed the pours of my skin were smaller, white-heads gone.  For any age; my daugher &amp; granddaughter both use the Mia and I my only regret is I didn&#x27;t know about this when I was younger.  But even in one&#x27;s 50 or 60&#x27;s it will make a difference !!</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend to others. I&#x27;ve heard of some having breakouts but it didn&#x27;t happen for me - thankgoodness :)  Found my face a lot smoother.  This together with my routine made a huge difference. I haven&#x27;t used it long but I feel that I can go out in public with just mineral foundation powder, that&#x27;s a huge deal for me as i always needed concealer.</li>
    <li> Seller put product box in only a thin plastic bag; box was dented upon receipt. Item was already partially charged, which confused me. The directions say to charge it first for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I really did my homework before I made this huge investment for a face cleaner.  It was absolutely worth it.  I&#x27;ve only been using my mia for about two weeks and my acne is almost completely gone!! I don&#x27;t even use the acne brush heads, the sensitive ones work just fine! Highly, Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say that my pores look smaller and fine lines have been reduced but I will say that my skin does look cleaner, brighter and feels smoother. I purchased the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; brush heads and my skin never feels dry or irritated after using the Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used in on my bf once (he loved it) and am purchasing a seperate brush head for him to use.</li>
    <li> This is my second Clarisonic (the last one started to have battery/charging issues after about 1 1/2 years).  I loved my first Clarisonic and became used to have clean, soft, clear skin all the time.  After I started having battery issues and stopped using it, my skin eventually started breaking out again.  I felt like I was looking older.  My skin was dull and just old looking (I&#x27;m in my early 50s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke down and bought this version.  WOW!  After one use, my baby soft facial skin is back, my skin is clearing up, looking cleaner and brighter, and I swear it even feels a bit tighter.  Love this smaller size, and the magnetic battery charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the Clarisonic in the shower.  Have used it over one week and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.  So happy I made the decision to buy it a second time around and not just fall into the \\&quot;I&#x27;m getting old\\&quot; trap of thinking about my skin.</li>
    <li> I never would have thought I would be praising a beauty item so much that I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends, my family, my kids school teachers...heck, I even bought a few for family because I believe in this thing so much! The Clarisonic is nothing short of amazing. With the one minute of cleaning time, my skin has gone from dry in some spots and acne prone in others to bright, clear, and smooth. I&#x27;m simply amazed - my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since high school! I ended up buying one for my sister who has highly acne prone skin. After about a month of use, her skin is looking much clearer, and smooth in some places - something that she has been trying to achieve for years! She has tried everything, from Retin-A, to dermatologist visits, and a bevy of products - Clarisonic was the only one who gave results like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage is easy - magnetic plug to charge once a week, lather up your face a little, then use the Clarisonic for a minute in the shower every night (or morning, if you choose). The big trick - DO NOT OVERUSE! I&#x27;ve read that some people who go overboard and use it twice a day end up with the opposite result...your skin going nuts trying to overcompensate (aka breakouts!). I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic as directed and my skin looks great! It&#x27;s always wonderful having people comment how great my skin looks! All in all, highly HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months now &amp; my skin has never felt better! Really, never. It feels super clean every time. I originally bought this so that it could remove blackheads on my nose. While it removed most but not all, my face has never been cleaner, and looks better than before I bought this. I loved the cleanser it comes with it smells great &amp; is non drying. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had heard such good things about the Clarisonic Cleansing Brush, that I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. While it does an excellent job of cleaning your skin, it costs way more than it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve had mine for approximately 3-4 months and it decided to quit working last night. NOT. HAPPY. I spent quite a bit of money on this Cleansing Brush, and I would have hoped that it would last a lot longer than it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could have, I would have given this product a zero star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO. NOT. WASTE. YOUR. MONEY.</li>
    <li> I love this clarisonic!  I have very clear pores now.  I would recommend to only use it two-three times a week.  I used it twice in three days and my skin got kind of rough/dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas last year. She really likes it. I have the Oil of Olay Cleansing System and I cannot say that the Clarisonic is really any better. For the price I would suggest starting out with the Oil of Olay cleansing system, about $35, see if you like it and if so then maybe upgrade to this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic for a few years now with great results but, after it took really nasty spill down the stairs while I was packing for a business trip I was in search of a cheaper option. I heard great things about the Olay Pro X so I gave it a shot. It DOES NOT compare to the Clarisonic on any level!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING - The clarisonic comes with a neat charging dock that just magnetically snaps on. The Olay Pro requires batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATERPROOF - The Clarisonic is waterproof... the Olay Pro is NOT, it is water resistant. This basically means that the Olay can accidentally get a little wet but, has to be dried off immediately. Seems really odd that they wouldn&#x27;t make a device that is supposed to get wet, waterproof. I leave my Clarisonic in the shower and never had a problem. If water sits in the Olay Pro&#x27;s batteries then the batteries corrode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIMING - The Clarisonic automatically turns off (you can turn it back on) at the end of the recommended cleansing time so you don&#x27;t over cleanse your face. Olay Pro does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSING - Clarisonic \\&quot; has 300 movements per second to gently, yet thoroughly remove 6X more makeup and 2X more dirt and oil than cleansing with your hands alone\\&quot; The Olay Pro only rotates in a circle, no vibration. The bristles are also coarse and irritating to my skin. The Clarisonic gives you a better clean feeling. There is a reason dermatologists, estheticians and spas use the Clarisonic and not the Olay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERSATILITY - The Mia has several different options for cleansing brushes</li>
    <li> I had this on my Amazon wish list for the longest time and Mom and Dad came through this Xmas!  I cannot even put into words how happy I am just a week in.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, and my skin looks amazing.  Even my 6 year old son noticed!  Skintone is even, skin is supple and smooth, makeup application-using less and less!  At 36 with tons of sun damage in the past, I noticed right away that my skin looks even and brighter.  Over the weekend a little bit of a BB cream and some powder (no foundation) and I was gone!  Huge change for me :)  I will say that if you are having dryness, try switching your cleanser.  I previously used one for oily/combo skin and found that after a day or two I had a couple of dry patches.  Then I switched to Ceravie moisturizing cleanser and back to normal!  Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> I use it a few times a week.  Every day would be too much for my skin.  It helps keep my skin from getting &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; as my facialist calls it.  I think it feels good, too.  I use it with whatever liquid face soap I have in the shower at the time.  It keeps its charge well.  I think it could possibly help someone who has patches of acne as it really does seem to clean the pores out and make things feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product - it was rusting underneath the brush head despite the fact that it was &amp;#34;water proof.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean, smooth and fresh after using the Clarisonic!I  I will recommend it and make sure my daughters each get one.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  However, when I noticed some rust after 4 weeks of use, I was told by Clairsonic&#x27;s customer service that there was no way this could have been an authentic Clairsonic product, though I was able to register the item on their website.  Hence, Clairsonic has flooded the Amazon marketplace with second-quality merchandise that they refuse to stand behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the message is this: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ON AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas from a family member and was really happy to try it to. I&#x27;ve been wanting this for the longest. First thing, I did was registered it on their website. I love waking to using my Mia. I&#x27;ve only tried this for a week now and I must say it really cleans your face. It feels squeaky clean and you can tell the difference between the clarisonic v.s washing with your hands. Lotions,serum,creams, and makeup goes on smooth. A couple complaints I do have is,the refreshing gel cleanser that came with it,dried my skin so I had to switch it to cetaphil and you need to charge it for 18hrs after 20min.of use and last complaint I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my appearance yet. I still have blackheads and a few pimples here n there. But if you want to know you&#x27;re cleaning your face well, get this!</li>
    <li> I did my research &amp; decided to invest in the Clarisonic rather than any of the imitations that are out there. I also paid for part of my purchase with AMEX points, so the damage to my wallet wasn&#x27;t bad at all. This gadget is so easy to use, from charging to cleaning. It felt so good &amp; stimulating on my face. I really felt it getting into my pores. After 1 minute, it automatically shuts off. My skin felt so soft &amp; looked so clean. I&#x27;m acne prone, so I can attest that my acne meds (prescription meds) &amp; moisturizer seemed to go on better &amp; penetrate more effectively. Like other users, I find that I only need to use it 2-3 times per week, and I use it at night to get rid of the day&#x27;s build-up of makeup, dirt, oil &amp; outside pollution &amp; impurities. I can&#x27;t speak on the similar products offered by other manufacturers, but I definitely can say that investing in the Clarisonic is worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! My face is so much clearer, smoother, and softer. My acne topical creams are much more effective now. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It has really helped to improve my complexion over the last year. I just wish I could find the refreshing gel cleanser that came with my clarisonic for purchase.</li>
    <li> After using this product several times, it needed recharging.  After recharging, the product no longer worked.  I would not recommend purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I received the system, charged it for 24 hours as instructed. But when I went to use it all it did was vibrate, the brushes did not rotate. I removed the brush head to see if the mechanism rotates and maybe the brush head wasn&#x27;t seated correctly, but the internal mechanism didn&#x27;t rotate either.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my opinion that if a company&#x27;s manufacturing and QA process is poor enough to allow them to send a defective product out to a customer, then I don&#x27;t want their products.</li>
    <li> description was accurate arrived promptly through amazon shipping</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CLARISONIC TO REGISTER MY PRODUCT AND USE MY 25 DOLLAR OFF COUPON THAT CAME WITH IT AND THEY REJECTED MY MIA BECAUSE AMAZON IS \\&quot;NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER\\&quot;!!! SO THE WARRANTY IS VOID. IF YOU WANT A WARRANTEED PRODUCT AND WANT TO USE THE COUPONS FROM CLARISONIC FOR HEADS ETC. DONT BUY ON AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> I am 35 years.  I never had much problems with acne until 2 years ago.  People told me to stop touching my face so I don&#x27;t break out.  It didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;ve tried other acne products: it only helped partially.  Then I heard about Mia and how it cleanse your skin 6x better than using your hands.  It worked!  I break out once in a while but its not as bad as it used to be.  It helped that I use this in conjuction with neutrogena acne face wash and follow it with Burt bee&#x27;s acne spot treament.  I used it religiously now.  Now that i&#x27;m older, I take more care of my skin. This Mia is expensive but its an investment.  How you take care of your skin, specially your face can tell a lot about you.  Your face is what people notice first before anything else so it pays to take care of it.  I rarely write a review of products unless I feel it is truly worth it and this product truly deserve my praise(and no, no one paid me to write this review!)</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and just like many other people reported on here loved it until it just stopped working!even though it was bought through a separate seller, robrobie robin, amazon is giving me a refund. This is why I love amazon, their customer service is outstanding! I&#x27;m just a little upset about the seller, beware and buy from someone else!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product now for 4 days. I saw a change in my skin the first time I used this. My skin feels great and I can tell my skin care products are already working better. I look forward to how my skin looks and feels in the next 30 days. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this clarisonic in September 2012, prior to my wedding. It worked for a few months, then the way it was vibrating/cleaning became weaker. Now it won&#x27;t even start. I called clarisonic about the issue, and after giving them the number that the service agent asked for, they said they (i.e. clarisonic) didn&#x27;t manufacture it. She asked where I purchased it from, I replied amazon, and she said that they are not an authorized dealer so there is no warranty or help with replacement. She listed a number of authorized dealer where I should purchase from where the clarisonic will be covered by warranty, even if I need to shell out a few extra dollars. She said that they were getting a lot of calls about purchases from amazon and there really wasn&#x27;t anything they could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have done more research on my part, and purchased this item at an authorized dealer so that I would have warranty coverage. I am giving this product 2 stars because when it worked I really loved it, but I would advise others to buy somewhere else that offers the standard 1-year warranty for the Mia.</li>
    <li> Compact little scrubber that goes anywhere. Just like the original but better. Keeps a charge for a long time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I wish I were rich bc I would buy this product for everyone I know! I have been using it for about a month now and am in heaven. Like everyone concerned with their skin, I&#x27;ve tried everything. I know wash clothes hold germs, using your hands and foamy soap doesn&#x27;t seem too loosen up make-up and build-up, scrubs can scratch my skin and I get carried away and feel like I&#x27;m causing more harm than good. The only thing that worked for me were Oil of Olay faces wash clothes but I hated using a new cloth everyday, it felt wasteful and sometimes the soap seemed to dry out of the clothes. Then after being told by numerous ppl and doing lots of research I invested in the Mia and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use less face-wash than before, so I don&#x27;t feel as bad buying quality face-wash. It has a timer so I know when I&#x27;m done and don&#x27;t worry about over/under washing. Lastly, and most importantly, I notice that the lotions, serums, creams, etc that used to do nothing are actually working. I wasted so much money on products that weren&#x27;t absorbing into my skin. I can really feel them working now. I wear make-up far less than before, look forward to washing my face when I get off work vs waiting for right before bed. The Mia doesn&#x27;t make a huge mess of my sink or hair!! My face is smooth, fine lines and dark spots are improving daily and I genuinely love this product. I&#x27;m 28years old and feel more confident in my anti-aging and skin care regime than ever. YOU MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> The charging time for the product is outrageous. Its heavy and the replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap. Buy the $20 system, it works just as well.</li>
    <li> So, I just received my \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot; in the mail.  Having used a friend&#x27;s before, I knew something was wrong immediately.  I called the Clarisonic Customer Service number to tell them my device was not working properly.  As soon as I gave him the serial number that is printed on the base of the device and told him where I bought it from, he told me it was a FAKE.  He told me that you cannot buy a true Clarisonic from Amazon.  I can&#x27;t believe I got taken!! It looked exactly like a true Clarisonic!!!!!  But, upon reading the box a bit more carefully, my 12 year old daughter just found multiple typos!</li>
    <li> This product does a marvelous job of removing makeup getting your face clean.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy way to get your face really clean!</li>
    <li> Turns out its a fake model. Clarisonic is in a legal battle with amazon over the selling of false Clarisonics, so be carful if purchasing one of these.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A KNOCK OFF PRODUCT! I thought I was paying for a real Clarisonic since it says that...it lasted 6 months before breaking. I called the company because it is supposed to have a 1 year warranty. They told me it is a fraudulent product! So appealed that Amazon would allow buyers to keep getting screwed like this!!!!</li>
    <li> I used the Mia once or twice a week until the battery ran down.  It would never recharge.  I couldn&#x27;t get my money back or return it because I only had a one month window with amazon.  Very pricey for only a few uses.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to help reduce blemishes and it works. The bristles are a bit scratchy but bearable. I have had no major breakouts since using this for a month now. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love using my Clarisonic to cleanse my face.  When I finish, it feels truly refreshed and purely cleansed.  I cannot do without my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I loved the product at first. It arrived on time and worked well. I ordered it in January but by March the on/off button became VERY hard to push. Now in the middle of April it began to turn itself on. It is really embarrassing to have a vibrating noise broadcasting from your shower with no warning!!! Since my Amazon return policy had expired I called the Clarisonic dealer and they told me, by reading the serial number, that the product IS A FAKE. This is not the first product from this dealer that has been fake. Order from the Amazon warehouse and not from this dealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did refund me the money and provided a return label to send the fake back in. The Amazon customer service was so very helpful. She even found me a new product on the site while we on the phone!</li>
    <li> My wife has had the older, more bells and whistles model for 4 1/2 years. The device has been dropped twenty or more times by the kids and finally it died. As she really on used the older model for one purpose I bought this model as a replacement. It does everything she wants. Great seller, came fast!</li>
    <li> This little device helped wean me off Proactiv. It worked wonders on my skin, and I love the product itself. But recently, about 3 months after purchasing and using every day, the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button started to stick. The mia now randomly turns on when I&#x27;m not even holding it, and turns off while I&#x27;m using it. I don&#x27;t know what to do...it&#x27;s draining the battery and is very annoying. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s some kind of warranty. If not, I just spent $150 on something that only worked for a few months. Maybe I will try another brand next time I buy a cleansing brush like this.</li>
    <li> I love the clarisonic product.. i have always had acne prone skin and all I ever wanted was nice clear skin. i love my clarisonic so much I decided to purchase one for my daughter for christmas.. I purchased the Mia off amazon, and three months after use it completely stopped working and wouldnt turn on even after charging all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Clarisonic to try and get it replaced under the 1 year warranty, I gave them the serial number off the device, and they informed me they could not replace it because the device was fake, a counterfeit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE IN PURCHASING FROM THIS BUYER. I AM NOW OUT OVER 100$ AND THIS WAS MY DAUGHTERS CHRISTMAS PRESENT THAT I NOW HAVE TO REPLACE.</li>
    <li> I got some acne after quitting the pill and nothing was working with it, not even a cream recommended by a dermatologist. So I took a leap of faith and bought Clarisonic (despite the price) as I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt and also I had seen some excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it&#x27;s been really worth it. My skin is a lot clearer now (not completely though - but it&#x27;s been just a month) and as other reviewers have said, my skin seems to better absorb both moisturisers and foundation. So overall I&#x27;m really pleased I bought it and would definitely recommend it to anyone with combination skin.</li>
    <li> This product is not manufactured by Clarisonic.  Mine broke after 2 months and when I called Clarisonic, they said the lot number has never been used by them therefore they can&#x27;t replace it.  Don&#x27;t buy from this company, your product will break and can&#x27;t be replaced!!!  RIP OFF!!!!</li>
    <li> For $100+, I expected this product to last a lot longer than 1 1/2 years.  When my Clairsonic unexpectedly stopped working (not long after having replaced the $25 brush head) customer service told me &amp;#34;I would need to buy a new one&amp;#34;  No, I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my battery-powered Oil of Olay facial brush.</li>
    <li> product works great - pleased with everything!&lt;br /&gt;got it for a better price than if i had gone in to the stores to purchase it!</li>
    <li> After trying lotion after lotion I decided to find a way to exfoliate my face with out using scrubbing beads because they are bad for the environment (they&#x27;re tiny plastic beads and fish eat them causing toxic build up! YUCK) and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t be creating a ton of waste, like a disposable product. I love this thing! It got rid of the dry itchy patches on my face and my skin is SO SOFT, I can&#x27;t stop petting my own face! I love it so much I bought my mother one since she has skin similar to my own and she has the same results and reaction. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> I never believed the hype until I received one as a gift...truly changed my skin.  I will use it for life!</li>
    <li> I have had this exact Clarisonic Mia for about 6 months. It recently stopped working properly. I contacted Clarisonic to see if I could get the item replaced. They told me this model is not actually manufactured by Clarisonic so they cannot help me. I am very annoyed.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my daughter and one for myself only to find out that these items are knock-offs.  My daughters broke and she called Clarisonic and was told that they are fraudulent and that only authorized sellers from CLARISONIC COULD SELL THIS PRODUCT.  Like Macy&#x27;s, Sephora, Ulta or certain Dermatologists.  I notified Amazon of this problem and was even told by Clarisonic that Amazon is aware of the problem.  I can see that i did not impress Amazon at all as they are still allowing sellers to sell knock-offs using the Amazon name.  o yourself a favor and just buy from an authorized dealer.  Saving a few bucks is not worth hassle of trying to get a refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ON AMAZON! All of the low one-star and two-star reviews mentioning that theirs is \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and \\&quot;counterfeit\\&quot; and a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; and all of that, there&#x27;s a reason why this is the case-CLARISONIC DOES NOT SELL THEIR MIA ON AMAZON! Give them a call like I did and they&#x27;ll tell you this themselves. So if the company doesn&#x27;t sell their products on Amazon, what product do you think you&#x27;re receiving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my Mia from Macy&#x27;s in the middle-end of April of this past year, so I&#x27;ve had it for over 3 months, which is important when reading a review because a lot of the reviews of products are inflated due to the \\&quot;honeymoon phase\\&quot; in which customers are so elated and excited to have purchased the product that their euphoric mood inclines them to give positive reviews of the product they purchased. I&#x27;ve read reviews of this product in which reviewers mentioned buying their Mia&#x27;s a week earlier and seeing results or being optimistic, as though they could decipher whether or not this product aided them in that little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product two stars out of five because I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s necessary. Your hands work just as well, perhaps even better at massaging your face of the dirt and oil. I&#x27;ve generally used the Mia twice a day, one minute solely focusing on the face, another minute spending 30 seconds on the rest of my face that I didn&#x27;t clean and the final 30 seconds on my neck, so two minutes total. Where the Mia does a good job is visibly showing you the dirt that it cleaned off of your face onto the brush, this is especially true when you run the brush on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But part of the problem that I have, is this claim that Clarisonic makes that their brush removes makeup 6 times better than using your hands and that using their brush allows 61% \\&quot;greater absorption of vitamin C after use.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t wear makeup but dirt, oil, pollutants, topical creams and lotions etc., can accumulate at the end of the day. Does that mean this brush can clean all of that residue 6 times better than one&#x27;s hands will? Also, 61% of vitamin C absorption, does that mean that if I put acne cream or anti-wrinkle cream or skin toning lotion/cream or moisturizer or toner, etc., that then those products get absorbed into the skin 61% more (I&#x27;ll even accept half of that) thereby enhancing my skin&#x27;s health and potential beauty dramatically than if one used their own hands? I&#x27;m not sure, because like I stated before, I owned and used it for nearly over 3 months, but I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic positive and noticeable results from those two claims made. And if this product is SOLELY concentrated on make-up and vitamin C alone (as opposed to the various things I listed earlier in this paragraph), then who the hell cares? Make-up and vitamin C alone aren&#x27;t amazing claims to warrant purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and gave this product a reasonable chance for a reasonable time period to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to replace the brush heads every 3 months. They cost $25 each, and around $40 for two of them (regardless of the type of brush head you want: sensitive, delicate, normal, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Can visibly see dirt scraped off of face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes longer to wash your face than using your hands.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes an entire day to fully recharge your Mia.&lt;br /&gt;-Exorbitantly expensive at around $140 (with tax) (doesn&#x27;t even include many features like timed zones for the different parts of your face (forehead, cheeks, nose)).&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning maintenance. You have to clean out the dirt and bacteria on the brush head. They advise that you do it at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;-Even the softest brush head, \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; can be a little abrasive (though it&#x27;s not painful or anything, just a little irritating to the skin).&lt;br /&gt;-Does not feel like a face massage like many of these \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; exaggerated and embellished that it does.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a clarisonic for years.  I looked at countless youtube reviews and makeup alley reviews.  I was put off by the price and the cost of the replacement heads, but the curiosity got the best of my better judgement.  I am the type of person that keeps up on skin care and regimines so I said what the heck, instead of looking at a thousand reviews-just try it.  I am glad that I did though.  This product will NOT give you photo shoot skin, or an airbrushed look, it will simply give your skins top layer a deeper level of clean. (You may still have some sort of residue if you follow directly with a toner and cotton pad)  With that being said, my other beauty products did work more effectively therefore improving my skin.  The only other complaint is that it takes FOREVER for it to fully charge and I did not really like the \\&quot;loose\\&quot; feeling of the pLink charger.  I was not wild about the cleanser that came with it but it was a nice little addition.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are on the fence about buying it due to price and overall lifetime cost(I dont blame you I been there done that)  as a treat, you could buy it or use a friends to see if it is a good fit for you.  I did not experience the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; that a lot of people refer to.  I would say after 2 days I noticed that my other products worked better.  Try using your clarisonic after steaming your pores and follow with a nice facial mask and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND:  A few months ago when making a purchase at an office supply store, I noticed that the young lady (early 20s) at the cash register had incredibly beautiful skin - just flawless, looked like an airbrushed photo!  I told her, &amp;#34;you have beautiful skin!&amp;#34;  To my surprise, she eagerly started telling me that it was all due to a product she had recently started using, called &amp;#34;Clarisonic.&amp;#34;  I was intrigued.  A month ago, after researching a little on  Amazon.com, I bought a &amp;#34;Mia&amp;#34; along with an extra brush, so I could share it with my daughter.  (I am early 50s, and got a  &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; brush to use.  My 14-year-old daughter used the &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; brush.)  RESULTS:  What was so amazing to me, was that I experienced incredible results the very first time I used the product.  My pores were actually noticeably smaller, and my skin felt incredibly smooth and fresh.  As I continued to use this product daily --(for up to 1 and ½ minutes, although officially you are only supposed to use it 1 minute)-- the improvement continued.  I can hardly believe how good my skin looks!!  My family has been very impressed (even my 12-year-old son has noticed), and I have received many complements.  My skin looks much younger: tone is more even, the pores are tiny (not noticeable at all), the skin feels very smooth (hard to explain; it isn&#x27;t like it was especially rough before, but I might compare it to the smooth, fresh feeling of touching a baby&#x27;s cheek).  The results are definitely far better than any masque I have ever tried. I couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with this product!!!  (As for  my daughter&#x27;s own skin, she feels the Clarisonic  has decreased her acne and made her skin look prettier; she is also very happy).  OTHER COMMENT:  I did have blackheads on my nose area, and although they seemed to be improving a bit with Clarisonic, I decided to give my treatment a boost by buying &amp;#34;Biore&amp;#34; nose strips (that you stick to wet nose, leave for 15 minutes, then remove and they help clear out blackheads).  I only used the nose strip once, and carried on with my Clarisonic, and the results were even more fantastic!!  SOME TIPS:  Instructions provided with the Clarisonic are so streamlined; I think they leave out some helpful hints.  FYI, here are the steps my daughter and I take to cleanse with Clarisonic: 1. Use fingers to gently apply cleansing solution all around face.. 2. Turn on machine and cleanse as per Clarisonic instructions, starting with forehead, then nose/chin, and finally cheeks.  (It may tickle the nose area the first few times, but tickling goes away with time...) 3. Rinse face well by splashing with warm water. 4. Pat dry face, then apply a light facial moisturizer. 5. Rinse Clarisonic brush and leave to air dry.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic worked pretty well on my acne-prone skin...until about a year and two months after purchase, it gave up working. The warranty only covers a year. For such an expensive product, I would have expected it to work much longer. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> Called Clarisonic cust service they verified and told me this is fake</li>
    <li> Under layers and layers of dead cells lies a gorgeous, radiant skin. Mia is a very gentle way of clearing the cemetery of the dead cells off your face. I got my &amp;#34;new face&amp;#34; after couple days! Now, I can&#x27;t  imagine my daily cleansing routine without Clarisonic Mia! Worth every penny! I&#x27;m using so much less of my cleanser and moisturizer. Skin is lighter, more radiant, younger and tighter! I stopped using the foundation (only use it on special occasions now), because my skin is beautiful! I have had Mia for 2 months and charged it once only. It&#x27;s very pretty too. Slick and pink.  Invest and say hello to your gorgeous skin. It&#x27;s there, believe me.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! I have been using mine for quite some time and it is still going strong. I keep it in the shower to use on my face and I use it every single day. It is fine if it gets wet and it charges really easily. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great product - perfect for exfoliation</li>
    <li> this never charged.  i contacted the seller about this, no one ever wrote back.  i heard from many people that they have charging problems.  although the brush worked great for my skin, it worked for about 3 months, and then stopped working forever.  very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I did not buy my Clarisonic here. I read several reviews that they got fakes when ordering from these sellers. I bought mine off the clarisonic web site a couple of years ago. Clarisonic is recommended to me by a friend. It is the best beauty purchase I have ever made. I had either acne or rosacea and used many different prescriptions medications including metro cream and retina A. The retin A seemed to work okay but my face would get so dry and I still broke out along my chin line. Now that I use the clarisonic, I no longer have acne of any kind!!!! And I use NO prescription medication. I use it with bare minerals cleanser. I use a bare mineral moisturizer and make up and hardly ever break out. It&#x27;s amazing!! I gave my Mia to my 11 year old who suffers from acne and it has really helped her too! As long as she uses it consistently with her acne prescriptions, her skin looks beautiful. I would have never thought about buying this expensive product for a child but I let her switch the brush and borrow mine. It worked so well for her that I decided to let her have it for her own. I bought one of the ones with a body brush figuring I liked it so much for my face that it would be great on the rest of my body as well. It&#x27;s great. I share this one with my husband - we just swap out the heads. He likes it too and uses it on his shaved head. This prevents break outs on his face and head too. Wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered acne ever since middle school. I had a few golden years in my early 20&#x27;s, but since having my second child it has all gone downhill again. I have especially been breaking out along the jawline lately. I really want to avoid slathering benzoyl peroxide all over my face every day for the rest of my life, so I&#x27;ve gotten desperate looking for natural, affordable solutions. I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks, and I am impressed with the texture of my skin now...definitely softer and smoother. And I think brighter. But I agree with others that my acne is not better, and if anything I am breaking out where I normally would not. I am going to keep with it for a couple more weeks and see what happens since there appears to be a purging period, and I was very ill last month so I think that threw my hormones even further out of wack. I may also order a sensitive brush. I will try to update this review later! Like I said - I love the appearance it has given my skin, other than the stubborn acne that is still there ruining it. (p.s. I actually purchased this from skinstore.com when they were having a great sale)</li>
    <li> From the day a person enters their teen years, they deal with troubled skin and even continuing on as an adult. From acne, sun-damage, uneven complexions, sensitive to acne scars:  The solution to all these skin problems could be one product away. I¬¬¬¬¬¬&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Mia for the past six months; it is a small handheld electronic facial cleanser. This little gadget is a true miracle worker; I have been through the awkward \\&quot;pepperoni-face\\&quot; stage to a clear complexion with the Clarisonic Mia. There are so many great things about this product, the only downside is it&#x27;s a little pricey but in all honesty I thinks it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a myriad of skin care systems on my face to rid the acne and acne scars. The Clarisonic Mia is a small facial cleanser with a brush head at the top, that when turned on the brush bristles oscillate. When you turn it on, it begins to vibrate and after applying cleanser, just move the brush in little circles across your face and periodically rinse the brush. When rinsing the brush head, you can actually see the dirt and makeup it picks up (sort of gross, I know, but it shows you its really working.) You can use it with any facial cleanser, whether it is made for acne or your daily face wash. The Mia has a one-speed button and a built-in timer that helps you cover your face evenly without over-washing. Probably the most amazing part of this product is its durability; you can take it in the shower with you, even after complete saturation, it still works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic Mia is great for men and women of all ages. My mom purchased one before I got mine, she is forty-five years old and she claims it has revealed softer, healthier and younger looking skin. For myself, I&#x27;ve noticed a more even complexion, reduced the size of my pores and less breakouts. This product works with any skin type: from a teen with troubled oily skin to a forty-five year old with sun-damaged and aged skin. This product is not just targeted at women; men can use it too. The Clarisonic Company also offers various different brush heads for different skin types; for acne prone skin, sensitive, deep-pore to even a full body brush. I have a soft green Clarisonic Mia but there is also an assortment of colors to choose from. From the skin-type sensitive brush head to the fun colors they offer, Clarisonic has truly made a personalized skin care product for everyone out there with trouble skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is really only one downfall with this product, the price. If bought from the Clarisonic Company, it is $129, which includes two replacement brush heads and a trial size cleanser. I have to replace the brush head every three to four months and they range from fifteen to thirty dollars depending where you get it. I actually bought my Clarisonic Mia from the make-up counter at a mall but I have seen lower priced brand-new on web sites such as Amazon, EBay and Overstock.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am in absolute love with this product, from its durability to its amazing effects it has on my skin. A product where it can be used on men and women, any skin type and any age really sets itself aside from any other skin care system. All things considered the benefits of this product far out weight the downside of its price. I highly recommend this product and I hope you look into purchasing the Clarisonic Mia as well</li>
    <li> I did notice a difference in the smoothness after starting this regime pretty quickly, but i still had consistent breakouts until about 2 months in. I am enjoying skin like i haven&#x27;t had in years. My makeup goes on so well. I hardly have any spots i have to do extra cover-up. and i can use extra-light makeup instead of the heavy-duty i was using before. My skin really does look younger and cleaner and feels smoother. I am impressed. I hung in for the two months because even though my skin didn&#x27;t look markedly better for a while, it did feel good, and i felt like i got all the make up off my skin every day even with the heavy-duty makeup. (that might be why my skin looks so good now, finally getting it ALL off every night!)  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It has taken me a while to figure out how to blend this into my routine.  But I have and I love it.  My skin feels so soft and smooth.  My complexion has improved (with the help of some different products).  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I decided to finally make the plunge and buy this! I am so happy I did for multiple reasons. My face always looked..dull. I always made sure to exfoliate, but nothing really seemed to do it. After using this, my face looks more brighter and rejuvenated! When using it, it feels amazing on the skin. Like a massage for your face. I did also notice that it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my blackheads, but it did help them. After using this, my skin is so baby smooth. Comparing cleansing your face with just your hands, and using the Clairsonic are amazing. You realize how clean your face feels when you use the Mia, it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before. It has also helped a little with my acne scarring. My pores got smaller, and my skin had less breakouts! Of course this isn&#x27;t going to be a miracle worker and get rid of all of your breakouts, but paired with and cleanser that works well with your skin...it will be amazing!! Definitely recommend, my breakouts go away so much quicker and my face just looks so much better. Thank you Clairsonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lovin this one. I was hesitant to use this before thinking that it would irritate my skin more. The first time I used this, I can already feel that my skin is so clean. I have a trerrible acne before but this product really helps my acne problem. My friends actually complimented about my face that it looks so smooth and I don&#x27;t have pimples anymore. So I told them about the clarisonic. They have different brushes too for different skin types and so is the type of cleanser that you need to use. They have cleanser for oily and dry skin. I really am so happy with this purchased and the price is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia system from Amazon thinking it was a better deal than other retailers (less than retail price!). Wrong! Like other reviewers, I inspected it thoroughly when I received it and looked for signs that it might be a fake. Everything looked great... until I tried to register it on the Clarisonic website and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I then called Clarisonic to ask whether the Mia I purchased was authentic given the lot code on the handle and the customer service rep said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s not one of our codes\\&quot; (i.e. it&#x27;s a fake!). She then proceeded to tell me, \\&quot;Amazon is not one of our authorized retailers.\\&quot; When I heard that, I immediately sent it back and went to Nordstrom to buy the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, people - Clarisonic does not consider Amazon an authorized retailer for their products so if you really want to know what you&#x27;re getting, go to Sephora, Nordstrom, Macy&#x27;s or Ulta.</li>
    <li> The unit broke two weeks after I purchased it. I called the Clarisonic customer service and the product is not authentic so I have no remedy with Clarisonic. Terrible misrepresentation of a product.</li>
    <li> Apparently, you shouldn&#x27;t order this from Amazon but directly from Clarisonic. I bought my Clarisonic in December of 2012 and now it&#x27;s May of 2014 and it has completely died and won&#x27;t hold a charge. It&#x27;s now past the return date to Amazon but it&#x27;s ridiculous that this expensive item has died after only a year and a half of use (and I didn&#x27;t use it every day). Clarisonic won&#x27;t honor their warranty because they have no record of my Mia so if you want a Clarisonic that works, I would suggest ordering from Clarisonic directly. Not worth the price difference if it breaks after 18 months.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Mia and feel that my face is cleaner. It was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and also many friends have it and love theirs so I gave it a try and I am not sorry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing about it from a good friend who recommended I buy one.  I am so glad I finally listened!  I choose this as a birthday gift for my 39th birthday.  After using this for the past few weeks, my skin looks and feels better than ever!  If I could change anything, it would be the price of the replacement heads, which are rather expensive.  Best face-washing experience ever!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 6 weeks. Called Clarisonic Customer Service only to find it wasn&#x27;t under warranty protection because it was a knock-off. Amazon refunded most of what I paid although this was a Marketplace (third-party supplier). I liked the Mia, so I ordered one directly from Clarisonic even though it cost more.</li>
    <li> I left my Clarisonic Mia in a hotel bathroom and immediately replaced it.  It leaves my skin feeling healthy and and clear.</li>
    <li> The product was everything it said it was. Works very well. Comes with standard head, may want to look into different heads as well.</li>
    <li> charli tried this one for over 3 month and she thinks its better than what she expected from these beauty product and beats some of the smaller components. battary is good and the design itself is pleasing on the eye</li>
    <li> After 2 years of owning the Clarisonic Mia, I feel in the end it is just an okay product. Mine was gifted to me but after experiencing it, I probably would not buy one myself and would spend my money elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the dry side, and I&#x27;m in my early 30s. Initially I loved it because it really helped exfoliate my skin and my face was baby smooth. After about 6 months of use though, I no longer saw great benefits. My main want for this product was to ensure a really effective cleansing but I&#x27;ve never felt like it did an outstanding job. I would still find small traces of makeup on my toner pads and ultimately found a double cleansing method works better for a deeper clean, as well as BHA products that help exfoliate pores from the inside out. The bulkiness of the brush head also makes it particularly difficult to reach the crevices around my nose, which is the oiliness part of my face. I wish there was an option for a smaller brush attachment. If I decided to go with another vibrating cleansing brush, I would pick a smaller one. I know Tosowoong (a Korean brand) makes one, and I imagine there are others. However a small manual brush would work fine and be more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the standard brush head for the Clarisonic seems a bit abrasive on my skin. I&#x27;ve heard this can cause tiny tears on your skin which I could imagine with how the bristles feel. Since the beginning, I have always felt it was too harsh for daily use on my face. I do sometimes use on my body though, and it works fine there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is extremely well made. It&#x27;s sturdy and has never failed to operate. It feels as expensive as it is. The battery life is plenty adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands now, I am only using my Clarisonic for occasional exfoliating. As there are many easy, gentle and inexpensive ways to exfoliate, the Clarisonic is not even my first choice for that. My personal opinion is use your money to buy effective skincare products with antioxidants and retinol instead.</li>
    <li> For months I have heard great things about the Clarisonic, how this product has changed the lives of so many ladies out there. It gave me much hope thinking that this product would do the same wonders for my skin. I&#x27;m sad to say that after many months of using it, I&#x27;ve seen only a slight difference. The first two weeks my skin freaked out, broke out like crazy. Then after that, it stayed the same as it always is; dry, acne, and oily. I have changed cleansers to see if that was the problem, and I&#x27;m not too sure. The cleanser could have been the problem, but could it? I&#x27;ve tried so many with my Clarisonic. Overall, this product hasnt done much to my skin.. but at least it isnt worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could just be my skin, but I think this product has a great concept. Judging by the other reviews, I say it is worth a shot. It would make a nice Christmas present... $100 gift with a 50/50 chance that may change a girls life forever... or not.</li>
    <li> When we went to use the product it would not charge, when we called the manufacturer found out the item was a counterfeit. The ID # didn&#x27;t match. Returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell how an actual Clarisonic Mia works, because apparently what I received was not a real one. It  looked real, it came in the right packaging, but when I contacted Clarisonic customer care for an issue with it, and gave them the lot number printed on the unit, I was told &amp;#34;The lot code you provided is not a valid lot code, meaning that we did not manufacture that unit. We recommend returning it to the etailer you purchased it from because it is not an authentic clarisonic unit.&amp;#34; DO NOT buy from RobRobie Robin, as they apparently are selling knock-offs.</li>
    <li> After trying this out just twice, I noticed some black hair like things in the bathtub and realized one set of black bristles just fell out. Luckily, I was able to return it easily to Amazon. There seem to be a number of reviews about defective or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; Clarisonic Mias being purchased on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if mine was fake or not, but it definitely was defective.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pay the higher price and just went to Sephora to buy it again. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for a known authentic product than risk buying a counterfeit to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! My face has been clear of breakouts since I started using it a couple of months ago. I have absolutely no complaints about this product and would recommend it to everyone, especially those with persnickety skin.</li>
    <li> I have problem skin, it&#x27;s just a sad fact. I&#x27;ve had cystic breakouts for more than 12 years, dry patches for 10, and the early signs of aging have been setting in these last few years. My answer was to get expensive facials and microdermabrasion each month, which was very helpful, and to buy really great cleansers, toners, moisturizers, and masques. My skin was still just okay, and the investment was huge for the payoff.&lt;br /&gt;A while ago my best friend, who is an esthetian at a fancy spa in another state, decided I needed to know her secrets. She told me that there are 5 things that would put her out of a job if everyone owned them, and a Clarisonic was #1. She said that her clients who purchased the Mia hardly needed extractions and had a dramatic increase in skin elasticity. So I decided to invest in one after finding them so cheap on Amazon. She swore to me that it would pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;SO WORTH IT! I don&#x27;t need monthly facials and microderm anymore, my breakouts are greatly reduced, and my skin feels soft and amazing. Even my 1% retinol cream (another thing on her list) hasn&#x27;t caused a great deal of peeling because the Mia exfoliates my face so well. Plus, my other skin care products all work much better on my skin now. I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this tool enough. It&#x27;s a 100% difference from just using a high quality facial cleanser, and it makes products last longer and work better.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is excellent, it arrived on time and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the included cleanser because Trader Joe&#x27;s makes a super gentile and dirt cheap all-in-one cleanser that is better than any expensive product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I don&#x27;t want to risk having a breakout from any ingredients in the Clarisonic brand cleanser, so I can&#x27;t say anything about that. But the tool itself is beyond amazing.</li>
    <li> I use it for several days. Overall it is good. It is like electronic toothbrush vs normal toothbrush. It is cleaner than wash face by fingers</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month and I agree with all the other reviews! Haven&#x27;t had a pimple or cyst since I have used it and acne scars are fading! It was worth the money!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have dealt with combination skin, dry skin, extremely oily skin, and terrible acne my entire life.  I&#x27;ve used every prescription for acne out there but the only thing that really seemed to work was proactive, which I had been using for YEARS (draining my bank account I might add) and leaving my skin itchy RED and dry, but at least it was clear, right?  My esthetician finally told me to dump the proactive and get a clarisonic.  My initial thought was $100 bucks for a brush?  Are you kidding me?!  But I took her advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First few days- wow...my skin is SO SOFT!  This is amazing!  But definitely not making a difference with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next 3 weeks- skin is soft but I broke out terribly.  Cystic acne (which I usually don&#x27;t get) broke out around my jawline and between my eybrows.  It was so bad I actually had to cancel plans one night.  I freaked out and went into my esthetician who told me to stick through it and that all of the gunk that was way deep in my pores was coming to the surface.  She said initially it will make your skin more oily because it overactivates the sebaceous glands, but will get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a month after using it- I&#x27;m down to using it just once a day.  HOLY HECK my skin is amazing.  I use it at night before bed and dab some tea tree oil on my breakouts if i even have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just started using this product and find that your skin is getting worse STICK WITH IT!  My skin has never been this good in my life...people are actually completmenting me on my complexion!  My mousturizer glides on my skin and sinks in instead of just sitting on top and my makeup looks flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> **Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve now had my Mia for about 6 months and I&#x27;m feeling better and better about this product. People are asking me DAILY what I&#x27;m doing to my face to make it glow. Literally, people are using the&lt;br /&gt;  word \\&quot;glow\\&quot; when they describe my complexion. Having had mild skin issues for so many years, this compliment is music to my ears. I absolutely credit my Mia. If you religiously use this product,&lt;br /&gt;  you WILL see results. Hands down, this product should be given 300 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I heard about the wonders of Clarisonic technology, but I never bought into it. Rarely do products seen on TV actually deliver what they promise. However, I&#x27;m here to tell you, I am so in love with my Clarisonic Mia (I purchased the Pink Clarisonic Mia through Amazon). I&#x27;ve had mine for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;ve never been more excited to wash my face. I know, it sounds extremely lame, but let me just explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mild acne (nothing severe at all) and a red tone to my skin since about the age of 14 or 15 (I&#x27;m now 22). That being said, since then, I&#x27;ve not felt like I could go out in public without some form of foundation on my face covering all the imperfections - I even use a topical gel prescribed by my dermatologist, and I still feel this way. However, since I started using my Mia (even though it&#x27;s only been about two weeks), I can already see a major change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be wondering why I bought this in the first place since I said I don&#x27;t usually buy into products that promise so much. I&#x27;ll just say, I was tired of the same facial cleansing routine and the same skin problems I&#x27;d had since I was 15. I&#x27;d had enough and I decided it was time to do some research. I checked hundreds of reviews and really looked around for the best product for this money. The Mia hit every mark - so I bought it. I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I did!! My skin is so clean and, though it&#x27;s not totally acne free (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever bee 100% acne free), I&#x27;m already feeling like soon I&#x27;ll be able to go out without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some of the reviews I read, other people claimed to go through a horrible stage (acne galore) after starting to use their Mia, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with mine. When I&#x27;m done cleaning my face, it&#x27;s so soft and shiny (in the best way!) that I can&#x27;t help but to stare in the mirror and think, \\&quot;that&#x27;s MY skin??\\&quot; Honestly, this is no miracle product and I&#x27;m certainly not claiming that it is, but it 100% cleans skin sooo much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried numerous things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to read some reviews and find out if you think this is the product for you. If you want cleaner skin, it probably is. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, you&#x27;re never going to find it. If you are considering making this purchase but thinking about the cost, stop thinking and just put it in your cart right now. Yeah, it may not be a life changing product for you, and you may hate it for all I know, but I&#x27;m telling you that I think it&#x27;s worth it. I was skeptical, even after reading some reviews, but the Mia has absolutely proven itself to me, and I&#x27;d make the purchase over and over again.bee 100% acne free), I&#x27;m already feeling like soon I&#x27;ll be able to go out without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some of the reviews I read, other people claimed to go through a horrible stage (acne galore) after starting to use their Mia, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with mine.

    <li> Looked like the real deal (I have one I&#x27;ve confirmed with Clarisonic). Boxed identical to my Clarisonic. Instructions identical to my Clarisonic, but when it died on me 6 months later, Clarisonic couldn&#x27;t help with the warranty because the serial # wasn&#x27;t one of theirs.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product seems to deserve 5 stars when a person first receives it and uses it for a month or so. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the unit to stop working at which time the buyer finds out it isn&#x27;t backed by Clarisonic because it is counterfeit. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> My Mia quit working after 1.5 years.  The warranty is for 1 year only.  Disappointing for a $109 product!  It was a great product while it lasted, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth replacing so often.</li>
    <li> I bought the first MIA for my wife almost one year ago and since I have 3 women at home it was time to get my 16 year old her own MIA</li>
    <li> This Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System turned out to be a knockoff.  It stopped working and also the replacement heads couldn&#x27;t be installed.  When I called Clarisonic and gave them the number of the item, I learned it was a knockoff.  Amazon refunded my money but subtracted a $20 &amp;#34;restocking fee.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i never felt my face as clean without it!!!, i love it!,  i cant wait to get the accesories! its the best and great shipping on time</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this product.  It really does take away fine&lt;br /&gt;lines and my facial pores seem to have gotten smaller.</li>
    <li> This is a fake！the copper nails inside rusted soon! This is a fake！the copper nails inside rusted soon! This is a fake！the copper nails inside rusted soon!</li>
    <li> My skin feels so clean after using my clarisonic! You can see the before and after in the bristles when using it.. they look so yellow and I thought I was taking off all my makeup.. skin gets softer too, yo do get some kind of a mild dryness after using it but just make sure to use a good moisturizer which will be absorbed really quickly and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the advice of a friend.  She recently had a facial at a high end salon and they used this.  My teenage daughter suffers from fairly severe acne and I thought this would be worth a shot; we had tried just about everything.  In less than a week, the acne is clearing up.  Her skin is looking smoother and brighter.  The blemishes are diminishing.  She went back to a mild soap to use with the Mia.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this Clarisonic! My face hasn&#x27;t looked or felt better! SO happy! I highly recommend getting one!</li>
    <li> Very good and I thank Good Morning America for their review of this product.  Works like a charm and I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and have seen no benefits or differences in my skin. In spite of using a cleanser that is supposed to remove makeup, makeup remains on my face after using Clarisonic. My pores are still large and clogged with oil. Unlike a sonic toothbrush, which either removes plaque or doesn&#x27;t, the sonic facial cleaner does not demonstrate any measurable result.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas last year by request from my husband and I really REALLY like it. It has made a difference in texture of my skin and this is even without religious daily use. It&#x27;s not overly abrasive and I really like that it can be used in the shower/during a bath. I will be getting another one of these for my mom for Christmas next year.</li>
    <li> I am surprised these are so popular and expensive. Its a vibrating brush. After less than 5 months use, it started shorting out and is rusting out.  Find it strange that the return window for this was only a month too. Should have been a red flag. Also did not notice any difference in skin. Big waste of money</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product and called Clarisonic directly because people were saying that the seller that i bought mine from is selling counterfeit products.  Sure enough when i gave the customer service rep the serial number she told me that it was a fake!!! I returned it to Amazon and did not originally pay shipping but they are trying to make me pay some kind of bogus shipping charge.  After talking to amazon again they were able to get this money back for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller that i bought from was: 2malik but it was under amazon prime</li>
    <li> I love my Mia. After hearing about it on a beauty blog I decided that I needed to try it myself. I was skeptical after the first few days because I didn&#x27;t really see any results but after two weeks my skin was smoother than ever and glowing. My makeup looks better and I feel more confident wearing less because my skin looks so great. I would recommend d this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie yet I&#x27;m always looking to find the best products while staying on a budget. I don&#x27;t frivolously buy the \\&quot;next big thing\\&quot; especially if it&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I took the leap to spend $100 (on sale) on the Clarisonic Mia, I read many consumer reviews and justified its cost because the manufacturer&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush has done wonders for my teeth and gums and I thought I might be able to skip or eliminate costly facials in which I very rarely indulge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve always had good to very good skin, I can honestly say that the Clarisonic Mia is one of the best beauty purchases I&#x27;ve made. In two weeks&#x27; time, the small areas of pigmentation I had from pregnancy 5 years ago have begun to fade and the tone, texture and clarity of my skin have dramatically improved. My skin positively glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin&#x27;s aged well despite years of abuse (I smoked for too many years before quitting plus sleep deficits and stress take a toll on your skin) strangers have always been taken aback when I tell them my true age (48). I&#x27;m usually pegged in my mid to late 30s. I admit I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the surprised looks I get when a cashier looks at my driver&#x27;s license or an acquaintance appears little stunned when I tell her I&#x27;m closing in on 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I feel with the Clarisonic I can stop the clock and even turn it back a few years to that \\&quot;mid-30s\\&quot; look that was beginning to fade - until Clarisonic Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From moisturizers to BB cream, they now glide over my skin. The tone of my skin is so even that I can easily skip make-up except for a little under-eye concealer and still look refreshed and awake. For a great day look, I use a touch of mascara, liner and lipstick and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> This skin cleansing system really works as described!  I use it twice a week, my skin feels &amp; looks better, softer, smooth!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always nice to purchase a product online that arrives exactly as you were hoping and this product does just that!</li>
    <li> this item looks fake. also looked like a refurb. i have a clarisonic mia from a noted beauty store and the look of this one is just not the same. and to add, the box is dirty(looked used and has marks) and the inside product is dusty, the seal was obviously opened before, it would be a shame to gift this. it would really be so unfair if i would be charge for restocking fee becoz clearly this item is not what was not the quality i expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised to see that cleared my acne up. I&#x27;ve had acne for over 10 years (I&#x27;m 28). I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions and proactive among other things. I only asked for this brush because I thought using it would help my face age gracefully. Sooo clear skin was a huge plus. I didn&#x27;t notice the whole purge thing and I&#x27;ve been using mine for 3 weeks. And it came with a sample of their face wash which I ended up loving too :)</li>
    <li> Everything came fast and in brand new condidtion.  The clarisonic Mia has made my face smooth!  If I hit the lottery, I&#x27;ll sent to my friends</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. I have to say it would get a 5 but for the price. I first had a Pretika for half the cost, but it was stolen after being left in a resort shower, I had to have another and Pretika&#x27;s now rotates instead of oscillates and that is a big disappointment so I had to break down and buy a Clarisonic. I love it but they could make it for less. I was buying teh Pretika ones for everyone for gifts because I love them so much. At the $100 for the Clarisonic brush, no one is getting them as gifts now, almost didn&#x27;t get one for myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit for my wife for Christmas and it was a big success.  She&#x27;s used it everyday and says she can already feel the difference in her skin after a few days--her face is softer and smoother.  Actually, I can feel a difference, too.  We visited one of our friends for Christmas and her teenage daughter swears by it clearing up her acne.  Seems like a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is, noticed a difference in my skin the first few days of using it.  I have sensitive skin so I only use it once a day, and still noticed my skin was softer, not dull and grey looking and the fine lines faded some.  I saw this product at my Skin Clinic for almost $50 more, so I purchased through Amazon.  Received it in less than a week.  I also had a chemical peel a few weeks after I purchased the product and I think the Skin Cleansing System worked almost as good as the peel did.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the Mia at Amazon.  I bought it at Beauty Brands as I had a 10% coupon.  I just had to review it, though.  I am 55 and have noticed more brown spots and various large pores and bumps on my face.  I was constantly adding foundation during the day to cover it all up.  I bought the Mia this Monday and started using it Tuesday night after the obligatory charge (today is Friday).  I keep stopping to look in the mirror.  My face is quite a bit brighter.  I haven&#x27;t added foundation all day.  The bumps are diminishing, although not all gone.  It SEEMS the brown spots are diminishing, but it is too soon to tell.  I think those results are remarkable for 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contemplating a $2000 laser treatment and now don&#x27;t think I will need it.  As I was researching the reviews for the fraxel treatment, someone mentioned the Clarisonic.  I never heard of it.  I saw it at the store and decided why not try it?  I could always return it.  Well, this thing is not going back!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 21 year old daughter started using it as well.  I&#x27;ve noticed her skin is brighter, although she didn&#x27;t have as many issues as I.</li>
    <li> After about three weeks of use, my skin is noticeably softer.  It did bring some acne to the surface, which I expected, but I actually expected a lot more (so it hasn&#x27;t been too bad).  I&#x27;m a tired parent so I wanted/needed something to help my drab skin.  This seems to be helping so far...hopefully I will continue to see improvements!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;ve had acne-prone skin my entire life and my pores are generally clogged (I have blackheads and clogged pores as opposed to large or cystic pimples), and I read the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. After the first use my skin appeared smoother and I had high hopes for extended use. However, after a week or so I noticed my breakouts were happening more frequently. I thought maybe my skin was getting worse before it got better but after regular usage every day for 6 months, I had to attribute my worsening breakouts to the Clarisonic. I stopped using the product and went back to my regular Neutrogena Grapefruit facewash and the breakouts lessened and eventually my skin went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if the breakouts have to do with the fact that I was using the same dirty cleansing brush head every single day. I re-read the product instructions and even researched online to see if you&#x27;re supposed to clean the brush but there was no mention of it. Perhaps this product works for people with normal, acne free skin, but for me, a girl with the occasional clogged pores, random breakouts, and blackheads, this only made my skin worse. I would never recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Clarisonic...use it right in the shower.  It keeps a charge for over a week.  I actually miss it when I go on vacation and don&#x27;t have it with me.  Your skin feels so soft and clean after using it.  I noticed some positive results within a week of using it.  You can use it with whatever cleaning solution you usually use, but works best with a foaming or gel type.</li>
    <li> After reading the glowing reviews of the Clarisonic (including a personal one from the SIL), I really did think this would shrink my pores and result in glowing skin.  It did not.  Nothing bad happened, but no improvements happened either.  I looked forward to washing my face every day for the first few months.  The dirt came off my face.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It&#x27;s not an exfoliator, it&#x27;s a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in for a professional facial a few months ago and the woman used this on my face.  She touted it&#x27;s benefits and said it really helps clean your face.  Then she told me that she sold them in her store for a GREAT price:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have concerns that you are not cleaning your face well enough with cleanser, water, and your hands, then this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I am a total skeptic, i WANT to hate things i&#x27;m not familiar with.  I have to admit, several of my friends had tried to talk me into buying this product over the past year, and i never did - BIG.MISTAKE.  I absolutely love it.  i have used it for a couple of months and i definitely notice a difference in my skin.  It is brighter, smoother and my pores appear smaller.  I love the smaller size of the mia....it&#x27;s a perfect fit in the palm of your hand.  It&#x27;s very sleek and modern looking, and it holds the charge for a super long time,which is nice.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to travel w/.  Some reviewers complained of the price, but i think it&#x27;s well worth it!!</li>
    <li> $100 for a facial scrub brush might seem like a lot, but this is absolutely worth it. I really feel like nothing compares to this brand of brush. I&#x27;m glad I got the Mia - it&#x27;s a perfect size and I can mentally change areas without the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; from the Pro system. If you have your eye on this, take the plunge - you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> By far this is my favorite of the Clarisonic brushes that I&#x27;ve used and I even have the most up to date one.  I like the way it fits in my hand and the size of the brushes. On the other hand I prefer the charge bases on the other types.  Having to position this brush in such a way to make sure the charger stays connected can be awkward.  That said I still like it.</li>
    <li> Only function 1 month.  Dont get charged.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia is great and I&#x27;m a man and wouldn&#x27;t cleans my face with nothing else.  No face cloths for me and no imitation products either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
    <li> This product near single handedly saved my face from fine lines, flaky skin, and acne. A \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush head comes with it, and you&#x27;re supposed to use the brush 2 times a day... but that left my face looking like I was a burn victim! My face looked raw. So I switched to \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; brush heads and scrub my face once a day, and my skin is smooth and vibrant, not burning and sore. Also you need to realize that you will need to put on a heavier cream afterwards, because it dries out the skin. If you don&#x27;t use serum, you&#x27;re missing the point of what the clarisonic brush was made for. It deep cleans and preps your skin so serum is more effective. Then at night, put on a heavier night cream and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Bought one, it broke, called Clarisonic and found out it was counterfeit, Called Amazon and they made it good. Credited my account and sent a label for return....Copy of letter from Clarisonic follows    Letterhead Header US copy.jpg      Feb 22 2013    Re: Product purchased from Amazon    Dear Mr. Benavides    We understand that you attempted to purchase a Clarisonic product from Amazon.com The purpose of this letter is to state that Clarisonic is not affiliated with Amazon nor is this website an authorized reseller of Clarisonic’s products.

    <li> I am just going to go straight to the point. So I bought this over a month ago and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. Apparently, water has gotten under the button and it is not turning on. Also, I bought a different brush, so when I went to change it, the inside was all rusty and brown. My friend also has one but she bought it from sephora. Hers is perfectly fine with no water underneath the brush or the button. Guess this means I got a defective one. So, please next time make sure to check that the clarisonic is in prime condition!! That is the only reason I am giving it a 2 star. As for the clarisonic itself, it really cleans and gets down deep. My face feels softer and I am starting to see my blackheads disappear, slowly but surely. So anyways, I am gonna have to call the customer service and get it exchanged. It is such a hassel :/</li>
    <li> Normally I would not buy this product because I am in college. Since it was Christmas I thought I would reward myself, and I just gone through Accutane (I have had serve acne) so I thought this product would be perfect. Its not. My Clarisonic stopped working after 2 months. Save yourself some cash, do not buy this product off of here.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday. My skin feels wonderful. Gave it my sister and daughter and they also have received the same great results.</li>
    <li> I contacted Clarisonic customer service (1-888-525-2747) about a Mia I bought from this seller via Amazon. The issue was that the unit was buzzing loudly and was showing signs of rust after less than 2 months of use.    Clarisonic said they were unable to find the product number printed on the Mia (at base of the handle) in their database, consequently, the Mia I received is likely to be counterfeit. I lodged a formal complaint with Amazon and was issued a return/refund.    I recommend that Mia buyers either call Clarisonic (1-888-525-2747) or register the product at the Clarisonic website ([...]) immediately upon receipt of the Mia to check if the item received is genuine. And if not, to initiate a return and lodge a formal complaint with the the Amazon investigation team.</li>
    <li> I sent the Mia back as it didn&#x27;t work correctly while it was initially charging. I never received a refund. I received and email saying the Mia was received and then I never received a credit in my account or a refund check. This makes me very upset. My daughter gave me the Mia as a gift. The first one vibrated and the second one didn&#x27;t work either. Very strange. I received a credit for the first Mia..never received a credit for the second one. What is going on? Please put the credit into my account. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  My face and skin feels so clean.  I have this clean, polished looked when I use my Clairsonic.  It&#x27;s def worth the $$$</li>
    <li> I tried to register this Mia on the Clarisonic and couldn&#x27;t. I then found after looking at other Mia&#x27;s in stores the serial numbers were put on differently. This one rusted after a week, brush head very rough, brush cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on, and the magnet in the handle for the charger was very weak. I realized after buying one in a store and registering it, just how different the one I received via mail order was. Just be ware of this happening. I had no problem returning it. I do love the Mia, has cleared my skin up. Just make sure it&#x27;s real.</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying this product you are probably worrying about a few things. The most notable issue is the expensive price, only second to whether or not the product actually works. Let me reassure you that this product will truly change your skin forever, if you will let it. The Clarisonic Mia IS worth every penny and it does work remarkably well.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had mostly clear skin that is extremely sensitive to any product that it comes in contact with. I did not get a lot of pimples or blemishes but I had the terrible habit of picking at the sores whenever I was stressed and the results were not pretty. After going through any and every cleanser available, I looked online and found this product. I was skeptical at first, it seemed to good to be true and it was an electric scrub brush... As I read more about the product I became more and more intrigued and decided, after three weeks, to buy it. As soon as it arrived in the mail I immediately ran to the bathroom and tried it (even though the directions said to wait). I expected a miracle instantly but I quickly realized that my face looked no different, just very clean. Nevertheless, I can say after three months of using the product it changed my skin and has predominately removed any blemishes and even helped with the small scars on my face.&lt;br /&gt; Many of you will now say, \\&quot;what about the purging\\&quot; period in the second week. First, I can say that the purging period is real and it happens for most people. Essentially the brush is removing years of gunk and buildup in your pores after you begin using it. I admit, I broke out in buckets and it scared me to death. I actually stopped using the brush for a week. I saw it on my shelf later and realized that I had to retry it (it was $100) and this time I didn&#x27;t break out as much. Within a few weeks I had the clearest skin I have ever had in my life. Yesterday I went out without any foundation on and I was not worried about my appearance in any way. I haven&#x27;t gone out without makeup since high school so that is a huge step. I still get a pimple here and there but the brush gets rid of them quickly and I get one tenth of the amount now. Ask me if the product is worth it? Yes, it is 100% worth every cent. Will you purge for a week? It is possible, especially for those of you with sensitive skin, but I promise it will go away; stick with it. If you are debating buying the product, it&#x27;s worth the splurge, I promise.</li>
    <li> i have combination/acne prone/sensitive skin &amp; i have to say this is the best thing i&#x27;ve ever done for my skin. it&#x27;s more smooth and even, my breakouts are significantly less, and my skin feels super clean after using it. i&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic is the best skin cleansing system ever. I bought for my cousin and she loves it! She will never switch to anything else and her face has never been so clear!</li>
    <li> Good product for facial cleansing and you can take it in the shower.  I use a different cleanser that the one provided with the Mia, but the result is the same...great clean skin.  Liked it so much that I bought one for each of my three daughters.  One of my sons-in-law uses it and it helps cut down on ingrown hairs in his beard.  Easy to charge and it automatically stops after 2 minutes of cleansing.  Just important to change the brush head every 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I bought this. Lots of people told me that I have clear skin. I look younger! Very good!!</li>
    <li> This product works just like the reviews said it would. I notice a lot cleaner and smoother skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the full size Clarisonic and loved it for six months or so. Then it died.  So, I bought a Mia a few months ago -- and now it beeps constantly and won&#x27;t take a charge. The charge never lasted longer than one shower.  When these work, they are great, but two duds is a bit much, especially for something in this price range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mia for about one month and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My skin is clearer, smoother, pores seem smaller and there is an increased glow. In the evenings I use a makeup remover, then use a cleanser with my Clarisonic. I can see all of the extra makeup &amp; grime removed right there on the brush, so I know it works. I also believe their claim that use of the brush improves absorption of products because my skin is better hydrated and my mild case of rosacea seems to be improving. Are my results miraculous? Nah, but I&#x27;m a believer and will never be without my Mia.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself as my holiday present.  I was so excited...my skin has been somewhat dry and rough and I was looking forward to some good exfoliation and cleansing.  I have some friends who have used it and have nothing but good things to say about it and how great their skin has been since they started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes about my conditions: I usually have very clear skin.  I have sensitive skin and use only Aveda makeup and facial cleanser.  I usually use the yellow clinique lotion, although sometimes I need more moisture than it provides as my skin can get pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, even with the Sensitive Skin head, it was still way too harsh for my skin.  I gave it a chance...I was expecting a bit of a breakout like you get when you have a facial (any the gunk that has been trapped rises to the surface).  I started out using it with my gentle Aveda cleanser but it caused a lot of dryness and irritation.  Even when I waited a few days between uses, I was still causing too much irritation.  I also tried it once with the cleanser that comes in the package...cleanser felt good, but my skin was still irritated too much (this was after waiting a week from the last use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, as long as you have the ability to return it, you might still want to try it, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother if you don&#x27;t have the ability to return after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;- After having this for only a couple of weeks, the metal clips that connect the brush head to the unit were rusty.  Maybe that doesn&#x27;t matter to the longevity or use but I don&#x27;t want something I&#x27;m using on my face to have any rust associated with it.&lt;br /&gt;- It is ridiculous that this item doesn&#x27;t come with a stand of some sort.  It would cost them almost nothing to produce and would give you a better way to dry the product.  Right now you either leave it flat on it&#x27;s back or you tip it forward towards its face.</li>
    <li> Great product and completely met expectations. Definitely met needs and would highly recommend. Don&#x27;t need the lotion, but would recommend extra brush  heads.</li>
    <li> Not really a review of the product but I thought I was purchasing a new item, but this appears to have been opened and tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a med student and for some reason last semester (probably due to stress), I started breaking out very badly.  My skin hadn&#x27;t been that bad since I was 12!  I purchased this over break, and have been using it for about a month and absolutely LOVE it!  Its made a huge difference and makes my skin so soft- not only that, the Refreshing gel smells so wonderful!  Love it, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it came packaged in a Clarisonic box with Clarisonic logos etc all over but when I called Clarisonic to register the product, they told me it was a fake.  They asked me to take the brush head off and when I did, it was all rusty inside - gross!  Needless to say I am returning it and going to buy a real one from the Clarisonic website.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Cleansing System was purchased for my daughter who has a case of acne.&lt;br /&gt;By using the system every evening, her face looks much better. It has helped her so much.  I have tried this system myself&lt;br /&gt;and it certainly does make your face feel so clean.  My only problem is that my daughter won&#x27;t share!&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess I will have to purchase my own system.  Clarisonic - thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002XURD32 Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to order the Clarisonic Mia(TM) Skin Cleansing System ... ASIN: B002XURD32 ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Prime Membership ... and because this item is Fulfilled by Amazon I would get free 2 day shipping and no tax and pay a total of $98.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This same item is sold directly by Clarisonic (Pacific Bioscience Laboratories Inc) would cost me for $119.00 with tax of $8.03 ... free UPS Ground shipping which would take 5 business days to be delivered to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I wanted the price savings and faster shipping offered by the Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered about the price difference and called Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to receive and email from Clarisonic&#x27;s Customer Care informing me that \\&quot;please note that amazon.com is not an authorized dealer; therefore purchases made from these sites are not eligible for money back refunds and in some cases, warranty replacements due to the numerous \\&quot;non-authentic\\&quot; product bearing our name that is sold on that site.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this e-mail ... I read the reviews on the Amazon site (from customers who ordered the Clarisonic System from Amazon&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see for yourself ... more than a few customer received \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; ... or were unable to register the product because the serial numbers did not indicate it was a Clarisonic product. Defective were products were therefore not covered by warranties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question WHY ?????  !!!!!!  Amazon is offering the Clarisonic product for sale when apparently in many instances it has been reported as a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; ... and the warranty was not honored by Clarisonic. There is no mention on the site that the product may not be a genuine Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase directly from Clarisonic ... paying full price ... rather than risk getting \\&quot;stung\\&quot; with a shady purchase made through the Amazon site.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews, but I feel this one is necessary to save others from the trouble I have to go through.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product through Amazon thinking I was purchasing an authentic Clarisonic product.  WRONG!!!  (I should mention that I tried to register my handle the day it came in on the Clarisonic website, but the code didn&#x27;t accept.  I just thought their site was down for that day and I&#x27;d try again later.  Come to find out, there was a reason the code didn&#x27;t accept!)&lt;br /&gt;The Mia worked fine for the first month.  Then it came time to charge the handle.  I charged it for 24 hours, it didn&#x27;t turn on.  I charged it for another 24 hours.  Same thing.  So I called in to Clarisonic Customer Service and gave them my product ID number.  The service rep said that is not an authentic Clarisonic product.  They do not sell Clarisonic products on Amazon.  WHAAAAAT?!  Then why is it listed as such?!  He suggested I call Amazon Customer Service and request a return ASAP which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY disappointed that Amazon would sell fake products.  This is a company I have grown to love and trust over the past few years.  Now I feel very unsure about buying through them.  Shame on you Amazon!  Take this product off your website now please!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic system is wonderful..when it works. I bought this, used it for three months and it stopped charging. Clarisonic couldn&#x27;t help me because the lot number was invalid - meaning this is a fake unit. Thankfully, Amazon refunded me and were lovely about the return process.</li>
    <li> Great facial tool!  feels great on my skin and I love how it cleans so much better than just soap and water.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Is gentle enough to be used daily.  Gives skins a clean healthy glow.  After about a week my skin was almost completely clear.</li>
    <li> I should have read the negative product reviews...my Clarisonic was also non-registerable on their website and would not be covered under warranty. Thankfully, Amazon was very understanding and gave me a full refund while allowing me to ship it back for free</li>
    <li> The clarisonic stopped working after 3 months and when I called to check on the year warrantee that is listed on the box the lot number at the base of the brush wasn&#x27;t even a lot number that the company made. I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> some many wonderful reviews exist for this product not sure how to add anything meaningful. except that when I was at my aveda spa, my Esthetician asked if I used it and I said yes but that I had purchased the Mia model. she said that&#x27;s all you need. she showed me the other speeds on the professional version and said the Mia speed is really all you need!  go to know. p.s. I have not had any of the breakouts that others mention, but I only use my Mia every other day.</li>
    <li> A truly amazing product. Great for smoothing your skin and gentle enough for acne. Vastly improved the appearance of my face and cleared up my pimples. Works BEAUTIFULLY with Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
    <li> Then it broke. Love the system... My skin was clearer and softer. Just this week it stopped working and - of course - is no longer returnable.</li>
    <li> This product actually works.  It clears out the skin and also give you a light massage.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Clarisonic.  When you are finished using it your face is so clean, shiney and smooth. I have been using it for 3 days now and can tell a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from SouthSun Beach, and since the order was fulfilled by Amazon, and it was a similar price to what the manufacturer charged, I thought this was the genuine article. Fast forward 3 weeks of having this product. The interior has started to rust, and the bristles on the head are falling apart. I went to the Clarisonic website to get advice, and they informed me that this was not a product made by them. The serial number is incorrect. Luckily, Amazon is understanding and will be refunding my money, but DO NOT purchase this item!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend the money for a Clarisonic Mia, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have suffered with acne since I was in 7th grade. My skin got even worse after the birth of my daughter, I was so desperate! The Mia seriously has changed my skin, it is smooth, feels so clean, and my acne is noticeably better after only 2 weeks of use morning and night! I totally recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself thinking that it would improve my skin, but instead has done the reverse. Even after purchasing a gentler brush head, my skin has broken out all over, and I&#x27;ve had to receive treatment from a dermatologist who told me that she has now treated many people who have had an adverse reaction to this brush. Beware!</li>
    <li> Worth the investment. had the cheaper store bought brand before and it didnt hold up through all the water damage and wear and tear. the clarisonic is quality, made to stand the wear and tear of every day use. Worth the price, works gently on skin. there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s such a popular product, make the investment and you will appreciate it!</li>
    <li> I bought two Clarisonic cleansing systems from two different sellers that were both fulfilled and shipped by Amazon.  The one from Beauty Shop Depot came in a clean box with the tape over the opening intact.  The one from ProTronics came in a dirty box that had obviously been already opened (no tape, and a couple of torn bar code stickers attached to the bottom of the box) and the trial cleanser was missing from the box.  The units were also slightly different pink colors.  As other reviewers have mentioned, some of the units sold through Amazon are not authentic Clarisonic products, and I suspect that the ProTronics cleanser is not a real Clarisonic product.  I haven&#x27;t used either unit yet so I can&#x27;t rate the effectiveness of the product, but I will return the ProTronics unit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a product review before, but this was the most disappointing purchase and I had to share my experience.  I was so excited about this product; I&#x27;d heard great things about Clarisonic from my friends and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I ordered the pink and it worked for about six weeks; I noticed a few things that were weren&#x27;t quite right (the LED charge light burnt out quickly, etc) and last week it quit charging/working altogether.  I called Clarisonic to collect on the warranty, and after reading the rep the serial number she told me it was not a real Clarisonic but a knockoff and that they&#x27;d had many complaints before about Clarisonics purchased through Amazon...these are NOT real Clarisonics and Amazon is not an authorized retailer of the Clarisonic brand.  I&#x27;ve never had such a negative experience with an Amazon purchase...be forewarned, these come in what looks like very legitimate packaging and even have serial numbers and magnetic chargers, but are not real.  Please only buy from the Clarisonic website!!</li>
    <li> I got one for myself first. Then for my teen and now for my Mom. My teen&#x27;s forehead was filled with the usual puberty pimples and they have improved greatly! My pores have minimised, too! My Mom&#x27;s cheeks have firmed &amp; she is amazed. We are all very happy with this Mia 1.</li>
    <li> I have what dermatologists call &amp;#34;depressed skin&amp;#34;, I have recurring breakouts because the cleansers I have used in the past have not been able to fully clean my skin and dirt would pile up. Clarisonic completely cleans my skin and removes all my make up. My one pitfall is that they said it helps tone down oily skin, my skin is still oily. It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks so maybe over time it will. But my breakouts have stopped and my skin is a lot cleaner and absolutely glowing so I definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this product, I knew it was worth every penny.  My skin has never looked better.  Not going to say it wipes away wrinkles but it definitely cleanses on a level I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve before, making my cleansing products (Dermalogica) much more effective which has meant very clear skin.  At 45 and pre-menopause,  I&#x27;d started getting acne again and fought with it for a year before finding this product.  I use it 1-2 times a day and make sure to let the brush do the work; it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Both the Clarisonic and Skinsonic are the same but the Skinsonic is $29 bucks on Amazon. Here&#x27;s my review on both! I love my Skinsonic and it comes with 5 brushes. [...]</li>
    <li> Be careful when considering the purchase of this specific item on Amazon. I found out after I bought this brush that it is actually a bogus. It turns out that amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and that the brush cannot be registered on the clarisonic.com site because the code on its handle is a fake one. I recommend staying with authorized dealers for this product because they sell the clarisonic products and thus facilitate the buyers&#x27; access to info and discounts on many skin-care products.</li>
    <li> I spoke with Amazon customer service today to report this item as a counterfeit. The metal connection points for the brush attachment began to rust and we contacted Clarisonic. Based on the serial number, they told us that we had purchased a counterfeit product. Amazon is taking care of me and providing a refund, but I also asked that this issue be escalated. I was assured that it would be and that the seller would be removed from Amazon. I wanted to write a review to let others know not to purchase from them. I see know that there are similar comments from others so I am not confident that Amazon will follow through.</li>
    <li> This is my second mia and I love the product. I only replaced my last mia because the battery died after two years of twice daily usage. I love the clarity of my skin and it has helped tremendously with my acne.</li>
    <li> After using the Clarisonic Mia, my husband says my skin is radiant just as it is from a professional facial. I use it twice a day, and sometimes once a day, then tone and moisturize w/SPF 15 and special eye moisturizer. Hardly a need for blush because cheeks have a rosy glow. I would suggest this for men too....may clear up ingrown beard hairs for the guys.</li>
    <li> I debated about spending the money for this for more than a year, but finally gave in. It is worth every penny! My husband and coworkers and friends have all noticed how great my skin looks and my pores are noticeably smaller, especially on my nose. Very happy!</li>
    <li> It is like a facial every time I wash.  When I talk to folks in the beauty industry about my Clarisonic, they often reveal they have one and I always feel the excitement build in the room.  We know the benefits of the product and it just feels good.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for five days and can already see a dramatic difference in my skin. I strongly recommend it and think it was definitely worth the money :)</li>
    <li> Wife enjoys this very much.  She uses the product on a regular basis and will likely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I use the Clarisonic in the morning and evening. I can tell the diffrence in my skin when I use it my skin FEELS cleaner. Several times I had not used the Clarisonic for a day and had pimples starting to form on my face. Somewhat pricey but it works.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but it stopped working after two years (only used it a handful of times). It never held a charge and now when I try to charge my Mia it just pulses but will not charge or turn on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife. She called Clarisonic because it wasn&#x27;t working and Clarisonic said they do not sell on Amazon and that this product is not theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a knock off claiming to be Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> wanna a clean face but this.</li>
    <li> I bought the mia because it seemed like everyone had only positive things to say about it. It takes all the extra dirt and makeup out of your pores that you would never be able to remove with face wipes and face wash alone. I can&#x27;t imagine not using it now. I will say this; Before I bought it, I was led to believe that it would pretty much make my acne go away. It is a great product, but not a miracle worker. If you have acne caused by stress or anything other than dirt and bacteria, do not expect for it to clear your acne, because it will NOT. Overall, awesome, awesome, awesome. Great investment!!</li>
    <li> (I didn&#x27;t want to review this product until I had owned and used it for a considerable amount of time.  As I write this, I have had my Clarisonic for about 8 months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic hit the nail on the head with this product. I would recommend it to everyone (and I usually do). I use it in the shower at least once (sometimes more) a day.  It is wonderful.  Cleans my face and neck wonderfully.  Holds a charge for a long time.  Is compact, and travels well.  I&#x27;ve tried several of these face washers and in terms of durability and long-lasting use, this blows every other one out of the water.  Clarisonic is expensive, but completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using dermabrasion face washers about a year or two ago....fed up with adult acne and willing to try anything....  I didn&#x27;t start with Clarisonic.  I started with a Pretika.  It was good, but it died (read: went crazy) after a few months.  My skin cleared up so much, that I wanted another one, but I wasn&#x27;t going to purchase the same product again, so I tried a few other face-brushes.  Long story short: they all crapped-out. Finally I thought: \\&quot;I might as well try a really good one, since I&#x27;m spending the same amount of money on all these crappy ones.\\&quot; ....and here we are today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped with my adult acne so much.  Unlike creams, or facewashes, or everything else under the sun that I&#x27;ve tried, my skin has stayed clear for a considerable amount of time.  I completely chalk-it-up to more effective washing with a dermbrasion face brush over whatever else you can do to your skin.  While the other dermbrasion face brushes I tried cleared my skin up too (that&#x27;s why I kept trying so many), they were unreliable pieces of machinery.  This product consistently works, and also has the best features of all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my Clarisonic in the shower; I think this is the reason my other ones died--they just aren&#x27;t made for being in the shower (which is dumb, because I think that&#x27;s prime time to use it).  It holds a charge very well (I can usually get about 2 weeks out of mine before I hook it up again  (vibrates an extra time when it shuts off to let you know it needs to be charged again)). I have nothing but good things to say about my Clarisonic Mia!  I love it.  It travels well, as it is small, and I love that the brushes come with a cap/lid, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles getting all cruddy and bent when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: great product; worth the money! If you like face brushes, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on anything else.  You&#x27;re worth the best. This is the best.</li>
    <li> I actually own the Mia 2, but they&#x27;re basically the same machine except the Mia 2 has a timer (big whoop). But this was the best money I ever spent. I have been using it for about 3 months now and my skin looks amazing. I haven&#x27;t broken out since I started, and my once super oily skin has now toned down. My huge pores are getting smaller, and my complexion is glowy and even. I find myself not even using foundation very often anymore, instead going barefaced or  using only a tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments from family, friends, co-workers, strangers. This product is holy grail for me. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had my eye on one of these for several months before I bought it, and I am so glad I did.  I used to get a couple of pimples a week, but when using this consistently, I hardly ever break out.  It really helps your skin absorb lotion and feel so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer support is also incredible.  After using 2-times/day for a little under a year, my Clarisonic has been doing this thing where it turns itself on and off again (this was very startling when it first happened at 3AM, haha.)  I called customer support, they looked up the model number, and now are sending me a brand new Mia with no issues.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> My daughter, who is an aesthetist, requested this product for her Christmas present.  She says it is very reliable and effective, and recommends this brand to all her clients.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just wish the replacement brushes weren&#x27;t so expensive.  It is a good investment for your skin and makes your cleansers last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> So when I purchase a product I read all of the bad reviews first.  It seems those that didn&#x27;t care for the product fell into 3 categories.  1 - the product broke 2 - they already get facials and the product doesn&#x27;t compare 3 - they already had troubled skin and this product didn&#x27;t fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I realized Clarisonic wouldn&#x27;t honor the warranty under Amazon, I would have purchased it through Clarisonic. My bush is working fine so it still gets my 5 stars as of now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be very clear, i&#x27;m by no means the type of person to pamper myself on a regular basis.  In fact, I wanted this product because the only time I take to wash my face is when I&#x27;m showering.  Facial discoloration isn&#x27;t my friend so I do apply a great deal of foundation and well, I put it on in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t come off until the next morning (I know, I know shame on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, I work out a great deal so my face gets pretty oily from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say I have average skin.  I&#x27;m not prone to acne but I will break out if I don&#x27;t properly wash my face and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Mia does for me is pretty awesome.  I really can&#x27;t believe how soft my face is to the touch and it is visibly clearer. I love that it can be used in water - I encourage it actually.  If you don&#x27;t have a nice lather going, the brush will cause your face to get irritated.  Moisturize afterwards!!!  I read a reviewer complain that their skin became more oily because their glands went into overdrive to compensate for lack of moisture.  This hasn&#x27;t happened to me with this product but I can say it has happened to me with my hair/ scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those that call the Mia just a vibrating tool, I suppose it is but there is no way I could do that much scrubbing with cleaner that thoroughly, especially over the pores on my nose. It&#x27;s also way less sloppy, more relaxing, uses less cleaning product, and is super quick. In short it actually causes me to wash my face on a regular basis AND enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel for those that purchased the product and expected it to help with extremely troubled skin. So when I give this product 5 stars, please, please, please take into consideration that I have average skin that I hadn&#x27;t previously taken care of the way that I should have.  If I went to the spa, I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to be better than a true facial but it is pretty affordable in comparison.</li>
    <li> I love this little scrubber and use it every day.  Very durable and have even dropped it a few times and it keeps on working.  The battery last me a week and I use this twice a day!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin. Some areas of my face are very dry and some parts  are very oily. I have blackheads all over my cheeks but ever since I use this for cleansing or as makeup remover in daily basis, I can&#x27;t explain the result. I love it and it works like a magic on my skin. My sister didn&#x27;t like it though because she tried the sensitive brush and she told me she got some pimples next day. I recommended to use the regular brush. You should try all different kind of brushes available before giving up this product because trust me it worth every single penny :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Mia through Amazon.  I feel compelled to warn new users about a possible complication to using this product.  I used this product just TWICE.  I read all the reviews and was very careful to not push too hard or \\&quot;overuse\\&quot; it.  They recommend one minute of use and I did not even use it for that long.  After my second use, I notice broken capillaries on my cheeks.  I immediately stopped using it and searched the internet to see if this was a problem among other users and found that it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use this product under direction of a dermatologist, whom I believe after reading so many problem reviews of this product, is the ONLY  person qualified to deem your skin in need of this type of cleaning.  I now have to see a dermatologist to try and treat my permanently, ruined skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please research this product thoroughly.  And please see a dermatologist for the recommendation and not an esthetician, med-spa \\&quot;specialist\\&quot; or friend.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and this has helped so much to make it glow again. It made a huge difference and I would recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I bought the deep pore cleansing brushes when I had break-outs and I am very happy with my complexion now.  My skin is radiant and even toned. I am very pleased with the service I always receive from Amazon.  I was able to find them at a great price.  Hooray for Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I have the origins clarisonic.  I think this one is better bc its has a smaller body, has 2 speeds and a much smaller charging mechanism than the original, so it takes up much less space on the counter.</li>
    <li> Pro-x professional cleansing system will save you over $100.00 and works just as well if not better...It is gentle on the skin, my face, which tends to break out has completely cleared up, and you can use it with whatever cleanser you desire...just mentioning this for those who do not want to pay a high mark up price for a system, when you can buy one that works just as well for so much less.  So for those of you who do not want to throw your money away, but would like a good affordable cleansing system, go with the Olay pro-x...far more affordable and works just as well...!!</li>
    <li> There is no better way to cleanse your face every day.  It gets your face &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; clean, unlike just using a cloth.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was worth the splurge to buy, but my face has never felt cleaner or looked better!!</li>
    <li> I had gotten severe cystic acne this past summer out of nowhere that sadly, scarred the entire side of my face.  After using the clarisonic for a month, I have already seen a HUGE difference in my face! The scarring is slowly disappearing and I haven&#x27;t had a single cyst since using it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a gentle (like a cetaphil) cleanser that I bought from my dermatologist in the morning and use Nuetrogena scrub at night with it.  I haven&#x27;t used the cleanser that comes with it.  I charged my the entire twenty four hours after receiving it and after 25 days, am just recharging it, but it hadn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s charge yet.  I use it twice a day.  I would recommend this to anyone as I have seen dramatic results!</li>
    <li> I god this product 3 weeks ago. I have adult acne. I do not use the face wash that comes with it I use my own.  I have noticed that I don&#x27;t get a lot of the deep pimples so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it my face does feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> This was counterfeit.  Do not buy. I called them direct and gave them the serial number and it wasn&#x27;t their product</li>
    <li> I had been wanting one of these for quite some time and am very pleased to have found that the hype about this product is all true! After the first use, my skin instantly felt smoother. The brush was not harsh on my face at all. The next day, I could see results in the way my skin glowed and how quickly blemishes started to vanish. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price because I&#x27;m saving thousands of dollars on make-up removers. Will buy again and suggest to everybody I know!</li>
    <li> After using it a year. the rechargeable battery inside died today. it won&#x27;t charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;its funny that the battery died exactly right after their 1 year warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect to use it more than a year if you are considering purchase one.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the clean well scrubbed feeling I get from using this product.  I read all reviews and decided the cheaper model for $119 was perfect for me I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I bought this on a whim. A friend of mine recently purchased it and told me that her skin has never felt better! I have severe acne on my skin and my husband isn&#x27;t one to dish out compliments (even to his own wife). But after just two uses, he turns to me as we&#x27;re driving and told me that my skin looks so much better. I don&#x27;t know if I was more shocked to hear those words or to give kudos to an at home remedy that actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is naturally very oily and I used this on top of Retin-A and OBAGI as my face wash. Because both of the products contain salysylic acid, combined together they eally dried out my skin to the point where it peeled pretty bad, but that&#x27;s not the case for everyone. Once, the peeling passed after two days, my skin looked phenomenal. I don&#x27;t recommend using it everyday or even every other day. Bottom line, this product is amazing! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The shipping was incredibly fast! My package arrived within 3 days of me ordering the product.</li>
    <li> For the first month there was an improvement in my combination skin. After that it was noticeable that even with the sensitive head brush that twice a day use was too much and I cut back to once a day cleansing with the clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst the clarisonic did help my acne/blackheads it did not clear the problem completely, so don&#x27;t expect airbrushed perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly after 14 months the clarisonic developed an intermitant fault and started turning itself on and off randomly, even while just sitting on the bathroom self. As you cannot take the battery out I&#x27;ve had a few sleepless nights.&lt;br /&gt;Also as it is only guaranteed for 12 months it is now in the bin. I won&#x27;t be buying another at the price.</li>
    <li> The clarisonic Mia was supposed to come with a sample cleanser.  It did not!  It was a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware - I received this product, and noticed a typo on the packaging, so called the manufacturer, and after reading them the serial number, they confirmed it was a counterfeit product and was not warrantied by them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clearsonic white device and regret it everyday. I was adamant at first for spending ~$90.00 but decided to splurge and treat myself to one. This device is overrated and overpriced. The same week I used it the purple mesh pouch where I kept the Clearsonic bled into it and wasn&#x27;t able to remove the stain. Then around the seems it turned yellow , it looks like something I picked up at a second hand store. My face looks and feels the same, same issues I had before starting to use the Clearsonic (enlarged pores). I would recommend any similar brush, a more inexpensive will clean your face but no permanent noticeable results will come of it just like the Clearsonic. Bottomline: too expensive for what it is, IT&#x27;S A VIBRATING BRUSH!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft &amp; clean.  Use it morning &amp; night.  Recommend this product.  No need for 2 speeds, extra head for eyes.  age: 65</li>
    <li> I just received the product. The package is badly printed and the product smell so plastic. My roommate has one, and this one seems just not right. So I check on clarisonic.com and it turns out the code on the body is not valid.I have to return it. Be aware!!</li>
    <li> LOVE the product and was devastated when it quite working almost exactly one month after it arrived. I want to get another one but 100 bucks is a lot for something that might break in a month.  Where do I get one that will last?</li>
    <li> I currently deployed and I left my other one at home so I bought a new one. There is a major difference in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> The product lasted for only two months, when we called clarisonic to replace via the warranty the told us it was a fake.</li>
    <li> The product is as described! and I look forward to the benefits of clear, smooth skin. Awesome product and worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have tried everything OTC and Rx to clear up my skin.  Turns out I wasn&#x27;t getting a good enough clean.  I use the Mia at least twice a day and I no longer have any issues.  Everyone asks me what I did and I let them know I got a Mia!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my Mia in pink.  I purchased three more as gifts.  My face has never felt so clean and smooth.  I use once a day religiously.  I bought others for my Grandchildren and there complexion has greatly improved.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this item, I was very excited to find it for the low price. However, the item broke within a month of purchasing it! It began to randomly turn on and in 2 months it stopped working all together. Fortunately, Amazon refunded me the money and also did not charge me the $20 restocking fee when I complained that the item was completely broken AND supposedly has a one year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is a counterfeit! If you read other one star reviews, someone mentioned that a Clarisonic rep stated that they do not sell their products through Amazon. I ordered a real Clarisonic from elsewhere (and I know it&#x27;s real because I registered it on the Clarisonic website, something you should do if you want to verify your unit) and what a difference! First of all, the one I bought from Amazon left me red and irritated and the brush was rough but I thought that was how the product worked. When I got the real one however, my skin wasn&#x27;t red at all after using it and the brush was much softer against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be duped by the 5 star reviews. I mean if this thing has over 100 1-star reviews, you can already tell something is off. The $10 or so you save is not worth it. Luckily Amazon customer service is great and worked with me in refunding the money, but save yourself the trouble and call Clarisonic before you order one of their products online to make sure you&#x27;re purchasing from a verified retailer.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a Christmas present.  It recently quit working.  Clarisonic identified that the item was counterfeit.  I do not recommend purchasing items from this seller!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is my second and I will,always use one of these to clean my face. Worth every penny</li>
