### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t use them for all day in the sun at the pool, but for what I bought them for they were perfect.</li>
      <li>I think they worked perfectly for that use.</li>
      <li>These are great!  </li>

      <li>Hypoallergenic, they feel wonderful going on my face and they don&#x27;t cause issues for my kids.</li>
      <li>Great idea!</li>
      <li>The sunscreen wipes are awesome!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and my husband isn&#x27;t, so my two girls (2 and 5) have medium complexions.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re brilliant.</li>
      <li>These are great to have in your purse for your kids or self.</li>

      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>Great protection and so easy for application.</li>
      <li>In theory, it did, because he liked the easier application of the wipe on his face.</li>
      <li>They have a nice smell and you can see the lotion as you rub it on.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice too</li>
      <li>They smelled nice and were not greasy.</li>

      <li>I love love love them!</li>
      <li>but the fragrance is WAY too strong!</li>
      <li>These wipes work great for when I want to quickly protect their faces and arms without a huge ordeal.</li>
      <li>I think there could maybe be a bit more lotion on the wipes.  </li>
      <li>Thank you MD Moms for making such a great product!!</li>
      <li>Like I said, I wish they were a bit more saturated with the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Love these...easy to use and well saturated with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used sunscreen wipes on my kids before and they provided much more coverage than these.</li>
      <li>This is ok.</li>
      <li>I love that they are hypoallergenic and baby safe.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing these again unless I can find a better price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I thought this product would be more baby friendly</li>
      <li>They also do not smell like sunscreen and give off a very mild scent.</li>
      <li>Easy application to my face, and does not run into my eyes when I sweat.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t bother the kids.  </li>
      <li>These are so convenient and go on easily.</li>
      <li>So easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are so easy to use and don&#x27;t smell offensive.</li>
      <li>this is great for kids who dont like traditional sunscreen applied to their face.  </li>
      <li>Such a great idea.  </li>
      <li>A useful item to be sure but overpriced.</li>
      <li>Have loved these sunblock wipes since my 5 yr old was a baby.</li>
      <li>They are super portable and easy peasy to use.</li>
      <li>They are very convenient as well as being very easy to use.</li>
      <li>These are great, have been out in the sun as long as 2 hours after applying and no burns.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to put full on sunscreen lotion on her..</li>
      <li>Was quite dry, I wasn&#x27;t confident it effectively covered my son&#x27;s skin</li>
      <li>I have used them on my sun at home in California and they have been great, but we really put them to the test recently on a trip to Cancun.</li>
      <li>However, I think they h are worth it.</li>
      <li>Not only are these super easy to apply because you wipe them on, but my son never even had a hint of redness, they protected him so well!</li>
      <li>I called the company and they were very easy to work with, and they sent me a replacement pack and some free samples of other items.</li>
      <li>I have to use two each time and still don&#x27;t get enough to cover a suitable area.</li>
      <li>Putting sunscreen on my toddler and 3 month old baby is always a hassle, but with the towlettes the job is done very quickly.</li>
      <li>so I ended up using regular sunscreen on top.</li>
      <li>This is just like the iconic white mask seen on lifeguards, but it uses nano-particles, so it absorbs into your skin and disappears.  </li>
      <li>It was sunny, hot, humid and we were in and out of the pool all day.</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply and reapply on real little ones and pretty safe.</li>
      <li>Not only is it super convenient as a wipe and quickly applied, but this is ALSO a mineral-based sunblock: it uses oxides of Titanium and Zinc.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to toss in the beach bag or the back of the stroller for reapplication at the beach.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic for day trips, if you don&#x27;t want to bring a bottle of sunscreen that might open in your bag.</li>
      <li>I really like these sunscreen wipes.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these wipes!</li>
      <li>Great for sharing, like at the ball game.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think they work very well.  </li>
      <li>For $26 a pack I expected more.</li>
      <li>its messy, has that sunscreen smell, and I didn&#x27;t want it getting on her nice dresses/outfits and car seat, etc.</li>
      <li>I live in Texas and summers are hot here.</li>
      <li>Mostly all other sunscreens are chemical based.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply on the go when you are most likely in need of sunscreen for your little one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mess free, and I reach all areas quickly.</li>
      <li>Also, when the tots are this young you can get two kids pretty well covered with one wipe.</li>
      <li>Looking for a sunscreen for your baby that has both UVA and UVB ray protection and is safe and gentle for your little one?  </li>
      <li>Can be used multiple times during the day but dries out quickly.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use with a busy toddler running around that can&#x27;t stand still long enough to apply traditional sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Look no further on this simple towlette applicate with SPF 30 that is free of phthalates, lanolin, mineral oil, petroleum or waxes.</li>
      <li>At $26 a pop, I will use these only when I really need them!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also sensitive, my daughter had very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>These are useful when trying to apply sunscreen to a small child that wants wants nothing to do with sunscreen application.</li>
      <li>The chemical based sunscreens degrade over time in the sun and have to be reapplied frequently.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They do not stink and are soft on the skin.  </li>
      <li>For my 2 year old I use two towlettes.    </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that there are only 20 wipes in the package - wish there were more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would use them as my only sun protection if we were going to be out at the beach or in direct sunlight for a while since I find it easy to miss spots if you aren&#x27;t thorough with your application.  </li>
      <li>the lotion does go on very light, so I&#x27;m not confident that enough is actually getting on my son.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are very dry, not sure if there&#x27;s really anything getting on the kids.</li>
    <li> Helpful for on the go use. Easy application to my face, and does not run into my eyes when I sweat.</li>
    <li> I so wanted this product to work. I have a fair-skinned red head who hates to have sunblock applied. I was hoping this would take the struggle out of our mornings. In theory, it did, because he liked the easier application of the wipe on his face. But I feel like for the price, there is not enough lotion on the wipe, and secondly, I don&#x27;t think the protection was enough. He came home red-faced when I used them.</li>
    <li> These sunscreen towlettes are great. I live in Texas and summers are hot here. Putting sunscreen on my toddler and 3 month old baby is always a hassle, but with the towlettes the job is done very quickly. One towlette is enough for the baby. For my 2 year old I use two towlettes.    It&#x27;s mess free, and I reach all areas quickly. And, they smell so wonderful after they have been \\&quot;toweled down\\&quot; :o)    I can only recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Dried out when recieved. However only sunscreen I have found that didn&#x27;t cause a rash on my son with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these from another site, and loved them. Just ordered them for a field trip, and when I opened it to use it, it looked like it had already been opened, and the wipes were drier than previous packages. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! They are super portable and easy peasy to use. I love love love them! All the other parents and teachers are always asking where I get these.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Was quite dry, I wasn&#x27;t confident it effectively covered my son&#x27;s skin so I ended up using regular sunscreen on top.</li>
    <li> The sticky tab used for opening and closing the package does not stick correctly. The package was open when I opened the shipping carton.</li>
    <li> does not last long enough</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not only is it super convenient as a wipe and quickly applied, but this is ALSO a mineral-based sunblock: it uses oxides of Titanium and Zinc.  Mineral-based sunblocks form a physical block of the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. Think of it as applying pieces of rocks over your skin. This is just like the iconic white mask seen on lifeguards, but it uses nano-particles, so it absorbs into your skin and disappears.  Mostly all other sunscreens are chemical based.  The chemical based sunscreens degrade over time in the sun and have to be reapplied frequently.  Moreover, they have been shown to be endocrine disrupters.  Physical sunblocks work longer, cover a broader spectrum of the sun&#x27;s rays, and do not sting or burn because they are just rocks.</li>
    <li> This is ok. Didn&#x27;t expect the white film to be harder to rub off as others</li>
    <li> I think there could maybe be a bit more lotion on the wipes.  I felt as if they were a bit dry.  However, that said, they&#x27;re great to keep in your diaper bag and use on the go.  WIth the wipes, you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the sunscreen in the baby&#x27;s eyes, nose, or mouth.  They are expensive, but for the convenience, they are worth it.  Like I said, I wish they were a bit more saturated with the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I did not think it had enough sunscreen lotion in the wipe.</li>
    <li> These are great for children of all ages and I just keep them in the car and in my purse. No more fuss or tears about sunscreen on the face with these wipes and the kids can do it themselves.</li>
    <li> Expensive for sunscreen, but so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I would give these 5 stars if they weren&#x27;t so expensive. These are so convenient and go on easily. You do still need to rub it in a bit.</li>
    <li> Great for babies. Super easy to apply and reapply on real little ones and pretty safe. The smell is nice too</li>
    <li> Such a great idea.  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t bother the kids.  On the spend side though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still deciding how I feel about this product.  the lotion does go on very light, so I&#x27;m not confident that enough is actually getting on my son.  The idea is great though.  I will say he has not burned wearing it yet, so maybe enough is going on after all.</li>
    <li> Great protection and so easy for application. Only sunscreen I will use for the kids.</li>
    <li> I bought these wipes for times when I am out and about and my daughter (22 months) is in a sundress or something with exposed skin and I need sunscreen. I didn&#x27;t want to put full on sunscreen lotion on her.. its messy, has that sunscreen smell, and I didn&#x27;t want it getting on her nice dresses/outfits and car seat, etc. so I bought these wipes. I think they worked perfectly for that use. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use them for all day in the sun at the pool, but for what I bought them for they were perfect. They smelled nice and were not greasy. I would say the only negative is the price. At $26 a pop, I will use these only when I really need them!</li>
    <li> They seemed dried out. I was very disappointed because at that price point, I expected better. I&#x27;ve used sunscreen wipes on my kids before and they provided much more coverage than these.</li>
    <li> These sunscreen wipes were recommended to me by another Mommy. I have used them on my sun at home in California and they have been great, but we really put them to the test recently on a trip to Cancun. It was sunny, hot, humid and we were in and out of the pool all day. Not only are these super easy to apply because you wipe them on, but my son never even had a hint of redness, they protected him so well! I will continue to use these as long as they are around! Thank you MD Moms for making such a great product!!</li>
    <li> Looking for a sunscreen for your baby that has both UVA and UVB ray protection and is safe and gentle for your little one?  Look no further on this simple towlette applicate with SPF 30 that is free of phthalates, lanolin, mineral oil, petroleum or waxes.</li>
    <li> I really like these sunscreen wipes. They are so easy to use and don&#x27;t smell offensive. Actually, I don&#x27;t think they smell at all. The particular pack that was sent to me had an open seam in the back. I called the company and they were very easy to work with, and they sent me a replacement pack and some free samples of other items. I would recommend these to a friend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this product would be more baby friendly but the fragrance is WAY too strong! Look elsewhere mamas. This is not the product you want to be putting on your baby!</li>
    <li> These are useful when trying to apply sunscreen to a small child that wants wants nothing to do with sunscreen application. However, these are quite expensive. I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing these again unless I can find a better price.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen wipes are awesome! They are very convenient as well as being very easy to use. The ability to wipe it on, like using a washcloth, made my child not mind using sunscreen...always important with fair skin! Highly recommend these wipes!</li>
    <li> Love these sunscreen wipes! I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and my husband isn&#x27;t, so my two girls (2 and 5) have medium complexions. These wipes work great for when I want to quickly protect their faces and arms without a huge ordeal. Because these wipes are so expensive, I always keep them in a sealed ziploc bag when storing them, to prevent them from drying out.</li>
    <li> Use these on my face.  Work great for me.  I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are great!  The wipes make it easy to get good coverage on a squirmy toddler. They&#x27;re also sensitive, my daughter had very sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t irritate her at all. They are pricey, but we&#x27;ve never had an issue with sunburn.</li>
    <li> They have a nice smell and you can see the lotion as you rub it on.  Little gloss but not as bad as some other brands.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic for day trips, if you don&#x27;t want to bring a bottle of sunscreen that might open in your bag. Great for sharing, like at the ball game.</li>
    <li> We bought two packs of these for our seaside home when our toddler grandchildren came for a visit. They are easy to use, the children don&#x27;t mind being wiped--and last year they hated having gooey sunscreen wiped all over them--and we had no sunburns! They are easy to toss in the beach bag or the back of the stroller for reapplication at the beach. They are expensive and I wish they cost less, but it&#x27;s cheaper than treatment for skin cancer in forty years. Also, when the tots are this young you can get two kids pretty well covered with one wipe. We generally used two wipes for three children. Great idea!</li>
    <li> Love these...easy to use and well saturated with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Towelettes are practically dry.  I have to use two each time and still don&#x27;t get enough to cover a suitable area.</li>
    <li> These are great to have in your purse for your kids or self. They do not stink and are soft on the skin.  Love them!</li>
    <li> A useful item to be sure but overpriced. Can be used multiple times during the day but dries out quickly.</li>
    <li> These are great, have been out in the sun as long as 2 hours after applying and no burns. Why are these not being sold all over the place?? They&#x27;re brilliant.</li>
    <li> So convenient and works great. Easy to apply on the go when you are most likely in need of sunscreen for your little one. I then use the towelette on myself to use up any remaining sunscreen left over. My only gripe would be the cost and the greasy film it leaves on your hands which then gets on any object you touch afterwards. However, I think they h are worth it.</li>
    <li> As previous posters mentioned they are too dry. I also don&#x27;t think they work very well.  We always add an additional layer of sunscreen to our daughter because the wipes don&#x27;t seem to have any sunscreen on them. For $26 a pack I expected more.</li>
    <li> this is great for kids who dont like traditional sunscreen applied to their face.  my son even hated the stick.  this is the only way to apply without a meltdown.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes!! Living in Florida and especially during the summer, sunscreen on my 9 month old is essential. These wipes are the absolute easiest way to apply sunscreen and take no time at all to wipe down my son&#x27;s entire body with just one wipe. Since they are such a small package, I keep them in my diaper bag and always have them with me just in case we are out and I need to apply or re-apply sunscreen. I love that they are hypoallergenic and baby safe.  They also do not smell like sunscreen and give off a very mild scent. I&#x27;m not sure I would use them as my only sun protection if we were going to be out at the beach or in direct sunlight for a while since I find it easy to miss spots if you aren&#x27;t thorough with your application.  But I probably wouldn&#x27;t have a baby out in the sun for that long anyway.  My only complaint is that there are only 20 wipes in the package - wish there were more!</li>
    <li> Have loved these sunblock wipes since my 5 yr old was a baby. They are expensive but worth it to keep my kids from getting sunburns.</li>
    <li> Expensivel for  amount of towelletts in each packet. Will research other products</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite! Hypoallergenic, they feel wonderful going on my face and they don&#x27;t cause issues for my kids. Plus they are so simple to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Super easy to use with a busy toddler running around that can&#x27;t stand still long enough to apply traditional sunscreen.</li>
