      <li>If you are new to DE shaving there are some excellent resources on the web to help you find your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These blades are pretty great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good blade, sharp as very popular Feather and yet smoother.</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t take your face to the moon and return it safely, but they will leave it glass-smooth with a minimum of nicks.</li>
      <li>After trying everything under the sun including my second favorite Voskhod blades, I am very happy with them.</li>
      <li>I know it is time to change when I get a bit more pull feeling.</li>
      <li>Simply the BEST...</li>
      <li>Most of the comments specified mostly the &amp;#34;For Hospital Use&amp;#34; variety.</li>
      <li>Of course safety razor preference is an individual choice, but in my opinion these are the best blades on the market.</li>
      <li>I rate them in my top 5 DE choices and at $12 per 100</li>
      <li>I have used Feathers along with many others and this blade</li>
      <li>I easily get 4 shaves out of it before I even think about changing it.  </li>
      <li>I get super close shaves with no irritation regardless of the shave soap/cream I use!</li>
      <li>While more expensive than most safety razor blades, the Med Prep is considered to be one of the best blades by many who use a safety razor to shave.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, which for me rates just below Feathers and along with Gillette Silver Blue in is effectiveness as a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can not lose with this classically premium product, plus you get to keep a bit more of your money in your own pocket in the process.</li>
      <li>But again every whisker and skin is different and this blade may not work for you as good as it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These Personna Med Prep blades are unequivocally the Best double edge blades I have ever shaved with, Sharp, smooth with no pulls or nicks</li>
      <li>totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Compare that to ANY cartridge out there and this blade wins hands</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely rare for me to nick my face with one of these blades.</li>
      <li>These are a bit more costly than your Russian imports, but they are worth it and made in the USA besides!</li>
      <li>I went through a couple of sample set razors (including Feather), and eventually bought a large quantity of Greek Bics, which were pretty good.</li>
      <li>very good  long lasting</li>
      <li>As a bonus, they are made right here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried each of them in the Edwin Jagger DE89 that I bought right here on Amazon, which comes with five Derby blades.</li>
      <li>Hands down these double edged razor blades are the best one can buy.</li>
      <li>While the Lab Blue gives me a perfectly acceptable shave, it seemed a little grabby while making an across the grain pass.</li>
      <li>Quality is pretty consistent.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first week of shaving with the same blade (Muhle R89 razor) and am completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>A Google search for Personna 74-0002 double edge med prep blades will result in much better prices.</li>
      <li>The shaving community is a kind one with gentlemen willing to help out other gentlemen.</li>
      <li>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I significantly prefer these over the other Personna blues available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re my absolute favorites.</li>
      <li>These fit my razor and seem to last for a while.</li>
      <li>The performance was easily better than the five other brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Super sharp, very smooth and last forever.</li>
      <li>You will be surprised;)</li>
      <li>If the price makes you second guess, the Personna blues are not bad either.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend you give them a try.</li>
      <li>The blade never dragged or left any cuts - just a very smooth dry shave.  </li>
      <li>Personna represents the most enduring technology in personal care of the 20th Century and it still holds first place in the 21st Century.</li>
      <li>I could probably stretch it for a few more days if I cared to, but I do not.</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny extra you pay for them.</li>
      <li>They are sharp beyond belief, yet they shave smoothly.</li>
      <li>If 100 is too much to start with check out with some of the shaving forums and see if some one will send you a few for free, or trade up with some one.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay as sharp as long as the hospital blades, and I have had a one that would have served better as a butter knife than a razor.  </li>
      <li>wife gets two complete shaves on her legs with one blade, compared to the Lady Bic which costs 5 x as much and only shaves her twice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The performance is roughly the same at a much higher cost.</li>
      <li>This product is available at half the price listed here from other sources for a 250 razor pack.  </li>
      <li>While very sharp the Med Prep is also very forgiving.</li>
      <li>Feathers are sharper, though feathers are a little less smooth</li>

<li> Sharp, about the same as my rapira.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of others in the shaving forums and heard high praises - at least I won&#x27;t bleed out.</li>

<li> Sharp, smooth, expensive.</li>
<li> they used a Personna - and they used it dry!  </li>

<li> always have been and always will be...for wet shaving!</li>
<li> They are very sharp, smooth and long lasting but $54.25 for a hundred is an insane price.</li>
<li> They are very sharp and lasts forever.</li>
<li> I would recommend this blade to beginner or amateur wet shaver.</li>
<li> Having a heavy growth these blades cut through my beard with ease.</li>
<li> Won&#x27;t need razors for a few years.</li>
<li> These blades are sharp!!!</li>
<li> I usually shave every three to five days</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like it almost as well as a Feather.</li>
    <li> Simply the BEST...always have been and always will be...for wet shaving! Get a good soap (like Taylor&#x27;s &amp;#34;Mr. Taylor&#x27;s&amp;#34; exquisite product) to take the fullest advantage of a nick-free, super-close, ultra-smooth shaving experience. Personna represents the most enduring technology in personal care of the 20th Century and it still holds first place in the 21st Century. You can not lose with this classically premium product, plus you get to keep a bit more of your money in your own pocket in the process.</li>
    <li> Why did I buy these blades?  I&#x27;ve spent several times in the hospital, and each time they had to shave me for surgical prep they used a Personna - and they used it dry!  The blade never dragged or left any cuts - just a very smooth dry shave.  My thoughts are that I would try them on my face with a wet shave.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews of others in the shaving forums and heard high praises - at least I won&#x27;t bleed out.</li>
    <li> These fit my razor and seem to last for a while. I like them. I am not a verbose person. Please accept this feedback.</li>
    <li> After a test of many razor blades, I&#x27;ve found what I believe to be the best blade available. These are quite a bit more expensive than anything else avaialble, but there is nothing else like them. They are sharp beyond belief, yet they shave smoothly. They are worth every penny extra you pay for them.</li>
    <li> I bought the 100 pack of these &amp;#34;Hospital Use Only&amp;#34; razor blades after doing some testing with other brands. I bought sample packs of five razor blades each of five different brands. I tried each of them in the Edwin Jagger DE89 that I bought right here on Amazon, which comes with five Derby blades. A total of 6 brands in the same razor, using each one twice before replacing. I even kept a spreadsheet detailing my experience with each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience may or may not mirror your own. Various factors can influence the quality of your shave: Prep, soap type, how well you lather, shave angle are all in play here. If you are new to DE shaving there are some excellent resources on the web to help you find your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the Personna Blue and Med Prep blades in the mix with the others. I could definitely tell the difference between them. While the Lab Blue gives me a perfectly acceptable shave, it seemed a little grabby while making an across the grain pass. The Med Prep does not. I don&#x27;t know why, and I don&#x27;t care. I DO know that I get a &amp;#34;Baby Butt Smooth&amp;#34; shave with zero irritation with this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use each once twice, making two passes (with the grain and against) each shave. That&#x27;s upteen cents a day and totally worth it. I could probably stretch it for a few more days if I cared to, but I do not.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades since 2010. After trying everything under the sun including my second favorite Voskhod blades, I am very happy with them. Having a heavy growth these blades cut through my beard with ease. I highly recommend you give them a try. If 100 is too much to start with check out with some of the shaving forums and see if some one will send you a few for free, or trade up with some one. The shaving community is a kind one with gentlemen willing to help out other gentlemen.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. They are very sharp, smooth and long lasting but $54.25 for a hundred is an insane price. Though not easy to find you can buy them much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  These shave and last for about the same number of shaves as Astra blades for me, and Astras are about 1/3 the price.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well.  It was a learning experience.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t need razors for a few years. Nice blades I don&#x27;t look like a bloody mess after using them.</li>
    <li> These Personna Med Prep blades are unequivocally the Best double edge blades I have ever shaved with, Sharp, smooth with no pulls or nicks (i assume this is the desired effect when you are prepping a patient ). Plus these blades are manufactured in the USA and I like that plenty. A Google search for Personna 74-0002 double edge med prep blades will result in much better prices. I bought a 100 ct. box from Robbins Instruments for $25.00 plus $5.50 shipping. My advice is buy the best and use the rest for your utility knife. Best Regards, Dave.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and not really shape...</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have used. I went through a couple of sample set razors (including Feather), and eventually bought a large quantity of Greek Bics, which were pretty good. On Badger and Blade http://www.badgerandblade.com/ I saw several recommendations for Personna blades. Most of the comments specified mostly the &amp;#34;For Hospital Use&amp;#34; variety. These are the revered hospital blades, and they give a great shave. Quality is pretty consistent. I get at least 5 and sometimes 7 days out of a blade. I know it is time to change when I get a bit more pull feeling. These are a bit more costly than your Russian imports, but they are worth it and made in the USA besides!</li>
    <li> Hands down these double edged razor blades are the best one can buy. They are very sharp and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Sharp, smooth, expensive. I can&#x27;t recommend these over astras. The performance is roughly the same at a much higher cost.</li>
    <li> Best DE blade period.  I have used Feathers along with many others and this blade stays sharper longer.  I easily get 4 shaves out of it before I even think about changing it.  While I&#x27;m not sure what they do to these blades, they are a cut Above.  As a bonus, they are made right here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If the price makes you second guess, the Personna blues are not bad either.  They don&#x27;t stay as sharp as long as the hospital blades, and I have had a one that would have served better as a butter knife than a razor.  I rate them in my top 5 DE choices and at $12 per 100 it is the best value in DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Sharp, about the same as my rapira. Feathers are sharper, though feathers are a little less smooth</li>
    <li> This is a great product, which for me rates just below Feathers and along with Gillette Silver Blue in is effectiveness as a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have as listed here is the price.  This product is available at half the price listed here from other sources for a 250 razor pack.  Just google it.</li>
    <li> This blade is an exceptional blade for the money.  I get 4 to 5 great shaves from each blade which means 500 shaves per box and at $31 that comes out to just over 6 CENTS a shave.  Compare that to ANY cartridge out there and this blade wins hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that unless the blade has \\&quot;Hospital\\&quot; stamped on it it is not the Personna Medical Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife gets two complete shaves on her legs with one blade, compared to the Lady Bic which costs 5 x as much and only shaves her twice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have saved over $436 this year alone by using these blades over Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this blade!  It is the best out there.  Didn&#x27;t like the ones you got?  Send me a note and we can talk for a trade or sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathew Manzano</li>
    <li> best damn razor you can buy nowadays...  as good as the Wilkinson Sword of the 70&#x27;s that my dad used</li>
    <li> The are aboaluty the best blades I have used. They have the best balance of smoothness and sharpness. I get super close shaves with no irritation regardless of the shave soap/cream I use!</li>
    <li> very good  long lasting</li>
    <li> The best razor blade. And it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Only razor to buy. On 8 shaves now. Still sharp although I may swap it out anyways</li>
    <li> Excellent blades.  Great value.  Excellent supplier.</li>
    <li> These are the best, period. It is a joy to use these \\&quot;hospital\\&quot; blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are exquisitely sharp. Yet,I have inflicted zero nicks or \\&quot;burns\\&quot; with these.&lt;br /&gt;Their quality control seems fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They usually last a week. If you want longer, \\&quot;strop\\&quot; them. What else can you buy for about $30 per 100 that will last so long and work so well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be even happier they are made by a US company in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a big favor and get these.</li>
    <li> These are my go to blades. I&#x27;ve tried Voskhods, Personna Red, Feather, Blozano, Derby, Shark. and a bunch of others, and these are the perfect balance of sharpness and smoothness, and give 3-5 good shaves depending on the razor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good blade, sharp as very popular Feather and yet smoother. USA made. I would recommend this blade to beginner or amateur wet shaver. But again every whisker and skin is different and this blade may not work for you as good as it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only big CON is price that offered here on amazon. Shame on you vendors!! Absolutely ridiculous price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy it save your money - do yourself a favor and google this brand and SN. You will be surprised;)</li>
    <li> These blades are pretty great.  They won&#x27;t take your face to the moon and return it safely, but they will leave it glass-smooth with a minimum of nicks.</li>
    <li> I received these blades and they are indeed Personna Medical Prep blades stamped with &amp;#34;For Hospital Use.&amp;#34; While more expensive than most safety razor blades, the Med Prep is considered to be one of the best blades by many who use a safety razor to shave. While very sharp the Med Prep is also very forgiving. I&#x27;m retired so I don&#x27;t have to shave every day. I usually shave every three to five days and I find I can get at least seven shaves from a Med Prep blade. It&#x27;s extremely rare for me to nick my face with one of these blades. Of course safety razor preference is an individual choice, but in my opinion these are the best blades on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll take these blades over Feather blades any day. They&#x27;re my absolute favorites. Super sharp, very smooth and last forever. Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I significantly prefer these over the other Personna blues available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Though the lab blues are supposedly the same and a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> At $0.35 a blade, it is one of the more expensive DE blades.  On the bright side is the performance.  I just finished my first week of shaving with the same blade (Muhle R89 razor) and am completely satisfied.  The performance was easily better than the five other brands I&#x27;ve used.  I get one or two extra shaves per blade (depending on the brand I&#x27;m comparing to), so the extra cost is not a one to one comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Performance combined with a &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; on the label justifies the price.  Compared to the twin blade cartridge razors I used in the past, this is a clear winner.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp!!! I am on my fourth shave with the same blade and it is still doing well.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> One of the best blades I&#x27;ve found.</li>
