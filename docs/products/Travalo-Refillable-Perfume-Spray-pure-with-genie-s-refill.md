      <li>Easy to refill</li>
      <li>I had it filled in under a minute with not a drop of perfume</li>
      <li>Fortunately for me, I wrapped it in plastic wrap before I packed it in my toiletries bag, or I would have had cologne all over the place.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to fill and sprays an even mist.</li>
      <li>When I buy some new aftershave with a spray top, I&#x27;ll be buying another Travalo!</li>
      <li>I bought the Travalo travel perfume dispenser to carry a small amount with me when traveling, and it is perfect for that purpose!  </li>
      <li>I t&#x27;s exactly what you need to carry your favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Really works - easy to refill and doesn&#x27;t leak!  </li>
      <li>I gave a lot of these as gifts over the past year and everyone has loved theirs just as much as I love mine!</li>
      <li>This is amazing for the frequent traveler.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased several more (they&#x27;re cheap!)</li>
      <li>Great for travel &amp; any small purse.</li>
      <li>I love that it is so tiny that it meets TSA requirements for carrying onto an airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the idea of different types of colors it helps to keep the fragrance chose easy to pick out.</li>
      <li>pure one</li>
      <li>I ordered them for the whole family.  </li>
      <li>but the other colors are all cute.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been carrying it in my purse and it ends up upside down more times than not, and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>

      <li>I did not have high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>The spray is a fine, wide mist.</li>
      <li>It is better than travalo pump i5 which I ordered and did not fit my cologne&#x27;s nozzle.</li>
      <li>It delivers a fine mist of fragrance, not a stream like some little dispensers.  </li>
      <li>Only limitation is that some perfume nozzles may be too large for it.</li>
      <li>but WOW.</li>
      <li>There was no messy transfer, and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>It has never leaked - something that surprised me under changing cabin pressures.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wonderful Product!  No leaks, easy to use, and my friend loved them as gifts!</li>
    <li> Handy and cute. Leaked just a tiny bit in purse and evaporated before I finished using the perfume. So, good idea, worked well, just don&#x27;t fill it up. Add only a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for the frequent traveler.  I was about to spend $80 for a 1.75 oz bottle of my scent, because they no longer manufactured that size.  It could&#x27;ve been a knock-off as well.  Instead, was able to save more than 1/2 the price and use this.  It&#x27;s really idiot proof to fill up.  Also, the spray is a nice spread out spray, not a jet, or a clogged dribble.  For the price, I was expecting a sacrifice in quality somewhere... but honestly can&#x27;t find an improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent travel tool.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a commercial and randomlly thought of it weeks later and looked it up online. I bought it on the spot because it was cheap and interesting and had good reviews. I am SO GLAD that I bought it! It&#x27;s super easy to fill and sprays an even mist. Zero complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the black travalo pure one but the other colors are all cute.</li>
    <li> Only limitation is that some perfume nozzles may be too large for it. I had one bottle for which that was the case. Otherwise,  works exactly as advertised and no leaks in everyday use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. Smell good every moment of your working day. Bring your perfume with you in your purse. Easy to refill</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ll fill it out when I travel or have it in my car.</li>
    <li> These perfume travel atomizers are the greatest invention! Everyone should have one or two...easy to use and convenient to carry.</li>
    <li> Great for travel &amp; any small purse. I like the idea of different types of colors it helps to keep the fragrance chose easy to pick out.</li>
    <li> It leaks around the top. Fortunately for me, I wrapped it in plastic wrap before I packed it in my toiletries bag, or I would have had cologne all over the place. It&#x27;s attractive, fills very easily and sprays nicely, but it was supposed to be leakproof an I found that it is not.</li>
    <li> LOVE this travel spray!  Love the way you don&#x27;t have to spray into a funnel and hope most of the perfume makes it into the vial.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I use Costco lens cleaner for my camera lenses, eyeglasses and sunglasses, as well as my camera monitor in the field.  I bought the Travalo travel perfume dispenser to carry a small amount with me when traveling, and it is perfect for that purpose!  I did affix a label to it to identify the contents, the Costco All Purpose Lens Cleaner comes in a spray bottle (with lifetime refills from Costco) that has a stem that works perfectly with the Travalo.  I always seem to lose the Costco pen dispensers, and they are tricky to fill.  The Travalo fills easily and works great as a lens cleaner dispenser!  When I buy some new aftershave with a spray top, I&#x27;ll be buying another Travalo!</li>
    <li> I got one that leaked and then I got this one. Great idea. Easy to refill. Doesn&#x27;t seem to leak.</li>
    <li> Broke after a couple uses. Not worth the money I spent. &amp;#34;Silver Refillable Travel Size Perfume Bottle Spray, 12ml .41oz&amp;#34;  instead and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been frustrated trying to find a small, inexpensive, easy to fill atomizer for my favorite perfumes.  I purchased the Travalo on a flight back from Europe last year, put it in my carry-on and promptly forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks ago I started packing for another trip and found the Travalo.  I had it filled in under a minute with not a drop of perfume spilled!  It delivers a fine mist of fragrance, not a stream like some little dispensers.  The package says it will hold 65 sprays, which is perfect for my requirements when traveling.  I&#x27;ve been carrying it in my purse and it ends up upside down more times than not, and doesn&#x27;t leak.  I love that it is so tiny that it meets TSA requirements for carrying onto an airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  READ THE DIRECTIONS.  Put the Travalo on TOP of the perfume (spray) bottle, not the other way around!  If you do it wrong it will make a mess!  Just ask a friend of mine!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become one of \\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve shown it to my friends.  They&#x27;ve bought them and love Travalo too!  I have purchased several more (they&#x27;re cheap!) for myself and as gifts.  A must have!!!</li>
    <li> I opened the package, placed it on my perfume bottle and gave it thirty-something squirts. Done. There was no messy transfer, and it doesn&#x27;t leak. The spray is a fine, wide mist. I love this thing.</li>
    <li> The Travalo Refillable Perfume bottle was exactly what I expected. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I did not have high hopes for this product but WOW. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s perfect. I t&#x27;s exactly what you need to carry your favorite fragrance. Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
    <li> Really works - easy to refill and doesn&#x27;t leak!  I gave a lot of these as gifts over the past year and everyone has loved theirs just as much as I love mine!</li>
    <li> Great idea for travel or purse.  It beats buying small sizes, and it fills easily.  I ordered them for the whole family.  It&#x27;s great that they meet airline regulations too.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is superb.  It feels solid and well made.  I have taken it (on the plane) to Chicago twice, Washington DC and Seattle and it holds up perfectly.  It has never leaked - something that surprised me under changing cabin pressures.  I now only buy the largest bottle of cologne, saving me lots of money each year.  This thing has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travelers. It perfectly fits my cologne&#x27;s nozzle. It is better than travalo pump i5 which I ordered and did not fit my cologne&#x27;s nozzle.</li>
    <li> wonderful find. doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Third one I have now. They are great.</li>
