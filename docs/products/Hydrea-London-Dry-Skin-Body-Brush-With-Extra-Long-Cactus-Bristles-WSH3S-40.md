      <li>Perfect for dry brushing.</li>
      <li>Love the stiffer bristles,  more than I&#x27;m used to but do especially an excellent tool job,  do you expect it to reach certain parts of your back.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic brush... more expensive than others, but has great coverage and perfect handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes it easy to brush your body quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the longer handle and the large surface area of the brush, for me this is the perfect dry brush.</li>
      <li>Handle is perfect - brush is wide, bristles are just the right amount of stiffness.  </li>
      <li>Good handle, the bristles are nice and long, and give the right amount of exfoliation and stimulation.</li>

      <li>This is by far the best dry brush ever.  </li>
      <li>worthy the money.</li>
      <li>Nice wide brush head covers more territory and quickly.  </li>
      <li>After reading hours of reviews on dry skin brushes, I kept coming back to this one because something about the way it&#x27;s shaped made me feel it would work the best.  </li>
      <li>Nice big brush for body brushing to move the toxins and old stuff out of my body :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The quality in this brush from the handle to the bristles is superior to the other brush that had hundreds of positive reviews!  </li>
      <li>This had a handle just the right length for reaching everywhere.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an easy thing to do to help take care of yourself and your skin!</li>
      <li>This dry brushing body brush is amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very invigorating!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many over the last three months and this one works really well.</li>
      <li>, the bristles are coarse, since I have kind of sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I love this dry body brush.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush for dry skin brushing.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels to do dry brushing.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a dry body brush to get my Lymph Moving better as we all have a certain amount of lymph stagnation.</li>
      <li>but, if nothing else, the soft skin I have after I brush and then shower makes the purchase worth</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is if you have very sensitive skin, then the bristles on this brush feel quite strong to the touch.</li>
      <li>I am new to dry brushing and actually bought this brush in the hopes that by assisting my body with the draining of my lymphatic system that my healing from total knee replacement would go more smoothly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I started dry brushing to improve lymphatic drainage but the improvement in skin texture is a nice bonus and some of the stretch marks on my hips are starting to fade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is a nice balance of strong but not such hard bristles you feel like you might actually exfoliate your skin</li>
      <li>Makes the other brushes all seem cheap.  </li>
      <li>But  being I&#x27;m new</li>
      <li>Nice, soft bristles, no scratching on delicate skin.</li>
      <li>Man did I need this for this super dry heat!  </li>
      <li>Very coarse which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Yes, at first the bristles are stiff and if you are a first time dry brusher you will have to give yourself time to learn the brushing technique and to get used to the feel of the bristles, but they soften up significantly</li>
      <li>I also purchased another one at the same time with a longer handle that had hundreds of positive reviews just in case</li>
      <li>Sturdy and works well so far.</li>
      <li>the bristles are way to soft to support the weight of the brush while drying, it would deform the bristles, so I put it on its side and put something in front of it to keep it from sliding.</li>
      <li>I started dry brushing first with the medium brush and worked my way up to the cactus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This was my first dry brush purchase.</li>
      <li>The brush feels a little rough at first, but after several uses is fine.</li>
      <li>well then gently squeeze out the excess water from the bristles and hang to air dry in a ventilated area</li>
      <li>I have purchased many brushes, from small to long handled.  </li>
      <li>have extra sensitive skin</li>
      <li>That is a big let down but the size and shape make it worth it to get another if it ever bites the dust.</li>
      <li>Comfortable long handle, but no so long as my other handled one.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are long and firm with the right amount of scratchy.  </li>
      <li>A little stiff but works for my purpose just fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice big brush for body brushing to move the toxins and old stuff out of my body :-)</li>
    <li> Love the stiffer bristles,  more than I&#x27;m used to but do especially an excellent tool job,  do you expect it to reach certain parts of your back.  But not what it was designed for.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars excellent shipped and packaging thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this product a lot!! I started dry brushing first with the medium brush and worked my way up to the cactus.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much, I bought two.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush... more expensive than others, but has great coverage and perfect handle.</li>
    <li> A little stiff but works for my purpose just fine.</li>
    <li> I use this daily because it feels good and improves skin tone.  Love the shape &amp; weight....... happy</li>
    <li> This brush appears to be well made. It is intended for dry-brushing only, and not supposed to be used in the shower. For the purpose of stimulating the lymph system, this brush works quite well. The brush feels a little rough at first, but after several uses is fine. Some bristles fall out when I run my finger across them, but not too many. Good for health. From the seller: this brush is made in England.</li>
    <li> Man did I need this for this super dry heat!  LOVE the results and I only use about 3-4 times a week.  If only I had time and energy to use 14 times a week!  (i have twin infants!!)</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush. I wish the handle would be a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> I cannot bear the brushes that have detachable heads and too long a stem as they always come off and it&#x27;s too bulky. This had a handle just the right length for reaching everywhere. I use it as a dry body brush to get my Lymph Moving better as we all have a certain amount of lymph stagnation. This can help break it up a bit, especially if you are not that active. The only thing I would say is if you have very sensitive skin, then the bristles on this brush feel quite strong to the touch. I have gotten used to it though. Wetting them would help. A good brush and sturdy. I can see it lasting for ever!</li>
    <li> Took a month to deliver as it arrived from Europe. Sturdy and works well so far.</li>
    <li> After reading hours of reviews on dry skin brushes, I kept coming back to this one because something about the way it&#x27;s shaped made me feel it would work the best.  I also purchased another one at the same time with a longer handle that had hundreds of positive reviews just in case I was wrong about this one and needed to send it back.  Wow!  This one beats the other one with the hundreds positive reviews hands down!!! The bristles are perfect!  Not too hard, but hard enough to get the job done.  You will feel this brush doing what it&#x27;s suppose to do, get those toxins moving and out of your system.  I love the way it feels to do dry brushing.  It&#x27;s very invigorating!  The quality in this brush from the handle to the bristles is superior to the other brush that had hundreds of positive reviews!  This is the one!  If you have to pay an extra $5 of whatever it may be for this brush, do it!  It&#x27;s worth it. Superior quality.  Makes the other brushes all seem cheap.  Shipping time was good.</li>
    <li> I Love this brush, it&#x27;s excellent quality,The size is great the handle long enough to reach your back, the bristles are coarse, since I have kind of sensitive skin I use it three times a week on non consecutive days. I&#x27;ve used it three times a week for two months before I take a shower and my skin is softer, after I shower, while my skin is not completely dry, I moisturize with a little sesame oil. I started dry brushing to improve lymphatic drainage but the improvement in skin texture is a nice bonus and some of the stretch marks on my hips are starting to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is only for dry brushing but when it needs to be washed I use my clarifying shampoo rinse it well then gently squeeze out the excess water from the bristles and hang to air dry in a ventilated area or it could be left horizontally with the bristles facing down, this can be done with the cactus bristles because they are stiff, I also have the Hydrea face brush with goat&#x27;s hair and the bristles are way to soft to support the weight of the brush while drying, it would deform the bristles, so I put it on its side and put something in front of it to keep it from sliding.You could also find a way to support the brush with the bristles facing down but not resting on the bristles while it dries. I keep the brushes in the bathroom but not in the shower.</li>
    <li> If you are flakey...lol, this brush is for you.</li>
    <li> I am new to dry brushing and actually bought this brush in the hopes that by assisting my body with the draining of my lymphatic system that my healing from total knee replacement would go more smoothly and quickly.  (I was having some specific nerve endings issues and saw a post on a TKR site suggesting dry brushing.) I have been very pleased with my results. I experienced some initial swelling when I first started brushing but once I watched some &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; videos on YouTube and learned the proper technique to dry brush, everything sort of fell together and my healing is back on track. Now honestly, I don&#x27;t know if the brushing has anything to do with my healing but, if nothing else, the soft skin I have after I brush and then shower makes the purchase worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed other reviewers warning of the severe stiffness of this brushes bristles. Yes, at first the bristles are stiff and if you are a first time dry brusher you will have to give yourself time to learn the brushing technique and to get used to the feel of the bristles, but they soften up significantly so don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the brush four stars because the handle needs to be a tiny bit longer. I can reach everywhere on my body except for the very middle of my back. Even one inch longer, but still the same width, would be a bonus. The second reason for four stars is the lack of direction about how to use the brush. There are a lot of bad &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; videos on YouTube and I had to wade through a ton of them to figure out the proper way to use the brush. A pamphlet or even a link to the company&#x27;s own &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; site would have been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone about the benefits of dry brushing now. It&#x27;s such an easy thing to do to help take care of yourself and your skin!</li>
    <li> Love this brush..my skin looks awesome</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Handle is perfect - brush is wide, bristles are just the right amount of stiffness.  I use this every day.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush, the handle is perfect, you can reach all body with it, although the hair is a bit hard but it feels soooooooo good after brushing. worthy the money.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dry brush ever.  The bristles are long and firm with the right amount of scratchy.  Whether you believe in all the dry brush hype or not it does simply improve the look and feel of your skin by removing the dry dead skin.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It is perfect for my Dry Brushing. Stimulates my blood flow and helps me gid rid of dead skin cells and toxins.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but I just don&#x27;t make the time to do it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works perfectly, and hangs easily. Nice, soft bristles, no scratching on delicate skin.</li>
    <li> This dry brushing body brush is amazing. Everything I could want from a body brush. Good handle, the bristles are nice and long, and give the right amount of exfoliation and stimulation. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I always ask my husband to scratch my back,  but it still feels itchy sometimes afterwards.  With this brush,  it relieves itching and leaves no nail Mark.  It feels great.  It is big enough and I am going to use it for body brushing to enhance lymphatic circulation.</li>
    <li> The brush works as advertised.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first dry brush purchase. It seems to be of very good quality! And it came very quickly! My only draw back was that the bristles are a little rough, I thought it would be a little softer. But  being I&#x27;m new to dry brushing I can imagine it will take some getting use to.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many brushes, from small to long handled.  This is by far thr best. Comfortable long handle, but no so long as my other handled one.  The really long handle keptgettin in the way and I would have remove the handle for everything but my back. Nice wide brush head covers more territory and quickly.  Only thing, for those of you who like a hard brush, this one is a little above medium.  My favorite of my five brushes.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry brushing. I love the longer handle and the large surface area of the brush, for me this is the perfect dry brush.</li>
    <li> This brush rocks my world.&lt;br /&gt;The shape is what makes it spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it easy to brush your body quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have extra sensitive skin so I get a little red after using it but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice balance of strong but not such hard bristles you feel like you might actually exfoliate your skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does lose bristles every time I use it. That is a big let down but the size and shape make it worth it to get another if it ever bites the dust.</li>
    <li> I love this dry body brush. I&#x27;ve bought many over the last three months and this one works really well. Thank you to who makes it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, works well and feels great! Not too tough, not too soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush for dry skin brushing.  It is made of cactus but the bristles are very close together and thick and so it doesn&#x27;t feel pricikly at all.  it feels invigorating and the shape is perfect for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> Very coarse which is exactly what I wanted.  Worth the money!</li>
