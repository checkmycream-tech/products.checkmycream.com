### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The is the perfect size to keep in my pocket for touch ups during the day when I use Maybelline 24 hour lip color.&lt;br /&gt;Super moist!</li>
      <li>Product and great service!</li>
      <li>These fill the need perfectly.</li>
      <li>perfect to put into purse, i wish they sold these in the store.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a perfect size.</li>
      <li>Excellent lip balm.  </li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>So happy to discover that you could order the balm by itself, because it always runs out before the color...  </li>
      <li>Thank you for a great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This balm is the best and does not cake and have any funny taste...!!  </li>
      <li>very pleased with this</li>
      <li>GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THIS!</li>
      <li>this will come in handy to keep it shiny....</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioning balm to go over the Super Stay lip color.</li>
      <li>It feels good on and gives a nice smooth finish to the lipsticks.</li>
      <li>so I could use the conditioning balm for my favorite colors.</li>
      <li>Too pricey, but I have to have it since I absolutely love the lipstick.</li>
      <li>Not in love with the smell and taste.  </li>
      <li>so I use more of this than the color coat.</li>
      <li>Very excited to find this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves my lips so soft, and it has a great shine to it.</li>
      <li>I love the size...fits perfect in my little belted purse.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this to use with [[ASIN:B006UETYXY</li>
      <li>also run out quickly.  </li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;ve been loyal to this line for years because of its quality.</li>
      <li>I however started using it as a regular lip balm instead, and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Love Super Stay 24, but always eat off the balm several times a day.  </li>
      <li>I saw this here on Amazon and have already ordered two, they are so nice because you can keep your lipstick as long as you want and just replace the conditioner with this one.</li>
      <li>It fits right on the regular tube just throw the top away.</li>
      <li>I am in constant search of more of these lip balm refills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the same as the top coat that comes with the 24 hour lipstick.</li>
      <li>It needs to be reapplied pretty</li>
      <li>Love the Lip color that I get at the drug store (as long as I don&#x27;t eat toast)-  </li>
      <li>I use the Maybelline Stay-put Lipstick and this is what keeps it on your lips to whole day.</li>
      <li>Might be helpful to have refills available in stores next to the 24 color......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more in the future once mine dries out because it&#x27;s really so convenient, especially when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing lipstick.</li>
      <li>I bought several different Maybelline Superstay Lipsticks and thought I better buy a couple of these conditioner refills too.</li>
      <li>I will not need to buy new for a LOOOONG time now.</li>
      <li>Maybelline New YorkSuperstay</li>
      <li>this is a pretty neat fix without the constant rotation that I had been doing.</li>
      <li>Carry these small tubes in my purse in case my lipcolor needs refreshing.</li>
      <li>YOUR LIPSTICK SHINY AND SOFT.</li>
      <li>as I felt it left my lips really dry after awhile, but it ended up not being too compatible with it as it would make it come off quickly.</li>
      <li>The balm keeps the color fresh and it does tend to wear down faster than the color, therefore, you do need the refill.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I live in a dry city</li>
      <li>my maybelline superstay lip color last longer (i&#x27;m constantly having to buy an entire new color+conditioner stick because i run out of the conditioner</li>
      <li>They changed the size of the product, so you need to keep the original balm plugged into the end of the lip color and keep the cap on the grey refill and carry it separately, small sacrifice.</li>

    <li> i always use the  superstay lipsticks,&lt;br /&gt;and  this will come in handy to keep it shiny....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus i use it like chap stick to..&lt;br /&gt;works wonders if your lips are chapped!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to use with [[ASIN:B006UETYXY Maybelline New YorkSuperstay 14 hour Lipstick, Wine and forever, 0.12 Ounce]] as I felt it left my lips really dry after awhile, but it ended up not being too compatible with it as it would make it come off quickly. I however started using it as a regular lip balm instead, and I absolutely love it! It leaves my lips so soft, and it has a great shine to it. It makes my lips look like they&#x27;re sparkling. I&#x27;ll probably buy more in the future once mine dries out because it&#x27;s really so convenient, especially when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing lipstick.</li>
    <li> So happy to discover that you could order the balm by itself, because it always runs out before the color...  problem now solved!</li>
    <li> This balm is the best and does not cake and have any funny taste...!!  I do not like lip gloss or balms with flavor.....keep lips moist and no craking even in the winter.  Thank you for a great product.</li>

    <li> I am in constant search of more of these lip balm refills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo to Maybelline for stopping this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast service!</li>
    <li> I used to have to carry the lipstick with the Balm, but now I can carry this refill Balm in my purse. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Horrible, this is a small balm and is not a good deal of any type, the balm is easy to finish, even a dollar chap stick is cheaper and so much better.</li>
    <li> Just wish Maybelline supplied enough with the lipstick so you wouldn&#x27;t have to buy separate!</li>
    <li> Excellent lip balm.  Carry these small tubes in my purse in case my lipcolor needs refreshing.</li>
    <li> perfect to put into purse, i wish they sold these in the store.&lt;br /&gt;makes my maybelline superstay lip color last longer (i&#x27;m constantly having to buy an entire new color+conditioner stick because i run out of the conditioner side).&lt;br /&gt;this fits ontothe other side of the double sided superstay lip color, or you can carry it as a standalone.  i do the latter.&lt;br /&gt;SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THIS!</li>
    <li> The is the perfect size to keep in my pocket for touch ups during the day when I use Maybelline 24 hour lip color.&lt;br /&gt;Super moist!</li>
    <li> Very excited to find this product. I have a drawer filled with Colorstay Lip Stains that have plenty of product remaining although the balm was exhausted long ago. I will not need to buy new for a LOOOONG time now. Yippie for me!</li>
    <li> Great. Product and great service!</li>
    <li> I use the Maybelline Stay-put Lipstick and this is what keeps it on your lips to whole day. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can find that isn&#x27;t sticky and also doesn&#x27;t take off my color-stay lipcolor. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioning balm to go over the Super Stay lip color. I just wish it was unscented. Still, I&#x27;ve been loyal to this line for years because of its quality.</li>
    <li> I bought several different Maybelline Superstay Lipsticks and thought I better buy a couple of these conditioner refills too. It feels good on and gives a nice smooth finish to the lipsticks. You can also use it as a lip gloss without using any colored lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Love the Lip color that I get at the drug store (as long as I don&#x27;t eat toast)-  BUT I always run out of balm before I run out of color-  this is a pretty neat fix without the constant rotation that I had been doing.</li>
    <li> Not in love with the smell and taste.  I do not lick it, but you can always taste it a bit.  It needs to be reapplied pretty often.&lt;br /&gt;It is not bad; just not great either.&lt;br /&gt;They also run out quickly.  I have gone through three of these for one of the superstay lipcolor.</li>
    <li> This is the same as the top coat that comes with the 24 hour lipstick. I live in a dry city so I use more of this than the color coat. These fill the need perfectly. I stash them everywhere....purse.....kitchen....van....makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well-think it was old-expired</li>
    <li> I love the size...fits perfect in my little belted purse.  Don&#x27;t know why Maybelline discontinued this product...it&#x27;s a perfect size.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Superstay lip color has a balm attached to one end.  The lip color is applied, allowed to dry, and then you go over your lips with the balm. The balm keeps the color fresh and it does tend to wear down faster than the color, therefore, you do need the refill.&lt;br /&gt;This refill will not plug into the current lip color end.  They changed the size of the product, so you need to keep the original balm plugged into the end of the lip color and keep the cap on the grey refill and carry it separately, small sacrifice.</li>
    <li> THEY DO NOT SELL THIS IN STORES.......&lt;br /&gt;I USED IT SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.&lt;br /&gt;MAKES YOUR LIPSTICK SHINY AND SOFT.</li>
    <li> Too pricey, but I have to have it since I absolutely love the lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love Super Stay 24, but always eat off the balm several times a day.  Having access to balm refills is essential for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Maybelline!  Might be helpful to have refills available in stores next to the 24 color......just saying.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this</li>
