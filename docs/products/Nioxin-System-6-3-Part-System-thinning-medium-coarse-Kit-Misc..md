      <li>I thought, why not say hello or nice day and give them a smile.  </li>
      <li>There are ice caps available and the cost is 300 on up.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Make sure to trim split ends, drink lots of water, eat right, and take your vitamins.</li>
      <li>hair clean:</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not going to give you a FULL head of hair, but it will thicken the strands that you already have.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll find out in two more treatments, just how much is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Increased daily dosage of Biotin, taka a good Collagen supplement and with this product as well,</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m more impressed than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>i smile because i see my pillow clean of hair...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received tremendous support from people on the internet, nurses, people I meet at a support group, everywhere.  </li>
      <li>super fast&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I did take lots of Biotin and vitamins</li>
      <li>my hair didn&#x27;t fall out any more than normal.</li>
      <li>So far I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I started loosing my hair 2 yrs ago,  i tried all different kind of shampoo like horse tail shampoo, Tio Nacho, garnier fall fight,</li>
      <li>they recomended that Nioxin System 6 was the one i need it, and yep they were right</li>
      <li>There is new growth on top, and it&#x27;s much shinier and softer.</li>
      <li>hair grew super fast in one month even after I cut 4/5 inches off after using Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read it was better to cut it shorter, but not shave it or cut it too short.  </li>
      <li>I had nurses, who were willing to try anything to save my hair.  </li>
      <li>scalp feels great, makes hair at least look thicker.</li>
      <li>I also bought Nioxin Diamax which is pretty pricey</li>
      <li>I noticed improvement after the first use.</li>
      <li>I bought the system for coarse hair but thought six would be for those losing the most hair</li>
      <li>Easy to use and results are apparent, though it does require patience.</li>
      <li>in two weeks I filled 3 waste baskets of hair from the top.  </li>
      <li>I gathered from reading the label that it was useful as a sunscreen for the scalp, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out if it had any other benefits to help my hair grow better.</li>
      <li>This order came fast and I felt it working and making my hair feel thicker for abiut tje first week.</li>
      <li>which i did daily for 3 full months!.</li>
      <li>I have dry and brittle hair, and I was able to get a comb through my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair also has two weeks worth of normal hair growth, so the real decision upon it&#x27;s effectiveness will be when I get a haircut.</li>
      <li>- you can use it without the whole system and it makes my hair a lot fuller without the frizzy volume (i have large curls which can be frizzy if i don&#x27;t have product in).</li>
      <li>Of course it made me really upset</li>
      <li>I really did not see any difference.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m not a scientist and there&#x27;s much that I don&#x27;t know about the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a gentle shampoo, conditioner, and mouse like stuff--</li>
      <li>I STARED SEEING THICKER HAIR ON THE FRONT OF MY HAIR LINE AND MY HAIR WASN&#x27;T FALLING OUT ASK MUCH.</li>
      <li>Really wanted to like this system</li>
      <li>You have to be really diligent.</li>
      <li>for real.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t nearly as much hair showing up on my comb and brush.</li>
      <li>The system gave me a bit to much to do in the morning.</li>
      <li>It helps me as much as it does others.  </li>
      <li>If not, then I will go cheap and accept the inevitable.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have that much money to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>guarantee is a marketing trick since you cant really say if there are any results in 30 days.</li>
      <li>I have not see that much difference in my hair growth</li>
      <li>It really helps.  </li>
      <li>the reviews about peoples&#x27; hair falling out REALLY freaked me out...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this product</li>
      <li>I saw new growth once I finished my first bottle of the three parts.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The system gave me a bit to much to do in the morning. I now just use the shampoo and have ditched the conditioner and foam.</li>
    <li> My hair was so thin! I cried as I struggled to arrange my hair so that my scalp didnt show through it. It was just getting worse. I could filll a sandwich bag with the hair I lost over a 2 day period... which i did daily for 3 full months!. It was frightning ... I had been sick and my immune system had really taken a beating. Little by little I made slow but steady progress back to health. But after a year of vitamins, scalp conditioners and all of the products I thought might be the key, all I had to show was an over abundance of hair products:( I felt condemned to a lifetime of dull, dry and patchy hair. But after finding and using Nioxin I have shiny hair again and its filling in faster than I hoped it would!! Taking 10 mg. of Biotin a day combined with the Nioxin 3 step program every time I shamoo brought me back to life again! Try it! It works:)</li>
    <li> This product is helping my hair grow back after loosing it to chemotherapy.  Easy to use and results are apparent, though it does require patience.</li>
    <li> This system needs to be used daily. My husband started to thin as the stresses of his job and a growing family started to increase. This really brought back some fullness to his hair and thickness.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this system but I don&#x27;t think it works.  I have used these products since July.  I also use the Nioxin Diamax.  I have not really noticed much difference in the thickness of my hair.  I thought I was seeing new hair growth in my problem areas but when I looked at my before and after photos (one month and three months) I really did not see any difference.  I didn&#x27;t lose more hair, though.  I gave three stars because I am hoping that this is stopping my hair loss. Once I use up my products, I  won&#x27;t buy this again.  I will use store shampoos for thinning hair (a lot cheaper) for three months and will take more photos.  If I notice more hair loss then I will go back to Nioxin.  If not, then I will go cheap and accept the inevitable.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be easier to use but is too many steps for me so I take it to the hair salon with me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work for me and it wasn&#x27;t even very good as a shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> First, the set I received came with a conditioner bottle that was half as large as the shampoo. I ran out long before I used up the shampoo. Second, the &amp;#34;Scalp Treatment&amp;#34; was a puzzle. I gathered from reading the label that it was useful as a sunscreen for the scalp, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out if it had any other benefits to help my hair grow better. I didn&#x27;t care for the slightly sticky feel of it, and didn&#x27;t really need sunscreen, so I just stopped using it. Third, I think this product has been rather drying to my hair. And lastly, I didn&#x27;t see any signs of any improvement in hair growth. Since I only used it for a couple of months, I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of a doubt and rate it &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34;, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is explained in the bloody title. 13 More Words: Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth...</li>
    <li> I noticed improvement after the first use. This product works so well, I bought one for my mom. After using Nioxin, I have received compliments on my hair. After two weeks of using it, I noticed only half the usual amount of hair fell out after shampooing. Truly amazing product! Love it.</li>
    <li> It cleans the scalp and make you hair looking good..</li>
    <li> Love it!  It has brought life back to my hair and the shedding has diminished.  I highly recommend to anyone thinking about it.</li>
    <li> So i gave this a try not expecting miracles... And after 30 days... I&#x27;m impressed and relieved! Here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;Hair re growth: 30% improvement&lt;br /&gt;Hair thickening: 50% improvement&lt;br /&gt;Stops hair from continuing to fall out: 90% improvement (it helps you keep what you got left!)&lt;br /&gt;Gets hair clean: 100% improvement (leaves it shiny and clean)&lt;br /&gt;Balding spots diminishing by about 50% just after 30 days! I&#x27;m buying my second pack and will do a review 60 days out! Hoping it continues to work as well!!!! Hope this helped:)</li>
    <li> I am African American, and this product dried my hair out. It did not provide any moisture and simply stripped my hair of all its natural oils.</li>
    <li> Hair showed definite improvement within the first couple uses.  Hair was fuller and there was much less breakage.  This stuff definitely works!</li>
    <li> For my sister who has been very ill and has really had a lot of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about this and after discussion with her, purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;She has had some results, slowly but surely. Time will tell if this product fulfills her needs.</li>
    <li> This order came fast and I felt it working and making my hair feel thicker for abiut tje first week. After that it looked like my hair was actually thinning worse whenever I looked in my mirror. I might have purchased the wrong number though.</li>
    <li> The product was clearly used and the seller did a poor job of taping the bottles shut, I guess hoping I wouldn&#x27;t check; a portion of product from each bottle is missing...as if used, poured out, or it&#x27;s fake. I&#x27;m not confident in using the product from this seller, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it weren&#x27;t even NIOXIN product in the bottles. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to enjoy my experience with this product. I will be returning my purchase and will order from another (legit) seller.</li>
    <li> Great products and they are working perfectly; my hair and scalp never felt better and my dryness is getting better with each use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Ive been usuing since Feb I think and have baby hairs everywhere. This is great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I am 40 and an Asian female, healthy, and no medical problems. But the hair towards the front and top of my head was getting thin and every time I got a haircut, the haircutter would comment on it. I got Nioxin because I heard good things about it. I used it for about two months and every time i shampooed with Nioxin, I noticed a lot of hair in the drain and in my comb. I thought that was normal and would decrease over time. It never did. So I switched back to my old shampoo and immediately saw the difference. There were only a few hairs in the drain compared to the clumps with Nioxin.</li>
    <li> great but not seeing any difference..yet.</li>
    <li> I have not see that much difference in my hair growth but it probably takes a while to see a difference.</li>
    <li> scalp feels great, makes hair at least look thicker. Since you dont need to use much, it is going to last around 3 months</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nioxin System 6 for medium to course hair. Love the shampoo and conditioner. I also purchases the hair booster. All 3 work great, but I&#x27;m sorry to say I am not a fan of the scalp and hair treatment that came with the starter kit. It makes my hair feel stiff and for my African American hair, I need my hair to feel soft when I put a comb through it. Not feeling like it&#x27;s going to break off when I try to style it. NOTE: Called the Nioxion company and they strongly advise against buying their products from Amazon and/or EBAY due the items possibly being expired and thus not giving the results they&#x27;re suppose to. Apparently, some salons try to get rid of old products by selling them on Amazon and EBAY. They suggested buying directly from a salon. I found a beauty supply store in my area that sales Nioxin. Will get through using what I already purchased from Amazon before giving the supply store a try. But that may be why some people aren&#x27;t getting the results they were hoping for. As mentioned before, not happy with the scalp and hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, I have noticed less breakage. There isn&#x27;t nearly as much hair showing up on my comb and brush. So far, I&#x27;m more impressed than what I&#x27;ve used in the past. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping with the thinning (could be due to being purchased online...not sure), but it is a bit stronger. Hair maintenance is key. Make sure to trim split ends, drink lots of water, eat right, and take your vitamins. FYI: According to the Nioxin Rep. that I spoke with, wait at least 48 hours after coloring before using the Nioxin products. Instead of cleaning your hair with Nioxin prior to coloring, use a regular clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> Used this product as instructed but without any results. I even contacted the seller to figure out why I have no results hoping to get some tips, but the seller never responded. 30 days money back guarantee is a marketing trick since you cant really say if there are any results in 30 days. When you figure out that all you bought is really expensive shampoo than its too late to get you money back.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair  twice a week and my hair is growing in the bald spots.  I haven&#x27;t had hair in those spots for years.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever for older hair.  Adds thickness and shine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help as advertise. Still hair fall and dryness is there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for thinning hair, yet - but I love the smell and it didn&#x27;t break my skin out like other shampoos/conditioners do.  I have dry and brittle hair, and I was able to get a comb through my hair.  Even if this is all it does - it works for my other problems!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great</li>
    <li> Did not like the foam</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this Nioxin..&lt;br /&gt;My hair grew super fast in one month even after I cut 4/5 inches off after using Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my hair is getting back to it&#x27;s old healthy thick hair!! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along w/ Nioxin and Diamax..&lt;br /&gt;I used both every night religiously for a month and I didn&#x27;t put any heat in my hair(well I hvnt for a year). But due to my medication &amp; thyroid my hair and I are in a fight to Stay Alive..lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to have gorgeous hair..Yay! So w/ Nioxin I&#x27;m winning..&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair started shedding badly around the 3rd week.. But I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting rid of dead hair on my head or my new meds &amp; Thyroiditis were causing this..&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t panic.. Why? 1). I am use to this happening and 2.) hair grows bk..&lt;br /&gt;***(A secret if you want to stop shedding immediately use GARLIC- yes smelling Garlic for 2/3 hours mixed w/ reg condition and it will stop for 2/3 months)... U will stink.. Ugghh.. I didn&#x27;t do it this time b/c the smell but after I finally washed &amp; permed my hair it was long, thicker and healthier... Love it.. Can wear my own hair w/o any extensions..&lt;br /&gt;I love extensions but I I like scratching my scalp more..&lt;br /&gt;I am scared to stop using this product b/c I wonder if it will fall out or stop growing super fast&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I did take lots of Biotin and vitamins but I hv done such b4 w/o Nioxin and it nvr grew this fast or got thicker..&lt;br /&gt;Loving my hair!!</li>
    <li> Amazing results the first week!</li>
    <li> This stuff works for me.  I only use it once or twice a week as it is a little &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;.  Increased daily dosage of Biotin, taka a good Collagen supplement and with this product as well, my hair quit falling out and is definitely thicker.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using this about two weeks. My hair does noticeably look fuller and thicker. My hair also has two weeks worth of normal hair growth, so the real decision upon it&#x27;s effectiveness will be when I get a haircut. So far I am satisfied. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s regrowing any hair, but it does seem like it&#x27;s making it thicker looking and fuller.</li>
    <li> Product is everything I wanted it to be and did to my hair what needed to be done; ie., made it manageable with blow drying, added shine, and the blow drying lasted an extra day!</li>
    <li> Was definitely missing product from the bottles. I&#x27;ve purchased this from stores several times and never had this issue. Dissapointed as it is not cheap..</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Did nothing positive for my hair, and if anything, I&#x27;d say the chemicals caused further harm. These hair growth systems are criminal.</li>
    <li> All three of the products included in the kit work as well as advertised for cleaning, conditioning, and scalp conditioning!</li>
    <li> I had already used this product before for myself. Due to a sickness I lost a lot of my hair it was thinning like crazy. So naturally when my mom came to me because she was losing her hair because of the weight of her dreads. . . I reccomended this product to her then bought it for her. My mom is African American and it worked on her. I am mixed half white and half black and this product is amazing. I reccomend it to anyone looking for their sanity to come back and/or hair to stop falling out completely.</li>
    <li> It works!  Using for thinning at part, hairline, and crown.  I have thick coarse curly&lt;br /&gt;hair that has been chemically straightened.  The # 6 is the recommended formula,&lt;br /&gt;and is very very difficult to find in salons.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference with this shampoo than from my other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have cancer.  I call it an illness and I take meds for the illness to get healed.  I do not use the &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; word.  It&#x27;s too strong and scarey of a word for some people.  Some of the nurses don&#x27;t like me using it, but I don&#x27;t care.  It&#x27;s my health and I am not allowing any negative words into my thoughts.  I believe that Jesus has healed me already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought nioxin to try to keep my hair.  I also try to wrap my head in ice.  The meds are said to stop when the temp is 30 degrees.  So I tried.  I had nurses, who were willing to try anything to save my hair.  I had waist length hair.  I read it was better to cut it shorter, but not shave it or cut it too short.  I used the nioxin for about 2 wks prior to the meds being administered.  W/in two weeks I filled 3 waste baskets of hair from the top.  I cried and cried.  I still do.  There remains a remenant of a strip of hair from about four inches from the base of the back of my scalp.  And it still is there.  And yes, I still have to shake hair off from my pillow daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe that Nioxin or any other product can overcome the meds that are placed into the body.  There is a pill that some people can take and they don&#x27;t lose their hair or they lose less.  Not the case with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flop my straw cowgirl hat on and no one notices except me.  I can&#x27;t look at myself, tho, I know Jesus can.  It&#x27;s been traumatic.  There are ice caps available and the cost is 300 on up.  They don&#x27;t always work and there&#x27;s no guarantee that they do.  I didn&#x27;t have that much money to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that I had to do something after the 2nd med treatment since so much fell out.  Tho, I cried and cried, I had to move on, still grieve the loss of my hair, but to trust Jesus enough to know that He&#x27;ll work it out.  I have a wig that I purchased years ago.  Couldn&#x27;t wear it because my hair was too thick.  I can wear it now.  I get complements on the cowgirl hat and can make jokes about my horse beingparked outside or about it not fitting into the hospital&#x27;s elevator.  I keep trying to smile, laugh, and make bad jokes.  It helps me as much as it does others.  I also noticed going into the hosp that there were many people sitting by themselves waiting for their rides.  I thought, why not say hello or nice day and give them a smile.  Another milestone for me.  But isn&#x27;t that what life is about, having a Savior, who puts these ideas in my head, goodness knows as shy as I am, I w/not have thought about it much less done it.  I walk along the place where the flowers are blooming.  It&#x27;s hard when the meds make me sick and I can sleep day and night  for 5 days, sick from the meds.  I had planned to get a part time job and return to school.  But for whatever reason, Jesus closed all the doors.  The tumor has shrunk, it was the size of a golf ball. I&#x27;ll find out in two more treatments, just how much is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pray all will be gone.  I&#x27;ve received tremendous support from people on the internet, nurses, people I meet at a support group, everywhere.  I plan to start using nioxin again soon.  My friend said that she was helped by one of its products when she just had some thinning hair, no illness.  I have faith that the nioxin will help, it&#x27;s a gentle shampoo, conditioner, and mouse like stuff--sorry, I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called.  I expect it to help regrow the hair faster than normal.  Until the treatments are over, I&#x27;ll wear the cowgirl hat and the wig.  And prob still cry for a while longer.  I hope this helps those of you, who are experiencing the same thing.  It&#x27;s not easy, I cry at the worst time like when I&#x27;m on the phone.  Gee.  Jesus heals.  Thank you for allowing me to share my experience so far.  It stinks.  But with Jesus by my side, I live alone, with 3 bunnies and 4 cats, it&#x27;s one of the hardest things that I&#x27;ve encountered.  But I&#x27;m never alone.  God bless you all.  I pray one day that the hair loss will no longer be an issue.  BTW, I also used a silk pillow case.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair follicles like ordinary ones do.  I tried.  It sort of worked.  I&#x27;d like to see if the scalp was at an even 30 degrees if indeed it w/stop the hair loss.  But I&#x27;m not a scientist and there&#x27;s much that I don&#x27;t know about the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love and best wishes to all of you, who are going thru this ordeal.  Yes, keeping looking for the ending, don&#x27;t accept what authorities say, do your research, find answers, turn to Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
    <li> Was sent &amp;#34;chemically treated&amp;#34; instead of regular.  Products have been used for 3 weeks.  Some progress. Still have scaling and dandruff.</li>
    <li> the reviews about peoples&#x27; hair falling out REALLY freaked me out... but i decided for $25 i would try it out. this product works - it&#x27;s not going to give you a FULL head of hair, but it will thicken the strands that you already have. for real. my hair didn&#x27;t fall out any more than normal. but if it does, they say that those are dead and would have fallen out anyway. the shampoo has a nice minty smell to it and makes me feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also bought the nioxin diamax which i LOVE - you can use it without the whole system and it makes my hair a lot fuller without the frizzy volume (i have large curls which can be frizzy if i don&#x27;t have product in). it&#x27;s not oily at ALL either, just feels like water in my hands and my hair feels conditioned.</li>
    <li> The product shipped on time and actually was early. The hair product appears to work and is the 2nd time we purchased it. Will get it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I started using this system a couple of months ago, and my hairdresser says she sees a big difference in my hair. There is new growth on top, and it&#x27;s much shinier and softer. My hair loss was caused by a hormone imbalance, and I am presently being weaned off HRT, so that could also contribute to the change. However, I doubt the hormone change alone would make this big a difference this quickly.</li>
    <li> I am still loosing hair....Just wonder if this product slows down balding or not....I don&#x27;t dare to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I was on a business trip for a week and I did nto use this - did not see any big change..well</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS ITEM BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AFTER I HAD MY BABY . LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT WORKS . I STARED SEEING THICKER HAIR ON THE FRONT OF MY HAIR LINE AND MY HAIR WASN&#x27;T FALLING OUT ASK MUCH. I RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Did not see any noticeable difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on the scalp, but my hair loss did not stopped...</li>
    <li> not impressed with it. been using nioxin for 5 months. i don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever in the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> It helped a little with my thinning hair.  However I found that it did not clean my hair very well. After completely rinsing my hair out I found that I always had a flim left on my hair after rinsing the conditioner out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for years.  Started using it when my hair started thinning in the front.  Of course it made me really upset so I looked into the product and started using it.  It really helps.  This is a nice system because you get all 3 products.  It may not work for everyone because it does depend on why you are having hair loss.</li>
    <li> All Nioxin products are great. I usually but the pills but since therw not on the market anymore i bought two of the systems. One for me and my husband. I havent started using mines but, he has and we already see results.</li>
    <li> Smells great scalp feels really clean hair looks great! I do expect to have thicker hair again, this product is giving me great results</li>
    <li> im truly happy i bought Nioxin 6. I started loosing my hair 2 yrs ago,  i tried all different kind of shampoo like horse tail shampoo, Tio Nacho, garnier fall fight, aloe vera and many other, i even bought Nioxin 2 because my friend recomended to me and didnt help a lot so i gave up,,but a month ago i went to a hair salon and someone there told me to try Nioxin again, i went to their website Nioxin.com and i did an online consultation and based on my type of hair they recomended that Nioxin System 6 was the one i need it, and yep they were right i have been using this product for a month now,,every morning when i wake up i smile because i see my pillow clean of hair...i hope this works for you to, Good Luck.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, it didn&#x27;t do much for me. Also, I ran out of the scalp treatment much earlier than the other two and now I can&#x27;t get a new bottle of just the scalp treatment. So I&#x27;m giving up on this stuff. Seemed like a waste of money for thinning hair. Did find with cleaning hair, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure it really minimizes the thinning that occurs from hair loss.  Use all 3 parts of the system.</li>
    <li> I found no difference with my hair after using this product for a month +. It was recommended to me, but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my thinning hair. Smells awful too. Do yourself a favor... Accept that you are going bald and just shave your noggin!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin for a month now with no change. My hair seems thinner now than before and it is very dry.</li>
    <li> Just started using it so won&#x27;t review the product, however one of the bottles (conditioner) was opened and some of the product had spilled. It wasn&#x27;t enough to return but I would appreciate more care with the products. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
    <li> I bought the system for coarse hair but thought six would be for those losing the most hair and I saw it was for treated hair. I would recommend possibly making that cleared.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product wasn&#x27;t authentic I feel it wasn&#x27;t. This product didn&#x27;t at all work for me the conditioner made my hair fall out even more than it had been. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I see no results actually seems to look thinner than it did before. Overall this was not a good purchase I&#x27;ll try again but I&#x27;ll get it from a salon.</li>
    <li> Great product if you don&#x27;t wish to wash hair often. Don&#x27;t know if it helps with growth but it sure makes it feel fuller!</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthier and thicker. The key is to keep using it. You won&#x27;t see results immediately, but over time, you will be satisfied just like me.</li>
    <li> I have tried some other solutions I found online but Nioxin is the system that works for me.  Gave it a  3 because it takes patience and time to see results but it does happen.  I saw new growth once I finished my first bottle of the three parts.  Now the two areas of my receding hairline is no longer see through to my scalp.</li>
    <li> The description says cleanser 10.1 oz, scalp Therapy 5.07. But you actually receive a 8.5 oz bottle of cleanser and 4.5 oz bottle of scalp therapy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and I didn&#x27;t find that my hair grew any faster.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I was very upset by my rapidly thinning hair - I was always the girl with lots of long, thick hair. My stylist had mentioned it a few times before and once I got fed up I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m loving the results! It&#x27;s not fully back to what it was, but it&#x27;s definitely getting there. You have to be really diligent. I also bought Nioxin Diamax which is pretty pricey but I use it 3-4 times a week and it&#x27;s great!</li>
