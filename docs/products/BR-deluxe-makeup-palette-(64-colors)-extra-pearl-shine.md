    <li> This is a gift to my daughter. She liked it very much. Recently i have order another set for brother&#x27;s daughter</li>
    <li> Way better than expected.  Strong pigments, so much packed into this, plus mirror. Bought for niece and she loved playing with it!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter love it.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my tween daughter who wants to try makeup (only at home!) for the first time. Very cute &amp; compact, decided on this one becuz of the mascara &amp; eye pencil, making it more of a complete kit than most others. I paid $18/free ship, 10 days ago.</li>
    <li> Great for the purpose intended - play make up for my grand daughter</li>
    <li> This is a smaller makeup kit that I bought as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It arrived in good shape, packaged well.  It is exactly as shown in the picture.  There is a small mirror in the top, there are brushes, blushers, eye shadows, etc. The trays lift up or slide out from the sides. It made for a nice gift.</li>
    <li> works great for my jr high girl, fits in her purse and she can do her makeup everywhere, great for kids that have gym</li>
    <li> So cute and adorable! You should buy it! I read customer reviews saying that the trays pop off but i think that only happens when you open it out too hard.The makeup has every color i needed and I am soo happy with it.</li>
    <li> hello,im savannah&lt;br /&gt;this makeup  is cute,its worithy andnot cheap and its for a low price i could wear it to attract boy since im so popular</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 12 year old for a spa birthday party. The girls loved making up their faces with the wide array of shades to choose from. I feel it&#x27;s a bit much for an adult woman and not as high quality as dept store makeup but great for teen girls.</li>
    <li> Great product with lots of choices and colors.  Easy to put on eye shadow and blush.  Sturdy in its make and easy to open and close the drawers.</li>
    <li> This is so beautiful love it I&#x27;m pleased to do business with you perfect kit I got everything here :)</li>

    <li> This was a present for my granddaughter she liked it very much and it was hypoallergenic which is very good</li>
    <li> Wonderful for teenager/ children (play ). It looks so beautiful. I can guarantee your teen will be thrilled! I did not tried the make up on myself so I can&#x27;t guarantee the quality of the make up for adult, but for a teen/ young adult, it is a more that they would ever need. Colors are pretty. Nothing clash or trashy . Definitely the best value I found even after checking all department stores!  Looks even better than on the picture.</li>

    <li> Our 16 year old niece thinks this kit is perfect for her wild taste.  She has a younger sister that loves it too.</li>
    <li> Was for my daughter and she loved it</li>
    <li> This was amazing it didn&#x27;t come broken or anything like that. But the lipgloss was all over the place. And it doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> Great makeup for the price!</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter who loves to play with make-up but is really too young to wear it. She enjoyed every single color and always went to show her mother how she looked. For a young girl, this palette is a very special treat. She especially liked the fact that it was real make-up, not pretend. Even her dolls wore it! Would buy this again in a minute.</li>
    <li> The case itself was hard to open and overall appeared very cheap. Bought as a Christmas gift but due to quality and appearance will not be giving to anyone.</li>
    <li> my wife love this makeup kit</li>
    <li> exelente maquillaje llego como se esperaba todo bien rapido envio se recomienda</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter just turned 12 and she loves this kit. Everything all so easy to use. A++seller</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11 year old niece for Christmas. Light, pretty colors. Good for her to learn with.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and early arrival.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the colors of this makeup set!!!</li>
    <li> This is good same which we were looking for</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful make-up kit!  I bought it for my Niece and she loves it!  It is perfect for play make-up for kids or even nice enough for true make-up for any adult.</li>
    <li> My Teens LOVE These! Lots of make up- small price- Wow!</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter loves it. It&#x27;s her play make up but it seems like it&#x27;s good quality. It has held up very well. None of it has broken or come loose. The case looks very nice. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old grand daughter loves this make up kit.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  It folds up to take it everywhere.  way cool.</li>
    <li> The materials were OK but I got two broken pallets hence I returned it. Good for a teenager may be but not the best for a grown woman.</li>
    <li> I like this makeup kit. It was not expensive at all. I&#x27;m 15, and this is almost perfect for me. None of the eyeshadows were broken. The eye liner was cheap. I had to buy a different one because it simply did not work right. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I lost the lipliner before I got a chance ot use it. There are many different color eyeshadows. Throughout the day, it starts to wear off and gather at the top of my eye lids. The solution is as simple as reapplying, but it&#x27;s still a pain.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to maybe 13-14 year olds. I suggest using lighter colors unless you are able to reapply the eyeshadow at least once. The eyeliner is not good, but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying this.</li>
    <li> Bought this a s gift. Looks nice and one in all. Compact design. This product is good for those who use very less makeup</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter.  She loves the make up, but the case broke the first day.  The trays that swing out were only held on by one tiny post and they snapped almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Yes, my daughter totally freaked out when she opened this as a Christmas gift.  This was her first makeup EVER!  She has been having so much fun with it; I totally recommend this, especially the price is extremely reasonable.  It opens up so many different ways to various kinds of makeup and colors, that in itself is so much fun for a little girl (well mine was 12 when she got it) and she uses it and plays with it all the time.  A great gift for a girl age 11 to 14!!</li>
    <li> Good for my daughter but not nice enough for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it. It is a great starter kit for young girls. Good quality.</li>
    <li> great. bought for my 7yr old daughter who wanted to play with mommy&#x27;s and aunt&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> nice looking product... i gifted to my cousion and she liked it very much</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. She enjoys all of the colors. I have borrowed some of the shadow when wanting to add color beyond my general colors. It seems to last well and blends well. The case is nice and it has everything she needs to travel with in one handy location.</li>
    <li> Very cute for a teen an even an adult. It comes with everything</li>
    <li> worth it decent price, please remember, these are for middle schoolers, not for gown women...that&#x27;s my opinion. I bought it for a girl in my neighborhood that went crazy or it, she absolutely loved it:)</li>
    <li> Good one. I expected it to be a little big in size</li>
    <li> Just perfect for the teenagers on your Christmas list.</li>
    <li> This was a nice selection of colors but the trays don&#x27;t swing open.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and a really awesome choice of colors however the palette itself is a lot bigger than I was expecting, I was hoping for something small that I could fit in my travel makeup bag but it&#x27;s a little larger than I was expecting/hoping. Nice product though</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 8 year old daughter to play with.  It is smaller than looks online, not much bigger than my hand.  It would make a great travel make up kit if someone is looking for that.</li>
    <li> Gift for my granddaughters. They love it.x x x x x x  x x x x x x x x</li>
    <li> This handy little kit is great for travel. It so convenient to use. I am actually wearing make up again</li>
