<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I wanted - works great!</li>
    <li> Below you will see the review of the original product i purchased at the derm&#x27;s office. However, on Amazon I got a fake product! The authentic lytera is a light caramel color and not ivory. Buyers beware! Who knows what that fake stuff can do to your face! Do not buy skinmedica products from Amazon sellers.  original review: i have a little hyper pigmentation under the eyes. i was obsessed with it and tried ipl, laser on a test spot (but i was too scared it would make my problem worse to actually try it on the entire area), hydroquinone (too irritating). i was ready to give up, but i recently visited an excellent dermatologist here in ny, and since i was there i thought i might as well ask what i coulddo for my problem. he suggested that i use lytera. he sold me the entire kit, which contains cleanser, spf, brightening complex and retinol complex. i only used the brightening complex on the two spots that bothered me. it does dry your skin a little (so make sure you use a super moisturizer such as aquafor or skinmedica post procedure moisturizer). two weeks later the two spots under my eyes have begun to lighten up... and i was told it would take two months to start seeing results! i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> No result after using for 5 months.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does a great job and lasts a very long time. Good value</li>
    <li> This lytera doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I bought at my dermis office. The consistency looks darker. I have a feeling that it is a fake product. Anything can happen if there is money to be made.</li>
    <li> great product to even out the color of you skin</li>
    <li> Good product. Priced too high</li>
    <li> Yes, I had used it before and really like it.  Your skin might be too sensitive for it.</li>
    <li> on my 3rd tube...will always use this...great ingredients..great results, this is well worth it..I&#x27;ll always have this on hand</li>
    <li> This brand is pricey, but less on Amazon than a spa I first tried it at. It is great at muting skin discolorations due to hormones and aging.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lytera for about four months now. It has been a gradual process, but I can now see a difference in my skin tone.  The ruddy areas have faded and my general coloring is more consistent.  I still have the age spots that I originally wanted to erase, but they are not as prominent as they were before. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this bottle is authentic or if they changed the formula. My first bottle I purchased from my Dermatologist. I saw it was cheaper on Amazon and purchased it. The color of the lotion is white while my first purchase from my doctor was a light tan. See photo, the swatch on the left is from my doctor.</li>
    <li> I bought it from Skincarerx after listening to their skin care specialist bragging about it.  I paid more than what is listed on Amazon and was really disappointed.  It is nothing but a high priced JUNK!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and will reorder again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the product. . I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Will repurchase and is a highly effective product.  I am of spanish decent and it is working in fading my brown spots.  Best product I have used on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best brightening cream out there</li>
    <li> This was suggest by my dermatologist as a way to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; my face and lessen any dark (age) spots. I couldn&#x27;t justify the price they were charging, but came home and found it on Amazon. I thought it might be worth trying. I was wrong! I am continuing to use it in the hope that suddenly there will be improvement, but actually just trying to use it up rather than wasting it. I would not recommend you waste your money.</li>
    <li> I use this with vitamin c ferrulic and use sunscreen. Has a nice texture, smell and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I immediately got a rash on my face and had to discontinue using this product amd returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than three months. It was recommended by my dermatologist, so I purchased the entire kit. Don&#x27;t throw your hard earned money away like I did, the product simply does not work. Usually my skin takes to products easy, and I see quick results, however this product has just make my skin look so dull! It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s not worth a dime. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I decided to finally get serious about repairing years of skin damage and purchased this along with Skinmedica Tri-Retinol ES. I have skin that is very reactive to silicones and it is extremely rare to find treatment products that have no/low silicones; these fit that requirement. I have been using Lytera twice daily (per instructions) along with the tri-retinol every other night and although my skin is showing signs of retinol acclimation (dry, flaking, sensitive; lytera also has retinol as an ingredient) I absolutely see lightening of sunspots and freckles beginning. My MD says that most people mess up because they stop using retinol products at the first sign of flaking, wait, start again, see flaking, repeat...and their skin never gets to the point of showing results. I&#x27;m encouraged to see even minor changes after just two weeks and intend to continue with both products (and hope to eventually be able to use the retinol complex every night). Using a great moisturizer at night has also minimized skin sensitivity and flaking. I believe that there is no instant fix available from topicals but slow and consistent is a good strategy.</li>
    <li> It appeared the seller diluted the product. The clear wrapper looked like it was tampered with at the bottom of the box.  The color is lighter and consistency is runnier than the current bottle that I&#x27;m using that I bought from the aesthetic medicine office.</li>
    <li> Awesome !! Noticed a brightening to my face. Skin is softer, pores smaller. Using in conjunction with skin medica cleanser, and dermrepair and tns eye cream in conjunction with clarisonic Mia and opalsonic. Only been using 2 weeks.  However some lightening of my hyperpigmentation. Can&#x27;t wait to see results after the full 12 !</li>
    <li> I do believe two sun spots have substantially lightened since using Lytera. I like the consistency and it soaks in.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous brown spot lightening creams, this is the best by far. I bought it on the recommendation of my doctor.</li>
    <li> I was sent a tiny sample which did a stupendous job inside 2 days.  The Lytera that I bought doesn&#x27;t do the same as the sample.</li>
    <li> Just the same as what I purchase at the dermatologist except much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this product every other day for several months and, while it felt smooth, I did not notice any difference in my skin tone or dark spots.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful for my dark spot.</li>
    <li> I consider this product an effective one, I started using the product  for 2 months and I see my skin is starting to lighten and even. I guess I don&#x27;t need to apply Vit. C since it is included in the ingredients. I will recommend this product to my daughter who has acne scars and to my ftiends who have  skin problems.</li>
    <li> A Dermatologist on the Today Show boasted about this product so I bought it. It&#x27;s been over a month and I do not notice any difference at all. Really disappointed:/</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after just 2 weeks.  I hav dark spots from being in the sun and have tried many products  over the years. A friend told me about Lytera and I am amazed at the difference, The dark hyper pigmentation on one side GONE and the other is getting lighter every day. Live this product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by the office where I get my hair removal laser treatments.  They sell it for $100 and I got it for $85 thru Amazon.  I have almost finished using it religiously daily and see absolutely no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Part of my daily facial routine.Used it for years.</li>
    <li> All of the Skin Medica line is Great! I use many of the products and love them... I have noticed many things with using Lytera to include brightening. This being used with the Retinal is a great combo. Skin care like anything else is very important. My skin care clinic recommended this brand for me and I have been hooked ever since.</li>
    <li> Skinmedica says Amazon is not an authorized seller.  But for a significant price reduction I thought it was worth taking a chance.  Only time would tell if it&#x27;s worth it.  I initially got a sample from my dermatologist who dispensed it out of the same pump bottle and the creme was a light ivory color and when using it, I got a tingling sensation on my skin the first few minutes.  The product I purchased at significantly reduced price thru amazon, although the box appeared to be sealed, the lotion was a brown/mustard color and did not leave the sensation on my skin.  Not sure why the significant change in appearance, but I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time trying this product that might be questionable as I wanted results more then saving $50 and wasting my time.  It ended up costing me more as I went back and purchased another bottle from the physician at full price and that bottle dispensed a light ivory lotion.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, at least I&#x27;ll know I was working with a full strength product.  I was told the discoloration could be due to oxidation or age, not going to speculate how the bottle I got on Amazon got that way.</li>
    <li> The order came just as advertised. It&#x27;s a good product at a reduced rate! This is my second purchase of the product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what it said it would. It did nothing to lighten my dark spots on my skin. Not happy at all with the lack of results.  So frustrating.</li>
    <li> IT DID NOTHING. I USED AS DIRECTED.  I GOT SUCKED IN BY THE BRAND AND THE NAME.  I DID NOT &amp;#34;BRIGHTEN&amp;#34; MY SKIN IT DID NOT WORK ON ANY DISCOLORATION. I USED THE WHOLD BOTTLE HOPING IT WOULD WORK BUT JUST LEARNED A LESSON. READ THE INGREDIENTS.  ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS.  IT REALLY DID NOTHING TO IMPROVE MY SKIN SO USING IT FOR AS LONG AS I DID I BASICALLY MADE MY SKIN WORSE SINCE I WASN&#x27;T USING SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK, LIKE SKINCEUTICALS, OR YSL FOREVER LOGHT CREATOR SERUM. THE PRICE FOR THIS ITEM IS OUTRAGEOUS CONSIDERING IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  NORMALLY, I WOULDN&#x27;T BE SO HARSH &amp; SAY IT MAY WORK FOR YOU BUT I WILL GO SO FAR AS TO SAY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  THIS ITEM DOES NOT BRIGHTEN OR HELP WITH DISCOLORATION.</li>
    <li> a lot of money for something that only worked ok</li>
    <li> Not sure think the product was old, seemed more yellow than the product I purchased&lt;br /&gt;from a spa.</li>
    <li> I think my sun spots may be a little lighter but I need more time to be sure. don&#x27;t notice my skin being any brighter...I&#x27;m hopeful though!</li>
    <li> The cream was a mustard brown instead of the yellowish color is usually is and smelled funny? Moldy? The top of the container was very loose like it had been tampered with . It was awful . My rating is -1 star. Shame on the seller .</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Lytera to help to reduce sun damage and sun spots without using hydroquinine.  By the beginning of my second week.......my skin turned bright red and burned horribly.  Then my face started to peel significantly.....for over a week.  Altho it did seem lighten my spots.....the intense burning was too much to bear.  I gave up on it after about 10 days.</li>
    <li> The results are very gradual and the product is difficult to pump.  Why mot use a jar or tube or some other packaging?</li>
    <li> After trying countless products, this is the only one that reduces my age spot and melasma without aggravating my rosacea.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist has me using this.It works well. I had trouble finding the time to go by the practice and pick it up so I like that I can order it and have it delivered.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by my dermatologist.  My skin is very sensitive and it is not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference since using the product of my skin tone being better. I have only been using it a couple of weeks so maybe after another couple of weeks there will be a difference.</li>
    <li> If you are ok to use something every night (rec&#x27;d AM &amp; PM but I only use PM as I refuse to put on a treatment cream PLUS sunscreen PLUS makeup-just too much to layer on and do) for months, it should work as it did for me. Definitely lightened my sun-damage/old acne spots considerably. 2oz bottle lasted me A YEAR this way. OVERPAID for it at dermatologist&#x27;s office - BUY IT HERE for about 85.00 while Dr&#x27;s will charge 125-175!!! Nice faint cinnamon/licorice type scent not overpowering, light lotion/cream feel, does some decent moisturization and takes a minute or two to absorb on my normal skin. Works, but takes months if you can commit. Worth it to avoid other skin lightening things like carcinogenic hydroquinone.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on the skin but it has not lightened any of the dark spots I have on my skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and well packed.  Item appears to be authentic.  I only had it for a week, so It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it works.</li>
    <li> great price! I got this same product from my dermatologist for $134.00. It really makes a difference on the skin!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Lytera and I recommend it, although I can tell from the reviews that results vary. For me, it&#x27;s not a total cure (or miracle) for my hyper-pigmentation, but it does work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended Lytera. She feels it&#x27;s safer and better performing than hydroquinone products. She did tell me (because I asked due to the price) that you have to keep using Lytera, and don&#x27;t stop, which kind of bums me out but doesn&#x27;t surprise me. My first bottle was $125 at the docs office, and I was hesitant to purchase it any other way, but I&#x27;m so glad I looked for a better price (and glad it&#x27;s on Amazon!). The quality from the Amazon vendor was the same as my original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had completely run out for several days by the time 2nd bottle arrived, and I could not wait to get this stuff back on my cheeks. It lightens my dark patches, which makes it WAY easier for me to camouflage my blotchy skin with makeup yet still look like a real person (too much makeup is not my thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, about a week after I started using the bottle from Amazon, a close friend commented that my makeup was really working to hide my melasma (she knows all about it), but whoa, I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make up when I saw her! The freshness of this product does seem to matter. The newer the bottle is, the better it seems to work. If you try it, use it morning and night, and wear sunscreen (or moisturizer with spf) over it during the day.</li>
    <li> was told to use this for my melisma inbetween triluma.  It is expensive and I have been usin git for two months now.  it has done absolutely nothing other than feel soft.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it does seem to gently lighten melasma spots over time. If you have melasma (dark spots on your cheeks and/or above you lips, you know it sucks and is hard to get rid of.  This product seems to help.  My dermatologist said you won&#x27;t see results until 5-6 weeks.  I think I could tell a difference in 3-4...subtle but any little bit is greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have used it for a year now and have noticed a nice chance in my skin color and texture.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvements to my skin yet - but I have not used it for a complete month.  I bought this product to fade the age spots on my face.  Will see if they lighten up after one month.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist for dark spots.  It&#x27;s expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Shipping was ground so it took longer than wanted. But the product is great. It does take some time. This is my second bottle. I will order more!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Skinmedica Brightening Complex.  I continued it&#x27;s use because I have seen significant results in the lightening and near removal of my many age related and sun related brown spots on my face.  I started using their full line of cleansing, lightening, retinol and sunscreen products about 6 months ago.  As a result, my friends and relatives that I have not seen in a while, always comment on how great and youthful my skin looks.  I would recommend this product line to anyone looking to improve their skin tone, elasticity, moisture and regain a more youthful, healthy look.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this line of products but if there was one I&#x27;d pass on, it would probably be this one. First, it stings when you put it on. Second, after several weeks I haven&#x27;t seen much in results. The other Skin Medica products have been great. This one? Just okay.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service! Great product.</li>
    <li> This really works. I started seeing results in as little as two days!!</li>
    <li> Have tried other skin lightening products &amp; wasted my money. Lytera is so worth paying a little more &amp; lasts a long time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just have one week using this product and I can believe the diference I have in my face, I tryed so many products and not one did anything! I love it and I want to use the whole line!</li>
    <li> ....I don&#x27;t see any changes.  I will continue using it till gone in case it needs longer time to be effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/7/2013:  Want to change my 3 stars for 1 star.  It gets the one star because I really like the smell. I have not seen even the slightest change to my skin.</li>
    <li> love this line of skin products.  Good price.  Brand new in package.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now. I noticed an improvement in two weeks and I am very satisfied and happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting for the results. After using it for a month I wonder for how long more I have to use it to see  any positive result.</li>
    <li> Works well after having a a breakout. I get hormonal pimples and just one appears on my face once a month. Well, I had a huge cystic one on my cheek (never has happened before) the size of a dime. After the pimple resolved, I started to put Lytera on with a q-tip and within a week, the scar was gone and now just have a dot the size of a pen mark left. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using it since last December, I already have seen a huge improvement in my skin tone.  Iw ould definitely recommend it.  The seller was great, I got it on time and it was as it was shown, well package and a good place to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, great results</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my skin and was definately not worth the cost!  After almost a month, there is no noticeable difference in my skin other than it being a bit drier!</li>
    <li> The product may work but I wouldn&#x27;t know as the push down top broke the third time I used it.  I had heard that the quality of the container wasn&#x27;t very good and those people were correct.  Maybe they should make a self applying top where you pour a dab on your hand instead of the dispenser type bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful face product.  You can see results almost immediately.  And, about half the price that my dermatologist was selling this product for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for black spots</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local facial salon and it was $125.  Found it here for a lot less.  Have been using this for about 3 months and I feel like it makes my skin look glowy.</li>
    <li> This product has been expired or something because the cream color is very dark like chocolate (the good one I bought from a dermatology has milky color which was in good condition before) and has no effect or tingling. It is expired!</li>
    <li> I used it for ~ 3 weeks for sun spots on my face but saw no changes.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my dermatologist.  Late 40&#x27;s and battling sun damage on my face.  This product took it away quite quickly if used morning and night.  However, if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen, the spots are just going to return.  I went on a week beach vacation and allowed myself to tan.  As you can guess, the one large spot came back.  Grrrr.  I will continue to use this product and will just keep my face out of the sun.  Besides, they make makeup where you can fake a tan, right?</li>
    <li> Would never order again.  I think they were old products.</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve used which delivers what it claims; lighten those brown spots/clarifies facial tone. Have used for 4 months and will continue well worth it!</li>
    <li> I noticed a visible difference after only using this product for 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The only side-effect was it made my eye area puffy.</li>
    <li> LOVE this... had super pigmentation on my cheeks ( couldn&#x27;t use blush for years as it looked like a red blob no matter how light the colour) three weeks of this stuff and i am using blush on again. can&#x27;t recommend it enough</li>
    <li> trust it is doing what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> I have been using lytera for a short period of time. I feels very good on the skin. I am not sure if it makes a difference after applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I would like the container&lt;br /&gt;to show some indication that the container is near empty so that I can reorder it. I purchased the item from Amazon aand I was very satisfied with the service.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra Smith</li>
    <li> Im so satisfied with the results. I Use Lytera day and night and see a big difference in the brightening of my skin tone. Ill also love that it is sensitive enough for my skin without causing any redness or irritations.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.....how refreshing!</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product by an MD but couldn&#x27;t afford the retail price. I found it on the Skin Care Rx website on sale. I believe they are actually authorized distributors but it was still over $100. It worked great for me it completely faded 2 obvious age/sun spots on my forehead in 2 months. (I&#x27;m a 55 yr old WF) I can only use it at night because it beads up under my make up. If I had time to wait longer  between applications it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Getting ready to order a new bottle but going to try this distributor. I hope their product is legit as I will definitely be able to tell the difference. As for those giving low stars and saying it doesn&#x27;t work I would suggest they try a true Retin A product along with it to help turn over the skin cells faster and lighten at the same time. As for using in the eye area I do not put it under my eyes but I do put it in the eye area around the nasal bones where I have skin discoloration. It will not get rid of dark circles but it could fade sun spots in the under eye area and brighten the skin.  I will let you know what I think about the product this company is getting ready to send me. The 5 stars above are for the product off the Skin Care Rx website. I hope this new suppliers product stands up and can keep the stars. I&#x27;ll update this rating in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I I have used this product for two and half weeks, it feels great so far.  Good product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it but no sunscreen.  A little pricey</li>
    <li> Need more time to get get the desired results</li>
    <li> Miracle worker! I never run out!</li>
    <li> I like the smell.  It will take time to see results.</li>
    <li> So, fabulous! I hate when I fall in love with another Skinmedica. product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about four months..my.skin feels great but I don&#x27;t see much difference in it&#x27;s brightness.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!  I am an  avid outdoors person and though I use sun block religiously, I  have suffered from sun spots since my mid twenties. I am now in my mid fifties and still get sun spots on my forehead and lower chin area.  I have been on Retin-A for years and have tried several other skin brightening solutions but the spots never completely disappear.  I have just completed my first bottle of Lytera and can actually see significant fading on the forehead and the chin area is almost 100% clear. I will continue to use Retin-A, Lytera and sunblock and hope to see the spots completely fade away for the first time in 25 years!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product; I&#x27;ve been going to her since 2000.  For my skin type (fair, 62 yrs. old) Lytera is fantastic.  After one month, my husband even noticed the difference.  Since I&#x27;m between bottles, I can see that my skin is returning to its original appearance...which isn&#x27;t terrible, but certainly isn&#x27;t good.  Also, it only takes two pea sized applications, one for face, the other for neck and upper chest area.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this product.  She lives by it and says it&#x27;s completely worth the money.  She struggled with acne due to pregnancy, but I never knew it until seeing pictures of her in the past.</li>
    <li> Works great! Even on very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many Skin Brightening components &amp; this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a year now and it is the only thing that works for me apart from fraxel laser. Every other product I have tried is inferior.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for two weeks, it was recommended by my dermatologist. After the second week of use I begin to break out in hives. This is way to expensive to waist money on. I would never purchase this product ever again. I have hives every area I placed on my dark spots</li>
    <li> Lytera works well with lightening and skin smoothness due to it contains retinol.  The price was discounted.</li>
    <li> Only 2 stars for now for arriving nicely packaged.  Well I received the package, took a whole week to arrive as they promised however I have only been using it for three days day and night, will have to see what results it gives! The pics below shows what my face looks like on day one of starting this cream.  I&#x27;m 41 years of age.  I cant wait to see the results.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff for reddness control.  I ran out and was unpleasantly surprised by the results.  I bought more immediately!</li>
    <li> This skin lightning cream was recommended by a plastic surgeon.  It is so awesome.  Sent on time by seller and would buy again.  Really works on lightning your skin if used day and night.  Love it!</li>
    <li> MUST have for anyone with hyperpigmentation, melasma, or prone to sun damage.  Must use everyday to keep those melanocytes from producing the brown pigmentation.  Also a must have after laser treatments or chemical peels to lighten the skin if you want to protect your investment.</li>
    <li> My container lasted for about 6wks, as I was putting it on the back of my hands as well as my face, a.m. &amp; p.m. I didn&#x27;t notice ANY change at all in  the discolorations and I use SkinMedica Sunscreen and a Visor every time I go outside for any length of time. I&#x27;ve decided to go back to Hydroquinone w/AHA (from Paula Begoun at about 1/3 the price) and am also going to try Kojie San Soap, next. Very disappointing, considering SkinMedica *usually* has superior products. Maybe it works, if you use it for several months, but I can&#x27;t justify continuing buying something for a high price, without any results after a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I don&#x27;t care for the pump container either. I decided to unscrew the cap and lo and behold, there&#x27;s another 3-4 days worth, that can be scooped out with a Q-tip. Same thing with the TNS serum.</li>
    <li> Deals effectively with age spots and brightens the skin.  I have sensitive skin and while it took a little bit of adjustment, I find it very effective on my skin.</li>
    <li> Remarkable product. I have been using this product along with the Skin Medica Retinol over the past two weeks. My skinn is much tighter and luminous. Effective on wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> Have tried many products/tx for melasma- including IPL, peels, prescription hydroquinone and Tri-luma.  I have been using SkinMedica Lyterra and retinol tx for 2 months and am starting to see spots lighten. Definitely need patience and consistency in treating melasma.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a product that works. A Registered Nurse actually recommended this product to me. I received bad burns on my face from a Microderm abrasion peel in 2009, which left my face very discolored &amp; hyper pigmented. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I notice a BIG difference. My face appears to glow, and the sun spots are fading drastically. I HIGHLY recommended this product. I also wear SPF everyday!</li>
    <li> The product received is discolored to be brown in color instead of being white cream.  The seller would not let me return it so far! I have ordered directly from SkinMedica this product and is white cream. The product works well with me but need to make sure it is not degenerated/old/defective before you use it. I am going to order it from SkinMedica from now on, although it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before for dark spots on my face.  The cream help to decrease the spots.  I like the feel of the cream of my face.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month now.  I read all of the other reviews and thought I would try the product -- it is a little expensive so you need to use it sparingly.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything -- no warmth, no flaking, no nothing....so does it work, well I&#x27;m not sure.  I still have a lot of the product to use so need to give it a chance.  There is no odor, it goes on easily and you don&#x27;t have to use much -- use only on the spots you are trying to correct.  So I&#x27;ll keep using it on those areas I want to lighten.  I&#x27;ll give another update in a couple of months -- oh, yes, be sure to wear sunscreen after this product \\&quot;soaks in\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- I have finished using this product.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think it worked well.  I learned of this product on Good Morning America awhile ago and thought I would try it.  Perhaps it works for some but didn&#x27;t for me.  My spots are not dark so I thought it would soften the color --- but I don&#x27;t see any results.  For the price I would not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, My dermatoligist said that this type of product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for years with dark spots and skin discoloration from sun exposure to pregnancy. You name the product, I have used it expensive or simple otc. I have had success with just a few produtcs. One starting with discovering your liver actually rids toxins through your skin. Vitamins and a detox every now and then has helped dramatically. My first product was Osmosis Restore Internal Immune Repair along with Topical Immune Repair. In conjunction these two work harmoniously in fading your dark spots. You have to use each product as it states, one will not work without the other. Though the product runs 100.00 each, it was worth starting the journey. My next successful product is the Youth Code corrector. I had great success with just 19.99 when on sale at the nearest corner store. This maintained my skin until I had a Photofacial. This had been recommended years ago by my dermatologist. The general concern is it may worsen your skin, thus taking me years to break the bank and accepting what may happen. The results of the Photofacial brought me to tears wishing I had done so years ago. In the end, Lytera had helped maintain those areas still existing. Keep in mind I had only one treatment so far, at least 5 are recommended. Lytera has helped areas I have not treated with the Photofacial more so than expected. I have found my new go to and will never stop using this product. Each product I have listed had helped dramatically, in conjunction with Lytera I could only imagine the results. Don&#x27;t hesitate when considering this purchase. Do not skip applications, do not wear without sunblock nor expect a miracle in just a few weeks. Every skin type is different what may take you a month may take another two in order to see results. Patience people, all you have is time at this point and you will see results.</li>
    <li> Bought on recommendation of cosmetic dermatologist.  Been using for several weeks.  Have not seen skin improvement yet.  Container not well designed.  Pump dispenser quit working after about a week.  Had to unscrew the top and take out lotion with a cue tip.</li>
    <li> It keeps my face looking fresh with an even tone.  Sometime I use it every other day because my skin gets sensitive to it.  Costs almost half as much as my spa charges.</li>
    <li> I have used Lytera for several months. There has been NO CHANGE in my skin!!!  I am a product guru and this is one you can skip.  Save your money. Two thumbs down...one star!</li>
    <li> This product was reviewed in a magazine last year and I decided to give it a try.  I have some large dark spots on my face that are, thankfully,  non-cancerous and I wanted to lighten them.  This is not an overnight cure (at least for me) but I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and can see noticeable improvement.  These spots have not disappeared but most have lightened quite a bit.  It is a fairly pricey product but it was well worth trying for me.</li>
    <li> My first bottle costing much more came from my dermatologist. This is an authentic product in the same sealed box like my first purchase, just a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks now but so far, I love it. I love the consistency &amp; smell. Time will tell if it works or not. Will do another review in a month or two(enough time to show any results).</li>
    <li> This product is very drying.  You will lose layers of skin and, I assume, your skin will eventually look clearer and brighter.  I couldn&#x27;t use it twice a day as instructed as my skin was peeling off making me look like I had facial &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34;!  Maybe I&#x27;m just super sensitive, but in my opinion it isn&#x27;t a miracle topical cream that will change your skin overnight~~~ unless you had dry, flaky skin in mind.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful about this line but have been disappointed with the results. No improvement or changes.  Maybe a different experience for you.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product from Amazon...I recently purchased this product directly from Skinmedica. Pay the extra money and buy direct. You will see a difference in the color scent and overall quality of the product.</li>
    <li> very good if you have oily skin but has not yet done much for my pigmentation  on my face as this is my third bottle will just finish this bottle then try organic pharmacy</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff ,my skin looks so much brighter.it feels wonderful .has a very nice scent to it.waiting to see if it fades any brown spots.</li>
    <li> I purchased first bottle of this from Plastic Surgeons office and was very happy with the product except price. I was aware of the risk of buying from Amazon and affiliates but for price difference I would give it a try. BIG mistake. It did nothing for my skin and product was a darker color. I believe it was old or not stored properly. I purchased another bottle from Plastic Surgeons office and noticed a big difference in one night. Big lesson learned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months and have seen improvements in my skin tone. Bought 1st bottle from derm at nearly double the cost. This one was the exact same for half.  Works well enough as my daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t trust this product. I don&#x27;t have any good review about it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my  skin professional  it&#x27;s price was much lower than I had gotten. I encourage you to purchase it</li>
    <li> I did not find this worked at all, additionally it turn a dark beige color, and I am pretty sure the product was old when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I just received this and opened the bottle to see that it is discolored.  I&#x27;m thinking maybe it is older and wondering if it will even work.  It was less expensive, but now I&amp;#34;m thinking I should have paid more for one from a legitimate distributor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old, live on the beach and have since a child.  I have had numerous chemical peels, but nothing has compared to this product.  ALL my age spots are gone.  I use it in the evening before I go to bed, after I use my Clarisonic with Cetafil for sensitive skin.  One bottle has lasted me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many different products to simply reduce the age/sun spots on my face, but had no idea Lytera would actually make them literally disappear.</li>
    <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approx 6wks, and I like it. I have not noticed a HUGE difference in my hyperpigmentation, but my skin does look brighter, so I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;I switched from using Obagi, I want to try something without hydriquinone, so I&#x27;m not sure how this works in comp to that. I have nothing negative to say about this. It also goes on light.</li>
    <li> Is the best product,I really liked it</li>
    <li> love it and have used it for almost 2 years, $$$$$ but worth it.</li>
    <li> very powerful...I can only use it 3 times a week if I don&#x27;t want to be peeling excessively</li>
    <li> This product has made all the brown pigmentation on my skin go darker???!!!!  I thought if I paid a lot of money for a product it would work.  It is also a light tan colour and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s &#x27;off&#x27;.  It was sealed on receipt though.  I feel as though I have wasted my money and will not be purchasing further Skin Medica product.</li>
    <li> Already beginning to see results after only using it over a week now.</li>
    <li> good price for this product, should purchase</li>
</ol>
