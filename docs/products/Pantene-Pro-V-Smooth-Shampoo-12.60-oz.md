<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, affordable solution for frizz.</li>

      <li>It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine, with beautiful body.  </li>
      <li>They like the scent and are happy with the appearance of their hair at the ends.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent, &amp; feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame--it seemed like it should&#x27;ve been a great product--</li>
      <li>Lathers well &amp; smells great, too.</li>
      <li>She uses swimmer&#x27;s shampoo which works great to protect against the chlorine</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is a great start.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, not overpowering.    </li>
      <li>but I found this shampoo and conditioner combo to be an improvement at reducing the frizz, and even better it&#x27;s incredibly affordable.</li>
      <li>It works best if you use [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce</li>
      <li>The&lt;br /&gt;product itself is not a bad one, but it is also not the best for frizz</li>
      <li>In the end I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase &amp; would definately buy this again.</li>
      <li>I am really happy with Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Loving the smell and lather of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t surprise me because I&#x27;ve found that Pantene always does make nice shampoo that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>I am loving</li>
      <li>What I did notice is that the shampoo smells good and has a feel and texture to it that is more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The smell is quite nice as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs!</li>
      <li>Hands down,&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Frizzy to Smooth\\&quot; shampoo was a good product to simply clean your hair,&lt;br /&gt;leaving</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a mild and pleasant scent, and it does not leave any filmy residue.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims to do and smells GREAT while doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With that said, if you don&#x27;t want to buy both, I think the conditioner would be a better buy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not frizzy in a curly way-I just have a lot, which creates flyaways and \\&quot;flipping\\&quot;, in areas where I don&#x27;t want it:)</li>
      <li>I am definitely satisfied with the results</li>
      <li>They are thrilled with the smooth hair results</li>
      <li>My hair did stay more \\&quot;calm\\&quot; although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, this never wavered my love for the Pantene.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has been a favorite among all of them.</li>
      <li>it smelling nice and smooth, but for its intention of controlling</li>
      <li>/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top ), which works much better to control frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine.  </li>
      <li>you have a daughter with lots of tangles, be sure to check out Pantene&#x27;s line of detanglers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>The biggest point I can make is that they wanted more when the bottle ran out.  </li>
      <li>So I needed a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t cause more harm.  </li>
      <li>The product tackles the problem of dry frizz incredibly well, and it lathers up nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my hair too flat and lifeless, thought it does do a good job of cleaning and smells quite nice!</li>
      <li>Longevity and health of my hair is more important to me than its looks.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pantene as my primary shampoo for more than two years now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a Pantene, it really smooths your hair, and the fragrance smells good.  </li>
      <li>different in quality; however, although this shampoo mildly controlled my&lt;br /&gt;frizz, I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo to be the best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While this product did not eliminate all of the frizziness that my hair is prone to, it did significantly reduce the amount of frizziness and did remarkably better than the every-day product I was using that was not formulated for medium-thick hair.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily and washes out that way too...</li>
      <li>The strong fragrance, however, did not carry from the bottled product to my hair after washing.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I will have any strong desire to go out of my way to purchase this shampoo again.     </li>
      <li>Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Anti-Breakage Detangler, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo works fine.</li>
      <li>Once my hair dries it&#x27;s smooth and easy to brush and comb</li>
      <li>in all... if you don&#x27;t expect miracles, it&#x27;s a fine shampoo.</li>
      <li>Wow, I was really impressed with this new conditioner.</li>
      <li>Is the difference hugely noticeable?  </li>
      <li>A system of shampoo, and some styling product to take some of the fullness out of my hair has always been important to my routine.</li>
      <li>And this product, Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick hair solutions Frizzy to smooth shampoo just seals the deal.    </li>
      <li>When I got the chance to review this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner, [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce</li>
      <li>I liked it that much.      </li>
      <li>G Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series Light Conditioning Detangler, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This stuff really works - it makes my wavy hair really smooth; good for those times I want to wear it straight.  </li>
      <li>It suds up very well so doesn&#x27;t take a large quantity to get a good wash.</li>
      <li>I tried the shampoo a number of times, alternating hairstyles just to be sure, but found that it left my hair drier than normal and more prone to tangles--and even mats!!</li>
      <li>I tried using better conditioners after the swimmer shampoo but nothing really seemed to help.  </li>
      <li>It works well on long hair and provide a pleasant scent, while it works to repair the frizziness.  </li>
      <li>I also like that it smells fresh and clean, not like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it has a great lather and a nice smell - it&#x27;s similar to all of the other shampoos in the Pantene line.  </li>
      <li>After about 2 uses, I started to see great results, the frizz has gone down a lot!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot</li>
      <li>I do not color or treat my hair in anyway, and rarely use a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells amazing, is noticably creamier and smoother than other shapoos I have used, and washes out clean-very important for the thickness of my hair.</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m alternating between [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh and not too chemically, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the product and will continue to use it, although I still enjoy variety and will continue to use other products.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in South Louisiana, and June is quite possibly the most humid time of the year for us - the humidity levels are off the charts!    </li>
      <li>The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare.</li>
      <li>latter product was much better</li>
      <li>When I first started using the shampoo, the smell reminded me of fruit-punch bubble-gum.  </li>
      <li>As usual, my hair was soft, smooth, and smelled nice!</li>
      <li>I have three teen girls who want to maintain great hair health and two have very long hair.  </li>
      <li>so should be easy to get every last drop out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>shampoo itself is nice and thick, lathers up quickly, rinses nicely, and has a subtle fragrance similar to hand soap (it&#x27;s not floral or fruity which is nice for men).  </li>
      <li>and I really LIKE Pantene.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I tend to have very frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this-Pantene does it again!</li>
      <li>This is a plus for a guy that just wants to wash and go.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really pay that much attention to which products I use</li>
      <li>After seeing this new frizzy-to-smooth solution, which exactly fitted my need, I deiced to give it a go.    </li>
      <li>I typically have very thick &amp; frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to conditioners, I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot &amp; am glad I did.</li>
      <li>Although my hair can fit the description for this shampoo at times (medium thickness, a little frizzy), I can&#x27;t really say how well it actually smoothed my hair, since I use gel most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Another thing I&#x27;d like to add is normally when using conditioners my hair is very tangly after a shower, with this though no tangles at all.  </li>
      <li>Other than this one, admittedly minor, gripe it&#x27;s a good shampoo that works as advertised.</li>
      <li>I am pleased to say that this shampoo did seem to cut down on frizz,</li>
      <li>So far the best I&#x27;ve found is Herbal Essences \\&quot;Dangerously Straight.\\</li>

      <li>It really helped smooth her hair and add moisture to the especially dry ends.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I live in South Louisiana, and June is quite possibly the most humid time of the year for us - the humidity levels are off the charts!    To start, I like this shampoo, it has a great lather and a nice smell - it&#x27;s similar to all of the other shampoos in the Pantene line.  One thing to especially note is that this shampoo definitely weighs your hair down, which is great for humid areas, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up the moment I walk outside, but I also feel like it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;too\\&quot; heavy....Almost looks like I didn&#x27;t wash it.      My hair is medium to thick texture, some natural curl to it, and frizzes up instantly in humid weather - the shampoo does what it says, it really is a hair solution for frizzy hair, but it does have a con - it weighs my hair down just a bit too much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for just under a month now and have found it to work almost as well as Bumble and Bumble curly hair products.  My hair is extremely dark, thick, coarse, and brittle.  So I needed a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t cause more harm.  I am pleased to say that this shampoo did seem to cut down on frizz, although the results weren&#x27;t immediate--I started to see an improvement after about 2 weeks of use (every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 Star because Pantene Products are tested on animals.</li>
    <li> First let me start by telling you a little about my hair.  I have thick wavy hair that is about 6 inches long.  The only products I use are leave-in conditioner and gel.  I do not color or treat my hair in anyway, and rarely use a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V&#x27;s Frizzy to Smooth shampoo is supposed to work, in conjunction with the matching conditioner, to tame frizzy thick hair.  Does it do that?  I would say only a little more than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  If I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair after washing it, it still gets a little crazy and frizzy, but the Pantene helps a tad.  Is the difference hugely noticeable?  No, but it is something.  If your hair is only moderately frizzy than it may work well for you, but I have a hard time believing that without applying product after shampooing, anyone&#x27;s&#x27; hair would be smooth.  I will, however, give the Pantene products credit for making my hair feel softer than my previous shampoo and conditioner I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is nice and thick, lathers up quickly, rinses nicely, and has a subtle fragrance similar to hand soap (it&#x27;s not floral or fruity which is nice for men).  I used both the shampoo and conditioner so if you notice two very similar reviews for these products, that&#x27;s why.  With that said, if you don&#x27;t want to buy both, I think the conditioner would be a better buy.  It&#x27;s very thick and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... if you don&#x27;t expect miracles, it&#x27;s a fine shampoo.</li>
    <li> Wow, I was really impressed with this new conditioner. It&#x27;s got a great scent, &amp; feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair. I typically have very thick &amp; frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to conditioners, I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot &amp; am glad I did. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the commercial. They advertise that you&#x27;re supposed to wake up in the morning without the frizzy do. I kinda assumed this was BS from the get go &amp; therefore am not being uber critical, but there you have the 4 stars. Another thing I&#x27;d like to add is normally when using conditioners my hair is very tangly after a shower, with this though no tangles at all.  In the end I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase &amp; would definately buy this again.</li>
    <li> I suppose my hair matches the type targeted for this product, as it is thick. And with it being [self-]cut as short as it is, it can be prone to frizz (not that it bothers me). I just wanted to try the shampoo, okay!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo, my hair feels soft and smooth and my head doesn&#x27;t look like a fuzzy coconut as it normally might when using some other shampoos without conditioning. The product tackles the problem of dry frizz incredibly well, and it lathers up nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem with dry, frizzy hair then I suggest you give this product a try. I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Loving the smell and lather of this shampoo. It&#x27;s light and fresh and not too chemically, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft. It&#x27;s on the repeat list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene as my primary shampoo for more than two years now. After seeing this new frizzy-to-smooth solution, which exactly fitted my need, I deiced to give it a go.    The first thing you notice is that, this particular shampoo is not as thick as my previous one (natureFusion). And the second thing you&#x27;ll feel (just after you&#x27;re finished, and started rinsing) is it leaves a stickiness in your hair. This is probably due to the formula that makes your hair smoother. In that area this pro-v frizzy-to-smooth solution works well.    However, while I prefer easier combing of my hair, I&#x27;d return to natureFusion series after finishing my current stock. Longevity and health of my hair is more important to me than its looks.    As a summary:  Pros: It&#x27;s a Pantene, it really smooths your hair, and the fragrance smells good.  Cons: Did not like the sticky feeling after rinse, does not clean as much as natureFusion</li>
    <li> I have three teen girls who want to maintain great hair health and two have very long hair.  This shampoo has been a favorite among all of them. They are thrilled with the smooth hair results and I can attest to seeing less of the wild frizz they sometimes would have.  They like the scent and are happy with the appearance of their hair at the ends.  The biggest point I can make is that they wanted more when the bottle ran out.  So, I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I&#x27;m always looking for shampoos that can straighten my hair so I don&#x27;t have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I&#x27;ve found is Herbal Essences \\&quot;Dangerously Straight.\\&quot; However I&#x27;m always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner, [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)]].    Unfortunately, this shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower.    With that in mind, you&#x27;re probably wondering why I didn&#x27;t give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in shampoos that are supposed to add body.    So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this shampoo, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 13 year old girl who&#x27;s been dealing with frizz for about the past year. Ive tried 5+ different kinds of brands, then saw this. I instantly told my mom I wanted to try this, since my sister has been using Pantene for years and it&#x27;s worked for her. After about 2 uses, I started to see great results, the frizz has gone down a lot! I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now, an I only have a few strays hair, barely any frizz!! I am now using the shampoo, conditioner, hair detangler(which works!!), and the spray bottle that helps straightening hair from drying out. It all works, and my hair has been a lot softer lately. I would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy, unmanageable hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story short:&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses I saw a difference! And in 2 weeks it&#x27;s barely frizzy! This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and I like Pantene products. I don&#x27;t really pay that much attention to which products I use but I thought that I would give this one a try when the opportunity presented itself. I am definitely satisfied with the results but I don&#x27;t know if I will have any strong desire to go out of my way to purchase this shampoo again.     This shampoo works fine. My hair isn&#x27;t particularly frizzy by nature though I occasionally have issues because I am a water polo player. This shampoo seems to prevent problems though I am not sure if this was even a problem to begin with at this time.     I recommend giving this shampoo a try if you have problems with frizziness. It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot and you may see some results. I think I did.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try this Pantene product because there are not many (affordable) shampoos and conditioners out there that are geared towards medium-thick hair.  I have thick hair with lots of body - not really straight and not really curly, but in between so very prone to frizziness.  I found that with regular use and when the shampoo and conditioner were used together that these worked reasonably well.  While this product did not eliminate all of the frizziness that my hair is prone to, it did significantly reduce the amount of frizziness and did remarkably better than the every-day product I was using that was not formulated for medium-thick hair.  Humidity definitely has an impact - on days with high humidity obviously my hair was frizzy no matter what, but I found this shampoo and conditioner combo to be an improvement at reducing the frizz, and even better it&#x27;s incredibly affordable.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - it makes my wavy hair really smooth; good for those times I want to wear it straight.  Lathers well &amp; smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It works well on long hair and provide a pleasant scent, while it works to repair the frizziness.  It works best if you use [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)]] after you use shampoo.  You get six os 12.6 oz bottles.  Bottle has a \\&quot;stand-up\\&quot; shape which is also convenient.</li>
    <li> This product has the same high quality of all Pantene products. It&#x27;s not too thick so should be easy to get every last drop out of the bottle. It suds up very well so doesn&#x27;t take a large quantity to get a good wash. My only complaint, and it&#x27;s very subjective, is that I was expecting a very smooth, squeaky clean type of feeling on my hair after the wash and prior to the conditioner. This formula actually makes my hair feel a little rough, as though it leaves a film on my hair after washing. This feel remains after conditioning as well. Once my hair dries it&#x27;s smooth and easy to brush and comb so the final result is as expected. Other than this one, admittedly minor, gripe it&#x27;s a good shampoo that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo with Pantene Naturals Conditioner.  It left my hair feeling dry and was only minimally helpful against frizz.  I have long thick hair and have had better luck with Biolege products.</li>
    <li> In order to truly test the usefulness of the product, I selected both the [[ASIN:B003JA3KSW Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Conditioner]]. This review assumes the use of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a one product type of girl. Right now, I&#x27;m alternating between [[ASIN:B0007CXXGO Biolage by Matrix]] &amp; [[ASIN:B00352G60I Victoria&#x27;s Secret So Sexy]], depending on my mood. Both of these brands are considerably more expensive than Pantene products, so I was not expecting much from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to fully review them, I committed myself to using only the Pantene products for two weeks. My first impression, from the scent of the product, was that it was a little too fragrant for my tastes. The strong fragrance, however, did not carry from the bottled product to my hair after washing. If anything, there wasn&#x27;t ENOUGH fragrance that remained in my hair. To my surprise, I did find that my hair seemed thicker after a couple of weeks of use. I was pleased with the product and will continue to use it, although I still enjoy variety and will continue to use other products.</li>
    <li> This tamed and smoothed my long, salt and pepper hair without making it feel flat and lifeless.  I am loving this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes conditioner can weigh my hair down, so I try not to use it that often.  I don&#x27;t have to use any conditioner when I use this shampoo.  It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine, with beautiful body.  I also like that it smells fresh and clean, not like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine.  I&#x27;m happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs!</li>
    <li> This is a rather typical shampoo using typical surfactants to cleanse the hair. It has a fragrance which I like...but is reminiscent of less expensive fragrances in cheaper shampoos. Conclusion: a typical shampoo that does the job, but leaves hair no different than others I use</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get frizzy no matter what time of year it is. In the Summer, it&#x27;s the humidity that makes my hair frizz and I have a problem in the Winter as well. But I&#x27;ve found that Patene&#x27;s Frizzy to Smooth Shampoo really does cut down the frizz that I get. It took a few shampoo&#x27;s to really notice the difference but it definitely worked. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me because I&#x27;ve found that Pantene always does make nice shampoo that does what it&#x27;s supposed to. The smell is quite nice as well. It&#x27;s a pleasant smell and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone that has frizzy hair and is tired of dealing with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter does swim team and her hair takes a beating from the sun and water during the summer.  She uses swimmer&#x27;s shampoo which works great to protect against the chlorine but her hair still felt coarse and frizzy upon drying.  I tried using better conditioners after the swimmer shampoo but nothing really seemed to help.  After about two weeks of rotating this Pantene product with the swimmer&#x27;s shampoo, my daughter&#x27;s hair was reformed. It really helped smooth her hair and add moisture to the especially dry ends.  Her hair looks substantially healthier today than it did a month ago.    I have been very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo!  It does exactly what it claims to do and smells GREAT while doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very thick, unruly hair.  This shampoo has helped make her hair less unruly and it doesn&#x27;t leave it looking, or feeling, dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick and very wavy hair.  In the humidity we&#x27;ve been experiencing, normally my hair would be a frizzy mess.  I am surprised at how much smoothing this shampoo does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a daughter with lots of tangles, be sure to check out Pantene&#x27;s line of detanglers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EGZZ1G Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series Light Conditioning Detangler, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EH1Y88 Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions Silkening Detangler, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EGYDEQ Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Anti-Breakage Detangler, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth shampoo with Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions Silkening Detangler will make your hair look like you spent the day at the salon!  It&#x27;s a wonderful, affordable solution for frizz.</li>
    <li> I think the fragrance is close to ripe cantaloupe.  When I first started using the shampoo, the smell reminded me of fruit-punch bubble-gum.  Pleasant, not overpowering.    The viscosity of the shampoo is like a stiff moisturizer.  The bottle can stand stably right-side-up or upside-down.  The shampoo rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or scalp feeling excessively conditioned.  I have short hair and shampoo every day.  I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner, and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel overly harsh.  It&#x27;s not nearly as harsh as clarifying shampoos.    After using this shampoo for about two weeks, I think my hair may be a little smoother.  But it&#x27;s hard for me to control for changes in humidity.    Reading the ingredients, the difference between this and ordinary Pantene Pro-V &lt; [...]&gt; is the addition of Cocamidopropyl Betaine (which Wikipedia says is an antistatic agent), and the substitution of sodium for ammonium as the detergent counterions.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t work for me. It makes my hair too flat and lifeless, thought it does do a good job of cleaning and smells quite nice!</li>
    <li> This shampoo also works well on thick, coarse hair that is made worse by lap swimming.  It smoothes out my hair without the need for follow-on products.  This is a plus for a guy that just wants to wash and go.  This shampoo has a mild and pleasant scent, and it does not leave any filmy residue.  It does all of this at a value price.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, which takes over an hour to blowdry completely. My entire life I&#x27;ve searched for and used products, that would take away some of the fullness of my hair, or at least calm it down. It&#x27;s not frizzy in a curly way-I just have a lot, which creates flyaways and \\&quot;flipping\\&quot;, in areas where I don&#x27;t want it:) A system of shampoo, and some styling product to take some of the fullness out of my hair has always been important to my routine. This shampoo is a great start.It&#x27;s smells amazing, is noticably creamier and smoother than other shapoos I have used, and washes out clean-very important for the thickness of my hair. I highly recommend using this-Pantene does it again!</li>
    <li> A fan of Pantene for a long time, I was used to hearing rumors of how &#x27;bad&#x27; it was for your hair, etc.  However, this never wavered my love for the Pantene.  And this product, Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick hair solutions Frizzy to smooth shampoo just seals the deal.    My hair is wavy -- often unmanageable.  I can style it and one hhour later the waves have come through and the frizz has set in.  With this shampoo, I noticed that with only two washings, the difference in the ability I had to style my hair and the style&#x27;s shape to maintain, even in heat, went up considerably.  When I flat iron my hair, that style actually stays for longer than just mere blowdrying.      The price of this shampoo is reasonable and had it been more expensive, I would pay it.  I liked it that much.      Natalie S.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the matching conditioner for the last several weeks.  My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;1) The shampoo is runnier then the normal Pantene, so when you first use it, be careful because it&#x27;s easy to run it over your hand and waste some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My hair did stay more \\&quot;calm\\&quot; although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - I&#x27;m not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with them.  I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  It&#x27;s no miracle but it can help a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene Shampoo for years, and this product proved to be&lt;br /&gt;no different in quality; however, although this shampoo mildly controlled my&lt;br /&gt;frizz, I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo to be the best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have very frizzy hair year round, and during summer, my hair is&lt;br /&gt;even frizzier; therefore, I decided to try this shampoo to note how much&lt;br /&gt;hair control I&#x27;d have after each use. To be frank, the product was quite&lt;br /&gt;good. As usual, my hair was soft, smooth, and smelled nice! However, Pantene&lt;br /&gt;has another product, Pantene Pro-V Restoratives Frizz Control Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/Pantene-Pro-V-Restoratives-Control-Shampoo/dp/B000GCX&lt;br /&gt;ROS/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top ), which works much better to control frizz. I&lt;br /&gt;have been using the latter product for several years now, but since Pantene&lt;br /&gt;came out with a new product, I wanted to compare the quality. Hands down,&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Frizzy to Smooth\\&quot; shampoo was a good product to simply clean your hair,&lt;br /&gt;leaving it smelling nice and smooth, but for its intention of controlling&lt;br /&gt;frizz, I highly recommend Pantene&#x27;s \\&quot;restoratives\\&quot; line. Perhaps \\&quot;Frizzy to&lt;br /&gt;Smooth\\&quot; shampoo did work for some, but for me, a person with extreme frizz,&lt;br /&gt;the latter product was much better (conditioner included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend someone in need of frizz control to give this product a&lt;br /&gt;shot, because not everyone&#x27;s hair is same and has the same results. The&lt;br /&gt;product itself is not a bad one, but it is also not the best for frizz&lt;br /&gt;control.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length, naturally curly hair and have used Pantene&#x27;s other shampoo and conditioning products in the past, so I was excited to try this new \\&quot;Medium-Thick Frizz-Control\\&quot; formula. My hair normally has a shine, bounce and natural highlights, so I expected this shampoo to enhance those qualities. Unfortunately, I found that the product made my hair dull and lifeless.     I tried the shampoo a number of times, alternating hairstyles just to be sure, but found that it left my hair drier than normal and more prone to tangles--and even mats!! I never use anything in my hair besides leave-in conditioner and I tried the shampoo both with and without it. It&#x27;s a shame--it seemed like it should&#x27;ve been a great product--and I really LIKE Pantene. I so wanted to like this product, but it just did not agree with my hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with few discernable talents when it comes to health and beauty supply reviews.  Although my hair can fit the description for this shampoo at times (medium thickness, a little frizzy), I can&#x27;t really say how well it actually smoothed my hair, since I use gel most of the time.  For guys with short hair I don&#x27;t know how dramatic the results can be, but for me I didn&#x27;t really notice anything different than the other basic types of shampoo that I use.    What I did notice is that the shampoo smells good and has a feel and texture to it that is more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  It goes on easily and washes out that way too... give it a try!</li>
    <li> Having used Pantene products in the past, I purchased the new Pantene ProV Frizzy to Smooth shampoo and conditioners. After one use, my scalp was itchy but after a second bout, my scalp, ears and face where the hair touched the skin was itchy and burning horribly. I contacted the company by email and phone and was blown off, told to hold onto the products and heard no more. Whatever they are putting into their products is very harsh and they don&#x27;t want to know about it. Buyer beware.</li>
