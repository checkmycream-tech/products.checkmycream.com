      <li>I like many of the Bvlgari scents for men and women.</li>
      <li>I still love it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;purchase of $59 or more.  </li>
      <li>The perfumes in the department store smell more geniune.</li>

      <li>I already had some and really love it.</li>
      <li>The men LOVE this sent.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume....</li>
      <li>to find a true rose fragrance that&#x27;s blended</li>
      <li>A very beautiful rose fragrance, very feminine and romantic.</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.  </li>
      <li>, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it.</li>
      <li>But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it.</li>
      <li>It cost much more at Disney than thru Amazon and the shipping was Very Fast!</li>
      <li>The roses were placed in an antique white vase and the whole house smelled like her perfect roses.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>parfums that I ordered were in sealed, original boxes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more affordable on Amazon than in the pricey boutique where I first found it.</li>
      <li>Very youthful too in spite of being on a more refined side.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sampled it on my wrist first and yuMM!</li>
      <li>fresh flowery rose but longer lasting.</li>
      <li>The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray.</li>
      <li>was scared to purchase it because I doubted the price reflected the originality, but I was pleasantly surprised it was an original in the original box and wrapper.</li>
      <li>I told my husband not to buy me any&lt;br /&gt;fragrance gifts until he first checks out</li>
      <li>perfume smells EXACTLY like her roses.</li>
      <li>She really loves it!</li>
      <li>with this soft, romantic rose parfum.  </li>
      <li>She really loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon..</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are not imitations or knock-offs; these are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>Also does not have much staying power on me.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more expensive but you will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Roses, are the main note, along with a hint of violets and I suspect jasmine as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The true scent of roses is the&lt;br /&gt;top note which gently blossoms into a slightly powdery floral</li>
      <li>Classy, well structured fragrance, but not very long lasting, but this is often the case with very fresh fragrances.</li>
      <li>I felt seductive, young and scrumptious.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>would also like to state that I&#x27;m an 18 year old semi-punk woman.</li>
      <li>and I could smell her old fashioned white roses in the corner of her garden.</li>
      <li>But it soon became so cloying, that I could barely stand to smell it on the bottle.</li>

    <li> the scent is good and lasts a medium length. made in Italy.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly.  Arrived in good condition.  The fragrance was as beautiful as remembered.  Good pricing.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant floral scent. I received many compliments. The item was shipped and received promptly</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume in a perfume shop earlier today; the smell instantly took me back to my grandmother&#x27;s garden and I could smell her old fashioned white roses in the corner of her garden. I can remember her cutting the prettiest of these ivory roses and bringing them to me to smell. The roses were placed in an antique white vase and the whole house smelled like her perfect roses.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells EXACTLY like her roses. Perfect without a degree of difference. It&#x27;s a lot more affordable on Amazon than in the pricey boutique where I first found it. I can&#x27;t wait to order it so I can wear it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to state that I&#x27;m an 18 year old semi-punk woman. I still love it. So, I would definitely say that anyone could get away wearing this perfect rose parfum!</li>

The scent neeeever dies, it stays with you all day, which is great if i liked it. But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it. I couldn&#x27;t remember why i ever bought it, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it. PS I agree with some other reviewers who describe this scent as chemical, bathroom air freshener, etc. The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray. :/</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this fragrance for two years but couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;justify spending $90 for it at Saks or Sephora.  Behold Amazon&lt;br /&gt;who is selling the 1.7 oz. eau de parfum for $37.50 with free&lt;br /&gt;shipping and $10 off (for Mother&#x27;s Day) with a fragrance&lt;br /&gt;purchase of $59 or more.  I bought this and another all-time&lt;br /&gt;favorite; what a great deal!  They arrived today and I&#x27;m in&lt;br /&gt;heaven with this soft, romantic rose parfum.  It&#x27;s very&lt;br /&gt;difficult to find a true rose fragrance that&#x27;s blended just&lt;br /&gt;right.  This one is perfect.  The true scent of roses is the&lt;br /&gt;top note which gently blossoms into a slightly powdery floral&lt;br /&gt;without losing the rose.  Truly feminine and romantic.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it on me and he&#x27;s hard to please when it&lt;br /&gt;comes to fragrance.  He said this is definitely a \\&quot;10\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be wary of ordering from Amazon at this low price.&lt;br /&gt;Both parfums that I ordered were in sealed, original boxes.&lt;br /&gt;These are not imitations or knock-offs; these are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;At these prices, I&#x27;ll be expanding my fragrance wardrobe while&lt;br /&gt;saving a bundle.  I told my husband not to buy me any&lt;br /&gt;fragrance gifts until he first checks out Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re happy customers!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice rose perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife a while ago. She really loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon..</li>

This is sold at Saks and Neiman for $90!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Nice scent although it is still not quite the rose scent I am looking for.  Also does not have much staying power on me.  May just be my nose or body chemistry.  I like many of the Bvlgari scents for men and women.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister last year. A few months ago I noticed her perfum end I asked what it was because she smelled so good! She said: You gave it to me. I decided it is time to get it for myself!</li>
    <li> Fragrance is wonderful; not an overpowering scent and lasts all day. Highly recommend. Shipping was fast and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, i like so much</li>
    <li> I love this perfume....this is my second bottle and I am very glad I purchased it through Amazon...excellent fragrance..</li>
    <li> I already had some and really love it. Floral smell.  The price was so good that I bought some more.  My Christmas present to myself.</li>
    <li> A very beautiful rose fragrance, very feminine and romantic. Not the flirty type but more sophisticated, Bvlgari does well producing sophisticated fragrances. Very youthful too in spite of being on a more refined side. Classy, well structured fragrance, but not very long lasting, but this is often the case with very fresh fragrances. I prefer D&amp;G Rose the One,fresh flowery rose but longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this in Italy at Disney World and feel in love with it! The men LOVE this sent. My husband says it smells so sweet and wonderful on me. It cost much more at Disney than thru Amazon and the shipping was Very Fast! Only took a few days so my hats off to the person who sold it thru Amazon. Wonderful...fragrant...rosie smell...Makes a Wonderful Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> There was a review for another size of this where the women said that this made them smell like someone&#x27;s grandmother. Well, let me tell you that my vacation romance did NOT think I reminded him of grandma. He fell for the perfume head over heels. If you have the kind of body that turns fragrances \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; like I do... this scent is spectacular. Sexy and sophisticated with a girlie twist. I felt seductive, young and scrumptious.</li>
    <li> When I received this parfum I was very disappointed. The scent is very faint and doesn&#x27;t last. I would recommend buying from a department store. The perfumes in the department store smell more geniune. They&#x27;re more expensive but you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y lleg&amp;oacute; en buenas condiciones, sin da&amp;ntilde;os ni problemas</li>
