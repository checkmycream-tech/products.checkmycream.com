<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this as a refill to a product I&#x27;ve been using for years!!  Great product and a must have!!  No oil and it does the trick!!  Was shipped timely and quickly!!  Thanks to amazon and their vendors!!</li>
    <li> Love it so soft and moisture my skin . If you have combination skin and sometimes  you feel that your face skin is dry it is the solution .</li>
    <li> This is so lovely for dry skin. It goes on smoothly and easily and my skin just soaks it up.  It makes my skin feel so soft and supple. I love it.</li>
    <li> This moisture surge product is great for aging skin. Non greasy, light but does am incredible job of moisturization for 50+ age group. Also, a good ( decent) price break.</li>
    <li> I got the 1.7 oz thing for a friend who loves this stuff.  $50.  $50 for a teeny tiny jar.  Does this stuff have a diamond buried in it?  Is it made of gold?  I know people love this moisturizer, but if you are buying this as a gift, don&#x27;t expect to make much of an impression.  It&#x27;s pitifully small for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I noticed a difference only after a short time.  I helped with wrinkles and under eye dark circles which I have. I use it every night.  I used to buy it at a dept store but bought it on Amazon for a better price.</li>
    <li> WOW, Have had this cream  for awhile, write reviews when I truly use the product as directed.  Any How after 3 days of night and day use Literally watched it suck the puffiness from my 55 yr old eyes, taking off at least a few yrs.  Great stuff,  does take a few to dry but wow, don&#x27;t even need makeup with this stuff.  Now I am using this to replace my Strivectin Eye Firming Cream that is very expensive.  I only got this for under my eyes.  If you don&#x27;t get instant change use it a couple days.  Has a nice cooling feeling to it.  I am a big fan of Clinique tinted moisturizer.  Covers well.  Amazon gives a fair price on Clinique products.  If your looking for something for your eyes I know there are tons to choose give it a try.  You can always return to Clinique counter.</li>
    <li> I love this cream goes on nice and smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Its almost like a gel aloe, your skin soakes it up really quickly and it leave it really soft. I put this on in the mornings for under my makeup and use estee lauder time zone at night for wrinkle prevention.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other high priced products which either irritated my skin or contained perfumes.  This moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated all day long and helps makeup go on easily. It does not make my skin too greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I was not sure I would like this as I don&#x27;t like to change my face products much, I have Very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have good luck with most products.  That being said I am Very happy with this moisturizer.  it takes Much less to cover my entire face and neck, iti s NOT greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out or get blotchy which it is famous for.  I have not had the slightest reaction from this product.  So will be buying again and again in the future.  Also would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product and was not that excited about what it was accomplishing. She is getting the same results with over the counter products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product .Great for dry skin. Iuse it twice daily with no break outs.would recomend to others.great price.Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My face is soo oily this helps with that and my face never dries out. I love this product</li>
    <li> The product feels very light.  Feels good under foundation.  My face feels smooth and healthy.  I love this product - definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to give you gals a heads-up on some of these products, including products on Ebay.  Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief in the 1.7OZ jar costs only $34.00 brand new at Macy&#x27;s Dept. Store.  The 2.5 OZ jar only costs $46.00 brand new at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Smooths in so nice. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now. I have to buy a new one about every 4 to 5 months (depending on the season). It keeps my skin really moist and oil free. I usually apply it after my shower at night. I use very little, as I only stick my finger in and scoop out maybe a pea size or less. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent which I love and I honestly think it makes my skin super soft. I use it with proactive cleanser because I didn&#x27;t like the one that proactive tries to sell you. I get compliments on my skin all the time. I tend to get a few pimples every now and then and this product really keeps that from happening as it does it clog my pores. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am kind of a cosmetics snob, so normally Clinique products don&#x27;t do it for me, but I have to say this is the best moisturizer out there. I have combo skin - it is either really oily or really dry to the point that it&#x27;s peeling. No matter what condition my skin is in, this moisturizer works wonders and I can immediately feel it working as I put it on. Even though my skin can get really oily, this product doesn&#x27;t cause it to shine in excess - instead it just soaks up all the dryness and hydrates my skin. THis is one of those beauty products I couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> The Moisture surge is part of my morning and before-bed routine.  It provides moisture to my otherwise dry skin and leaves my skin feeling soft.  A must for anyone who has dry patches on their face.  It also works well under makeup and foundation.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful for daily use.</li>
    <li> skin moisturizer EVER! use it every day. greatest smooth hydratation possible with just a little drop of it- love it</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this, loved it so muck, I purchased a new jar</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s lite and non greasy. The product itself lasts a long time since you use a small amount.</li>
    <li> First off, I should admit that I am skeptical of Clinique products - I have had bad experiences with many of them, from allergic reactions to sensitivity, etc (and I never have those problems with other brands!) so chose to stay away from them for a long time. I then received a gift-with-purchase size sample of Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief in a lot of items I bought on eBay, so thought, why not? I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have infuriating combination skin - oily T-zone, dry patches on chin, and prone to pimples around the nose and lower chin. It seems I can never win with face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, I can. This stuff is my wonder cream. (Okay, more of a wonder gel. Ha!) It&#x27;s interesting that they call it &amp;#34;extended thirst relief&amp;#34;, because it feels exactly like a soothing drink to the skin. It soaks in instantly, eradicating that tight and stretched feeling - but it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue in the spots prone to extra oil! I feel perfectly comfortable applying it to my entire T-zone. Better yet, it seems to have an astringent property on my pimples. I know this is overly optimistic to say, but it really feels like this product adjusts to my skin&#x27;s needs. The dry patches are gone, the oily places more balanced, and the pimples have quickly and painlessly dried out and gone away. I have gotten only a couple of small pimples since I started using this product - and it was on the days that I forgot to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product, overall, is that I can use it day or night, or even for a touch-up midday. It never feels like too little or too much; just the moisture and comfort that I need. HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> Light, non greasy, non pasty, moisturizer - no clogged pores, no residue.  Better than products that cost twice as much.  I buy in bulk, so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I think it is not real after use. I have bought it on the official site and it is much better than this.</li>
    <li> Great item for skin and protection again all kinds of wrinkles and aging parts. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to look younger.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and love everything about it.  It has a lovely but mild scent.  Most importantly, it feels very light on your face, and makes make-up glide on.  It is an indulgence, but I use it sparklingly.  A little goes a long way yet.  Am I lovely yet?  ......</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this cream for years- nothing works better on my dry face! Never break out. No scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> good value for the price</li>
    <li> This is the very best moisturizer for sensitive or oily skin.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial cream I use. I hate my face feeling caked and bogged down with substances, so I never liked facial creams as a teenager. But then I discovered this cream. Not only is it super light on the skin, but its a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t actually require more than a few drops per day. I dab a spot on my forehead, both cheeks, nose, and chin and carefully smooth in. And voila! Instant moisturizing! It is expensive, but my first tub laster a year and a half and that&#x27;s with a younger sibling stealing away globs of it. I have skin that&#x27;s oily, but also gets dry, is prone to breakouts and peeling. This cream does away with all that after regular use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it hydrates your face without feeling greasy!  A nice change from other moisturizers I have tried.</li>
    <li> I like the smooth, non-greasy consistency, and it blends in easily and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized without being sticky or shiny.</li>
    <li> I have use this product before and I like it ,one time I saw it on Amazon and I saw the price more cheaper than Macy  ,I bought it $36.50(50ml)and Macy sale the same one is like 40.50or41.50something  so I feel happy  but ! When I open the bag i saw the product I&#x27;m feel unhappy because I thought  the one should same like the picture  and I thought  suppose it comes with a &amp;#34;glass bottle &amp;#34;so that&#x27;s why I feel sad  .everything is good besides that</li>
    <li> I love Clinique. This is my favorite winter moisturizer for my face. I always have a jar on hand from November through March.</li>
    <li> It is the best moisturizer ever. It keeps my face extremely smooth. People think I am younger than my actual age.</li>
    <li> I was getting a lot of breakouts before I started using this moisturizer.  I tried everything to try and moisturize my skin but everything made me breakout.  I received this product as part of a makeup kit with Clinique.  I didn&#x27;t think I would benefit from it but used it anyways since it was in the kit and OMG this stuff changed my face.  I no longer have ANY breakouts and I didn&#x27;t even realize it was because of this product until I started using another cream and broke out again.  I have combination skin but do tend to break out a lot and this helped to moisturize and eliminate breakouts and make my skin look flawless.  I would pay even more for this product if I had to it&#x27;s 100% worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and my skin is changing again. My skin has become extremely dry and breaks out with most products. Because of the gel-base, I thought this would work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I had only planned to use it as a nighttime moisturizer. Last night was my first and last time using this product. It went on easily and I didn&#x27;t have to use much to cover my face and neck. Within 30 min, I felt my skin tightening and starting to sting. Within 2 hours, I felt like I wanted to scratch all over my face. When I washed it off this morning and put on my regular moisturizer, it was a relief. I can&#x27;t wait to return this expensive product that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;While I was burning and itching last night, I looked up the ingredients. All the main ingredients are silicone based and I read that many of these cause irritation to some people with very sensitive skin. Instead of going in the skin, the silicones sit on the skin and make it feel smooth, not really moisturizing at all.&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all better luck with this better product, but I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly into skin. Makes face smooth and feels great.</li>
    <li> I have tried all different kinds of moisturizers from store brands to very expensive ones. This one is the one I keep coming back to. I continue to try others, but when my Clinique Moisture surge bottle is getting low, I reorder it. It isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to plump up your skin like no other. I use it every morning and every evening after cleansing.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for days your skin is really dry or even flaky. Its a rescue for days you feel like you need a facial. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Always love the way my face feels so refreshed after applying Moisture Surge!  Face feels so dry and tight if I don&#x27;t use it. Nice to be able to get it so easily and quickly on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use this at night for face and neck. I also use this to seal my makeup during the day, which gives the skin that dewy look. Luscious.</li>
    <li> this cream does not seem original, has a taste different from the real clinique</li>
    <li> Works good.  Not a holy grail item though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinique Moisture Surge for years after receiving a small sample in a &amp;#34;gift with purchase&amp;#34; set. I keep a small sample jar in my purse and reapply it whenever my skin feels dry or tired, particularly on very hot days when I&#x27;ve been sweating and wiping my face frequently. I also apply it over my Clinique moisturizer when I&#x27;m travelling in locales with very low humidity to give my skin an extra burst of moisture. The gel goes on smoothly, even over makeup, has a pleasant scent and texture and feels cool and refreshing on the skin. For dry complexions, this gel is not sufficient alone and should be used in addition to a regular more heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have heard nothing but good things from real people I know about this product, and I acknowledge their opinions.  I myself, do not like the consistency of the product as it feels watery and cheap to me.  It is described as a gel, but when you scoop it up on your fingers, it almost seems to melt away as if there is not much there.  It also sits on my face like water.  I have to wait until it dries out to put my make up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any benefits from using the product over the &amp;#34;Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion&amp;#34;.  Wish I had bought a sample size first.  This one goes under the cabinet with the rest of the expensive but not wonderful ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Feels wonderful on my face.  I have a problem with my skin getting red and feeling like it&#x27;s on fire.  No such problem with this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great daytime moisturizer</li>
    <li> I use it a lot. It&#x27;s light and oil-free, best for summer.</li>
    <li> Just wanted I needed. And the price was right! I love this producted but hated paying department store prices for it. And the jar is much small in the department store. This is great for hydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> My wife lfe the product and the excellent value.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. This product dissapointed me because its not hydrating at all. Not at all a good moisturizer. Its also a gel, not a cream.  your money on something more effective if your looking for a hydrating cream.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!!  It is light and makes my skin so soft. I bought this for all my friends last year for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Excellent hydration for your face. Important in keeping a nice complection.</li>
    <li> It is good for sensitive skinn.</li>
    <li> Great, makes your skin really soft and bright!</li>
    <li> I have used it for many years and it keeps my face and neck smooth, moist, and youthful.</li>
    <li> Product came as described. Great stuff. Great for any skin. I have sensitive and it&#x27;s moisturizes just enough. Not too only. Just enough for a glow. I get compliments on my even skin texture all the time after using this stuff.</li>
