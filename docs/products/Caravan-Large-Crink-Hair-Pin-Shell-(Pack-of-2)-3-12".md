      <li>Really love these ,I will bye more for my wife they are great for her long hair</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I have these original four rounded ones, though</li>
      <li>The available quantities made the choice easy and the price for the product was certainly affordable and reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I used a file to smooth out the finish as much as I could.</li>
      <li>Four will hold an entire head of hair that is medium to course when it&#x27;s rolled into an updo of any kind.</li>

      <li>I love these hair pins, and have made multiple purchases of them.  </li>

      <li>Exactly what my wife wanted.  </li>
      <li>have ordered these before and am back for more.  </li>
      <li>but then you wouldn&#x27;t have to buy so many, so they would stop making them because they would not sell enough....</li>
      <li>Exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
      <li>They should work OK once I smooth them out , two pins do hold up my heavy hair.</li>
      <li>Mine were smooth - no rough edges.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly as advertised, a real treasure.</li>
      <li>thye are pretty and stay in very well.</li>

      <li>I love twisting my waist length hair into a bun when its wet and I am in a hurry to go out or plan on working around the house.</li>
      <li>Fast service</li>
      <li>I also love the little french ones which are smooth and stiff, and don&#x27;t warp as quickly, but they don&#x27;t stand a chance on my hair, lovely and sturdy though those pins are.  </li>
      <li>My original purchase was 20 years ago and a local store.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them to anyone interested in the old style hair pins, like our grandmothers used to use.</li>
      <li>They also break in half at the top eventually.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic that for some reason I can&#x27;t find at the drugstore any longer.</li>
      <li>Classic.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for up do&#x27;s, especially if you have long hair or thick hair.</li>
      <li>Looking at the pins under a magnifying glass revealed the ends were extremely rough, not polished and smooth as you might expect.</li>

    <li> Holds my heavy hair up very well. Keeps it tidy most of the day.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as advertised, a real treasure. I would recommend them to anyone interested in the old style hair pins, like our grandmothers used to use.</li>
    <li> these work really well for buns</li>
    <li> They are the size and type I&#x27;ve been looking for, but the finish on the set I received was really bad. Nicks/chips in the surface, jagged ends and ragged seams. These are nothing like the smooth hairpins I bought years ago. I used a file to smooth out the finish as much as I could.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast service</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.  Usually waited to get to Harrods in London.  Unable to find anywhere.  Strong enough for long heavy hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased three packs of these. The pins were pretty much exactly what I wanted, except slightly longer than I&#x27;d like. Unfortunately however, they turned out to not be very durable. Every single one snapped in half after maybe 10-15 uses. They seemed to have an internal bubble right at the curve, and so were actually defective.</li>
    <li> These pull my hair and are not as strong as others I have used.</li>
    <li> strong good for thick hair</li>
    <li> I liked these, if they are the ones from China.</li>
    <li> I love this type of hair pin, the steel hair pins hurt and just don&#x27;t work as well for me.  It&#x27;s a classic that for some reason I can&#x27;t find at the drugstore any longer. The Caravan Large Crink Hair Pins are working great, strong and do have some flexibility.[[ASIN:B003IRS70C Caravan Large Crink Hair Pin Shell (Pack of 2) 3-1/2\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> These are not the variegated browns I&#x27;d hoped for; they&#x27;re a solid, clear, medium brown.  Today, some pins claiming to be tortoise shell turn out to be an obnoxious orange; so these are quite acceptable.  Mine were smooth - no rough edges.  I have medium length, thin, baby-fine hair so occasionally one may slip out and, being plastic, eventually they break.  I wish they also came in a shorter length.  USPS safely delivered them in a padded mailer in 8 days - with tracking information which was greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over 20 years.  They are perfect for up do&#x27;s, especially if you have long hair or thick hair. When you buy get at least 2 sets. you won&#x27;t regret it.  I keep 2 in my purse for an emergency up do.  I love mine.  I am so glad I found them again online.  My original purchase was 20 years ago and a local store. They are hard to find so snatch them up!</li>
    <li> The hair pins are ideal for my wife&#x27;s hair styles.  The available quantities made the choice easy and the price for the product was certainly affordable and reasonable.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought these in black and shell and used them for the first time today. I used one to secure my up do and one in the front of my hair to make a faux bang.  I hate bobby pins -- they bend and peel and are not attractive. i will never have to use them again thanks to these pins.  One of the puns arrived broken, and it was replaced the same day...customer service was outstanding</li>
    <li> The Hair Pins from this vendor were as adverstised and reasonably priced.  What a pleasant difference from Hair Pins ordered from a vendor in the west coast.</li>
    <li> Easy to put my hair up with just one pin!</li>
    <li> This type of hairpin is hard to find anywhere and I was so glad to go to the all knowing &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; and find, to my surprise, a vender!  I have very long hair and frequently wear my hair &amp;#34;up&amp;#34;.  At the end of the day when its time to let it down I find that with this kind of hairpin my hair doesn&#x27;t get weird kinks in it.  Caravan offers a wide variety of colors and sizes and i plan on ordering from them again soon! Quick delivery for a hard to find well made product!</li>
    <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;I love them for my natural hair, they keep it all under- control.&lt;br /&gt;They arrive in a very timely matter.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again if needed!</li>
    <li> so glad to find these</li>
    <li> They are not very smooth, and break my hair. I think for the product quality they could have been a lot less expensive.  I am going to have to smooth out the inside of them with some fine sandpaper. I love twisting my waist length hair into a bun when its wet and I am in a hurry to go out or plan on working around the house. They should work OK once I smooth them out , two pins do hold up my heavy hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these Caravan Large Crink Hair Pins for my wife where the price seemed very good.  The ones I received seemed fine to me, but when she used them, they hurt her head and caused a few welts.  Looking at the pins under a magnifying glass revealed the ends were extremely rough, not polished and smooth as you might expect. Filing them down with an emery board seemed to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> I love them - they are hold my thick long hair perfectly in a twisted up do and they&#x27;re super classy.</li>
    <li> These are great! Holds up a lot of hair. Great for beach days just a couple of these holds all my hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this type of pin for years but getting harder to find. Classic.</li>
    <li> I use them almost every day to pin up my long hair and was very happy to find them on line.</li>
    <li> They are a bit too long but they work for me. My hair is long and straight and these pins can be used in a hurry to pin it up.</li>
    <li> I loved the hairpins.  I still have a pair that is left over from some that were purchased over two decades ago. I was thrilled to find them again. I have long hair and like to pin it up quickly. One pin holds it in place until it is pulled out releasing my hair to flow down my back.</li>
    <li> I have thick, very long, heavy hair to put up, and these four pins I bought (two packs of two each) worked in the beginning when I got them, but then one broke (and they were about five bucks for each two-pack), and after a few months, the remaining three got bent out of shape. It&#x27;s a lot of hair for them to hold, and I thought of getting more, but I wasn&#x27;t happy that the plastic did that. They&#x27;re also completely cylindrical, and are a little too \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; because of that. The flat plastic hair pins I bought after these are a little shorter, but they remain in place, and anchor my hair well. I just have to use more of them. I&#x27;m not sorry I have these original four rounded ones, though (well, three out of four). They would be perfect for more reasonable hair (mine is not a reasonable length, and over-permed to be thick). Four will hold an entire head of hair that is medium to course when it&#x27;s rolled into an updo of any kind. These would probably hold fine hair, too, but might slip out.</li>
    <li> Perfect for long hair up do-only takes 3 to hold really long hair!</li>
    <li> great product. Really holds my hair and my hair is very fine and soft.</li>
    <li> Precisely what I had imagined and ordered</li>
    <li> I prefer to use plastic hair pins because they don&#x27;t scratch my scalp, pull my hair, or become uncomfortable during their use. I was unable to find these pins in the regular stores.</li>
    <li> These were as described, arrived quickly, well packed - if anything overpacked in a box and lots of stuffing - and just what I ordered, and the vendor deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing guys: I think there is a much smaller priority box that would work as well and be cheaper for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered these before and am back for more.  The pins seem to lose their shape over time (much quicker than older pins I inherited from my aunt), and using them on wet hair seems to accelerate the process - does anyone know why?  They also break in half at the top eventually.  And as mentioned the seams from the mold are not completely smoothed.  You can, however, order more without days of searching through stores and get them easily and painlessly - a HUGE plus.  All the stores near me have stopped carrying pins like these.  I also love the little french ones which are smooth and stiff, and don&#x27;t warp as quickly, but they don&#x27;t stand a chance on my hair, lovely and sturdy though those pins are.  These hold a lot of hair, but it still takes 3 or 4 to hold my hair in a bun or twist all day, which is my standard \\&quot;work do\\&quot;.  I will order more later, they are a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would make nice smooth heavier pins that don&#x27;t warp - but then you wouldn&#x27;t have to buy so many, so they would stop making them because they would not sell enough.... Built in Obsolescence, I&#x27;m beginning to understand......</li>
    <li> I ordered the same hair pins in black.  The brown and black pins arrived in two separate packages from seemingly different places. The brown pins are nice, but less sturdy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
    <li> This is an edit of last review..&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve worn these a few times, I have to say I really do like them.  Does not rip my hair out and they do stay in place though I usually have problems with combs and pins.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pins for about 20 years and they hold buns very well. My hair is mid-lenght, thin and wavy. It is not hard to use them and the pins dont show in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of clip all my life.  These were of inferior quality.  The clips bend open creating a gap that remains in a V-shape.</li>
    <li> I love these hair pins, and have made multiple purchases of them.  Not sure what people are talking about when they complain of rough edges or poor finish-- they haven&#x27;t bothered me.  I have somewhat fine, wavy, mid-back hair, and just one will do the trick of holding it up in a bun.  The reason these have received 4 and not 5 stars from me is that over time and with frequent use, the prongs become wide or malformed, and one hairpin has snapped on me.  If they could use a sturdier plastic like France Luxe pins, they would be absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> GREAT for those with the volume of longer hair.</li>
    <li> Really love these ,I will bye more for my wife they are great for her long hair she is very pleased !,,,</li>
    <li> Had 4 tortoise shell hair pins and 2 broke.  These are a great replacement.  Same length as previous but darker.  I like the lighter shade where you can see the color distinctions.  That does not disqualify these as a worthy replacement.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find these for years and so happy I found them again!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for longer, thicker hair and really holds a bun or twist!!&lt;br /&gt;5 Star Fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Excellent; as advertised!</li>
    <li> Living in the Caribbean it is very difficult to find products to pin my heavy straight hair back ( and necessary given the constant heat), these pins do the job, are comfortable and strong. Very happy with the purchase.e</li>
    <li> Hairpins are poorly finished &amp; snag the hair when being inserted. (Apparently hand-finishing is a thing of the past!) I bought four &amp; every one of them had burrs which made them impossible to use comfortably. Seller refused return of faulty product.</li>
    <li> I have always use these clips to hold my hair throughout my life.  They work well.  I am glad I can get these so easily on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very heavy, very thick, waist length hair and these are the only pins that will not only hold my hair up in a bun , but will actually stay in!!!  I have bought 4 packs of these hair pins, just because they are so hard to find!!  I only need to use 3 to put my hair up in a bun.  You wont be disappointed with them!  I just wish I could get some of the clear ones, but they are always sold out :(</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these off and on for some time. These are not just like what I have but the closest I have been able to find.</li>
    <li> AT LAST!! Found the hair pins for long hair that really work and stay put.  I use to have several of these - until my daughter borrowed some - and have not found them anywhere until NOW!  My hair is long and straight and soft, but these hair pins hold, hold, hold all day long!  YAY!</li>
    <li> Seems I&#x27;ll need more practice on how to use this &amp; where &amp; when but I got time &amp; that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll need!! You tube has some helpful tips to show how to use this &amp; I&#x27;ll be watching!!!</li>
    <li> I have long &amp; heavy hair, and these pins work great! I can hold all of my hair up with just 3 pins. The pins are virtually invisible in my hair, so creates a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I received these pins quickly,  and with a wonderful personalized note from the sellers. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So annoyed because I really wanted these to work.  They are firm &amp; hold my long hair up well. BUT they developed tiny chips &amp; pull on my hair when removed. Ouch! Maybe I&#x27;ll try sanding them or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s worth a shot. I still where them but am looking for better ones too.</li>
    <li> thye are pretty and stay in very well. they are hard to find in the store and the vendor was great.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as described and was a very difficult item to locate in a store.  This company came through without any problems.  I would recommend their service and product line.</li>
    <li> I love the size of these pins but I break one (in the same place every time) every time I put my hair up.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am.  They are just not up to the task!</li>
    <li> I t quickly and intacthought I was ordering tortoise-shell pins as the picture implied.  They are black, but that&#x27;s O.K.  I&#x27;m blonde, so we&#x27;ll see what they look like! Do they come in tortoise shell?  Thank you!  They were delivered quickly and intact.</li>
    <li> I had a set of these ages ago, and finally found these to replace them. Much to my disappointment, these are fairly flimsy plastic and don&#x27;t work nearly as well. They do the job for a bit, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
    <li> The hairpins are workable, but are a bit on the thick side and tend to stick in my hair.</li>
    <li> The hair pins are impossible to find. These are beautiful, high quality, durable. And stylish. Price was excellent.  Shipping was prompt and well protected my items in transit. Communication was great! I would definitely shop here again. For anyone who likes to wear their hair up these are the only way to go!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these pins for a long time. No stores carry them. I had several that belonged to my mother and as some of them broke after years of use, I was desperately looking for them. These are strong and even hold chignon like mine, long and coarse hair,&lt;br /&gt;very well. I am so glad to find them!</li>
