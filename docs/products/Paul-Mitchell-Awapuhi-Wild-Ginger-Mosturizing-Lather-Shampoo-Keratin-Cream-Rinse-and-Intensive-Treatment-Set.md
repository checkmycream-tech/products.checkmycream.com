      <li>Worth every dollar!</li>
      <li>I have never been as happy with the results of any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way it smells my hair feels so smooth and soft</li>

      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t enjoy the cream rinse.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend the shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
      <li>so glad I kept on looking until I found something that actually WORKS.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to finally have healthy pretty hair</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to work out.</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt healthier or grown as fast</li>
      <li>I also HIGHLY suggest the intensive treatment!</li>
      <li>I was very discouraged and had tried a number of products.  </li>
      <li>, I HOPE IS THE REAL PRODUCT</li>
      <li>There are other products that moisturize and strengthen my hair better.</li>
      <li>and I had tried so many other shampoo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Just make sure your hair is very wet</li>
      <li>I color my hair a lot and this shampoo gave my hair new life!</li>

      <li>This shampoo has made my hair soft shinny and almost no frizzies.</li>

      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t notice any less breakage or fallout - BUT possibly haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a change.</li>
      <li>I was surprised with the performance and the smell is different from anything else</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thin, you need a lot of it (much more than the shampoo meaning that you&#x27;ll run out of conditioner far sooner than the shampoo), and it leaves your hair feeling dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These products of Paul Mitchell are wonderful. I wish they were easier to find and locate and that stores would carry these products locally. I have been using the shampoo, conditioner, Hydrocream Whip, Sea Salt Spray, Ginger Hydromist Blowout Spray and Oil treatment for 6 months. I have never been as happy with the results of any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend others to try these products.</li>
    <li> Excellent for making your hair silky.  It arrived right on time....</li>
    <li> This Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner and the Treatment are great products! You need so little of the products. Just make sure your hair is very wet and you use so little. It keeps my hair very soft. It does not strip my hair of color either!</li>
    <li> I have colored and permed hair.  Even though I condition it, I still had lots of frizzies, dry ends, and my hair had lost its shine.  I was very discouraged and had tried a number of products.  I just could not get the results I needed until I used the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing shampoo, cream rinse and intensive treatment.  It has TRULY saved my hair.  I am very pleased and so glad I kept on looking until I found something that actually WORKS.</li>
    <li> Love this product line and the smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! the keratin made a difference in my hair, I could see it immediately and I will purchase this always.</li>
    <li> This pack is great for thin/fine hair. Gives it the moisture it needs without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I already use this and have for 2 months. My hair is softer and shinier than it ever has been.. most amazing duo I have ever used and so much more healthier than shampoo w sulfates and conditioner w oils...</li>
    <li> For dry hair and scalp, these items can&#x27;t be beat.  They moisturize so well making your hair feel luxurious.</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the performance and the smell is different from anything else I have.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good line.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price. Made my hair less frizzy and very soft and manageable. Great price value for money. Next time I would buy the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> The best Hair products on the Market! My Hair feels like the hair of a small Child, soft  to look at and touch!</li>
    <li> Envelopes you in its intoxicating scent as you lather and rinse your hair to a beautiful luster. Worth every dollar!</li>

    <li> Great produce and price from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Order came fairly quickly and was packaged well.  These products are amazing and I always seem to get more compliments on my hair after I use these products.</li>
    <li> Great products--shampoo and intensive repair especially.  The cream rinse leaves a little bit to be desired.</li>
    <li> The intensive conditioner is the only product that worked for me. I ended up throwing out the shampoo and the cream rinse. The shampoo made my hair feel dry, crunchy and brittle. I even experimented with using the shampoo with a different conditioner and still had the same results. My hair severely lacked moisture. The cream rinse had absolutely no effect at all, positive or negative. The intensive treatment tends to work well as a weekly conditioner but I also mix it with redken all soft conditioner. I really wanted this product to work out. It smells amazing! Overall it wasn&#x27;t worth the price. There are other products that moisturize and strengthen my hair better.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. The keratin makes my hair so soft and gorgeous! Best products for your hair, by far.</li>
    <li> Love Paul Mitchells  Awapuhi Wild Ginger Line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a good deal for all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love how it makes your hair feel and look can&#x27;t wait to finally have healthy pretty hair again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need to get the Oil Treatment… can&#x27;t wait &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST BUY IT!</li>
