      <li>and they liked it</li>
      <li>Nice feeling lotion, and</li>

      <li>Absorbs fast and smells amazing!!</li>
      <li>Works the best so far.</li>
      <li>Love love love this lotion!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for  cucumber scent, parabin free and provides excellent moisture replenishment.</li>
      <li>Puts more moisturizer in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, my father uses it the most.</li>
      <li>But on a regular day, this lotion is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
      <li>But it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>Not overall the best product for dry skin, but very pleasant.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and feels nice.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and has a nice, light fragrance.</li>
      <li>This scent is by far my favorite but all of the scents that EOS creates are spectacular!</li>
      <li>nice fresh sent like cucumber-melon &amp; I care about putting stuff on my skin that as all kinds of chemicals in it, this does not.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Not only this product but all of the EOS products are amazing!</li>
      <li>so I went back to buy more, my sister tried it &amp; liked it too</li>
      <li>This Lotion is by far my favorite lotion that I have ever purchased!</li>
      <li>This lotion is non-greasy, light, and fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order again good product</li>
      <li>It not only smells amazing but also makes your hand and body feel very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>most all natural lotions stink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Giovanni Cucumber Song lotion, which smells AMAZING and really does contain cucumber extract.</li>
      <li>I would most definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>Affordable, and I first found this lotion in Wal-mart.</li>
      <li>so I ordered it online &amp; will order a couple more bottles when I start running low.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this body lotion when I run out.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very soft, not overpowering, and the lotion itself is very silky, absorbs quickly, and does not leave that tacky feeling that you don&#x27;t want to leave all over your keyboard at work!</li>
      <li>Overall great products, as to be expected from this company.</li>
      <li>Love this product....very dry here in Az.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>so much themselves</li>
      <li>It is a fairly light lotion, so if you are having issues with advanced dryness and cracking, this probably isn&#x27;t going to be heavy duty enough to help.  </li>
      <li>Previously I had the hand cream in the same scent but ran out and decided that this would be a better option.</li>
      <li>I discovered this lotion in the small, flat travel size and loved it, so I had to get the larger sizes for home</li>
      <li>My hands and face stay soft 12 hours after use.</li>
      <li>Not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>brand is 97% natural, and paraben-free.</li>
      <li>I might also mention that I have very (annoyingly so) sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This product works really well and smells terrific.  </li>
      <li>I mean, it smells lovely, but not at all like cucumber -</li>

<li> so hands dry from the all the paper and my second job bartending so constantly washing my hands.</li>
<li> Her hands frequently dry out and crack because she&#x27;s in the medical field and constantly washes her hands.  </li>

<li> They also sell a couple other lotion types, along with lip balm, and shaving cream.</li>
<li> Not sure if I will purchase in the future.  </li>
<li> I like that it&#x27;s paraben-free and made with glycerin, shea butter, and other quality ingredients, but where&#x27;s the cucumber scent?  </li>
<li> but they were out of stock, I searched some other stored to no avail</li>
<li> they wrote the name down.</li>
<li> Very heavy floral scent, nothing close to cucumber.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I could not get the pump to operate.</li>
<li> /&gt;She isn&#x27;t crazy about the scent</li>
<li> I was just disappointed because is does not smell like cucumber at all, as described in the description.</li>

    <li> This lotion is great! It absorbs quickly and feels nice. I was just disappointed because is does not smell like cucumber at all, as described in the description.</li>
    <li> This Lotion is by far my favorite lotion that I have ever purchased! It not only smells amazing but also makes your hand and body feel very smooth and soft. Previously I had the hand cream in the same scent but ran out and decided that this would be a better option. Not only this product but all of the EOS products are amazing! This scent is by far my favorite but all of the scents that EOS creates are spectacular! I will definitely be purchasing more of this body lotion when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my skin.  Not heavy or greasy.  Light fragrance.  I will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> Lotion does not moisturizer. I like the EOS brand so wanted to try the lotion. Was not a fan.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried! Absorbs fast and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love this product....very dry here in Az.  Puts more moisturizer in my skin.  I will definitely order again good product</li>
    <li> The description of this lotion, cucumber, is incredibly inaccurate.  Very heavy floral scent, nothing close to cucumber. However,  the lotion is nice, if you can stand the smell...</li>
    <li> This product works really well and smells terrific.  I bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it.  Great product...</li>
    <li> Works the best so far.</li>
    <li> As always, a great scent and performance. Overall great products, as to be expected from this company. I ordered several mini bottles as stocking stuffers as well.</li>
    <li> I use the EOS lip balm so decided to give this a try. Goes on smoothly and has a nice, light fragrance. Not overall the best product for dry skin, but very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Nice feeling lotion, and I like that it&#x27;s paraben-free and made with glycerin, shea butter, and other quality ingredients, but where&#x27;s the cucumber scent?  I mean, it smells lovely, but not at all like cucumber - which is why I bought it to begin with.  Cucumber (cucumis sativus) extract isn&#x27;t even listed as an ingredient - or mentioned on the front of the bottle.  What&#x27;s up with that?  I&#x27;m going back to Giovanni Cucumber Song lotion, which smells AMAZING and really does contain cucumber extract.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Not sure if I will purchase in the future.  It&#x27;s fair at best.  Time will tell it seems.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my father uses it the most. He was burned a few months back and uses it over the Doctor&#x27;s other suggestions. Took it in to get approval on it and they liked it so much themselves they wrote the name down. When it dries it&#x27;s not sticky and it leave the skin smoother then the Doctor&#x27;s brands.</li>
    <li> This lotion is non-greasy, light, and fresh feeling. Great for after a shower, or when you don&#x27;t want to put on something with an overpowering scent. The scent is Cucumber Melon.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is 97% natural, and paraben-free. It contains Oat extract, antioxidants, and vitamins C and E to instantly enrich and hydrate the skin. Affordable, and I first found this lotion in Wal-mart. They also sell a couple other lotion types, along with lip balm, and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> product was different than described</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Target &amp; loved it so I went back to buy more, my sister tried it &amp; liked it too but they were out of stock, I searched some other stored to no avail so I ordered it online &amp; will order a couple more bottles when I start running low. nice fresh sent like cucumber-melon &amp; I care about putting stuff on my skin that as all kinds of chemicals in it, this does not. most all natural lotions stink. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great lotion! I highly recommend for  cucumber scent, parabin free and provides excellent moisture replenishment. My hands and face stay soft 12 hours after use. This lotion absorbs well. I recommend for dry hands. Unfortunately, I could not get the pump to operate. The pump is so convenient to use. I would most definitely purchase again. Lol, I carry the mini bottle as a back-up in my purse. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  Her hands frequently dry out and crack because she&#x27;s in the medical field and constantly washes her hands.  She likes this lotion.  It works and smells nice.  She also enjoys Nourish, though she does prefer this cucumber scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn&#x27;t crazy about the scent and it doesn&#x27;t provide real long lasting relief for extremely dry hands (which is probably because this lotion isn&#x27;t super thick), which is why I did not give the rating 5 stars.  However, for someone like me with semi-dry hands I believe this would be a great lotion.  It&#x27;s just not quite manly enough for me...</li>
    <li> The lotion was not in a package so I feared another brand lotion was put in the eos bottle. But it smells pretty good</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion in the small, flat travel size and loved it, so I had to get the larger sizes for home and after shower use..  The fragrance is very soft, not overpowering, and the lotion itself is very silky, absorbs quickly, and does not leave that tacky feeling that you don&#x27;t want to leave all over your keyboard at work! It is a fairly light lotion, so if you are having issues with advanced dryness and cracking, this probably isn&#x27;t going to be heavy duty enough to help.  But on a regular day, this lotion is perfect.  I might also mention that I have very (annoyingly so) sensitive skin and I have had ZERO issues with this product.</li>
    <li> gave it 3 stars because when i opened the package the lotion bottle was open and there was lotion everywhere! on the plus side, the lotion does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion! My hands are so dry from my jobs. I deliver mail so hands dry from the all the paper and my second job bartending so constantly washing my hands. One of the best lotions I have ever used!! Highly recommend!</li>
