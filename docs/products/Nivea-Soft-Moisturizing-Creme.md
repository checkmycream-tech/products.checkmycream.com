      <li>This product is good its good for dry skin and my skin is very smooth now but only problem is it changed my skin color</li>
      <li>i like the product because it is absorbed quickly into the skin and effective for the whole day.</li>

      <li>so far i am loving it</li>
      <li>I recommend this creme to anyone who&#x27;s just looking for a good moisturizer and especially for those who suffer from acne.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the service is really really great.</li>
      <li>We love it and your skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>it is worth the money</li>
      <li>I use this right after my shower, and my skin has never been softer.</li>
      <li>I love it on the face where it is absorbed fast and has the right amount of hydration for mixed skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this creme about a week ago and the first day I used it</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been getting a lot better ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my acne scars have definitely reduced.</li>
      <li>It feels light enough to use even in very hot temperatures.</li>
      <li>It really absorbs into your skin and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have the most dry flaky skin on my legs.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m changing my whole skin care</li>
      <li>This morning I had to get ready for a family member&#x27;s graduation, and after putting it on, I had an almost dewy complexion.</li>
      <li>My skin also feels a lot softer than ever and looks much healthier.</li>
      <li>I have KP on my upper arms and this product actually makes my arms smooth!</li>
      <li>my wife wanted this product and I did a little research and found it most affordable on amazon.</li>
      <li>It is a bit greasy, but if you skin is as dry as mine, that is not a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>My goodness, I was quite surprised to see that there was cream packed to the brim under that foil!</li>
      <li>really like the big tub (sealed), the scent and the way my face absorbs it - making it very soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I like this Nivea better than the hard Nivea as well.</li>
      <li>So far, no breakouts.  </li>
      <li>This is like the old fashioned cream in a jar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally gonna keep using this stuff, so I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Had to throw this brand new jar away, the smell was so strong and irritating.  </li>
      <li>Even on the first use it made my skin soft, I use it everyday twice a day!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I received a different kind of nivea.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had oily skin up until this year (thanks to menopause coming on) - now it&#x27;s what they call &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; but my cheeks are pink and on the verge of turning dry.  </li>

<li> A little goes a long way and this jar will last me probably a year.</li>

<li> With winter coming, it&#x27;s one less thing to worry about.  </li>
<li> And I have very dry skin, or should I say use to have very dry skin!!!!!</li>
<li> it isn&#x27;t heavy or oily and goes well under makeup.</li>
<li> The cream is a little thick</li>
<li> i am not sure</li>
<li> I have used very expensive creams in the past, and I happen to have forgotten my moisturizer on a recent trip.</li>
<li> I was preparing to be disappointed in the amount of product because usually when I see items like that, they&#x27;re vacuumed sealed and pulling on the tin results in a \\&quot;puff\\&quot; noise and the reveal of less product than expected.</li>
<li> I bought this cream about a month ago to use on my face and it has worked so well without causing breakouts or irritating my skin.</li>
<li> Opening it, there&#x27;s this thin barrier of tin foil that you just peel up.</li>
<li> There is something wrong with the order.</li>

    <li> It is a bit greasy, but if you skin is as dry as mine, that is not a bad thing.  It absorbs quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to help to firm skin, but an excellent overnight or under makeup moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nivea Soft is the best lotion/creme that I&#x27;ve ever used! Even on the first use it made my skin soft, I use it everyday twice a day! And I have very dry skin, or should I say use to have very dry skin!!!!! This creme is truely amazing! I love it and would not go without it!</li>
    <li> I have tons of lotions and mosterizers, but this is my favorite. I got this one from my mom for Easter and can&#x27;t stop using it! It really absorbs into your skin and feels so soft and smooth. I like this Nivea better than the hard Nivea as well. I need to get a smaller one for my purse because I tote the big one around everywhere. It&#x27;s better than any Burts Bee&#x27;s, Victoria Secret Body Butters, Vaseline Intensive Care as well as other supposedly \\&quot;HYDRATING\\&quot; formulas.</li>
    <li> Last week I noticed this in my local drugstore and bought it.  I&#x27;m so far very impressed and recommended my husband to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had oily skin up until this year (thanks to menopause coming on) - now it&#x27;s what they call &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; but my cheeks are pink and on the verge of turning dry.  So, up until now, I&#x27;ve stayed away from moisturizers because of my oily skin and breaking out but now I&#x27;m changing my whole skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the big tub (sealed), the scent and the way my face absorbs it - making it very soft to the touch.  So far, no breakouts.  I also put it on my eye lids and under eyes as well. With winter coming, it&#x27;s one less thing to worry about.  With the added Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E, I think this will be a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good value for the money.  A little goes a long way and this jar will last me probably a year.</li>
    <li> This product is good its good for dry skin and my skin is very smooth now but only problem is it changed my skin color i am not sure but i am looking a bit dark may be this is the reason.</li>
    <li> My family has used Nivea cream for three generations, and we have always been satisfied with it&#x27;s quality.  I use this cream twice daily for my face and neck (except under eyes), and it always leaves such a smooth pleasant feel!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have used - ever. My skin is very dry, even in the summertime. I use this right after my shower, and my skin has never been softer. The cream is a little thick and I have to use two hands to spread it evenly, but once it soaks in, it feels really light. It feels light enough to use even in very hot temperatures. I will definitely continue to buy this product, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy this on Amazon, when I had a sudden urge to see if my nearby Walgreens carried it, and it did so I snatched up a tub of it and eagerly tried it after my shower. Opening it, there&#x27;s this thin barrier of tin foil that you just peel up. I was preparing to be disappointed in the amount of product because usually when I see items like that, they&#x27;re vacuumed sealed and pulling on the tin results in a \\&quot;puff\\&quot; noise and the reveal of less product than expected. My goodness, I was quite surprised to see that there was cream packed to the brim under that foil! I only needed a small amount for my face and neck so this stuff will last FOREVER. Hahaa! Almost instantly, my face felt supple and smooth, and just when I thought I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed, it lasted through the night. This morning I had to get ready for a family member&#x27;s graduation, and after putting it on, I had an almost dewy complexion. I&#x27;m totally gonna keep using this stuff, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it smells nice and feels good when i put it on. so far i am loving it</li>
    <li> This is like the old fashioned cream in a jar. Now, if I could just get Maybelline to bring back the cake mascara in the little red flat slide!!</li>
    <li> I bought this creme about a week ago and the first day I used it I was extremely impressed. I have acne and it&#x27;s been getting a lot better ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my acne scars have definitely reduced. My skin also feels a lot softer than ever and looks much healthier. I put some on in the morning, after getting out of the shower, and before going to bed. I recommend this creme to anyone who&#x27;s just looking for a good moisturizer and especially for those who suffer from acne.</li>
    <li> i like the product because it is absorbed quickly into the skin and effective for the whole day. more importantly is the fact that it is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream....I have used very expensive creams in the past, and I happen to have forgotten my moisturizer on a recent trip. I picked some of this up and I cannot tell you how impressed I was with this. &lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find it in my home town, so turned to Amazon and found it. I am thrilled with it and recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> my wife wanted this product and I did a little research and found it most affordable on amazon. That is why I bought it there</li>
    <li> Had to throw this brand new jar away, the smell was so strong and irritating.  I guess I should have tried to return it, but didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this cream out after using another Nivea cream. It&#x27;s a very nice and soft, non -greasy cream, perfect for my hands which dry out often. What more can I say? It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but can&#x27;t put it too close to the under eye which is where I need it also. Would recommend it anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream about a month ago to use on my face and it has worked so well without causing breakouts or irritating my skin. it isn&#x27;t heavy or oily and goes well under makeup. My skin is now softer, no dryness and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
    <li> this must be the best cream for the face and body in the world!  I&#x27;m 41 and have I tried so many face creams and body creams in my life..nothing compares to this. I have the most dry flaky skin on my legs. Nothing quite does it other than this,without the grease! My face too,has never felt so hydrated since I was a child. If Nivea could add in some DMAE,HA, and Ester C.. I will jump for joy.that way I don&#x27;t have to use seperate serums! Thank you Nivea!</li>
    <li> Neutral smell and easy to spread. I love it on the face where it is absorbed fast and has the right amount of hydration for mixed skin. Works under make-up.</li>
    <li> i love this face cream. i used to use it back home in north Africa. it has vitamin E. it s  very good for oily mixed skin.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing creme feels nice and smooth on my face will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> great product.  Ordered for mother in law.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> We love it and your skin feels so soft and smooth.The only concern is the packing of this product, it might came in squeezed. Maybe seller should improving its mail packaging. Other than that, the service is really really great. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have using this product for years and everyone says how great my skin looks all the time without makeup.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I received a different kind of nivea. It&#x27;s not the same one appeared above! There is something wrong with the order.</li>
    <li> I have KP on my upper arms and this product actually makes my arms smooth! Its a great price and actually smells good too. I love that my arms are smooth now and that I dont have to spend a fortune to achieve that. I love that its not greesy too. Great lotion for ruff skin!</li>
