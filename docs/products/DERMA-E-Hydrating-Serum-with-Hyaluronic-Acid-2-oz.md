      <li>All you need is one or two pumps in your hand, then smooth on to your face.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Good reaction from my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>feel good applying all natural product onto my face.</li>
      <li>I have worked with many products, and while there are many out there that are equal to, and/or better; for your money, this cannot be beat.  </li>
      <li>If the packaging was better, I probably would have scored higher.  </li>
      <li>I like the sweet smell, smooth texture and l</li>

      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves no film on my skin.</li>
      <li>Serum feels silky and weightless going on and is absorbed quickly into skin.  </li>

      <li>I was so excited to try this because I have read such great reviews and was referred to it by a friend who has AMAZING skin and claims derma e products are her secret.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy or greasy, and makeup applies easily over it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cream for a while now.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product. Value compared to other products claiming to work at 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cream for a while now.  I&#x27;m trying to avoid a pricey trip to a dermatologist or aesthetician&#x27;s office, so I&#x27;m pretty much open to anything.  My main concerns are fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, and some patchy dry skin over the rest of my face and my neck. I tried several OTC products,  the best of which seemed to be the Oil of Olay hydrating night cream. It worked well for me for a while, but I developed an allergy to it.  I searched around Amazon last year and I came across this and thought I&#x27;d try it, based on the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;OK, enough of the back story.  The product arrived on time in a cardboard package, undamaged.  The cream has a pleasant, light fragrance and a nice texture.  After you apply it to your face and neck, fine lines and dry skin literally are smoothed away within a few minutes.  It makes your skin feel and look smooth and soft, and there&#x27;s no greasiness to it at all.  You can then apply your makeup on top of it and go - I put it on in the morning and also use it as a night cream.  One of the great things about this is - because it&#x27;s not heavy - it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break-out, like a lot of other creams do.  It even makes your hands feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is - after about 3-4 hrs, the benefits are gone, and the fine lines start to show again.  If you have the luxury to re-apply this midday, I would highly recommend it.  In other words, every day you will wake-up to your same fine lines and dry skin, and you&#x27;re starting from scratch again.  If only the effects of this were cumulative and permanent, it would be a miracle in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Final word on this - it&#x27;s just a lotion.  It works great for what it is able to deliver...it will make your skin feel and look soft and smooth for a short period of time.  I hate to be harsh but I&#x27;m being honest here...you have to be realistic - it&#x27;s a face cream, not Botox, so keep your expectations realistic and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.sappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought the product because of the advertised ingredient, hyaluronic acid. I used it only three times, two days in a row in the morning and the third one was at night.  I did not get the adverse reaction until the third application.  The next morning, I woke up feeling so terrible on the face, especially the middle portion - on the forehead, along both sides of the nose, top of mouth and the chin area. Some skin broke out with small pimples.  The whole area, including my nose, looks swollen, harden and hurt to touch. I never experience this with any other face serums or creams before. I am not sure which of the ingredients that cause(s) the problem, but I definitely am not going to try this product again.</li>
    <li> Nice. Smooth. Not sticky. Good alone under bb cream. Or also use moisturizer if need to. But it feels gentle. Good reaction from my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion out there.  It doesn&#x27;t make your face oily like every other face lotion I have tried.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is they recently changed the pump outlet to a smaller opening.  You have to be careful or you will shoot lotion across the room!  If anyone from the company is reading this, change back to the older outlet please.</li>
    <li> I prefer the \\&quot;foreveryoung\\&quot; hyaluronic acid  - it shows 100@ pure and just seems to work better although it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been going to a dermatologist for quite some time (over 20 years) and they highly recomend this product.  You can actually see it work.  It rehydrates your skin immediately!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have the kind of skin that has wrinkles and pimples at the same time -- it&#x27;s so hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Yet if I don&#x27;t moisturize my face it actually gets scaly and cracks!  Derma e is perfect -- non oily, no breakouts, smells great and above all just feels normal -- like there&#x27;s nothing on my face in a good way.  Love it and have been using it for about 4 years now. I hope they never take this off the market, I&#x27;ll be in big trouble!</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  I will only buy Derma E because I know it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive skin that is also prone to acne!  Absorbs very quickly and lasts all day with no shine.  Lasts for months!</li>
    <li> So happy to find Derma e! I have very sensitive skin, and often breakout from lotions. This product has been great for me--after using for about a week, the texture of my skin has become smoother, pores smaller, and wrinkles less noticeable. Very happy so far!    I agree with other reviewers--has a nice smell, and also the pump does tend to squirt all over which is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fabulous.  Hyalaronic Acid holds 1000 times the moisture and you can certainly tell when using this serum..  In harsh Minnesota weather this is a must have!</li>
    <li> Pump delivers exact amount needed so it lasts a long time.  Serum feels silky and weightless going on and is absorbed quickly into skin.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. It works even better than heavier creams for dry papery skin and lasts a long time with daily use. Please try it. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum was well-reviewed on another site and I was pleased to find it on Amazon for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin isn&#x27;t used to Vit C you may want to ease into using this (or any vitamin C serum) by using it every other day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum in the last month and am quite pleased with it.  I have been using Derma e&#x27;s Very Clear problem skin moisturizer and the Tropical solutions serum for about a year now and love them but wanted to add a different serum for the variety. I have used this serum at night.  It is fairly fluid &amp; thin, but my skin feels moisturized when I wake up.  It is not as thick as some of their other serums (ex: Tropical solutions serum) but this is a plus as I find heavier creams tend to clog my pores more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;Light serum&lt;br /&gt;consistency is thin/fluid&lt;br /&gt;Scent free&lt;br /&gt;skin feels moisturized&lt;br /&gt;Not as thick as some people may want</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  I don&#x27;t feel it did anythiing for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money again on it.</li>
    <li> About the same results as using any store bought cream.  Turns rancid like after short time, smells.  Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So far so good, i like to exfoliate my face first then apply so it penetrates those pesty lines lol it absorbs nicely and not greasy at all, it takes just a little to cover your face, therefore will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was surprised being all natural it would not be so strong of a scent.  So strong hard to use.  Also nothing goes over it well like a moisturizer just comes off when applying ,makeup .  If I had not thrown away the boxes I would ship it back.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling, light moisturizer.  If the packaging was better, I probably would have scored higher.  The pump kind of squirted the product all over the place.  Also, the container was clear, which I thought caused active ingredients to deteriorate. I use a few different moisturizers and my skin does seem more dry after using this one than the others.  Loreal Skin Genesis is also a hyaluronic acid moisturizer I use and is heavier for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes your skin feel silky smooth all day. I use this serum in combination with the derma e peptides plus cream, and my skin is finally starting to look really good. After using Rachel Perry&#x27;s products for a year while my skin was gradually deteriorating, I&#x27;m pleased to have found that derma e is offering natural skin products that actually work.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says. I&#x27;ve used it for years, again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years. It is a light moisturizer that quickly absorbs into the skin. It is even light enough for my teenage daughter with acne. I am a skin care professional with a sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many more expensive, professional products. This moisturizer has a very light scent and I never had allergic reaction from it. I use it on my face and neck few minutes before I put on my foundation. It&#x27;s a great daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> been using for over a month, but cannot yet tell that it has done a thing.  i will use all of bottle, but it seems like hand lotion, NOT a serum.  am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a great fan of Derma E products. I have been using a great variety of their day, night, eye cream and this serum. I like the sweet smell, smooth texture and l feel good applying all natural product onto my face.</li>
    <li> Let me say a little about my skin type and concerns, so before you read this you can decide if it is applicable to you.  I am 46 and have normal /combination skin.  I am pale and burn easily, but a brunette.  This year I have felt that my makeup doesen&#x27;t do enough, but when I don&#x27;t wear makeup I look lousy.  I also see some wrinkles in my forhead and around my eyes and lips.  I have always been told I have beautiful skin, so I really want to fight this fight.  I would rather not wear any make up but needs-must.  I have only been using this a for four days in combination with derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Crème and derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic...and I SEE a difference!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the silky feel of my skin. A great product for the cost.</li>
    <li> After one use my skin was absolutely radiant, beaming, and felt so soft to the touch. I was totally satisfied with these results and was not anticipating additional positives but to my surprise it also moistened the really sensitive area around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and it seems to really make my skin glow and look more radiant. I have sensitive skin so it does tingle a bit after I apply it, but its temporary and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, at all. Along with the skin lightning cream it really does help to lighten brown spots and even out skin tone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is leaving my skin feeling very hydrated and not greasy.  I had to search and search for a product that was high on the list of ingredients for Hyaluronic Acid.  This is the best that I found</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin and react to everyting, but this one my skin loves, soft and dewey! give a try !</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local online health food retailer because it got rave reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it 2X/day for about two months.  When I use it, I use a LOT of it;  at least 3-4 pumps.  I haven&#x27;t been using it sparingly and unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve noticed NO fragrance.  I&#x27;ve also not noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.  Compared to some high-end products I&#x27;ve transitioned to where I see results fairly immediately, this product is unremarkable.  I got the large 2 oz. bottle, and although I probably have quite a bit left, why bother?  It&#x27;s done nothing for my skin.  In fact, as I write this review, it just occurred to me, since I apply this BEFORE my moisturizer, it probably blocks the positive treatment of the moisturizer,  so I&#x27;m gonna stop using this, at least temporarily.  If my skin starts looking better without it, I will just trash it.  I consider this a \\&quot;low-end\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Hyaluronic Serum has been a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Nice and light texture.</li>
    <li> I have known Derma E products for some time, they are always high quality. Does not soak into skin very fast, it takes a bit. I love the pump better than others that come with a dropper.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I also use it along wiht the derma e Peptides Plus Serum.  I put it on after I shower or bathe, and it soaks right in.  Very gentle on my mature skin.  I can even use this around my eyes, and it does not irritate them.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite skin care products.  It&#x27;s light, easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t make skin irritated or break out.  Lovely product.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Put on after first splash cleanse in the morning.  It is light and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only bought one bottle so far, but this stuff is great! It&#x27;s got a silky, smooth texture, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. 1-2 pumps covers your fact, so the stuff will last for months. Also, I noticed a clear improvement in my skin. It looks smoother and has a nice glow to it that I hadn&#x27;t seen before. I&#x27;m a Derma E customer for the long-haul.</li>
    <li> Great hydrating serum. It absorbs quickly and leaves no film on my skin. I use it with the Hydrating Cream.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong item see above .</li>
    <li> I ordered this derma e Hyaluronic Serum along with several other derma e products . I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  It has a very strong scent and when you dispense the pump it shoots across the room!  I have been using it for a few weeks now and see no difference in my skin at all.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is my least favorite derma e product and a total waste of money sorry to say.  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this product or anything close, as to name or what it does.. It was not apparently delivered , I have been through in searching I can assure you!</li>
    <li> Something to add to my moisturizer recommended by a dermatologist to help hold moisture in the skin.  This ingredient is in many facial care products but sometimes not enough is added and this product adds the extra hyaluronic acid for a great price.  Has a very slight natural fragrance and since I only add a few drops or one pump to my moisturizer, it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now. I was having very dry skin and really needed something to \\&quot;boost\\&quot; my moisturizer. This did it.  I use this after washing my face and then wait a minute and use a facial moisturizer. I also mix this with my Vitamin C serum so that the serum doesn&#x27;t sting when I apply it in the morning.  I have used this on my hands and legs too below regular moisture when my extremities were really dry. One doesn&#x27;t need a lot either with each application.  I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> I have used the Derma E Hyalauronic Dehydrating Serum for a year now.  This is a fantastic product.  I am a licensed  Master Aesthetician with the state of Virginia.  I have worked with many products, and while there are many out there that are equal to, and/or better; for your money, this cannot be beat.  I have tried the  other 100% hyalauronic serums sold by Amazon, but I like the added vitamins in this serum, and it just spreads easily.  All you need is one or two pumps in your hand, then smooth on to your face.  Easy peasy.  Hyalauronic Acid works by pulling 100% of its weight in moisture to your skin, thereby plumping it up.  After you apply this,  add your moisturizer(s).  This is not meant to be a stand alone product.  ***As a warning, just because one person has an allergic reaction to a product, does not mean that everyone is going to have it.  And yes, you can use a product, or eat a food for years, and then develop a reaction.  If a reaction occurs, one should simply try to isolate the product, or ingredient, to find the cause.  Having a reaction is *not* the same as catching a cold, and should not be expressed as one.  Warning people that you had a reaction to a product to dissuade them from buying is unreasonable.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this because I have read such great reviews and was referred to it by a friend who has AMAZING skin and claims derma e products are her secret. I have very dry skin and had to apply about 3 coats before I felt like it was doing it&#x27;s job. It did make my skin look and feel great but the reason why I  gave it two stars is because the company (for some crazy reason) put in  &amp;#34;Plumeria Blossom Fragrance.&amp;#34; Thats right, Plumeria-- as in the terrible flower scent that should have died with the 90&#x27;s.I didn&#x27;t know anyone was even still using it!  It was WAY too fragrant, and in my opinion foolish to throw scent in there, if it doesn&#x27;t help my skin don&#x27;t put it in the formula! I tried to keep it on, but after an hour I had a headache and had to wash it off. I am taking it back to the store tomorrow. Also, I wish they would put the strength of the hyaluronic acid (the percentage) on the back. I think it is dishonest when companies don&#x27;t put how strong the ingredients are.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My esthetician measured the moisture level of my skin and it was low. She recommended a hylaronic acid serum to improve it. I found this on Amazon and since I&#x27;ve been using it, my moisture levels are way up!</li>
    <li> This is more like a cream than a serum.  It seems to work alright and it certainly smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have purchased. I love it and would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Moisturizing without being heavy at all. I mix it in with my foundation in the morning.</li>
    <li> Feels good.  Non-greasy.  I mix this 50/50 with the derma 3 peptides plus double-action wrinkles reverse serum.  Makes my skin feel soft to the touch and does not seem to clog pores.  I gave it 4 stars because it is too soon to tell if it really reverses wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Still  not sure of this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this morning and night as a moisturizer and it feels great.  It is not heavy or greasy, and makeup applies easily over it.  Heavy lotions make me feel like I am smothered. I have already purchased a second bottle, as I do not want to run out.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes the skin on my face and neck feel and look.  It is like getting a mini facial everyday.  It does have a fairly strong flowery fragrance so if that is bothersome to you, you might want to skip this product.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Derme E....</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum due to the ingrediant hyaluronic acid, which helps with restore and maintain the  skin&#x27;s moisture barrier(i.e. dry patches, dry skin, and wrinkles). The product comes in a generous 2fl. oz. pump bottle which nicely controlls how much product is disspensed. Only a pin dot is needed to cover your face. PLEASE NOTE: if you&#x27;re bothered by fragrance, do not purchase this product. I ended up trashing mine due to this. Also, the serum was a little to thick for me. This would be a fantastic product made in a fragrance free formula. I use Cerave moisturizing lotion as my serum with no problems.&lt;br /&gt; Due to the fragrance problem I only gave this product 2 stars. I would not recommend this product if sensetive to fragrance.</li>
    <li> This serum feels great on my skin and has created a noticeable difference in my skins texture. My only complaint is the strong flowery smell. Please leave it out and the alcohol it takes to make it smell. Most people using this product line don&#x27;t want either of those ingredients in their lotion.</li>
    <li> I like that this cream is not oily, dries fast, makes your skin look nice, and the light, delightful fragrance is an added bonus. Plus a little goes a long way when it comes to the application.</li>
    <li> Really good, love it.</li>
    <li> The contents remain the same, as well as the amount, but the company has changed the packaging.  What used to be a very light pump bottle perfect for travel is now a tall, heavy bottle, whose contents I&#x27;ll have to transfer when I fly.  The price of this product has gone up each time I&#x27;ve ordered it and I suppose now the rate of increase will be even greater.  I still think the serum itself is excellent and am just sorry that Derma e&#x27;s &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; marketing adventure has resulted in bigger, clunkier, and less ecologically-responsible bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70+ with dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers (including pricey ones suc as Elemis and various Dr. Hauschka products) and this is the only one that really makes a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now, twice day. -- morning and evening -- and have never got so many compliments on my skin. It looks and feels very smooth and dewy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after trying several other brands of serums at a much higher price tag.  I use several derma e products and was excited to try the serum.  I was not disappointed!  It is a nice lightweight formula that glides on to skin and absorbs after about 15 seconds. It is a great primer in the morning and evening before your moisturizer. On a lazy evening I just applied this serum and felt that my face did get enough moisture from the serum alone, however in the colder months that probably won&#x27;t work so well. Some reviews mention the pump not being well made...it can stick a little bit, but when you compare the quality of the product to those that cost 3 or 4 times as much I can live with a sticky pump.</li>
    <li> honestly i don&#x27;t see or feel any difference other then it stings a little around my nose and the sides of my lips.</li>
    <li> Derma e hyaluronic acid serum is an excellent moisturizer for under your make up.  It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.  I feel it&#x27;s made my face look younger as well</li>
    <li> get compliments when I use this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. I have eczema and acne. This serum moisturizers without burning and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff smoothes every part of me.  It&#x27;s not even in the same league as any lotion at Walgreens.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> When I was using this produced I loved it. Howeve,r I have found another product I like better for now, but may switch back and forth between products.</li>
    <li> I love the product! I feel comfortable when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;And it does moisturize the skin without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Only lightly hydrating.</li>
</ol>
