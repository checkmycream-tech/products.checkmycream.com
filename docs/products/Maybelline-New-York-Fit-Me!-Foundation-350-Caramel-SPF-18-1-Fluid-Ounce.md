    <li> Great coverage, it&#x27;s so easy to blend, feel great on the face, and natural, in my case the only problem was that the color is dark for my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product only a few times because it made my face so oily and shiny. Even when setting with powder. I just stopped using it. No good fit for me.</li>
    <li> This is probably the first foundation I&#x27;ve found that blends in with my my skin perfectly! Got it at Walmart for only $5.00! I love this &amp; will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It Was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong color , but that&#x27;s my fault. But I mixed this foundation with lighter foundation &amp;&#x27; it was perfect !</li>
    <li> I use this to contour on my olive skin and I love it. When I first used it though it kinda made my skin itchy.</li>
    <li> This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Great value. Shipped as promised. Bought five to stay in stock.&lt;br /&gt;I think this shade has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Changed my rating because it finally came lol it matches my skin tone I  just wish it was more coverage</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, it fits perfect for my skin, this foundation and shade was always sold out at my local walmart and other drug stores, that&#x27;s why i was disappointed when they discontinued this shade(350) from the shelf. I was so trilled that i found it amazon. I&#x27;ve be returning other foundations, because the shade just doesn&#x27;t match right. I&#x27;m just glad i found my true foundation! I hope they keep this shade in stock.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful color and it glides on my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I usually use The Queen Collection which is awesome! I decided to try this due to the great comments! I was embarrassed when I realized this make up made my skin look orange &amp; oily. I hate that I spent money on this product!</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst foundation I have ever EVER EVER tried in my life.. The product is extremely oily and it has a weird smell too it. Product also rubs off on EVERYTHING!!! Maybelline really dropped the ball with this product.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectation.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30s, I beginning to see some discoloration in my skin, I use this foundation to create an appearance of even toned skin. It is light and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation I&#x27;m a 350 and normally I buy it from Wal-Mart but it was sold out so I saw it on Amazon and immediately order 2 I have dry skin and this foundation gives me the right amount of shine but before I apply my foundation I always use a moisturizer and a primer This foundation doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes or anything and I work 12 hr shifts at an hospital and it last for me throughout my whole shift I love maybelline fit me the best product they invented</li>
    <li> mY MOM LOVE IT I GOING BUY ME SOME SILKY FEELING NICE SHADES. LOOK NATURAL FEEL GOOD ON FACE SILKY</li>
    <li> I bought the Maybelline fit me foundation in 350. It turns out that its too dark and I can&#x27;t return it. It went on great but by mid day, I was seriously oilier than usual. The foundation is ok for the price but I would have to purchase a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I simply bought it for contouring purposes.  It&#x27;s darker then my normal skin shade but recommended for contouring.  It works well.</li>
    <li> i love the way it makes my skin look amazing , it came before it was due which was great so gooooooooooooooooood job amazon !!!!!!!!!!</li>
