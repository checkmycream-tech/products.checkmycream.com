      <li>Love...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I love that I can sense the heat</li>
      <li>It does keep you from getting burned easily, but you can still feel the heat.</li>
      <li>and I can use the rollers easily.  </li>
      <li>this protects more than adequately.</li>
      <li>Going to buy a smoother glove next time and use this for softening up my face instead lol.</li>
      <li>But it really keeps my hand safe</li>
      <li>compared to the half glove that comes with most irons this is so much better :)</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair</li>
      <li>So, it did not serve me and I&#x27;m hoping to find thermal gloves with a different kind of material, something like silicone instead of this.</li>
      <li>I rarely use it because it snags the hair.</li>
      <li>and I have to wrap my right hand around the body of the blow dryer to do my work.  </li>
      <li>The glove is course, not very thin, or comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>My hairstylist gave me a thermal mitt when I explained that my new rollers were too hot to handle easily.  </li>
      <li>The hot air comes pouring right through the glove.  </li>
      <li>It did the trick, but I would look for something better the next time.</li>
      <li>Very resistant to heat!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I (keyword here is \\&quot;I\\&quot;)</li>
      <li>These feel like shower gloves exactly.</li>
      <li>This product works very well and saves my hand from getting burned by my hot hair or hot hair appliances.</li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>This allows me to hold my hair without getting burned so I can get my hair perfectly straight.  </li>
      <li>It really keeps me from burning my fingers.</li>
      <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well at insulating your hand from heat in this case.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is meant for continuous, direct contact with the hot tool.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it&#x27;s highly priced.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine at protecting my hands from heat, but the glove is so rough!</li>
      <li>in fact, hubby was like, hey new shower glove.</li>
      <li>It worked just as well as the professional thermal mitt</li>
      <li>The glove is stretchy and it offers some protection with some heated elements but not all of them ,so beware.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it is made of a loose, breathable fabric that is full of tiny holes.  </li>
      <li>You can still feel warmth but it does not burn you as if was your bare hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m teaching my 7 year old son to iron and wanted a glove that would protect his left hand while ironing.  </li>
      <li>While straightening it, my hair gets so hot that I can&#x27;t hold it with my bare hand, but using the brush to hold my hair like my stylist does is pretty difficult for me.  </li>

<li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to buy this!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d rather use it to exfoliate my skin than touch my hair, since all the strands of my hair get caught in the rough texturing and it causes frizz.</li>
<li> Works well, but the material is really rough.</li>
<li> so it takes a really long time to straighten and the brush usually just gets caught in my curls rather than assisting me in straightening my hair.  </li>
<li> This glove protects your hand from heat, as it proposes to do, but the material gets stuck on Velcro rollers and if you are styling your hair to separate and roll the sections on Velcro rollers as I do, the process becomes very unpractical and difficult to do because the rollers keep getting stuck on the glove.</li>
<li> too small and very itchy, its not a great product at all</li>
<li> A Little scratchy</li>
<li> I can hold on to my curling wand for a few seconds without trouble.</li>
<li> Waste of money to me ...</li>
<li> this took forever to arrive and when it got here it was no better than one of thoe shower gloves.</li>
<li> (That&#x27;s the really hard part.)</li>
<li> Not a good item for me.</li>
<li> This one fits the bill, thin but protective.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I hate how it snags my hair</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s good, i still feel the heat but it&#x27;s better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy it again. the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Just as described :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great! After I slide the curl off the iron I can hold while wearing this glove without burning myself.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Just a scrubby bath mitt you can pick up at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> The glove is stretchy and it offers some protection with some heated elements but not all of them ,so beware.</li>
    <li> Great for using with marcel irons. Keeps hands from getting burnt.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something that would block the heat from the flatiron. This does an ok job but you can still get burned.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t going to prevent you from getting burned if you grab the curling iron or straightening iron with the Mitt on and just hold the object at the point of heat.  But it will prevent you from getting burned if you accidentally touch the heated part of the hair appliance.  I actually use the glove on my left hand to hold my hair while straightening it.  While straightening it, my hair gets so hot that I can&#x27;t hold it with my bare hand, but using the brush to hold my hair like my stylist does is pretty difficult for me.  This allows me to hold my hair without getting burned so I can get my hair perfectly straight.  I have super curly hair so it takes a really long time to straighten and the brush usually just gets caught in my curls rather than assisting me in straightening my hair.  For the price of this Mitt, I can&#x27;t complain.  It does exactly what I (keyword here is \\&quot;I\\&quot;) bought it for.</li>
    <li> Given as a Christmas gift.  My daughter says the glove is a necessity!</li>
    <li> Works well, but the material is really rough. It scratches my skin.</li>
    <li> It does keep you from getting burned easily, but you can still feel the heat. The glove is course, not very thin, or comfortable to wear. As I was doing a lot of curling, I wanted something to protect my fingers from getting burnt. It did the trick, but I would look for something better the next time.</li>
    <li> Very resistant to heat! I can hold on to my curling wand for a few seconds without trouble. Buy this one!</li>
    <li> It really keeps me from burning my fingers.</li>
    <li> I was constantly burning my hand on my curling iron so I bought this mitt and use it when I wrap the hair around my hand.  It saved this klutz.  I wish they made something to tape on my forehead when I straighten my bangs.</li>
    <li> These feel like shower gloves exactly. But it really keeps my hand safe</li>
    <li> I wish I could get my money back. this took forever to arrive and when it got here it was no better than one of thoe shower gloves. in fact, hubby was like, hey new shower glove. those things are .99c</li>
    <li> My sister lost my glove for my curling wand. This was an affordable and quality replacement glove.</li>
    <li> it keeps her from being burned, and perfect size for her!  she loves how it works with her clipless curling iron!</li>
    <li> Great glove that helps me from burning my hand when I am in a hurry! I would recommend it to anyone who burns themselves trying to curl their hair in a rush.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it does what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to do.  A Little scratchy but I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> too small and very itchy, its not a great product at all</li>
    <li> My hairstylist gave me a thermal mitt when I explained that my new rollers were too hot to handle easily.  One mitt was not enough to work with them.  I ordered this one. It worked just as well as the professional thermal mitt and I can use the rollers easily.  Now I just need to work on my technique. (That&#x27;s the really hard part.)</li>
    <li> This is a great heat glove for the price. This thing is perfect for protecting my hand while I iron my hair. Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to buy this!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter because I got her a curling wand.  I knew it came with one glove, but I knew I would be using the curling wand as well, and knew I would have to have two.  I am so glad I got it.  It really does work.  Kept my hands from burning.  Thank heavens.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m teaching my 7 year old son to iron and wanted a glove that would protect his left hand while ironing.  This one fits the bill, thin but protective.  I did test it myself before handing it to my kid--obviously, it&#x27;s not enough protection to hold your hand up against the iron for an extended period of time.  But for the accidental bumps that sometimes happen while ironing (be it clothing or hair) this protects more than adequately.</li>
    <li> This glove protects your hand from heat, as it proposes to do, but the material gets stuck on Velcro rollers and if you are styling your hair to separate and roll the sections on Velcro rollers as I do, the process becomes very unpractical and difficult to do because the rollers keep getting stuck on the glove. So, it did not serve me and I&#x27;m hoping to find thermal gloves with a different kind of material, something like silicone instead of this. In addition, it&#x27;s highly priced.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves them!</li>
    <li> Love... compared to the half glove that comes with most irons this is so much better :)</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and product works. You can still feel warmth but it does not burn you as if was your bare hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine at protecting my hands from heat, but the glove is so rough! I&#x27;d rather use it to exfoliate my skin than touch my hair, since all the strands of my hair get caught in the rough texturing and it causes frizz. Going to buy a smoother glove next time and use this for softening up my face instead lol.</li>
    <li> I rarely use it because it snags the hair. I&#x27;ve learned how to curl my hair w/o burning my fingers. Waste of money to me ...</li>
    <li> WORKS. DOES WHAT IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO DO.</li>
    <li> I love that I can sense the heat but it doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I hate how it snags my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I have to wrap my right hand around the body of the blow dryer to do my work.  I don&#x27;t think this is meant for continuous, direct contact with the hot tool.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well at insulating your hand from heat in this case.  Additionally, it is made of a loose, breathable fabric that is full of tiny holes.  The hot air comes pouring right through the glove.  Not a good item for me.</li>
    <li> save your hands from being burnt, love this and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;clumsy&amp;#34; when using.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from being burned, however, the glove can get snagged on things.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and saves my hand from getting burned by my hot hair or hot hair appliances. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Will not protect u if u hold ur hand continuously against the heat source. Works good 4 protecting the hands from momentary contact.</li>
