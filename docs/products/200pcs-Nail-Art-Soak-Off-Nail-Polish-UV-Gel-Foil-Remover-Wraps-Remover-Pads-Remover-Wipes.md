      <li>These work great!</li>
      <li>The best part of these is that it has the acetone soaked pad, foil and sticks together to hold on.  </li>
      <li>They design is a great idea, but it didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I hoped.</li>
      <li>They also have a pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>These wraps work amazingly well.</li>
      <li>: I honestly think this is the easiest and cheapest way.</li>

      <li>You might be able to do 2 nails with one pad.</li>
      <li>I like this technique, it makes it easy to take off my gels.</li>
      <li>They are well saturated so I was able to resuse the pad to soak the rest off and clean the nail.</li>
      <li>However, there is a strong chemical smell that isn&#x27;t acetone.</li>
      <li>and they work great for regular nail polish removal too</li>
      <li>I was able to soak the OPI Gel color for 2 minutes and 90% peeled right off.</li>

      <li>Works great, sometimes I need to add a little acetone for the one or two stubborn nails, but generally have no issues.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;re really stuck in one place for the whole time, but you just find a good TV show and you&#x27;re done in about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>These work really well to remove gel polish.</li>
      <li>Then I find myself just trying to form the packet around my finger, but it is much looser than if the sticker stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At half the price of other gel polish removers this is a good savings!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are pretty easy to use, they are a little packet that has a pad inside that&#x27;s saturated with nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Between ripping the foil, tearing the cotton into small pieces, and wrapping each finger, it was a BIG hassle.stuck in one place for the whole time, but you just find a good TV show and you&#x27;re done in about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I have to add a little acetone to them, but the polish comes off pretty quick!  </li>
      <li>I use the drugstore gel polish, and these took it right off in only 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;These wipes are much better than some other methods I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still not completely sold on them.</li>
      <li>When you rip off the top and stick your finger, there&#x27;s a little sticker that you can wrap around to hold the packet tight.</li>

    <li> cos it was make in China, which i thought it was origin from the States!!! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Gosh I&#x27;ve gotten lazy, and these things work great! No more tin foil, cutting cotton etc... I do what another commenter suggested and did one hand completely then re used on the other. Works great, sometimes I need to add a little acetone for the one or two stubborn nails, but generally have no issues. They wrap snug and are not a big leaky mess.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product and I am very pleased.  Sometimes I have to add a little acetone to them, but the polish comes off pretty quick!  (I like that!) At half the price of other gel polish removers this is a good savings! The con to this is it takes almost three weeks to get.  So I order long before I run out.</li>
    <li> Love these and they work great for regular nail polish removal too</li>
    <li> These wrappers are not enough to soak off gel polish. Thin acetone pad and the wraps are too short so they fall off. Not better than using foil and cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Item performs as advertised!</li>
    <li> These work great! You tear the end off and the sticker on the side, insert your finger and then wrap the excess around to keep it in place. It soaked my gel polish off in about 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Takes longer than 15 min to remove the gel nail polish</li>
    <li> The best part of these is that it has the acetone soaked pad, foil and sticks together to hold on.  my only reason for giving this 4 stars is that the instructions are not really there so we lost several in the process of understanding how to properly flip the wrapper to have it stick to itself.  Recommend for anyone who loves to put on gels</li>
    <li> These wraps work amazingly well. I was able to soak the OPI Gel color for 2 minutes and 90% peeled right off. They are well saturated so I was able to resuse the pad to soak the rest off and clean the nail. You might be able to do 2 nails with one pad. They also have a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> I like this technique, it makes it easy to take off my gels.</li>
    <li> These work really well to remove gel polish. However, there is a strong chemical smell that isn&#x27;t acetone. As well as a fake soapy sent. It creeps out, making me worry what&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective, not super drying, and have a cute smell. I use the drugstore gel polish, and these took it right off in only 5 minutes! So convenient- I&#x27;m typing this while still wearing them on one hand. Wish they were on Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
    <li> did not loosen the gel polish.</li>
    <li> It is a convenient way to remove polish from all your nails at the same time.  Just keep them on for at least 5 - 7 minutes (I don&#x27;t think any instructions came with it, but could be wrong.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with gel nails and do them myself every two weeks. The process of doing them doesn&#x27;t bother me, but removing them is a pain! I&#x27;m constantly looking for a better way of removing them. I&#x27;ve tried many methods, which I&#x27;ll mention in a minute. When I saw these little pads I figured I&#x27;d give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty easy to use, they are a little packet that has a pad inside that&#x27;s saturated with nail polish remover. They are almost identical to an alcohol wipe because of the packet and the pad inside, with the only difference being what the wipe is saturated with. They design is a great idea, but it didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I hoped. When you rip off the top and stick your finger, there&#x27;s a little sticker that you can wrap around to hold the packet tight. The sticker isn&#x27;t secured on either side, so when you pull off on one side, then wrap it around, the sticker often comes off on the other side. I hope that makes sense. Then I find myself just trying to form the packet around my finger, but it is much looser than if the sticker stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With leaving the product on my fingers for 10 minutes I get about 80% off. When I pull the packet off I rub my fingernail with some pressure to help pull the polish off. Then I end up filing the rest that&#x27;s left and then pulling the wipe out of the packet and trying to rub off what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are much better than some other methods I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still not completely sold on them. I do one hand at a time since it&#x27;s hard to do both at once. When all is said and done it takes me about a half an hour to remove my polish. When I bought these they were $9.99, now they have increased to $13.99. I will not be buying these again at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a breakdown of each method I&#x27;ve tried. I listed them in order of the easiest to hardest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Bowl of acetone: I honestly think this is the easiest and cheapest way. It&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;re really stuck in one place for the whole time, but you just find a good TV show and you&#x27;re done in about 15 minutes. Someone gave me a tip to put the bowl of remover in a larger bowl of warm water so your fingers don&#x27;t get so cold. You can also pour the acetone back in and reuse it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail polish remover pads/packets: This product is the second easiest, but much more time consuming and difficult to do both hands at once.&lt;br /&gt;-Finger plug things: Messy and annoying&lt;br /&gt;-Finger tray: Similar to a bowl of acetone, but its extra stuff to have lying around, hard to pour the acetone back in. It just seems easier to use a small bowl.

    <li> They have to stay on for at least 5-10 minutes to see the gel break down. Even then I still have to scrape leftovers of it off. Easy to apply...a little hard to get off.</li>
    <li> Was not satisfied with the product. Very complicated to use as did not remove gel.</li>
