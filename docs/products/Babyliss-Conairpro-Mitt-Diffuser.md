### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the perfect solution for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>They are excellent for travel as they take up virtually no space.  </li>
      <li>This one has been great for me!  </li>
      <li>It has a good elastic - stays on my portable hair dryer perfectly.</li>
      <li>Also, great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Great for traveling and to have on hand.</li>
      <li>Absolutely great for traveling.  </li>
      <li>SO much better than the plastic ones!!  </li>
      <li>Very handy and convenient item for travel.</li>
      <li>Works great on my Babybliss blow dryer also it is very easily packed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than not using anything on the blow dryer, but not as good as a good diffuser that doesn&#x27;t blow around your hair.  </li>
      <li>love this after i figured out how to use it!</li>
      <li>This diffuser might not look like much but it works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Packs great &amp; works really well to produce curls &amp; reduce frizz.</li>
      <li>What I was looking for was a more sturdy Teflon mesh.</li>
      <li>I have used one of these Conair Mitt Diffusers for many years.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, so I cannot use it unless I buy a Conair!  </li>
      <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; on it, but my hands have fingers</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s better than not having anything at all.</li>
      <li>The  mitt will probably work better for you on the your lower hair dryer speed.</li>
      <li>and this is much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I remembered this option and set out to find it, a task that wasn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
      <li>Inexpensive, easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>but I do prefer the full sized plastic ones better.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and blow dryers just blow all the curl out of my hair.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a diffuser but are reluctant to make a huge investment, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>Elastic cuff makes it fit well around hair dryer.</li>
      <li>On the full speed, I can see where it might blow off as the mitt elastic slides quite easily against the hair dryer plastic.</li>
      <li>I had to order this one after my first one wore out after more years of use than I can remember.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to hear about the mitt that I could use for travel instead of having to bring the diffuser.  </li>
      <li>You probably spend more on a latte ;)</li>
      <li>Spending the summer air drying my hair was fine here in Los Angeles, I just had to step outside in the warm summer mornings and let nature take its course.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally very curly hair, so this works fine.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment.</li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re not crazy about it, it was under $5.  </li>
      <li>Honestly you could cut off the toes of a pair of stockings, stick it on a hair dryer and it would work the same!</li>
      <li>Works very well and great for travel minimal packing space needed,    </li>
      <li>I bought it not because it was cheap, but because it was &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; and I had ordered a Babyliss Tourmaline Pro hairdryer at the same time and couldn&#x27;t get a good answer as to whether or not a REAL diffuser would fit it.</li>
      <li>Great for travel or storing in small spaces.</li>
      <li>Perfect for drying long, curly hair upside down and scrunching.</li>
      <li>Takes virtually no space and performs exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to not be a slave to my flat iron and embrace my waves more.  </li>
      <li>I do have fine hair, and the only thing I dislike about this is that the mitt catches on my hair, which can lead to some frizziness.</li>
      <li>It came in a huge box to my surprise when I opened it and pulled out this tiny package.</li>
      <li>I tried a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser attachment, but after spending $20 on one only to have it pop off because of the shape of my dryer&#x27;s nozzle, I realized that \\&quot;universal\\&quot; isn&#x27;t accurate.  </li>
      <li>It fits any hairdryer and works very well.  </li>
      <li>But for the price, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>… my new hair dryer has a tendency to suck my hair into its fan.</li>
      <li>I needed a new diffuser</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully and it is easier to store then the bigger plastic ones, not to mention it costs only a lot less then the other diffuser&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>A huge savings over a new hair dryer that came with a hard, large plastic diffuser.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently growing out a very short haircut but had long, curly hair for many years, and I can tell this little diffuser will be my favorite when my hair is long again.  </li>
      <li>The air seems to concentrate and blow directly out the tip regardless.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and need to use a diffuser.  </li>
      <li>I actually modified it with some fabric to stop the air from just coming out the very tip. /Shrug</li>
      <li>The first one lasted for about 10 years and just replaced by buying 3, since they are cheap and I&#x27;m afraid they will not be available in 10 years when I need to replace the next one!</li>
      <li>Cheap and diffuses as well as any diffuser I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
      <li>I had a very hard time finding a diffuser that fit my hair dryer</li>

<li> Cheap and diffuses as well as any diffuser I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> I had a very hard time finding a diffuser that fit my hair dryer</li>
<li> And it holds tight so even with the blower on high</li>
<li> w/ this diffuser popping off as some others have reported, but I have only used it on a traditionally sized/shaped dryer with a long, evenly-shaped barrel.  </li>
<li> It works okay, but I find it a little thin.</li>
<li> Wish I had known these things existed a long time ago!</li>
<li> I was skeptical of how this would work as I have only,used full size diffuser.</li>
<li> which keeps the dryer farther from my hair and less likely to get sucked in.</li>
<li> I could see how it might pop off a dryer with a short barrel or one that tapers from wide to narrow.  </li>
<li> I love the product but the band is very tight and a little difficult to put on hair blower.</li>
<li> I finally stopped into my local beauty supply and was about to walk out, disappointed once again, when I asked the sales girl if what was on the floor were the only diffusers they had.</li>
<li> I used to have one of these years ago and misplaced it in a move.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so thin that the air blows through it without slowing down at all so</li>
<li> so I gave up trying one of the hard plastic one&#x27;s and tried this out.  </li>
<li> This does, at least.</li>
<li> Works as well, if not better !</li>
<li> However, I was disappointed to discover that even on the low speed setting of my dryer, that the diffuser still blows my hair around some.</li>
<li> I have figured out how to work with it, but it is a little disappointing.  </li>
<li> I always hated my bulky plastic diffuser.  </li>

    <li> Packs great &amp; works really well to produce curls &amp; reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these Conair Mitt Diffusers for many years.  They are excellent for travel as they take up virtually no space.  Works with almost any hair dryer.  I rely on the hotel&#x27;s provided dryer and have never had a problem.  I have natural curly hair and need to use a diffuser.  This does the trick when I&#x27;m traveling.  The first one lasted for about 10 years and just replaced by buying 3, since they are cheap and I&#x27;m afraid they will not be available in 10 years when I need to replace the next one!</li>

    <li> This is the perfect solution for curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t blow the curl out or make your hair frizzy. Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Works great on my Babybliss blow dryer also it is very easily packed. I have naturally very curly hair, so this works fine.</li>
    <li> This diffuser might not look like much but it works great. I had a very hard time finding a diffuser that fit my hair dryer so I gave up trying one of the hard plastic one&#x27;s and tried this out.  It works wonderfully and it is easier to store then the bigger plastic ones, not to mention it costs only a lot less then the other diffuser&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I needed a new diffuser and I decided to try this based on the reviews.  It works okay, but I find it a little thin. It could have been shipped in one of the Amazon envelopes...It came in a huge box to my surprise when I opened it and pulled out this tiny package. It works thats why I only gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Takes virtually no space and performs exactly as promised. The  mitt will probably work better for you on the your lower hair dryer speed. On the full speed, I can see where it might blow off as the mitt elastic slides quite easily against the hair dryer plastic.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s better than not having anything at all. The air seems to concentrate and blow directly out the tip regardless.

    <li> Honestly you could cut off the toes of a pair of stockings, stick it on a hair dryer and it would work the same! It&#x27;s so thin that the air blows through it without slowing down at all so your curls end up frizzing out.</li>
    <li> I had to order this one after my first one wore out after more years of use than I can remember.  It fits any hairdryer and works very well.  Also, great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have figured out how to work with it, but it is a little disappointing.  I had a different &amp;#34;hot sock&amp;#34; for my drier for literally YEARS that was very simple design (spongey foam with elastic band) that finally died and this was its replacement.</li>
    <li> love this after i figured out how to use it!</li>
    <li> Wish I had known these things existed a long time ago! My hair is fine and blow dryers just blow all the curl out of my hair. Added benefit… my new hair dryer has a tendency to suck my hair into its fan. That&#x27;s a pain. This adds length to the dryer (but not weight!) which keeps the dryer farther from my hair and less likely to get sucked in.</li>
    <li> It has a good elastic - stays on my portable hair dryer perfectly. Material feels similar to my last one, which lasted about a decade.</li>
    <li> It works!  Absolutely great for traveling.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the band is very tight and a little difficult to put on hair blower.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, easy to travel with.  I always hated my bulky plastic diffuser.  This one has been great for me!  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these years ago and misplaced it in a move.  I&#x27;ve been trying to not be a slave to my flat iron and embrace my waves more.  Spending the summer air drying my hair was fine here in Los Angeles, I just had to step outside in the warm summer mornings and let nature take its course.  But now fall is here and that&#x27;s just not an option.  I tried a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser attachment, but after spending $20 on one only to have it pop off because of the shape of my dryer&#x27;s nozzle, I realized that \\&quot;universal\\&quot; isn&#x27;t accurate.  I remembered this option and set out to find it, a task that wasn&#x27;t easy.  I finally stopped into my local beauty supply and was about to walk out, disappointed once again, when I asked the sales girl if what was on the floor were the only diffusers they had. I said I was looking for the \\&quot;sock\\&quot; type that just went on the end, and she realized what I was looking for.  She led me to the register and there it was.  It was mine for under $5.  A huge savings over a new hair dryer that came with a hard, large plastic diffuser.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; on it, but my hands have fingers and this is much more comfortable.  These have been around for decades, and for the money you can&#x27;t beat it.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a diffuser but are reluctant to make a huge investment, this is the product for you.  And if you&#x27;re not crazy about it, it was under $5.  You probably spend more on a latte ;)</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the same product that I bought years ago.  Very handy and convenient item for travel.</li>
    <li> Great for travel or storing in small spaces. Elastic cuff makes it fit well around hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, so I cannot use it unless I buy a Conair!  The material is a plastic netting.  What I was looking for was a more sturdy Teflon mesh.</li>
    <li> SO much better than the plastic ones!!  I didn&#x27;t have any problems w/ this diffuser popping off as some others have reported, but I have only used it on a traditionally sized/shaped dryer with a long, evenly-shaped barrel.  I could see how it might pop off a dryer with a short barrel or one that tapers from wide to narrow.  I&#x27;m currently growing out a very short haircut but had long, curly hair for many years, and I can tell this little diffuser will be my favorite when my hair is long again.  Perfect for drying long, curly hair upside down and scrunching.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well but I do prefer the full sized plastic ones better. Great for traveling and to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Works very well and great for travel minimal packing space needed,    I was skeptical of how this would work as I have only,used full size diffuser. Works as well, if not better !</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and therefore I need a diffuser when blow drying my hair.  I was excited to hear about the mitt that I could use for travel instead of having to bring the diffuser.  However, I was disappointed to discover that even on the low speed setting of my dryer, that the diffuser still blows my hair around some. It&#x27;s better than not using anything on the blow dryer, but not as good as a good diffuser that doesn&#x27;t blow around your hair.  I won&#x27;t be using the mitt and will bring my diffuser instead.</li>
