      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am  SO  happy with this product.</li>

      <li>/&gt;This is a great hair product.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a very nice weighty feel to it.</li>
      <li>Does not make the item they sell a good item.</li>
      <li>Good value, Farscape shipping</li>
      <li>great if you have very fine hair...</li>
      <li>have very fine hair and this conditioner is great.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but that is about it.  </li>
      <li>Most of all, IT IS SO GOOD TO MY SKIN.</li>
      <li>Best thing I have found for fine straight hair!</li>
      <li>The smell is very light, it almost has no smell at all.</li>
      <li>HUGE tangles!  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this product</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I used to love this stuff, but I think they must have changed the formula.</li>
      <li>I have bought it more than once.</li>
      <li>It seemed to be OK</li>
      <li>This is another product that is not sold here any more.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>love love it</li>
      <li>Great product, works very well for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Even cheap store-brand conditioners are better than this.  </li>
      <li>Its easy.</li>
      <li>my hair was fine.</li>
      <li>The best part is, I noticed that there was less hair on my drain cover after I finished showering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anything that cost a little more and is a great product is quickly abandon and substituted with a lower quality more profit per dollar item.</li>
      <li>Ordering was easy, delivery quick.</li>
      <li>Perhaps a way of the times or just a get rich quicker</li>
      <li>The scent is a pleasant cross between lychee and honey.</li>
      <li>When the stores go back to selling quality products for a fair price.</li>
      <li>Even though I rinse most of it out it still makes my hair soft, shiny, and brushable.</li>
      <li>but these are well worth buying.  </li>
      <li>Results are very satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>Amazon wants my opinion but it has to meet thier requirements.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine - everything I have ever used weights it down-</li>
      <li>and I feel it rinses better than other conditioners, which seem to stay in your hair no matter how much you rinse.</li>
      <li>Prior to trying this and the matching shampoo ( ) I used Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner, and it still broke me out, made me itchy, and didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>Just because it is cheaper or twice as many for the same cost in the local stores.</li>
      <li>Had to give it away to a friend who can tolerate heavily fragranced products, smelled more like gardenia to me.</li>
      <li>As I said, it cleaned well and what was left of my hair was super soft.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend had bought me a bottle a few years ago because I always used cheap conditioners.</li>
      <li>just soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>, I recommend it to anyone looking for an all natural hair conditioning product.  </li>
      <li>As I was drying my hair, it felt soft, but when I looked at the bathroom walls and floor my hair was everywhere.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty dry</li>
      <li>A just right conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighted down or greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this and other Modern Organic Products, they seem deluxe and worth the price over drugstore crap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to preface this review with a little bit about my skin/hair type and why I bought this in the first place</li>
      <li>and I need a pretty heavy conditioner</li>
      <li>It has a pretty thick consistency that is more gel-like than liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down and a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> And in the process of detangeling, I actually pull out half my hair.</li>
<li> It is not a super conditioner, so if you have a rats nest in the back of your hair</li>
<li> It is one of the few hair products that actually perform the way it is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Check the label, you can smell the fake perfume in the product and it does not smell like lemongrass.  </li>

<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> As it is now, my hair looks terrible when I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for a while.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent when used with the Lemongrass shampoo. Very hard to find. I&#x27;m amazed that Amazon has it. Helps with volume</li>
    <li> love love it..will purchase it again...makes hair shiny but does not feel greasy will recommend to all my friends...great if you have very fine hair...</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well for fine hair.  Results are very satisfactory.  That is all I have to say.  Amazon wants my opinion but it has to meet thier requirements.  Kinda like our government at the moment.</li>
    <li> I just bought the shampoo and conditioner.. love the shampoo, hate the conditioner! I&#x27;ve tried it for about a week now but every day I get the same results..hair I can&#x27;t pull a brush thru. And in the process of detangeling, I actually pull out half my hair.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had bought me a bottle a few years ago because I always used cheap conditioners. It seemed to be OK so I used it till the bottle was done. The best part is, I noticed that there was less hair on my drain cover after I finished showering. For some reason it reduces the shedding of my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a very nice weighty feel to it. It has a pretty thick consistency that is more gel-like than liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down and a little goes a long way. The scent is a pleasant cross between lychee and honey. I did notice a slight volumizing effect when using this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Note this is not an all organic product.  Check the label, you can smell the fake perfume in the product and it does not smell like lemongrass.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> have very fine hair and this conditioner is great.</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff, but I think they must have changed the formula. As it is now, my hair looks terrible when I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for a while. I bought a few bottles because I was trying to stock up (it&#x27;s not easy to find anymore, maybe for a reason), and I&#x27;m sad that I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this stuff before and naively assumed that if it was lemongrass, it&#x27;d be mild, my bad. Had to give it away to a friend who can tolerate heavily fragranced products, smelled more like gardenia to me. That&#x27;s not what lemongrass smells like when I cook!</li>
    <li> Okay so when I was in the shower, I my hair started to fall out. I thought it was just a coincidence, but I was wrong. As I was drying my hair, it felt soft, but when I looked at the bathroom walls and floor my hair was everywhere. I decided it was just a fluke, so I retried and the same thing happened. When I went back to my regular shampoo my hair was fine. I am not trying to discourage anyone, but this is what happened to me. As I said, it cleaned well and what was left of my hair was super soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner. I&#x27;d like to preface this review with a little bit about my skin/hair type and why I bought this in the first place: I have extremely sensitive skin. Recently I have been having problems with all conditioners breaking my scalp, back, and shoulders out no matter how thoroughly I rinsed. I have long, thick, dry hair, but an oily/combo skin type. Prior to trying this and the matching shampoo ( ) I used Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner, and it still broke me out, made me itchy, and didn&#x27;t really work. I tried this brand after doing some googling and someone recommending it after having a similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and I feel it rinses better than other conditioners, which seem to stay in your hair no matter how much you rinse. Even though I rinse most of it out it still makes my hair soft, shiny, and brushable. It is not a super conditioner, so if you have a rats nest in the back of your hair this will not remedy your problem. The smell is very light, it almost has no smell at all. It does not leave a scent in my hair at all. It helps me with my brushing but its still an ordeal with long hair. It helps with frizziness and with control while styling. Most of all, IT IS SO GOOD TO MY SKIN. No break outs, not itchy, just soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am  SO  happy with this product. I would recommend this product over and over again. I have bought it more than once.</li>
    <li> A just right conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling weighted down or greasy. It leaves a wonderful scent &amp; leaves hair looking shiny.</li>
    <li> I think my conditioner is bad or turning bad. It smells like rotten cake mix.</li>
    <li> This is another product that is not sold here any more. It is one of the few hair products that actually perform the way it is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that cost a little more and is a great product is quickly abandon and substituted with a lower quality more profit per dollar item. Perhaps a way of the times or just a get rich quicker strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great hair product. Ordering was easy, delivery quick. Prices are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stores here locally want to know why people purchase on line instead of coming in. Its easy. When the stores go back to selling quality products for a fair price. I will purchase from the store. That includes automotive, toys, medications, and all items that I need. Just because it is cheaper or twice as many for the same cost in the local stores. Does not make the item they sell a good item.</li>
    <li> I have the shampoo to this line and both products do the job.  My hair is very fine - everything I have ever used weights it down-but these are well worth buying.  Yes I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner I&#x27;ve used for years - it&#x27;s neutral smelling, but retains a nice scent. I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this and other Modern Organic Products, they seem deluxe and worth the price over drugstore crap.</li>
    <li> Good value, Farscape shipping</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but that is about it.  My hair is pretty dry and I need a pretty heavy conditioner and this one just didn&#x27;t cut it. it was like putting nothing on my hair.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it again. :(</li>
    <li> I have bra-strap length fine hair, and every day using the MOP Lemongrass Conditioner has been worse and worse.  Yesterday it took me literally 15 minutes to comb out my hair.  HUGE tangles!  As soon as I would get a section combed out, it would tangle again.  Ick!  Even cheap store-brand conditioners are better than this.  I dumped the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product, I recommend it to anyone looking for an all natural hair conditioning product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent for thickening up your hair if it is thinning.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found for fine straight hair!</li>
