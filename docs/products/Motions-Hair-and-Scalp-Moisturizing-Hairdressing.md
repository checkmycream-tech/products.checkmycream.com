      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried it.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product I&#x27;ve been using it for some months now and couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
      <li>Smells good, though.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful &amp; leaves a light weight</li>
      <li>Motions hairdressing will always be my favorite moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this hair moisturizer!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>As a bonus, it also adds a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>I apply it to my hair every night,  comb it &amp; braid it then in the morning it nice &amp; wavy.</li>
      <li>However, the new formulation IS THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER HAD!</li>
      <li>I have used motions for years and have been generally satisfied, but not in love.</li>
      <li>am thinking of ordering more.</li>
      <li>This was ok.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I probably should have order more in case they change the formula.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The motions moisturizing cream is all that i have ever wanted, it absorbs so quickly in the hair and most of all, keeps the scalp, moisturized without causing itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>, it is light and very-effective.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for a severely flaky dry scalp (not dandruff).</li>
      <li>i think that this product would be good for people with thinner hair or woukd be good to use on a day you are running late and need something quick to put in your hair.</li>
      <li>Motions are pretty good product that produce consistent results however with long-term use many relaxers - including Motions products - gradually become less effective over time.</li>
      <li>So, once I found out that the reason for my shedding was the lack of moisture, I went out on a search for a good daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you need something that can be used everyday for ideal moisture.</li>
      <li>If you use too much it will cause a greasy build up quickly.</li>
      <li>and I can easily run a comb through it right after washing and both straight and natural styles look better and last longer.</li>
      <li>This cream keeps the hair soft and lightly moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Motions products for many years beginning with regular Motions Hair Relaxer and gradually added the shampoo and conditioner to the lineup.</li>
      <li>This is the most recent that she had me try.</li>
      <li>Product is greasy if you use too much.  </li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this product is the first time I used it my hair went from coarse and dry to a healthy-looking sheen</li>
      <li>Even if you have tried Motions hairdress before and didn&#x27;t care for it, I would encourage you to try this particular product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of hair care products but the buck stops at Motions Hair &amp; Scalp Moisturizing Hairdress because it&#x27;s lightweight with a pleasant although not too lingering fragrance - plus a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>It is highly moisturizing without leaving hair feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Light enough for daily use without a build up.</li>
      <li>first I thought it would not last in the hair</li>
      <li>I have recommended to numerous people who have all said pretty much the same thing I am saying.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy.</li>
      <li>I think it leaves my hair soft, moisturized and adds a bit of a shine.</li>
      <li>I was almost ready to give up until I saw this product on the shelf at my local harris teeter.</li>
      <li>I had been getting it done professionally every two weeks</li>
      <li>the moisturizer seemed kind of thin to me</li>
      <li>so I apply it once or twice a week to my scalp and smooth a small amount on the ends of my hair</li>
      <li>Highly recommended as this has been one of the only things that has helped with my dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it pretty heavily &amp; it hasn&#x27;t gotten a build up yet.</li>
      <li>I usually apply a few fingers worth and wipe as much of it out of my hair as I can without removing all of it from my scalp.</li>
      <li>I also use a small amount when I flat iron my hair and like how soft and straight my hair is.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product.  It keeps my hair moist and thus curtails breakage. It has lasted  along time.  I probably should have order more in case they change the formula.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use look like someone had took some out of it half of a jar was scare to put it on my hair.!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my hair to see if it would work or not. it worked but not the way i wanted it to. the moisturizer seemed kind of thin to me and i felt like i had to use alot of it to make my hair &amp;#34;moistured&amp;#34;. but even then i used another type of moisturizer over the motions b/c if i didnt my hair would be very dry at the end of the day. i think that this product would be good for people with thinner hair or woukd be good to use on a day you are running late and need something quick to put in your hair.</li>
    <li> Light enough for daily use without a build up.</li>
    <li> I have used motions for years and have been generally satisfied, but not in love. However, the new formulation IS THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER HAD! It is highly moisturizing without leaving hair feeling greasy. It smells great, it is light and very-effective. PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER CHANGE THIS PRODUCT. You have found the perfect formulation! Even if you have tried Motions hairdress before and didn&#x27;t care for it, I would encourage you to try this particular product. I have recommended to numerous people who have all said pretty much the same thing I am saying. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The motions moisturizing cream is all that i have ever wanted, it absorbs so quickly in the hair and most of all, keeps the scalp, moisturized without causing itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it would not last in the hair but actually it does, I oil my hair once a week or even twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of ordering more.</li>
    <li> This was ok.  A little greasy.  Tried to use it to moisturize my scalp, but it stayed flaky.  Smells good, though.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth. I do not need to use conditioner. Do use little otherwise it might look oily. I avoid putting on scalp, just put on ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Motions products for many years beginning with regular Motions Hair Relaxer and gradually added the shampoo and conditioner to the lineup. Motions are pretty good product that produce consistent results however with long-term use many relaxers - including Motions products - gradually become less effective over time. I am an African-American female with medium-length coarse dry hair, a dry scalp and split ends but I don&#x27;t care for and avoid buying or using products that leave my hair (and scalp) &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;smelly. I&#x27;ve tried a number of hair care products but the buck stops at Motions Hair &amp; Scalp Moisturizing Hairdress because it&#x27;s lightweight with a pleasant although not too lingering fragrance - plus a little goes a long way so I apply it once or twice a week to my scalp and smooth a small amount on the ends of my hair and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;bye bye&amp;#34; dry hair and spliting ends. My favorite thing about this product is the first time I used it my hair went from coarse and dry to a healthy-looking sheen and I can easily run a comb through it right after washing and both straight and natural styles look better and last longer.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Finally a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too thick and heavy, that doesn&#x27;t cause buildup, and I can use everyday! Awesome product I&#x27;ve been using it for some months now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to try their other products! Definitely worth a try if you need something that can be used everyday for ideal moisture.</li>
    <li> My daughter had me try the Motion line of products. This is the most recent that she had me try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I actually like it. I use it sparingly daily and find that I like it. If you use too much it will cause a greasy build up quickly. I think it leaves my hair soft, moisturized and adds a bit of a shine. I also use a small amount when I flat iron my hair and like how soft and straight my hair is. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy frizzy very long hair oily scalp and very dry ends, This cream make my hair super soft and shiny, the price is very cheap, i usually use very expensive brands. i recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> This cream keeps the hair soft and lightly moisturized all day. Had to buy in bulk because it&#x27;s been hard to find lately since the company came out with newer products. They can&#x27;t match or replace this one though.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for a severely flaky dry scalp (not dandruff). My only complaint is that it leaves your hair/scalp very oily/greasy but I don&#x27;t think that is avoidable since that is what is doing the hydration of your scalp. I usually apply a few fingers worth and wipe as much of it out of my hair as I can without removing all of it from my scalp. Usually lasts a few days or until you shampoo your hair. Highly recommended as this has been one of the only things that has helped with my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m handicapped and have to wash my hair with those shower cap things they used to have in the hospital. Sometimes I get crusty patches and this helps with those.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. My hair has always been dry which would of course lead to shedding. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair wasn&#x27;t growing the way I wanted it to. I had been getting it done professionally every two weeks but my hair stylist never mentioned anything about using a daily moisturizer so I was basically in the dark for years! So, once I found out that the reason for my shedding was the lack of moisture, I went out on a search for a good daily moisturizer. I ran into a lot of dead ends during this process. I was almost ready to give up until I saw this product on the shelf at my local harris teeter. I bought it, took it home, and from then on my hair has been on the up and up! It&#x27;s so lightweight and gives my hair a healthy shine. No more dry hair! No more shedding! I am so pleased with this product. Motions hairdressing will always be my favorite moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Product is greasy if you use too much.  In my opinion product is not great for dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair moisturizer! My hair is naturally wavy. I&#x27;ve been wearing the wet &amp; wavy look. My hair got dry from using mousse alone so I was a local store &amp; saw this on the shelf &amp; decided to give it a try. I love it. I&#x27;m so happy I tried it. It smells wonderful &amp; leaves a light weight frizz control &amp; shine. I&#x27;ve been using it pretty heavily &amp; it hasn&#x27;t gotten a build up yet. I apply it to my hair every night,  comb it &amp; braid it then in the morning it nice &amp; wavy. This will be my go to moisturizer until I go back to the hair salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Within one week, I noticed a difference in my scalp.  It keeps your scalp and hair hydrated all day.  As a bonus, it also adds a nice shine.  I would recommend this product.</li>
