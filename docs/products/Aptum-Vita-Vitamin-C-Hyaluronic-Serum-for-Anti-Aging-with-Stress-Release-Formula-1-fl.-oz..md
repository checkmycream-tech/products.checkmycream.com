    <li> I am very pleased with the results so far. I&#x27;m using it every day in the morning and spread it all over my face and neck, followed by an SPF lotion.

    <li> It gave me a rash the first night I used it. I waited about a week and tried it again, and I have not had anymore issues. Love the product. I had someone tell my yesterday that I was 28..... but don&#x27;t tell them that I am actually 46!</li>

    <li> Received my product quickly and I sm really loving it. My skin is super-sensitive so I was a bit leery. It feels great on my skin and co workers have noticed a difference too!</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C Serum!  Also, not tested on animals.  The serum soaks into your face-at least it did on mine-immediately.  I think it will be great for this winter but also, my skin needs it in summer too.  There is no smell to irritate the nose or eyes.  And the product itself didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes. I think it also mentioned dark circles.  That will be the real test!  THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Natural, organic, no alcohol or parabens. This serum is making my skin more moisturized and brighter looking. My freckles look like it&#x27;s fading and it feels so soft.</li>
