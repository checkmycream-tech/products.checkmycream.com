      <li>I never thought this would smell so good.</li>
      <li>but it still smells really good.</li>
      <li>THIS PERFUME NOT TO MENTION THE GORGEOUS COLLECTOR BOTTLE.</li>
      <li>It smells good when u put ur nose up to the bottle</li>
      <li>I am not to keen on perfumes but i must admit it did have a Good smell to it..  </li>
      <li>so she was very pleased to add this to her collection.</li>
      <li>&quot; One of the BEST in the market today.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this perfume as a gift for my Wife for Mother&#x27;s Day 2014 and she hasn&#x27;t stopped talking about how good it really smells.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the sweet smell of it and the bottle is beautiful!</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna be honest</li>
      <li>The pear stands out the most in this fragrance.</li>
      <li>This perfume made me smile all day and smell good all day too.</li>
      <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t stay on and it comes off even when I just touch the top.</li>
      <li>IF BROKE OFF THE TOP</li>
      <li>To me, this scent is heavier, but I love it.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase when it was 60 something dollars because someone already touched this bottle</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>THE TOP IS BENT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M SURE I&#x27;LL BE BACK FOR MORE!!!</li>
      <li>Was so excited to receive this Perfume!</li>
      <li>and she loved it so much.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE I LOVE UNIQUE THINGS</li>
      <li>this was a gift to me daughter and as she stated &amp;#34; I love it so much Daddy&amp;#34; Thank for such an awesome gift.</li>
      <li>The package came fast and the perfume smells amazing</li>
      <li>This is a very intriguing smell.</li>
      <li>Even though the original is still one of my faves.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this and the special edition to anyone over the original.</li>
      <li>the shrink wrap was not tight fitting and upon opening the box she was stuffed in sideways...</li>
      <li>The perfume wasn&#x27;t reaL.</li>
      <li>but once you spray it smells like straight alcohol.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as Minajesty</li>
      <li>It definitely has a more sweet and muskier smell than Pink Friday</li>
      <li>Plus, this was originally $75.00 on Macy&#x27;s, but on Amazon I only got it for $26.00.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast; I highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
      <li>so I cannot tell how full it actually is</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
      <li>Onkia is my fave and then the special edition of Pink Friday.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little flowery with a strong scent of sweetness.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Nicki Minaj fan and been wanting this for such a long time!</li>
      <li>Clearly this was pre owned... or returned..</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>THEY WON&#x27;T LAST LONG BECAUSE IT&#x27;S A TRUE COLLECTORS ITEM.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely more luxurious than just the average Pink Friday.</li>
      <li>When I saw it was a deluxe version of Pink Friday, I thought it would smell almost exactly like that, but I was so wrong.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t regret in buying this product and actually will buy another one in the near future for her...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty heavy.</li>

<li> less overall</li>
<li> so of course i wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything else</li>
<li> Nicki&#x27;s Pink Friday\\</li>
<li> there was a little spraying in the box, the nozzle was off and the bottle had a tiny scratch on it from the necklace I think but other than that the fragrance</li>
<li> IS THIN SHEETS OF BROWN PAPER</li>
<li> Highly disappointed</li>

    <li> This is a very intriguing smell. It&#x27;s definitely more luxurious than just the average Pink Friday. I would recommend this and the special edition to anyone over the original. Even though the original is still one of my faves. Onkia is my fave and then the special edition of Pink Friday. It&#x27;s a little flowery with a strong scent of sweetness. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Clearly this was pre owned... or returned.. the shrink wrap was not tight fitting and upon opening the box she was stuffed in sideways... her collar bone was chipped on both sides.. the bottle is all gold so I cannot tell how full it actually is but it&#x27;s still pretty heavy. It took 10 days to arrive to me. It was a fragrance net purchase, inside contained 2 perfume samples and a face cream for wrinkles (sample) along with a purple fragrance net lip balm and coupons.. for 26 dollars and no tax it was a good buy for me. But I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase when it was 60 something dollars because someone already touched this bottle</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great! It smells completely different than her other scents. To me, this scent is heavier, but I love it. Shipping was fast; I highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> THE BOX WAS BEAT UP&lt;br /&gt;THE SPRAY NOSSLE IF BROKE OFF THE TOP THE TOP IS BENT AND THE NOSSLE WONT GO BACK ON THE HEAD WONT STAY ON THE NECKLACE WAS ALL MESSED UP AND TANGLED NO PLASTIC WRAP ON IT ON THING PROTECTING IT IS THIN SHEETS OF BROWN PAPER AND I HAVE A VIDEO TO PROVE.

    <li> I&#x27;m gonna be honest there was a little spraying in the box, the nozzle was off and the bottle had a tiny scratch on it from the necklace I think but other than that the fragrance it&#x27;s self is just enchanting and long lasting the bottle is a collectible and I&#x27;m a HUGE NICKI MINAJ fan so of course i wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything else less overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>

    <li> Wow. I never thought this would smell so good. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it so much. She&#x27;s a Minaj fan so she was very pleased to add this to her collection. When I saw it was a deluxe version of Pink Friday, I thought it would smell almost exactly like that, but I was so wrong. It definitely has a more sweet and muskier smell than Pink Friday and I personally prefer it. Plus, this was originally $75.00 on Macy&#x27;s, but on Amazon I only got it for $26.00.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to receive this Perfume! I am a huge Nicki Minaj fan and been wanting this for such a long time! I love the sweet smell of it and the bottle is beautiful!</li>
