      <li>It arrived fast, in perfect condition and didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping fees.</li>
      <li>This is a great tool to clean your bushes.</li>
      <li>but it is great to clean brushes one at a time.</li>
      <li>The best gadget I have tried thus far.  </li>
      <li>None of my makeup products stick to the egg which was a huge relief!</li>
      <li>Works fantastic!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>and i was able to remove stubborn stains from my foundation brushes</li>
      <li>The seller was awesome, I would definitely do business with them again!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love this brush cleaner</li>
      <li>My brushes are so clean and beautiful, really makes a difference when doing my make up!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to wash my makeup brushes more often and this makes it so easy.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I got it because not I have something that I can always keep my brushes clean with.</li>
      <li>BUT it does clean better than with just my palm.</li>
      <li>It easily fits in the palm of my hand so I can still scrub my brushes.  </li>
      <li>the color is exactly as the picture which I really liked.</li>
      <li>this little guy does it the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...</li>
      <li>Great item for keeping your brushed clean.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very important and makes life so much easier!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t stand the fact that I can&#x27;t clean IT, and it remains stained with makeup residue.</li>
      <li>It does clean my brush well</li>
      <li>I just ran my brushes over the front of it with the soapy water and watched it become clean.</li>
      <li>I use dish soap when I clean mine</li>
      <li>Honestly, the shape offers quite some flexibility with what you want to clean depending on the size of the brush.</li>
      <li>It gets all of my brushes squeaky clean quickly and efficiently.  </li>
      <li>This lil brush glove gets all my brushes super clean and it makes cleaning my brushes go by very fast!</li>
      <li>If you have bigger hands I could foresee a fit issue when trying to slip the pod onto more than two fingers, but I think if you just held the pod in your hand instead, you would be fine.</li>
      <li>Overall, very satisfied with seller, price and quality.</li>
      <li>Overall, very satisfied with seller, price and quality.ce.</li>
      <li>Thanks!! 😉</li>
      <li>But again, does what it says as far as cleaning brushes, for sure.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the purchase,</li>
      <li>It absolutely cuts the time it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!</li>
      <li>I liked though that it has those little dots at the end, since they helped me clean thoroughly smaller brushes and make sure that the hairs were free of product.</li>
      <li>I generally use warm to hot water and soft soap to clean off my brushes so as to kill germs and remove leftovers from makeup products.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a faster to way to clean their makeup brushes and it really does leave them super clean!</li>
      <li>when cleaning my brushes, while supporting it with the rest of my fingers.</li>
      <li>it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  </li>
      <li>I used to just rub my brushes back and forth in the palm of my hand, and it would take me about 5 minutes per brush, making sure that I got all the soap and excess water out, and with this, i&#x27;m done in about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cleans my brushes very well!</li>
      <li>You can try using just hot water by itself, or with soap.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s better than cleaning brushed just by hands alone.</li>
      <li>It was a bit smaller than it looked on the picture, but I still love this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many brushes and I don&#x27;t want to store something big</li>
      <li>Works awesome for smaller brushes, but not much area to work with when cleaning my bigger brushes.</li>
      <li>Very convenient, wish ridges were slightly higher</li>
      <li>Like another review says, it doesn&#x27;t really work on large brushes though.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>With a bit of elbow grease and the brush cleaner, you really feel like it does a thorough job.</li>
      <li>It cleans my brushes really well.</li>
      <li>Cleans GF&#x27;s makeup brushes really well.</li>
      <li>Both work really well.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much i needed this till i started using it.  </li>
      <li>than that it cleaned my brushes really well</li>
      <li>I really like this brush cleaner.</li>
      <li>so I can really get rid of build up</li>
      <li>Also, the dots/ridges of the silicon glove helps building a lather with soap a lot easier, and like any washboard don&#x27;t expect it to clean your brushes for you, it only serves as a very nifty surface while you do the work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used this to clean my concealer brushed</li>
      <li>My new obsession!</li>
      <li>This fact, however, doesn&#x27;t make me love the product any less.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s medium size, easy, has the shape of half an egg and quite comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I will more than likely order a larger one soon.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have to take a little longer when washing brushes for blush and foundation, but I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
      <li>i put a little bit of baby shampoo right on the glove and it gets my brushes so clean.</li>
      <li>I got this off of my wishlist, so I was surprised when I got it on my door step, but when I looked at when it was purchased and when it was delivered, it was here in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it was going to be, which was exciting.</li>
      <li>and I must say that even the dirtiest brushes look brand new after I&#x27;ve cleaned them with this.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
      <li>Makes washing my brushes so much easy &amp; cuts time in half would buy for a gift</li>

    <li> Great product and washing and scrubs my brushes nicely without forcing the brush too on too the Finger glove.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Cleans my brushes very well! Affordable, and a great investment!</li>
    <li> It was a bit smaller than it looked on the picture, but I still love this product. It cleaned all my brushes very well even only with water. You can try using just hot water by itself, or with soap. Both work really well. Overall, I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all. I love it and I am glad I got it because not I have something that I can always keep my brushes clean with. Definitely would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I like this item. Until I  stumbled upon it on Amazon.com, I never knew that it existed or even what it was used for. I like it. I will put it to good use and my make-up  brushes will thank me g or it.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. I&#x27;ve been meaning to wash my makeup brushes more often and this makes it so easy. I just used a bit of dish soap and warm water. With a bit of elbow grease and the brush cleaner, you really feel like it does a thorough job.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with my BrushEgg! I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a faster to way to clean their makeup brushes and it really does leave them super clean! Plus it&#x27;s under $5!!</li>

    <li> This is one of the best things that I have ever received for helping me clean my brushes! I got this off of my wishlist, so I was surprised when I got it on my door step, but when I looked at when it was purchased and when it was delivered, it was here in a very timely manner. This lil brush glove gets all my brushes super clean and it makes cleaning my brushes go by very fast! I used to just rub my brushes back and forth in the palm of my hand, and it would take me about 5 minutes per brush, making sure that I got all the soap and excess water out, and with this, i&#x27;m done in about 2 minutes. And with using this, the dry time has also decreased since it&#x27;s really good with getting the excess water out of the brush. I can use all my brushes on this, I don&#x27;t have a problem using my bigger foundation brushes on this. I recommend this, and for 5$ it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> Did a really good job cleaning my brushes.</li>
    <li> I had NO idea that there was an invention to help wash makeup brushes until I received one of these with a makeup brush that I ordered! NOW I wonder how I ever lived without it. It absolutely cuts the time it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more! I used to just wash them over and over until the water ran clear, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and cleans them in no time! I am very impressed and very happy! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! It&#x27;s about time I got one of these! I do have to take a little longer when washing brushes for blush and foundation, but I&#x27;m okay with that, I find washing my brushes to be relaxing. It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it was going to be, which was exciting. If you have a lot of make up brushes you need this.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across a photo of this BrushEgg on IG and I thought I would give it a try since I don&#x27;t want some huge ugly silicon mitten, nor did I want to purchase an expensive brush cleaning mat. I don&#x27;t have many brushes and I don&#x27;t want to store something big so this BrushEgg seemed the perfect fit. It works great, cuts brush cleaning time in half for me and its small enough to just toss in my makup bag. Highly recommend it. And take another look at that price..... 😏</li>
    <li> Every girl needs this I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not as common as nail clippers or tweezers, it&#x27;s very important and makes life so much easier!</li>
    <li> I love this little thing! It literally makes cleaning my makeup brushes less of a chore. I use dish soap when I clean mine so I can really get rid of build up and I must say that even the dirtiest brushes look brand new after I&#x27;ve cleaned them with this. My only caution is makeup can stain this bad boy but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I&#x27;m posting this review on the day I received the product which was the 1st day of the estimated delivery time period. I attached this product to an order with other products so that i can use the free shipping service from amazon (for elligible orders above 35$) and it actually arrived first before anything else.&lt;br /&gt;1. This little product is like a silicon washboard for make-up brushes and sponges. I generally use warm to hot water and soft soap to clean off my brushes so as to kill germs and remove leftovers from makeup products. The material of the silicon finger glove is thick enough yet still flexible so that it wasn&#x27;t affected at all after I tested for the first time by letting hot water run over it for several minutes. Major plus, since i didn&#x27;t want to end up with a product going gummy soft under high temperature due to thin structure.&lt;br /&gt;2. The size of this product allowed me to hold it by one finger (there&#x27;s not much room for two unless you have really small fingers) when cleaning my brushes, while supporting it with the rest of my fingers. But I could also skip that and just hold it in my palm. Overall, it&#x27;s medium size, easy, has the shape of half an egg and quite comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;3. I used the ridges of the product for cleaning make-up brushes and sponges while running them softly perpendicular to the ridges, and the little dots at the end for eye-shadow brushes. Honestly, the shape offers quite some flexibility with what you want to clean depending on the size of the brush. I liked though that it has those little dots at the end, since they helped me clean thoroughly smaller brushes and make sure that the hairs were free of product. Also, the dots/ridges of the silicon glove helps building a lather with soap a lot easier, and like any washboard don&#x27;t expect it to clean your brushes for you, it only serves as a very nifty surface while you do the work.&lt;br /&gt;4. Most importantly, at least for me, I noticed the price. I compared it to other similar products of the same material, shape and function and the one by Hotrose pulls ahead. It&#x27;s only 4.99 $ (currently, at the time of the review) compared to more expensive ones, and as I mentioned in the beginning I ordered it among other products and chose the free shipping service from amazon.com, since this little product is actually elligible for the free shipping service from amazon.com when other similar ones are not, adding quite the cost on such a small simple cleaning product. It arrived fast, in perfect condition and didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping fees. Overall, very satisfied with seller, price and quality.ce.

    <li> Where has this been all my life?? This little egg does wonders, it has cut my brush cleaning time in half. I just love this nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> Totally works! i put a little bit of baby shampoo right on the glove and it gets my brushes so clean. if you are a makeup junkie like i am you totally need one of these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I used this to clean my concealer brushed and I couldn&#x27;t get all the product off of the finger glove after cleaning the brushes. But it&#x27;s better than cleaning brushed just by hands alone.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A MUST FOR EVERYYYY MAKEUP KIT!! Makes cleaning my brushes a breeze</li>
    <li> Not even worth the few dollars I paid for it.  A gimmicky piece of rubber is all this is.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Works very well no need to spend $40 on the big sigma glove this gets the job done just as perfectly !</li>
    <li> This product is great. I absolutely love it. All I need to clean my brushes is a little soapy water (just watered down dawn) and running water. It cleans so well and leaves my brushes soft. I did not need to buy brush cleaner this little guy does it the best. I just ran my brushes over the front of it with the soapy water and watched it become clean. Great product.</li>
    <li> Would&#x27;ve liked it to be a little bigger but other than that it cleaned my brushes really well and it makes washing my brushes a lot easier. It got to my house about a week from when I ordered it and the color is exactly as the picture which I really liked. Thanks!! 😉</li>
    <li> Cleans GF&#x27;s makeup brushes really well.</li>
    <li> My new obsession! This has a great texture to help scrub brushes and works great! I do have to say that it fits somewhat snug on two fingers (I wear a size 7.5 ring on my ring finger and would have to admit I think my fingers are a little on the fluffy side). It&#x27;s still comfortable to use, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as tight as it is. None of my makeup products stick to the egg which was a huge relief!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! So happy I bought it. Like another review says, it doesn&#x27;t really work on large brushes though.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush cleaner. the only downside is that it&#x27;s so small that i cant even put one finger comfortably. It does clean my brush well and i was able to remove stubborn stains from my foundation brushes but it does stain over time. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and a half now and the cleaner is now almost the same color as my foundation. It still cleans my brush properly but the stains just makes the cleaner look dirty and and unhygienic.</li>
    <li> One of those things you don&#x27;t truly realize you need until you&#x27;re using it &amp; then you&#x27;re ashamed you haven&#x27;t had it all along!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it and it functions fine ... I just wish it was a tad bit bigger. It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable holding it when I&#x27;m trying to clean 20+ brushes BUT it does clean better than with just my palm. If you&#x27;re looking to clean a few brushes here and there then this product would work.</li>
    <li> The seller was awesome, I would definitely do business with them again! Very fast shipping, careful packaging, and they even followed up with an email after the item was delivered to ask how the product was working out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup scrubber pod works like a dream! If you have bigger hands I could foresee a fit issue when trying to slip the pod onto more than two fingers, but I think if you just held the pod in your hand instead, you would be fine. It is a very nice alternative to the Sigma brush gloves, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much i needed this till i started using it.  I tried cleaning my brushes in a cup with water, or brush through my hand and rinse but it would take forever.  This seems to get the makeup off pretty well and with less time.</li>
    <li> Love this brush cleaner</li>
    <li> Works well cleaning brushes. Can&#x27;t stand the fact that I can&#x27;t clean IT, and it remains stained with makeup residue. I have tried everything, including running it through the dishwasher, it just ends up looking gross. But again, does what it says as far as cleaning brushes, for sure.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Cleaned several brushes and a small amount of time.</li>
    <li> My brushes are so clean and beautiful, really makes a difference when doing my make up!</li>
    <li> Great item for keeping your brushed clean.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning my makeup brushes. Yes, it s a little on the small side, but it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Really gets the makeup out that is deep within the brush.  Good investment.</li>
    <li> The Brush Egg is so amazing!  It works hard so I don&#x27;t have to when it comes to cleaning my makeup brushes.  It gets all of my brushes squeaky clean quickly and efficiently.  Totally worth the purchase, and I would buy it again and again.  My only qualm is that it is definitely a bit snug on two fingers, especially if you have a lot of brushes to clean.  This fact, however, doesn&#x27;t make me love the product any less.  It easily fits in the palm of my hand so I can still scrub my brushes.  I definitely recommend that you buy this!</li>
    <li> Works well with smaller brushes rather than bigger brushes. I&#x27;m content with the outcome of the cleanliness of my brushes</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to clean your bushes. A little small but it is great to clean brushes one at a time.</li>
    <li> I like it. It cleans my brushes really well.</li>
    <li> I love concept of this, just wish it was a little bigger. It doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers as well, slips off. Works awesome for smaller brushes, but not much area to work with when cleaning my bigger brushes. Works otherwise though, serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
    <li> The product is working great.</li>
    <li> i wish i would of got a bigger one and paid a little extra but other than that i love it works great i use baby soap on it with olive oil and it works.</li>
    <li> The best gadget I have tried thus far.  I purchased the smallest one and it still did the job.  I will more than likely order a larger one soon.  This is truly a must have.</li>
    <li> Very convenient, wish ridges were slightly higher</li>
