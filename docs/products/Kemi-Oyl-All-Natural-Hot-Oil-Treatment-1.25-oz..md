    <li> My hair went completely bald in some spots and this rejuvenated every inch of my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells really bad and does NOT wash out easily! I didn&#x27;t use a whole lot and 4 washes later, my hair still has that gross smell. YUCK!</li>
    <li> The experience was great.  It arrived in a very timely manner and I plan to get great use out of this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love how the oyl makes my hair feel.My niece advised me of this product. I will order some more.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this product and recommened it to me. I like it.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today and used it, I saw a difference right away. I have naturally curly hair and it becomes a bit frizzed, this oil made my hair soft and smooth. I will definitely buy more of this product, It also smells great and it arrived faster than I expected it to.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what i was looking for I would re-order this items when my current supply runs out. KUDOS..</li>
    <li> I first started using Kemi oil over 10 years ago.  Its smells good.  Makes hair silky.  Quality product worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product looking for a solution to my very dry scalp.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe I misued it, but the I could not get the oil out of my hair.  I took 1/2 dozen washes, including using Dawn dish soap...all the washing defeated the purpose of the oil treatment to begin with.</li>
    <li> cant find this at stores anymore, i love this product, I use it to straighten my hair so it wont fry out and I love it thanks</li>
    <li> This can be a little heavy in my hair and make it look greasy. A very little goes a long way and def start from the bottom. This stuff lasts forever because you only need a little bit each time. Bonus- it smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Kemi-Oyl and was very excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> hair seemed the same after using</li>
    <li> This is a great product for black hair!  It is no longer sold in my local area so I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s available online.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I used to have this years ago and thought they had quit making it. As always, Amazon has products that no one else has!</li>
    <li> I love Kemi oyl! It leaves my hair manageable. A must have to put on those dry ends! A little goes along way! type 4b/4c</li>
    <li> This is not the kemi-oyl I remember as a teen! The smell is not as fragrant as it used to be, the fragrance and absorbancy is what drew me to this product in the first place! The consistency seems to be equivalent, And  the color is exact. I Just don&#x27;t see this being the same product I purchased repeatedly long ago. Must say farewell. lol :(</li>
    <li> My daughter is the one that told me about this product.  I use it on my granddaughters hair and even my own.  When I wash our hair after semi drying our hair I put some Kemi-Oyl on the hair.  Then I continue blow drying and the hair comes out softer.  Here&#x27;s where the Kemi-Oyl really works....  After the hair is completely dry I put more Kemi on the hair...not alot because you&#x27;ll end up with a greasy build up and the hair feels yucky.  After putting more on I then flat iron the hair.  The hair comes out as if it was relaxed.  I&#x27;ve not used a relaxer in my hair for over 6 months now and when I use the Kemi-Oyl as I&#x27;ve stated my hair come out awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely replenishes the shine and moisture in African American hair.</li>
