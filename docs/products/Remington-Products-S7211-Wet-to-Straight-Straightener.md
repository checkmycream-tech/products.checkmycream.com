<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works really well especially when you&#x27;re in a rush</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever. Cuts styling time by more than one half. My hair is a few inches below my shoulders. From wet to dry and styled takes about 20 minutes. With practice, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster. Be sure to read the directions for usage tips and temperature setting guide. Hair comes out great and stays straight. I suggest using a heat protection product with it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flat iron by far! Hair stays straight for a long time and the shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works great, no problems</li>
    <li> love it works awesomely</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever used.  Works very quickly and the width is perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> article of excellent quality</li>
    <li> My hair is actually staying straight and without any added hair products. I love this straightener!</li>
    <li> I have this one I&#x27;ve had it since 2013 or 14 and this is the only one that will do the job quick fir my hair and it leaves it smooth ☺. My hair is very thick dry and very very very curly like it looks like a curling wand curled my hair and you were to brush it and it still does the job</li>
    <li> I owned this a year ago and it was sadly stolen. I bought another from this seller knowing exactly what to expect from the product. No, it doesn&#x27;t completely dry AND straighten your hair. Yes, it&#x27;s called Wet to Straight. It does have vents on the top panel so that when you hit spots of your hair that are more wet, it sizzles a little and steam rises from the vents. You can&#x27;t just hop out of the shower with sopping wet hair and straighten it with this and expect to be done and go about your day. You do have to dry your hair (mostly) first. If it&#x27;s a little bit damp, it does a good job of taking the moisture away and straightening. Overall, if used as a regular straightener, it will satisfy your needs, as it does mine.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to try ironing my very damp, long, prone to superfrizz hair when I got this in the mail today (but what the heck). I went right for it and I was pleasantly surprised. Obviously no one wants to hear the sound a straightener makes when ironing wet hair but be not afraid! Here I am some 30 minutes later with super soft, shiny and straight hair. So happy!!!! I used an ISO prior to this one and it honestly doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as nice as this iron does.</li>
    <li> Arrived way early and works awesome</li>
    <li> Excellent product..fast service</li>
    <li> I tried my sister&#x27;s remington wet/dry straightener and loved it! Had to have one myself. Adjustable heat option is fantastic. Simply love this product. Thanks Remington.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener it saves me so much time. It does sizzle when you straighten your hair but it&#x27;s not ruining your hair. If you put your hair in a pony tail and then straighten your ponytail it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
    <li> I live in Chicago and went to Florida, meeting my best friend there last month. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the sudden cold/dry to hot/humid climate change. My hair was curling and frizzing really bad with the warm humid air and for several days I walked around with my hair all over the place. Hair spray just made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;Before I left my hairdresser had said I could try using a straightening iron but I hadn&#x27;t remembered to pack mine, which I hardly ever need in Chicago. However my friend had this Remington wet to straight product- which totally came to the rescue. Best of all, you can use it on wet hair. I was able to blow dry my hair mostly, and then use the Remington while my hair was still damp. I was amazed- it totally flattened my hair, leaving it looking silky, shiney, and straight, beautifully shaped, and there were no little frizzy pieces peeling away nor did it curl at all!&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this a few times now, but the results are a 180 from how my hair used to look in humid warm weather. I am taking this with me everywhere I travel from now on. Also the straightener uses some steam I think to help keep from burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used this straightener in conjunction with Aveda smooth infusion soothing masque, which I applied as a conditioner after shampooing. The product says it reduces volume and adds shea butter for conditioning. It really does the trick. My friend also brought this product along. She lives in Houston and has to deal with hot humid weather all the time LOL. I always wondered how her hair looked so good. Now I know!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it everyday and recommend it to friends!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and I hate drying my hair before I can straighten it.</li>
    <li> My second one.  Love.</li>
    <li> My hair is little dry. Before using this model of Remington, I used HSI which worked lot better for me. After using this model of remington my hair turned more frizzy, dry and weak..!</li>
    <li> I love it, Although one must be carefull when using it frequently because my hair dried a bit, Just not for daily use</li>
    <li> Not recommended for extremely curly, POC hair. Should&#x27;ve known it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> If I could give this straightener negative stars I would. I have thick, curly hair and all this did was make it feel like straw after I had straightened my hair. Most other hair straighteners I use leave my hair silky, soft and smooth. But this breaks my cuticle and makes my hair so dry and strawlike. It takes me almost 3 hours to straighten my hair with this and it doesn&#x27;t even make it look nice at the end of it all ! Am looking for a much better hair straightener. Am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! it leaves my hair perfectly straight...</li>
    <li> I bought this updated version of the same (2012) make and model. My friend borrowed my old one and fell in love with it, so I gave it to her. I am happy I did. This updated version has ceramic plates and I can&#x27;t begin to describe the difference in the way my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, while the ceramic plates themselves get very hot, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel scorched to the touch because of the way the heat is transferred to your hair. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; it or cause a burnt smell. Second, depending on your hair type, you may need only one pass-over per section of hair straightened. Third, it creates a glossy shine that is difficult to achieve even with the use of products. Fourth, it creates a salon-quality body that lasts the entire day. With a flick of the wrist, you can also create curls. I know people who spend hours and a fortune to get their hair half as beautiful as this flat iron can get it in about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note, while I used the 2012 version on my damp hair with great success, I have not tried this one on damp hair. Hair type &#x3D; mixed/bi-racial, length &#x3D; very long.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!!! I have the one inch and wanted to try the two inch..do much better!!</li>
    <li> i received a broken device. it blew up after trying to use it.. i plugged it into 127v socket and still problem was worse.</li>
    <li> product as expected, delivered on time</li>
    <li> Love this straightner! My hubby bought me the Chi for valentine&#x27;s day and I really liked it but it doesn&#x27;t have temp settings and I have to wait for my hair to dry or use a blow dryer. I tried this out at my mom&#x27;s and fell IN LOVE! It&#x27;s super affordable and holds up very well over time!</li>
    <li> Package was intact. Product took less than 2 min to reach max temp of 420 degrees. Straightened hair as it should without burning. Easy to adjust control knobs. Lightweight, comfortable grip, overall five star for the price! Absolutely would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works fine but is too wide for my hair. This is not a good product for short hair. You have to be very careful not to get burned by the steam when using it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener; however, it loses a star because it is not 2 inches, as stated in the product description. It is only 1 3/4 inches.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener, had one for myself from the store and bought this one for my daughter since she was always using mine. Heats great, straightens quickly.</li>
    <li> The original Wet 2 Straight was an excellent product that lasted me over 5 years. While I would not use it on soaking wet hair, it did save time in that I didn&#x27;t have to spend as much time blow drying - I have extremely thick hair that takes forever to blow dry, so being able to blow dry my hair until it&#x27;s damp and then start straightening it from there was a huge plus. It was one of the very few straighteners that got hot enough to give my hair that sleek, straight look. I just replaced my old one with this one after the heating element finally went wonky, and while the model looks a bit different, I hope to see the same great results. If this product is anything like the older model, it will not only provide you with great results, but will remain functional throughout years of daily use/abuse!</li>
    <li> Awesome product works wonders.</li>
    <li> The Remington Wet to Straight Straightener works very well and is easy to use.  It did a great job of straightening my naturally curly hair, and didn&#x27;t leave any of the weird creases in my hair after I used it.  This can be used on wet or dry hair without causing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this hair product, since it lets me straighten my hair into a sleek style, without taking too much time.  The only thing I&#x27;d change, and it&#x27;s really minor, is the heat setting; it would be easier and more convenient if &#x27;dry&#x27;, &#x27;damp&#x27;, and &#x27;wet&#x27; were marked beside the numbers on the heat setting dial instead of me having to look them up on the instructions.  Other than that, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Awesome , even got it on time!</li>
    <li> Great product. Got it super fast.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the one inch flat iron I replaced and I see nothing wrong with its functionality, but the green metal plate is just a hair over 1 5/8 inches, NOT 2 inches.  I don&#x27;t see that little detail anywhere in the listing, and it is very annoying that I didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was buying.  I went back and measured my one inch iron and it is indeed one inch.  How about just being honest about the dimensions?  You can see in the photo that the entire width of the iron isn&#x27;t even 2 inches.</li>
    <li> This is the third Wet 2 Straight hair iron I&#x27;ve owned - all 2 inches, but the first one was the original black &amp; silver one, and the second being the purple curved one. I loved the original, but found that the second one hurt my hand to use and took longer to straighten. This straightener, however, works quicker on my dripping wet hair (one time over a wet section and it&#x27;s dry and straight), makes my hair silky smooth, and perfectly pin straight but still retains the natural volume. It has a comfortable feel in my hand, and looks sleek. I could not be happier with this straightener.</li>
    <li> I found the wet/dry hair straightener to be adequate for my hair which is very fine and very little friz.  I towel dried the hair and then waited for some of the wetness to dissipate.  Using the straightener on semi-damp hair it did complete the drying process with a smooth, straight texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand my daughter has thick, wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  She did not like the product at all.  First, you have to put the temperature in the 400 degree temperature to get it to dry.  I have been told by hair stylist that any temp over 400 is very damaging to hair.  The result on her hair was more frizzzies.  I think it did do the job it claimed to do which was dry and straighten with one product.  I found this very handy on my vacation when I only had to pack one hair styling device.  There are some advantages if you have fine hair that straightens easy, but be careful you don&#x27;t burn/fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracey</li>
    <li> As someone with curly hair, I like to straighten my hair... The thing is, I&#x27;m not a fan of waiting for my hair to dry, and I don&#x27;t like using a blow dryer. I have very fine hair, so I&#x27;d rather keep the heat damage to a minimum. When I saw this straightener, I was stoked to try it out! I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to dry anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, make sure you point the holes on the side AWAY from your face. Otherwise you&#x27;ll get a face full of steam, which doesn&#x27;t feel so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it took FOREVER to straighten my hair. My hair is very fine, so I can&#x27;t imagine what someone with thick hair would have to go through to finish this process. It&#x27;s faster to use a blow dryer with my original straightener (it would help if I were to invest in a blow dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it got the job done. It works well, albeit not very fast. I&#x27;ll stick to my standard method, but I&#x27;ll keep this on hand for when I need to get it done quickly and can&#x27;t wait for my hair to dry.</li>
    <li> When you have a 14 year old female in the house, a good straightner is a must (so I am told) tried several and this get the thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Remington Wet to Straight Straightener and I love it! I decided to buy this model to save me time getting ready in the morning, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about blow drying my hair.  Blow drying hair and straightening it right after can leave your hair damaged and brittle. Eliminating the blow drying will help keep your hair smooth and healthy! The wet to straight aspect of the straighter makes it so your hair doesn&#x27;t have to be completely dry in order to straighten it. Some people may be skeptical about that feature, but it actually works really well! The only downside is that your hair can&#x27;t be completely wet. It needs to have air dried first for about 15-20 minutes depending on the thickness of your hair. It also has a little light indicating when it is ready to straighten wet hair, which is really helpful because it needs to be at a certain temperature  Another thing I really liked about this product is that it heats up really fast. The ceramic plates make it so it can get to 420 degrees in only 30 seconds, which is another time saving feature! You can adjust the heat because when your hair is dry, it doesn&#x27;t need to be as hot, which is also very healthy for your hair.  I also really prefer the 2-inch to the 1-inch straightener. My old straightener was 1-inch and I&#x27;ve noticed that the 2-inch cuts my straightening time in half! If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, efficient straightener, I would highly recommend this one at a low price of only $24.99!</li>
    <li> The best straightener that I&#x27;ve tried so far. It can straighten my waist length waves in less than 10 minutes. For as well as it works, it&#x27;s really affordable. I haven&#x27;t tried it on sopping wet hair but that&#x27;s not something I would normally do anyway. It works on damp hair which is wonderful in itself! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Just got this and I am loving it so far. It makes my hair shiny after running it through and I can do some lovely curling which is a plus!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for-- overall a good purchase. Definitely worth it, straightener is easy and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for the price!</li>
    <li> My wife says it does a good job and it does what it is supposed to do, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Now I will look every day a wonderful hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well. No burns or injuries due to the proper design. Good product</li>
    <li> Original product, the best</li>
    <li> Works wonderful. I can straighten my hair in half the time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had. It feels so smooth while straightening your hair, and feels so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s ok, but I had one before that was better.</li>
    <li> this is a great straightener! This is our 4th wet to straight. One went with the married daughter. One went with the college daughter. One stays at camp and one for mom.</li>
    <li> Im a caribean curly hair, and this iron make my hair realy and healthy air style. Best product for a low price. Jus may be come with an iron spray to protect the hair.</li>
    <li> This will always be the best hair straightener ever. I prefer this over the $80 one I had that just broke.</li>
    <li> good product gets the work done. Not just dry hair but also good on wet hair..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a wet to dry straightener work as well as this one. This is actually the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first one I had for almost 2 years. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because if you have your hair towards the top of the iron, it pulls your hair. I&#x27;ve learned how to make sure my hair is at the bottom...but it&#x27;s an inconvenience. This is something they really need to fix. I bought a second one because it really is the best wet to dry I&#x27;ve yet to see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year now.  I use it on wet hair, and dry hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with damage in spite of all the people who said it would damage my hair.  My hair actually seems to be in better condition than it was before I started using it.  The plates have 30 heat settings.  I typically use the hottest when I&#x27;m using it on wet hair.  I use the mid settings for damp and dry hair.  I actually prefer using this on wet hair.  I&#x27;ve found that for some reason it takes better, holds better, and is less frizzy than if I use the strightener on dry hair.  My hair is very fine but there is a lot of.  My hair is is also wavy in some places and straight in others so it&#x27;s a quick and easy way to do my hair.  I can keep nice and fresh feeling by using this intead of a blowdryer.  I usually get dandriff from using a blolw dryer, but this bad boy works wonders without having to worry about dandriff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better flat-ironing straighteners but surely not for this price. I loved the thickness of it, I tend to prefer it thick and this one (the 2inch) has the perfect size. As a preference, I straighten my hair when it&#x27;s already dry, but I tried it wet for the sake of the review and it worked perfectly fine. My hair is thick and curly and I flat-iron it with protective products on so my hair looks better so the straightener tends to get a little dirty. This was very easy to clean and heats up really fast. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for an affordable one!</li>
    <li> Only problem is it doesn&#x27;t tell you what the temperature is for each heat setting.... anyone know?</li>
    <li> This product was great quality and just what I expected. It works great</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Love this! Altho the side vents can burn you if you&#x27;re not careful, because of the vapor. I rate it 4 stars because it&#x27;s missing and automatic turnoff option.</li>
    <li> Best straightener, and i don&#x27;t like to write review. However,  I recommend this 100%</li>
    <li> This product met and exceeded my expectations. I was a little hesitant about a product that claimed to dry your hair and straighten it all at once, without causing your hair to look frizzy or dry. However, I have been extremely happy with the results each time I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;One morning I was running very late. I have long hair (falling several inches more than halfway down my back) and figured this is never going to dry and straighten my hair in less than 10 minutes and have my hair still look good. This was the first time I decided to try it. Well, I was wrong. It came out looking great! It was smooth, shiny, and soft. And this is the result I get each time I use it. And it stays that way all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started putting my hair in a ponytail because I hated to blow dry and then straighten my hair. I&#x27;m pretty simple with my morning routine. I like to be able to get ready in 1/2 hour or less. I find myself wearing my hair in a pony tail less because this really does cut my hair styling time in half. And it looks great and the results last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution. It does get extremely hot so be careful when using it. That did concern me at first because I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. However, I have not noticed any damage at all and I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated, my hair is several inches past the mid-point of my back and is not super thin, but isn&#x27;t thick either. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s between thin and medium but closer to medium (on a scale of very thin, thin, thin-medium, medium, medium-thick, thick, very thick), so a thin-medium. I like in New York where winters are dry and summers can be humid. I have been using straighteners, in general, for about 10 years now. This is my first wet 2 dry straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some reviewers noted, depending on your hair type, you may need more than one pass. This didn&#x27;t concern me or surprise me because I often have to do that with a regular straightener and this one is both drying and straightening so, to be honest, I kind of expected it. Also, people use them differently. It depends on how long you hold the iron as you move it down your hair. Unlike others, I did not have a problem with it gripping and holding my hair tight in between the plates but I can see how maybe someone with very thin hair could have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I really liked is the fact that the control is on the inside of the straightener. I have had so many where the temp gauge or the on/off switch are on the outside, so when you grip the handles to straighten your hair, you bump the controls all the time! It sounds minor but can be very frustrating when it keeps happening. Therefore, this was a major positive for me, as well as the fact that it was a dial so you could really fine-tune the temperature. The product is lightweight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other claims made on the page ...&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;You can actually feel the steam vents working.&lt;br /&gt;You really can use it on wet (not even damp) hair.&lt;br /&gt;There are a large number of settings on the dial. It might take a few tries to find the one you like best for your hair style and type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for some reason my opinion changes as time goes on, I will update my review. But for now, if you want a straightener that is a reasonable price, saves times, and works on wet hair, then you will be very satisfied with this product. I highly recommend giving it a try.straightening so, to be honest, I kind of expected it. Also, people use them differently. It depends on how long you hold the iron as you move it down your hair.

    <li> My hair is usually super dry, frizzy and curled up everywhere after I took a bath, woke up in the morning, or after a run.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and it worked out great. I only needed to straighten my hair once after I took a bath and sleep, woke up in the morning with my hair completely okay, still straight when it usually not (with previous flat irons I used). There may be a few frizz and mess here and there, straightening for like a minute would be a-okay!&lt;br /&gt;The hair lasted for like 4 days XD YES!!&lt;br /&gt;I know applying too much heat on my hair isn&#x27;t a good idea, but with product, it helped me limit my time flat ironing. It dropped from 6-7 times a week to like 2-3 times. My hair isn&#x27;t the shiny, silky and perfectly straight naturally type, so not using a flat iron would be a disaster for me.&lt;br /&gt;But I like the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian by the way, and I don&#x27;t use this product when my hair is wet, even though it is designed to work that way. I don&#x27;t like the idea of putting heat on wet hair so yeah...</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my order and the product is so effective.</li>
    <li> Came the very next day: undamaged and works amazingly! I love that it&#x27;s quiet (my other straightener made loud noises) and heats up super hot super quickly. I loooooooove how quickly it works. I&#x27;ve never had straighter hair before in my life. Sincerely, Miss Frizzle</li>
    <li> PRODUCT OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, FULFILLED WITH MY REQUEST AND COVERED MY EXPECTATIONS, EXCELLENT ATTENTION AND TIMELY DELIVERY, THANKS. ENRIQUE ARMANDO MARTINEZ FROM MARACAIBO-VENEZUELA.</li>
    <li> good quality everithing works ok</li>
