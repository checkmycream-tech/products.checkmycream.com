<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So easy to use and no pinching!  YES!!!</li>
    <li> Love this curler!! so much better than my old one, it&#x27;s very springy and curls my lashes great! The great colors are a perfect touch!</li>
    <li> This works great, it is lightweight and I keep in it in my travel bag so I can look hot on the go ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this curler a few day but so far I love it.  The only thing I would change would be to make the thumb holes a little bit larger.</li>
    <li> Wow I love this eyelash curler. It works great and it does not pinch me or hurt me at all like so many others I&#x27;ve tried.  I was skeptical at first but so glad that it lives up to its advertisement.  Easy to hold and it only takes a few seconds to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I loved my new eye curler! I would totally recommend it to my friends. Plus it looks way better than the ones in the store.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lash curler that I&#x27;ve had. I love the design. I don&#x27;t like the old school metal ones that your lashes get stuck in and ripped out sometimes. This one is smooth and easy to use. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great! It doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid and make me tear up like the usual ones do! This gives my lashes a nice curl without heat...although for a more dramatic look, heat is the way to go. I really like is the design and size of it. My current eyelash curler was tiny but was the best thing I had found to date...well, not anymore! I love that it comes with a replacement pad, that can be very easily switched out. This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Was expecting more of this product. I have thin lashes &amp; curler doesn&#x27;t.t grab on to as well as cheaper product.</li>
    <li> Really love this eyelash curler. The extra pad is is great to have.  Also love that there is a latch so the curler stays closed when not in use. It doesn&#x27;t pinch and isn&#x27;t too heavy, fits nicely in your hand.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Really like this Eyelash curler, the last one I purchased was the Tarte &amp;#34;picture perfectâ„¢ eyelash curler &amp; deluxe lights, camera, lashesâ„¢ mascara&amp;#34; I like this one WAY better. It also comes with a replacement pad, and care/usage recommendations. Comparable in price to the Tarte one, minus the mini mascara... in my opinion this one is WAY better.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Perfect for my eyelashes</li>
    <li> I ordered my new curler about a week and a half ago and received it in the mail today. First off I have to say I love the colors. Black and pink are one of my favorite combos. The curler comes with a plastic pouch, an instruction booklet, and a second cushion pad for the curler. It was very easy to grasp tho the clasp itself is much wider than other curlers I&#x27;ve used for me tho this isn&#x27;t a problem and I have relatively small hands. I also liked the compactness of the curler and how it came with a holder to keep the clasp together. The curler creates gorgeous height for my already long lashes and does so without ANY pinching of skin or lashes. The customer service is also great, it&#x27;s obvious they take pride in their product. I would definitely recommend this curler for anyone looking for an affordable comfortable to use and cute makeup tool.</li>
    <li> High quality.  Work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST to your make-up collection!  I just love love love this lash curler.  It lives up to its claim....&amp;#34;pinch &amp; pain free.&amp;#34;  I can&#x27;t believe how comfortable it is to hold and use too!  I can curl my lashes in a jiffy, unlike before when I used to get extra cautious for the fear of pinching my eye.  The quality is very good and comes with an extra rubber and a clear case.  I just know this curler will last me for a really long time.  Definitely a great buy for the price.  Their customer service is also supurb.  They sent me an email asking for my satisfaction and assured me that they can be reached anytime!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and because my eyes are to small, I have it to a friend who loves it. Customer Service is stellar - I wrote to let themknow mthe plastic package was slit open (perhaps a return or box cutter mishap?) and asking for a smaller size (it isn&#x27;t made smaller); they generously refunded my purchase &amp; told me to keep the product, which I was not expecting!</li>
    <li> This curler works really well. I usually buy a revlon or similar one from walmart but this one was worth a few extra bucks. It gives a great curl that seems to last a little longer than the others.</li>
    <li> nice color and size, but does not curl lashes</li>
    <li> Decent and doesn&#x27;t pinch, but my old Shiseido eyelash curler still does a better job curling my lashes.</li>
    <li> Great deal for this product! Also, great product and service! So much better than the cheap imitations, thanks!</li>
    <li> great quality awesome product fast shipping love it !!!!!</li>
    <li> This gets a solid, &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  It is actually the first curler I&#x27;ve used that *does* pinch.  The holes on the handle are pretty small, so if you don&#x27;t have thin fingers, you might have an issue.  The plastic clip to hold it closed in makeup bags broke two days after I got it.  It does give a nice, smooth curl and the customer service is seriously amazing.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use the handle is rubbery to have more control it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands. This is my first time using one of these it was super easy. Comes with a bag to put it in. Also an replacement pad.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curler!! Heating it with the blow dryer adds a more dramatic look! And the black and hot pink makes it just look fun to use!:) Cant recommend it enough!!</li>
    <li> Great item just i expected</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Works great on her short lashes. Nicely coated with rubber so your not putting metal up to your eye.It curled her lashes and made them look more noticeable.She has very short light colored lashes. After using the DELUXE Eyelash Curler her lashes look great. I would recommend this for light haired woman with lash problems.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler itself is very cute. However, the eyelash curler that I received have some sharp ends on the two sides which would hurt my eyelids whenever I put it close enough to curl my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really wonderful curler. This is the best one I ever had, and the seller is very nice.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for 3 days now but love it!!! It doesn&#x27;t pinch...or pull my lashes out whatsoever. I was wondering why my eyes looked so good this week and the curler is why! I dont even need eyeliner! Give it a try :)</li>
    <li> Received it today and tried it out. Happy to say that I like this curler and it doesn&#x27;t tug or pinch my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the insta-curler and I also got one for my sister. I am&lt;br /&gt;so pleased with them, I am  telling all my friends where to buy them. She said these were the best she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;A great product at a great price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this curler at all. It&#x27;s a must have for your makeup accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much&lt;br /&gt;Best regards&lt;br /&gt;Becky</li>
    <li> Stylish lash curler; works well without heat-but instantly works if you heat it with the hair dryer. Would have given 5 starts except the way the mechanism works, I&#x27;ve pinched my skin if I&#x27;m not careful. Nice product; would recommend!</li>
    <li> It is ok product. It doesn&#x27;t work well on my eyelashes. I was so surprised other reviewer give it 5 star. It is really a ok product I won&#x27;t buy Again or recommend to other people</li>
    <li> I love it. It works so much better than my old one. It showed up so quickly and the seller was so great and helpful.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the positive reviews and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone. !!!</li>
    <li> Love the packaging! And it works really well with my short asian lashes.</li>
    <li> Super product!  Worked great!</li>
    <li> My first time ever using a an eyelash curler and I love it. It isnt cheaply made and it&#x27;s easy to use. I love the color of it and it doesnt look boring like the ones found in the store!</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute best eyelash curler on the market. It does not pinch or pull your eyelids or lashes and does such an amazing job that you don&#x27;t even need those gunky eyelash primers. I have straight eyelashes that require an eyelash curler to add curl and this product is amazing. A++++</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! goooooood!!!</li>
    <li> This review is for those who have short eyelash like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I dont see anything different compared to Drugstore curler.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get use to the feel, but now that I have, I love it. It&#x27;s gentle on the lashes and curls nicely without pulling</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Yes I received the Instacurler yesterday and so far I am amazed! I tried it without heating it and it curled my lashes and they looked extended!!. I can only imagine what they will look like if i heat the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the chance to try this product.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works great. It is comfortable to use and is gentle on your lashes.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME! Very sturdy, and well made. High quality. I was going to buy one of those expensive, name brand eyelash curlers, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It works perfectly, and honestly I enjoy looking at it. Love the colors. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and customer service...incredible. I&#x27;ve never experienced such a high level of customer service before. Gives me faith in the company, and as such has earned them a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as my 30 yr. old eye lash curler that I finally replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Some things don&#x27;t get better.</li>
    <li> I love the Insta-Curler; it does a great job curling my lashes. My only wish is that I&#x27;d like the curler to be a color other than black.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s impossible to see my (black) lashes against it, so placement is a little difficult. Any color -- hot pink, green, blue -- would allow people with black or light brown lashes to see better. I love the trick about using the blow dryer on the pads to curl the lashes more. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my now favorite accessories</li>
    <li> I received my curler and I am very, very pleased. It came in perfect shape, and it works perfectly! More comfortable and easy to use than any other curler I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product! Customer for life!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I definitely noticed the difference from the store eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve bought and this one. I get much more lift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried eyelash curlers in the past but always ended up tossing them out because they would ultimately frustrate me and get tossed out.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this one a shot because of the design and after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands-down, the best curler I&#x27;ve tried! It isn&#x27;t bulky or clunky or awkward in my hand like some. I love that there is a replaceable cushion AND it comes with an extra set. Also I really like the little bag for storing it, keeping it safe from my makeup and my makeup safe from it in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it with heat yet, but haven&#x27;t felt the need to as it works great as is. With other curlers I always ended up pinching or pulling lashes while trying to get ready in the mornings, and I haven&#x27;t experienced anything like that with these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this again, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Product works great! I don&#x27;t even have to curl the curler and it works great.</li>
    <li> This curler is great. I love it.</li>
    <li> Does not curl.... I wish I can get return it.</li>
    <li> Awesome eyelash curler! Didn&#x27;t pinch at all! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! Not only is the color cool looking but it works so well! And doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids like other ones I&#x27;ve had in the past do. Love it!</li>
    <li> Seriously loooove this eyelash curler! It does not pull or pinch my eyelids AT ALL and it also curls them wonderfully! Will be ordering another for my sister!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a big difference in this and what I&#x27;m used to buying in my local beauty supply store. It does it&#x27;s job but I will go back to my regular Revlon curler when this wears out as I think that one curls just a little more quickly. I seem to have to hold this in place longer and go over my lashes more. All in all it&#x27;s pretty good but I&#x27;m a little let down by the hype.</li>
    <li> For one dollar trust me it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> i was like so excited to but this product a long time ago and now i have the chance to use it. Its literally perfect, better than any other eyelash curler ive ever used, including chanel, lancome and many other expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;Every cent is worth it!</li>
    <li> I item was well packaged.  So far I like this eyelash curler then most of the other ones I have used.  I really curls the lashes and it doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes together after applying mascara.  It also doesn&#x27;t pull on your lashes, so far i&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I admit, this product took a little getting used to for me. I&#x27;ve had such troubles finding a good lash-curler for my thin, delicate lashes as of late. I had read/heard back in the 80s that heating up the curler helps and I&#x27;m glad they give that advise - it&#x27;s true! It&#x27;s probably the most  comfortable curler I have ever used and I even purchased one for my daughter. I wanted to give it a few weeks to be sure I continued to like it and that it held up, which it absolutely has.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the curler</li>
    <li> The INSTA-CURLER works perfectly! Also, the packaging was great and the curler is super cute and easy to use. Compared to other eyelash curlers that I have used, this one is definitely the best because of how amazingly it curls my lashes! I am really happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in 30 years based on a painful experience as a teenager.  I tried this for the first time today and - voila! - my lashes are curled!</li>
    <li> I used the curler this morning for the first time. I thought it did a great job. It was smooth and easy to get all my lashes in there without feeling like I would pinch off the lid! Thanks for making a great product.</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curler ever. I was very skeptical about purchasing it, now I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I was quite amazed by the quality of this eyelash curler. I own Tarte, Shu umera and Clinique which are all priced around 20+ dollars. This curler is comoarable to my high end ones. Packaging is very nice and the structure is very sturdy. Loving it.</li>
    <li> Great curler. Arrived on time and its very smooth. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes like other metal ones do.</li>
    <li> This curler is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  It does not pinch my eye lids like most other curlers I used did.  The seller is very communicative and friendly.  I highly recommend this curler.  You will love it.  It looks so classy and lovely to look at too.  I hope they&#x27;ll never discontinue this curler.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the result!</li>
    <li> I love this curler!  It is so much better than the old curler that I&#x27;ve had for probably 15 years.  I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference a good curler could make.  I love using this with heat, as recommended in the instructions.  It really does make a difference.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with pinching, and the curler is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> The quality and the result are both excellent</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed this eyelash curler. Besides the fact that I love the colors, I really like the cushion grip on the handles. I have fibro and really sensitive fingers and these handles are so easy on my fingers and easy to use. I like the pinky rest with cushion too!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler in the world! I won&#x27;t be buying any other brand. They won&#x27;t let you down. Customer service is also the best any problems just let them know and they will respond quickly with a solution.</li>
    <li> This is the best lash curler I have used. It doesn&#x27;t pinch my side lashes, and it is good quality. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Love this  lash curler, easy to use without any problems, plus it comes with extra cushion so if the one on it gets wore out or you lose it there is a back up that you don&#x27;t have to pay for. I would buy this again for myself as well as a gift for my bestie or sister in law!</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler! I had never used one before. Love the look &amp; feel of the product. Easy to use. Great!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used so I would definitely recommend this to all:)</li>
    <li> Very nice and works very well.  My wife is very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t pinch at all or pull out my lashes like all the other ones do (I don&#x27;t even want to think about the number of eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve bought). Excellent customer service excellent product, I&#x27;m very happy, finally found the right one  :)</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Just what she needed.</li>
    <li> It was super easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;This is great quality and good design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy again for my friend.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I ordered this.  I thought that it was going to be a wonderful product.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and have used a lot of different eye lash curlers, unfortunately this product did not work as well as I had anticipated.  it does not get close enough to the eye lid to be able to get a good curl.  I tried it quite a few times and each time, I had the same result.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Revlon curler since the beginning and after trying many others  (without breaking the wallet), this one does it pretty well. Love it. Will definitely purchase again after 6 month when I replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Just got my 2nd curler in the mail. Cammy R is an excellent rep. She responded to my messages extrememly quickly and is sooo friendl and personable. I love the customer service. Received my curler quickly and I love this product so much. It&#x27;s better than the high end curlers at a fraction of the price. I lobe everything about it and I definitely recommend this product from this seller to everyone.</li>
    <li> Received the eyelash curler very quickly. The curler works great! Suggestion: come out with other colors if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
    <li> Cammy (owner) is amazing! I reached out to her with a concern and she rectified the situation immediately. They put customers first and are so easy to work with, I wish they all the best and much success ;-)</li>
    <li> After great anticipation for this highly-rated eyelash curler, I received a defective product. The lower part of the curler that moves due to spring action is crooked and there is a gap where it should grab and curl the eyelashes. I have prepared this to return to Amazon, which is was stated to be fulfilled by despite the return label showing as the company&#x27;s - Fuchsia Line. I am extremely disappointed but would like to order a replacement if I am assured that the curler will be carefully inspected for defects prior to shipping.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. Doesn&#x27;t pinch like other curlers do. I have had trouble with past curlers and almost stopped using them but this one renewed my faith in them. Plus the colors are so great</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to hold and use. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different eyelash curlers over the years and was never thrilled with them. The would either pinch or not make a curl worth the effort/time. Just figured that&#x27;s how they all were unless you wanted to spend some major $$$ on a super nice one and I just couldn&#x27;t make myself do that.  This one is great! Gives big curl with no pinching/effort in just a few seconds. Very happy with my purchase. Will be interested to see how it holds up over time and will update my review if needed.</li>
    <li> Received item when promised. It works great and is also pretty.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does not pinch my eyelash. Comes with 1 extra pad</li>
    <li> Perfect! Arrived on time and everything was as described, works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Best Quality~!! Thanks~!!</li>
    <li> amazing amazing amazing thats all i have to say one of the best eyelash curlers i have used!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Delivered on time. I have had not trouble with pinching or discomfort. Very glad I purchased this item over other brands. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> Works great, Same quality as the high end stores but half the price.</li>
    <li> I think I would prefer a lighter colored curler - My eyesight isn&#x27;t great and my dark lashes against the dark metal is very hard to see whether I have my lashes properly placed in the curler before I close it.  Other than that, this is a nice curler.  If you just changed the top bar color it would make a big difference.  I understand that could be a manufacturing problem.</li>
    <li> I received my Insta-curler and was pretty excited to see if it really does as it claims. When I opened it I noticed it was very appealing.  It feels like a legit eyelash curler ,meaning not cheaply made no plastic feeling here.  It also has a spring back in the handle which I think is amazing! !  I&#x27;ve been looking for a eyelash curler that actually curls my lashes and i can happily say that search is over.  It does keep my lashes curled as long as I don&#x27;t put mascara on. My mascara weighs down my lashes which sucks but I do love my curler. I haven&#x27;t tried it with the blow dryer which it says to to have better curl. I shall try thay next. Great buy will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Sorry....thought I was going to love this item. But it is not pinch free. In the front there is a space when you squeeze the handles together that catches your skin under your eye. It has happened a few times even when I am careful. It is great on the lashes but that part of the item hurt me a few times and left a red mark. So this one is not my favorite tool.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Little tricky at first. Works well once you get the hang of it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my eye lag curler. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  It curls ALL my lashes perfectly.  I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> This lash curler is so awesome. It works better than the traditional lash curlers. I have really straight asian lashes, but when i use this, my lashes look a lot better and a lot curlier. I highly recommend this curler!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE EYELASH CURLERS THEY WORK SO WELL!!</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of eye lash curlers due to it always seems to pinch, but this one actually doesnt, I am very pleased with it and now I can actually have my lashes look good! The quality is anazing, alot more durable than others in have tried. The fact it came with a little case I can keep it in my purse without it getting gross is a bigger bonus!</li>
    <li> I got this for the wife since she wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the one she had. She really likes this one a lot and she has better control over this one. She has used it every day since it arrived and is really happy with it. He lashes are naturally long and this curler works great with her lashes. They don&#x27;t pull on her lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;She highly recommends the curler!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my lashes at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyelash curler! It does not pinch my eyes and turns eyelashes perfect for me!!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler, it doesn&#x27;t clump as much, lashes are evenly curled, nice grip too. Good quality material, im using it everyday &amp; definitely wound recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not only is this eyelash curler super pretty it works great as well. They are made of carbon steel, very sturdy and durable. The ergonomic handles gives you a comfortable grip they are easy to use the pink cushion pad protects you from pulling your eyelashes or pinching yourself it&#x27;s absolutely pain free. I like to curl my lashes before and after I apply my mascara the curler makes my eyelashes look longer and fuller and I also noticed that when I use this curler my mascara doesn&#x27;t get all over the pink cushion pad this would happen with my old curler and even if I ever do get mascara on this curler it would be really easy to clean. I absolutely recommend this high quality eyelash curler to anyone who wants longer and fuller eyelashes without any pain.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same eyelash curler for a loooong time before I decided to try this one. I really like the make of it with the rubber around the fingerholes. Being a cosmetologist, also having a place to rest my ring finger is comforting and gives me more control. It&#x27;s not cold against the face like the old metal ones (which I switched from). So far, I really like it. At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with my eyelashes. Since it claims to be just as good as the kinds that heat up, I was expecting a bit more from it, especially since I have long lashes. If I hold the lashes a few seconds longer, I notice they get a little more curly. However, It definitely works better than my old metal curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the make of this curler, and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic. I had to replace my travel curler that finally broke after 10 years, This is a good curler.</li>
    <li> Worst eyelash curler yet. Have to heat it up to get a decent curl. Already looking for a replacement after a few short months as the pad and replacement have both split.</li>
    <li> Love this curler! Very nice quality. Slightly heat the curler with your blow dryer and you&#x27;ll get great results. I also really like the handle clip that holds it in a closed position for storage. Great idea!</li>
    <li> better thatn the cheap ones you find, love the handles and the extra pad</li>
    <li> Pain free, pinch free eyelash curler. So easy to use. Great gripping of lashes without yanking them out! A light squeeze and my lashes are curled. Made out of carbon steel, so not the cheap drug store curler. It actually comes with instructions for use, a case, and extra little pad. Definately try with the blow-dryer for a few seconds. Lashes come out beautiful! So easy to use with great results!</li>
    <li> Works well, no pinching, came with case, instructions and a replacement cushion. Pleased with product</li>
    <li> Beautifully made eyelash curler. It has very substantial construction, and I feel it would last for quite awhile. It curled my lashes very nicely. One negative thing about this curler is it has trouble grabbing my small top lashes on the outer sides of my eyes. This is easy to use. It does not pull out my lashes from getting stuck and i have yet to pinch myself</li>
    <li> Cute color and build, but I didn&#x27;t like how it left my lashes. They didn&#x27;t curl like my revlon curler, it was more like they were bent. My eyelashes looked they were doing a 90degree angle. I wish it worked because I liked the pink color.</li>
    <li> Love it!! A great eyelash curler! And it&#x27;s so pretty. Came on time and is exactly as advertised. Would but from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with blepharitis so I need to be very careful what I touch my eyelids with.  This did not irritate my skin or eyelids, which is great!! This curler is very sturdy, although a little bulkier than I would like.  I have short, thin, sparse eyelashes (usually I have eyelash extensions on but I&#x27;m taking a break so I needed a eyelash curler) and this does a pretty good job of curling my eyelashes.  There was no pinching, or weird creasing or pulling.  Although I prefer my eyelash curler brand that I&#x27;ve been using for over 10 years now, this comes in as my 2nd favorite.</li>
    <li> So the customer survice is great. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks already and it really doesn&#x27;t stand out to other eyelash curlers. I would give it four stars but the thumb hole doesn&#x27;t fit my thumb! It is too small! I can&#x27;t use it comfortably which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> The deluxe eyelash curler is perfect for what I was looking for. I have always used the all metal curlers. And I wasn&#x27;t a fan. I came across this eyelash curler from Fuchsia Line and have fallen in love. The curler is sturdy and well made. It has been constructed to meet the needs of many women. It curls my eyelashes nicely and in no time. I haven&#x27;t experienced pinching my eyelid. So far this has exceeded my standards and will keep in mind anytime I need a gift for one of my make up loving friends!</li>
    <li> i really had low expectations with this purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when i used this and had such gorgeous lash curls! Its sleek, firs my eye shape perfectly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks gor a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!  using a blow dryer quickly on the curler and eyelashes, really sets the curl. It is just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this eyelash curler!  I heat it up for a few seconds with a hair dryer before curling my eyelashes and O.M.G. my lashes stay curled and beautiful the entire day!  I use one coat of mascara to add a more dramatic look but I can totally skip the mascara if I wanted a more simpler, more natural look.  This is the only eyelash curler that does not hurt my eyes or lashes so that is a total plus.  The overall quality is phenomenal!  I will surely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who really likes the color and function of this lash curler.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this she said it works better than any one that she&#x27;s owned.</li>
    <li> I love this Eyelash Curler! The curl is amazing and lasts forever! The packaging is great and everything was neat and orderly. I have spent *way* more on lash curlers before, and they hardly compare. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use these as soon as I got them out of the box. First of all I must say that I am impressed by the sleek style and design of the curler.  Used them for the first time and they curled my eyelashes wonderfully with absolutely no pinching. This is a fabulous little eyelash curler, very comfortable and I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Comfortable for left or right hand. Well done</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyelash curler!!! I received it in 2 days (not a Prime member) and it is fabulous! It curls my lashes beautifully without, pinching, pulling or any pressure at all. The curl lasts all day and it is comfortable to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt my fingers like most other curler do. Seriously love this curler!!!</li>
    <li> Here is why I do not like this product.  First of all, the metal is black and my eyelashes are black.  So when I try to put it over my lashes, I cant see them so I have no idea if I have all of them in it before I clamp down.  Second, the pad is not soft enough (even with the blow dryer) to squeeze it good and hard.  My lashes are very curl resistant apparently and I have to hold it for a few minutes in order to achieve a curled lash.  When I use my basic silver curler, I can see that all my lashes are inside before clamping down and the pad is squishier so I dont have to hold it as long and produces a great curl.  No happy with his product at all.</li>
    <li> Cofortable handle, nice look, works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lov&#x27;n my new eyelash curler! It works really great and I see a total different result from my conventional eyelash curler. Way better! It&#x27;s chic, high quality, and durable.  I love it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice curler that is gentle on the eye lashes but still curls well. I&#x27;ve bought plenty of curlers over the years and have been a true revlon fan. I wanted to try something new and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Company cares about putting out a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an eyelash curler. Is sturdy but bulky. Doesn&#x27;t do any better than the $1 ones. It just takes up more space, probably won&#x27;t break, and is pink.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Very feminine, and easy to use! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this product and have recommended it to anyone who has asked!</li>
    <li> I used to not think this was a necessary tool.....wow was I wrong!!! This thing is amazing!! It makes my lashes look fuller and longer, they are so beautiful now!! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and use all the time,</li>
    <li> This I a great item !!! I use it everyday &amp; no problems!!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever tried! I was using a Revlon curler and I could not reach my outer eyelashes. This one can get close to my lid without pinching. It is comfortable and stylish! Additionally, the customer service is incredible! Within minutes of placing my order I received an email telling me my product was on my way. The day I opened my package customer services was making sure I was satisfied with my product. I recommend this product 100%! If for some reason you do not like this product, I am confident that the company would more then make it up to you.</li>
    <li> First of all, this curler just feels well made. Secondly, it is the best eyelash curler I have ever used. Hands down. Lastly, this company wants its customers to be happy with their product. A trifecta. The curler does an awesome job and I love it.</li>
    <li> This Eyelash Curler came quickly with no problems.  I really like it as it is easy to handle and does not pinch like my old one.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s comfortable, and it has a step by step guide to get the most out of it.</li>
    <li> The first time I&#x27;ve used it was today and I&#x27;m very impressed! My lashes seem fuller. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought this curler would have been amazing, considering all the good reviews it has received. Sadly, when I curl my lashes with this, the curl doesn&#x27;t last very long ( I have long lashes and they point straight down). The curl only lasts me about 10 minutes and then my lashes go back to the way they were. I tried heating the curler up with a blow dryer and yeah, that only helped my lashes stay curled for about 30 minutes or so. I recently bought a three dollar curler and that one works 10 times better than this one. The curl lasts a long time with the 3 dollar one. Maybe it&#x27;s my lashes? I don&#x27;t know, but I was hoping this Fuchsia Deluxe eyelash curler would work better.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like using eyelash curlers because they are painful and don&#x27;t give me the look I am going for. I found this gem, and after one use I am already hooked! It doesn&#x27;t snag on my lashes and doesn&#x27;t push too hard and it gives it the false looking curl we all want. This is a MUST for your beauty collection!</li>
    <li> This curler is my favorite of any I have ever purchased! The finger openings are extremely comfortable and the fit is perfect. I have struggled in the past with some eyelash curlers getting stuck on my fingers when I finished using them because I had to squeeze the curler so hard but, this one slips off my fingers easily. It is a very comfortable fit on the eyelash and eyelid area. Curls lashes beautifully!</li>
    <li> LOVE this curler and extra refill pad!!!!  Thank you Fuchsia for making this cute curler.  This curler does in fact is pinch/pain free!!!!  Thank you for this wonderful must have curler!!</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because my kit didn&#x27;t come with an extra eyelash pad. However, this product is nicely made. It is sturdy but it does not clamp or yank your eyelashes out. I would recommend this but you may or may not have to buy your own eyelash pads to change them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited with this product... I read the manual that came with it and did exactly as follows and it worked. So excited</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This product is absolutely fabulous. My lashes look so long but yet very natural. I highly recommend this. It is just plain wonderful.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love love love this..</li>
    <li> Well made and gets my lashes on point. Easy to use even when my hand isn&#x27;t as steady as I would like.</li>
    <li> Works great!  No pinching of the eye lids!</li>
    <li> Product had a great quality and package. I tried it on as soon as I got it and compared the result with the other eye. The difference its visible and the product does the job perfectly. Great costumer service and coming with instructions!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the ones I bought at the store worked better.</li>
    <li> At 65 years of age I have used a lot of eyelash curlers and I must say that this by far is the best. Great price, great product. You will no be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Use the hair-dryer trick.  You won&#x27;t need mascara!</li>
    <li> Very high quality for the price.  Also, very quick shipment.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the only one I have ever used that doesnt pinch me while using it. It works great!</li>
    <li> LOOOVe this curler.  It&#x27;s very \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot;. A lot better made than previous lash curlers I have owed.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far so good&#x27; I love it!</li>
    <li> I just received my curler and since I was home, opened it and tried it out right away. I read the simple instructions and decided to heat the unit up with hot water instead of a blow dryer since I don&#x27;t have one. The unit itself is very sturdy; seems like it will last a long time. They will give you a 50% off discount if you order another one in 6 months, according to the pamphlet. Sweet. It also contains an extra rubber cover for the eyelash curler as well as a plastic bag to keep it in. I love pink and the color combination is very cute. I curled my eyelashes and they were curlier. I have attached a photo to demonstrate the difference. One eyelash is curlier than the other. I then applied mascara to each to accentuate the differences. I&#x27;m highly pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is too cute!  In the package you&#x27;ll recieve a eyelash curler tool, two rubber seals, and a plastic lock for the curler&#x27;s handles.  Used it as soon as it arrived and worked like a charm.  The instructions that are included will recommend you use a hair dyer to heat the curler for better results but this will lead to the seals wearing out faster.</li>
    <li> Omg I love with this curler!! I recommend it to all my ladies out there! Worth the money..</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Arrived quick and is very ergonomically efficient. Definitely a must have!&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and it grabbed all my long lashes and curled in 10 seconds and none were left in the chamber.........&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pinch or kink,  it works great ! ! !</li>
    <li> Love my new Insta-Curler- I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but I&#x27;ve had friends and clients (both days) comment on the length, curl, and general lush-ness of my lashes. I&#x27;m sending them all to Amazon to check out thus awesome product! Also, the customer service and follow-up post-purchase was out this world- c</li>
    <li> Great product. doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit! it reaches all of your eyelashes, even those little ones at the inner corner of your eye.  Great product for such a great price! some eyelash curlers sell up to $30. ridiculous, go with Fushia!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for me, but the customer service deserves a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curler that I have EVER used!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Its cute and very useful. It doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes during use and curls my lashes quickly. My lashes look so beautiful. Thank you Fuchsia.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It&#x27;s durable, I don&#x27;t feel that it yanks my eyelashes like others do and in my favorite colors. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> It works fairly well for the price. I&#x27;ve had the luxury of working at Sephora, therefore I&#x27;ve tried the best and the worst of them. The black background of this makes it impossible to see where I am crimping down on my lashes, leading to some inconsistencies. The pad is very rigid and doesn&#x27;t allow for much cushion. I also find it difficult to get the product close to my eye without the front piece getting in the way and pressing up against my under eye area.</li>
    <li> Love the curler, super fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> The World Best Hot item.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! So easy to use!! I have purchased so many different ones and this by far is the best!!</li>
    <li> I received the  INSTA-CURLER late last week and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I had a Revlon branded curler for years.  The  INSTA-CURLER has a nice feel in my hand and I like how the instructions recommended heating up the curler -- I used to do that 20 years ago, but forgot how much of a difference it makes.  I also appreciate the extra refill already included.  I probably won&#x27;t use the carrying case that was provided -- I just throw it in the make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!  I would like to add I&#x27;m glad it was available on Amazon -- I work full time and have a 2 yr old, so trips to Target are not&lt;br /&gt;always the easiest.  My husband and I are Amazon Prime members and we try to buy everything we can through Amazon to maximize our time together and remove weekly errands from our list of weekend activities.</li>
    <li> This is the first curler to actually get a lasting curl in my stubbornly straight lashes. It is painless and doesn&#x27;t pull on the lashes like I&#x27;ve had others do in the past. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this thing. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great item and quality! So worth the money. I love these and I know they&#x27;re going to last me a very long time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye lash curler! I&#x27;ve been curling my eyelashes since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 46 now and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  No more fear of ripping out my eyelashes or painfully clutching the curler and enduring the discomfort in order to get my lashes curled!  It&#x27;s PURRfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> takes a little getting used to but once you do it is amazing  so glad i purchased this</li>
    <li>   I love it.  It&#x27;s my first time using an eyelash curler.  I find this very easy and comfortable to use. I was scared to try it because watching a video seems so painful.  But this was so easy. Great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! Great quality! Really curls my lashes!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to my eyelashes as I&#x27;d hope for :(</li>
    <li> I used to curl my eyelashes, which are a blondish brown color, with an eyelash curler I bought from a local drug store.  It was their own brand and it worked beautifully for me to actually be able to see my lashes.  I heard the drug store chain was being sold to a competitor and I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get that style curler anymore so I went to all its various locations and bought all of those curlers I could get.  About five years ago, I ran out of curlers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried - and this not an exaggeration - at least 8 different eyelash curlers.  I have never found one that would fit properly into my eye socket (I have a very small face.) nor could I find one that I could see my eyelashes on, before squeezing to curl.  I had hoped that this tool would do the trick but I need to use a magnifying mirror in order to see my lashes.  Nonetheless, it gives the lashes a great, natural curl that lasts all day.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  I&#x27;m very pleased because I can go back to using mascara again because my lashes are very straight unless curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that now that I can wear mascara again, I discovered that my mascara has been discontinued!  You can&#x27;t win!  But once I find a replacement, I&#x27;ll know I have a very good eyelash curler to use!</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this product. First of all, I have very fine hair...including finely thin eyelashes. To top it off I recently had a mole removed that was beneath my upper eye and caused my lashes on that eye to bend downward. (I wish I had known how easy the surgery was or I would have had it done sooner). The doc did have to take a few lashes with the mole (sigh). The good news is...they&#x27;ve grown back. The best news is...this curler has begun to gently bend all the lashes back up. This 65 yr old can use mascara again! I use a bit of heat even if it shortens the life of the pad (an extra one was included). This Deluxe curler is fantastic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Save your money! It doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, this Eyelash Curler. And the color is soooo awesome, it is the same color as my pair of pink and black boots that I love and wear all the time. The Curler is a beautiful pink and glossy black, it is just so darn cute. I actually stopped using eyelash curlers years ago, because they would always and I repeat always pinch my eyelid (ouch) well this Deluxe Eyelash Curler from Fuchsia Line has not once pinched my eyelid. I can get close as I want and it doesn&#x27;t pinch the life out of me. It is a great product, and I highly recommend it for women who have given up on eyelash curlers because they were always pinched or pulling out eyelashes by other ones.Give this one a try. Not only does it not pinch you, the colors that were chosen when it was being created are just so darn cute.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and have gotten compliments on how my eyelashes turn out. Would absolutely recommend this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just received this eyelash curler.  So so substantial!  it curled my eye laser in seconds without any pinching or tugging in the least .  So easy to hold  and handle!  I never had an eyelash curler like it.i gave up curling my eyelashes because of the discomfort Thank you Infusion for giving me back the curl!!!!!&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I never liked using a lash curler because of pulling, but this lash curler is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Thus eyelash curler is way too bulky and misses a section of eyelashes each time I try to use it. Even my broken and cheapie curlers work better than this. I wrote an email stating my complaints to the company over a month and a half ago and have yet to hear back, so I&#x27;m sure they know their product is garbage.</li>
    <li> Great Set of Curlers.  The handles are made of a soft material and that makes them more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;They work great too!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have received the Inst-Curler and so far am very happy with it.  It is lightweight but seems sturdy, and is easy to operate.  I look forward to trying the heating process too (5 seconds with hair dryer then curling the eyelashes).</li>
    <li> The curler is great. It&#x27;s much better than my old one.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on your lashes when you try to get maximum curl which was my main issue with my old one. It shipped right on time, isn&#x27;t damaged, and works great. I give it 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> Gentle on my lashes.  They curl nicely.</li>
    <li> This by far the best eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned in years! It is definitely worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> It is at least twice better than my tarte eyelash curler. Also, a lot less painful than shisedo one.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Arrived quick and is very ergonomically efficient. Definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> Works great and does exactly what I need!!</li>
    <li> I received the DELUXE EYELASH CURLER  and for me using an eyelash curler for the first time it works very nicely. I use it every day and there is a noticeable difference. It came with all the parts and is a nice product that I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> The curler works better than any other I have used. It didn&#x27;t pinch, and did work even better when heated, as per the instruction sheet that came with it. It did take one or two tries to learn how to use it, because it is at a different angle than the Revlon curler I have used for years, but after learning to hold it at the correct sngle, it was very easy to use. I will never use another brand again as I am so satisfied. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this product had expected alot more for costing so much but besides handles bein slightly more comfortable than all metal, these arent better than much cheaper drugstore curlers.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The packaging on this alone makes it gift quality, but the curler is perfect to keep for yourself as well. It comes in a box, and when you open it up there is a little fold-over flap pvc bag that the curler can be stored in, with a smaller pocket to tuck the extra cushion into so it doesn&#x27;t get lost. I like that it comes with an extra cushion so it can be easily replaced when need be. The fact that it comes with instructions for use is a bit funny to me, but i guess i get it, like, if this is your first ever eyelash curler you won&#x27;t be at a loss for how to use it at least! I recieved this</li>
    <li> This curler is cute it&#x27;s black and pink and it comes in a clear plastic box.  It comes with one extra plastic insert besides the one already in the curler. The only reason why I don&#x27;t give this curler give stars is because it doesn&#x27;t curl my eye lashes right away I have repeatedly press the curler and even after a few times they don&#x27;t seem very curled. I think it&#x27;s because the plastic inserts are too hard not spungy or soft enough to allow my lashes to curl.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever purchased (and I&#x27;ve tried many)!  It doesn&#x27;t pinch, curls the lashes perfectly, and I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard to get the results I want.  Will definitely purchase again if/when this one wears out!</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all. I will return it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;no pinching&amp;#34; but it actually doesn&#x27;t pinch at all!  I&#x27;m very happy with this curler and will buy it again and again (or at least the refills if that&#x27;s an option)!</li>
    <li> Great Curler that I use everyday! It is my favorite eyelash curler that I have ever come across! IT WORKS</li>
    <li> Okay, I have never ever had a better eyelash curler. Many curlers keep your eyelashes curled for a few hours. Or curled until you apply mascara. Not this one. This one keeps it curled all day no matter how much mascara you put on. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;I normally curl pretty close to the lash line and it hurts, but with this- I am curling basically on the lash line and I feel no pain. I highly recommend this product. Sorry- I was pretending to be a sexy Easter Bunny and this is the only photo I currently have of how wonderful it made my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. Will buy again if I ever need to.</li>
    <li> I have another eyelash curler. But it doesn&#x27;t work well. So I bought this. After I bought it, and used it it is fantastic. It is easy to use and good quality. It is not painful when I use it. This item&#x27;s grip feel so good. Actually this my 3rd eyelash curler, but it is the best I think. I tshove anothers in a drawer. This is the best!</li>
    <li> These are the best eyelash curlers I have bought. They are comfortable and we&#x27;ll made.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eyelash curler. I love that it does not hurt or pinch my eyelids. It looks really nice too. I love the colors. I wish they had some matching tweezers to go with this. I think that would be pretty cool. This curled my eyelashes easily. It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it hurting me. It comes with a clear storage bag for traveling and an extra refill pad. The eyelash pad is soft and comfortable. The design is really nice, as well. It was comfortable to hold in my hands. I highly recommend this! I received a discount on this product. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the little pouch, and the curler is easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> the curler really works and I loved it till the pad split and cracked in just over a week. The refills were worse.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an eyelash curler since junior high and I&#x27;m in my 40s. The old-fashioned ones used to make your lashes look bent, not curled.  I&#x27;m happy to say things have changed. This eyelash curler is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for years. I&#x27;ve tried everyone made. Heated, cheap, expensive... They all pinch my eyes, curl the bottom lashes up too, cut my eyelashes. I love the the Deluxe Eyelash curler. Curls great! Doesn&#x27;t pinch! Soft closing mechanism! I would definitely recommend for every girl out there!</li>
    <li> Broke after three uses. However, it worked really before it broke.</li>
    <li> Hi Guys, I got this thru a promotion code so I did pay for it and I needed a new 1 BADLY, I did not know that you could use this with your blow dryer for the heat to curl your lashes but it specifically says you can do it, so I did and it worked great I was really impressed ( cuz I was thinking like yeah right when I read it LOL).  If you like hot pink and black (like me) you will LOVE the look very nice design to, although I do not think I will use it that much with the blow dryer because it does say in the instructions that it will where out the little pad quicker (and it came with 1 refill and a clear carrying case and it also comes with this little clear hook thing which I did not throw away when I&#x27;m done using it I put it back on because that is really what tore up my other ones because the handles were flapping around in my cosmetic bag when I carry it around so hold on to that if you&#x27;ve had this same problem), using it with the bow dryer will be only when I&#x27;m in a hurry or running late because its quicker then going back til you get the perfect look, the heat makes it go quicker, sounds funny if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about but the instructions are right there to help you along if you haven&#x27;t tried this method before.  TY so much Guys, Bye</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!!  I did use my blow dryer...  omg!!  My lashes looked amazing!!!  I was planning to try false lashes, but not now!!  I find Fuchsia line to be very supportive.  This is a great product, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!!</li>
    <li> This thing is great. There is no pinch when I curl my lashes. It gives a firm curl. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> At first glance I was skeptical of this eyelash curler but now, I&#x27;ve given my old one the boot! The packaging &amp; what&#x27;s inside: The packaging is vibrant and put together well. No damage or defects. Inside the box is the eyelash curler AND an extra removal cushion (which I love)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fuchsia Curler: do not let this curler fool you!  It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 days and I&#x27;m really happy! I love the look and feel! First, it&#x27;s soft material is excellent for gripping, and it DOES NOT pinch your eyelashes. That was one of my main issue with my last eyelash curler. The bright color gives it a cute, sassy, fashionable presence. They curl very well for me and consistently. Something I&#x27;ve also been looking for. One of my favorite features is the finger holes! This is genius! Not once did I have issues with it moving out of place or slipping out of my hand while holding. The holes give me easier control over the curler and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and ONLY criticism: I gave 4 stars because the holes are a bit on the small side. I&#x27;m a plus size woman and my little fat fingers are a tad big in the holes. I would recommend the seller make two versions or just make the curler standard with the holes a tad bigger for us with bigger fingers and tall people. It still serves it purpose but is a little uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely RECOMMEND this curler! It&#x27;s larger size is great, it&#x27;s durable, well made with great material, DOESN&#x27;T PINCH, and is easy, easy, easy to grip than MOST curlers I&#x27;ve tried! On top of all this, the seller has EXCELLENT customer service! I&#x27;ll be purchasing another very soon! You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> We love this eyelash curler so much! One of my daughters received it for Christmas and the others loved it so much that I had to buy one for everyone! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this wonderful product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, almost feels like your not curling your lashes when in fact you are. Good product especially for the price. I have used many curlers over the years and so far this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great.  I have really enjoyed using it...I don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;when my last curler stopped working but I guess I just didn&#x27;t notice. Using&lt;br /&gt;this one now I see such a big difference! Thanks for making such a great&lt;br /&gt;product and at such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Very well made.  Good quality that will last a long time. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used eyelash curlers for a very long time and I have to say this is one of the best that I have purchased! Its easy to use and it doesnt pinch your eye and it gives me long beautiful eye lashes! I also love the color!</li>
    <li> Ever go to use an eye lash curler and you pinch your eye lid? Ouch! With this DELUXE Eyelash Curler by FUCHSIA, you will never feel that pain again! This eye lash curler has a nice level of cushion behind it, making any pinching of the eye lid, no longer painful. The cushioned support in no way takes away from the curly effect of the eye lash curler (I hope to add some pics, at a later time).&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the eye lash curler is a higher quality than I expected (I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least). I don&#x27;t anticipate the cushioning to come off at any point in time, but if it does a back up was included (along with a clear travel case &amp; directions for use).&lt;br /&gt;I was highly impressed with the customer service of this company! They truly are available if you have any questions!!&lt;br /&gt;And having a LIFETIME 100% money-back guarantee, definitely makes this product a winner!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I found this product sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive my DELUXE Eyelash Curler by FUCHSIA, at a promotional price. My opinions, however, are that of my own!*</li>
    <li> This would be a great eyelash curler if you have smaller eyes. This did not fit my eye quite right and was just too small.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler EVER!</li>
    <li> I got mine yesterday and it is AMAZING I have straight eyelashes that are hard to curl and my lashes stayed curled all day today!</li>
    <li> Works great! No more pinching of eyelids anymore!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this and try it out so as soon I got it, I did just that! It works really well and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use. The handles on it make it much easier. I&#x27;ve used many brands of curlers in the past but this one seems to work the best. My eyelashes never looked better!</li>
    <li> I bought this per my fiancé.  shes a stomach sleeper so one eye comes out smooshed and the other curly.  she has purchased many eye lash curlers and they pulled and never did what she wanted.  she is trilled with the FUCHSIA curler.  it is so gentle and it does not tug or pull she said.  I will be buying another one for her as a back up for work.  like that she has one at home and one at work.  continue the great work...you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This curler works great.. Easy to use.. Will be recommending this to others..</li>
    <li> This is a fine curler-it does a good job-however I big thumbs and cant use it right:(</li>
    <li> great for long eyelashes, better than any other brand i just love it! the replace is just for a 5 month, but is really cheap on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel of this lash curler. It&#x27;s compact enough to fit in my travel make up bag and since it&#x27;s not medal it&#x27;s not as shockingly cold against your eye lids in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using an eyelash curler for years! They have always pinched and&lt;br /&gt;hurt when curling lashes.  This eye lash curler from Fuchsia is great!!  I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t even tell if I am curling my lashes because there is absolutely no&lt;br /&gt;pain or pinching.  The only thing I would recommend is to have the top two&lt;br /&gt;parts of curler a different color than black. I have dark lashes, so I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t see if I have my lashes between curler or not because there is no&lt;br /&gt;pain. But, when I check my lashes after curling, it is curling them closer to the lid&lt;br /&gt;and I am not getting the crease in the lashes either. It is unreal!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Maybelline, Revlon, and others. Revlon had been the best&lt;br /&gt;for me before I purchased the Fuchsia Line, but it was never pain free.&lt;br /&gt;I would never think about purchasing anything but Fuchsia&lt;br /&gt;from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have used eyelash curler to enhance my eyelashes for years and I have always had a problem when it comes  to holding the curler. With this curler it was so easy the curve handle at the bottom made my fingers feel comfortable to be able to close the curler with no pitching . I did not heat the curler before using but it still worked great . I also love the color I am not a pink type of person but mixed with the black it stands out. The extra pad will come in handy. I would totally recommend this product  to other it would also be a great gift.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch eyelids. but, it doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my lashes well either. I even tried the hairdryer method but it did nothing to my lashes so I can&#x27;t use this at all. Even the $5 curler from the drug store worked for me but I lost that one so I decided to buy this one since it has such high reviews but it&#x27;s actually not worth the the $12 spent on it..</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think there was a big difference in lash curlers, but I was wrong! This one doesn&#x27;t hurt, curls perfectly and is super easy to use. I will order again when I wear this one out.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this lash curler !!!! It works amazing and I love the color as well :) but this truly is the best lash curler I have ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long lashed but very dull and hard to curl. So I decided to try this and it sure did help keep my lashes curled</li>
    <li> I just used this eyelash curler for the first time this morning and was pleasantly surprised at how good it curled my lashes. I didn&#x27;t do what it said in the instructions about warming it up with my hair dryer because I was in the car when I used it, but even still my lashes are still curly after about 3 hours and I used no mascara. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll try it with mascara to see if it has a longer hold but until now I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Curl doesn&#x27;t last longer than 10 minutes. Also, I emailed their customer service with a quick question and they never got back to me. Don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the fact that it is pinch less. The company even contacted me to see how I liked the product, so I&#x27;m guessing if I did not like the product they would of taken care of my issue. You can even heat up the curler and it works even better. My daughter took my old one and am glad she did, so I was in the market for a new one. Thanks kid</li>
    <li> Such an adorable eyelash curler, for starters!! I love the color pink so the pink highlights on this is so cute! I love the ease of this curler and how it leaves my lashes looking longer and fuller!</li>
    <li> I have Asian eyelashes and this eyelash curler does not curl my eyelashes even a little bit. I&#x27;ve tried everything from heating it up with a hair dryer, curling it for 30 seconds... still no curl.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE it!! It&#x27;s the only eyelash curler that I&#x27;ve ever found to actually be effective on my eyelashes. Currently recommending to all the make up users that I know. Thanks for a GREAT product!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I had to simply for Fuchsia&#x27;s top notch customer service. The product itself is the best eyelash curler I have ever had the pleasure of using. It&#x27;s comfortable and has a wonderful design to it. They truly seem to care about ensuring customer satisfaction and that made the already wonderful product even better. Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this eyelash curler.  It was very weak at curling the eyelashes.  I returned it and am going to buy a Sephora eyelash curler or Shu Umera eyelash curler instead. While the instruction to blowdry this before using it would probably help, you can do that with any eyelash curler and I don&#x27;t want to have to do that.</li>
    <li> I received the product sooner than expected, so this people have a great delivery service.&lt;br /&gt;The product has very substantial construction, and I feel it would last for quite awhile. It curled my lashes very nicely, so I am very satisfy with the product</li>
    <li> I really like how springy it is. I bought a few different types of curler but this is the only one I&#x27;m keeping. The only sort of downside of this is that it&#x27;s black. That makes it look nice, but hard for me to see where it grips my lashes because I have black/dark short lashes and I couldn&#x27;t tell easily if it&#x27;s grabbing the lashes at the tip or near the lid. Anyway, the tool feels very solid, sturdy, springy and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Works well says to heat it with a blow dryer not necessary.</li>
    <li> Great perfect condition works great.</li>
    <li> This curler does not disappoint! with the right mascara and this curler, you&#x27;ll have perfect lashes. I have monolids so my lashes have zero curl whatsoever and they just stick out straight. I tried this curler and it effortlessly curls with no pinch! Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler.  It makes my lashes curl beautifully and the eyelash curler itself is pretty and comes with its own little carrying pouch.  I have always been intimidated by eyelash curlers but not this one.  I am a fan of this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler! It creates the perfect up swept curls very easily and expertly. The grips are very comfortable, no finger slipping. There isn’t any tugging on my lashes at all, just great big beautiful lashes. I have very short lashes and this product grips every lash. Curls last all day with a crease-free curl.&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try…you won’t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product.  I prefer wide mouthed eyelash curlers and this didn&#x27;t fit for me.  I have been using a hairdryer for eons with eyelash curlers so the concept wasn&#x27;t new to me either.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice now and thus far I have no complaints. This lash curler is by far better than my old one. My old lash curler always pinched me and didn&#x27;t seem to curl my lashes effectively. I did not initiate contact with the seller, they contacted me first and I appreciate their eagerness to make sure I was pleased with their product.</li>
    <li> Works great and curls eyelashes very good!</li>
    <li> I got this as a promotional item. I have never curled my eyelashes before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I love it. I can&#x27;t believe that I had never tried it before. It makes my eyelashes look so long. And mascara goes on so much smoother.</li>
    <li> Its a regular eyelash curler. Nothing special about it, ill stick to my expensive lash curlers. Way better!</li>
    <li> I think my daughter will really enjoy this.  It will be a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Best product so far for the eye curlers! Doesn&#x27;t pinch your eyelids and will not yank the lashes! Will not go back to the regular curlers. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and it looks awesome!</li>
    <li> Super grip handle and seem more quality than the basic stainless steel curlers. I was a little disappointed with the packaging though since it seemed to have oil in it?? Maybe from the curler I am not sure, but it wasn&#x27;t  that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> I had only used an eyelash curler once in my life, and it was a horrible experience. I said I&#x27;d never use another one again. When I got the chance to try this product I decided that I&#x27;d give it a shot. The packaging is very chic and the actual curler itself is very sturdy and looks like a nice accessory to keep with my beauty supplies. When I tried it out, I was a little worried about pinching my eyelashes, but it was simple, and my lashes were indeed curled! It looked great and I was super excited about the results. I am glad that I took the leap to give it another shot!</li>
    <li> Nothing to brag about and you can still pinch your lids with this curler.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I haven&#x27;t been curling my lashes for a while because I get wigged out by how most curlers pull, but this one is really comfortable -- I can comfortably blink while curling if I need to. And I like the ergonomics of it, it&#x27;s really easy to use. Also, someone contacted me personally to make sure I had received it and that I was happy with it, which was lovely.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler!  It&#x27;s the best one I have ever used.  It comfortably curls every eyelash without pinching.</li>
    <li> As a licensed professional cosmetologist I try out a great many products both high end and budget friendly when I came across this Eyelash curler I thought I would give it a try since it had good reviews. I am very glad I did. It far surpassed my expectations on such a budget friendly eyelash curler and does a much better job as giving me a natural curls and holds and last all day with just a few simple squeezes than my higher priced one I seem to have wasted my money on! This works great on days where I am meeting with clients or on days I just need to get those pesky lashes from poking my contacts even with out the use of a mascara! I love the handy pouch it comes in and the fact that they even include a replacement band for it as well! The color is very fashionable and the pink accents just add to its stylish flair. I will be recommending this Lash curler to my friends and family and clients as a great product to add to their cosmetic tools .</li>
    <li> So easy to use and so gentle on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Top two sides are too sharp and did not curl my eyelashes properly. It took me about 10 min to get one eyelash right.</li>
    <li> This curler is super great. I&#x27;ve given it about two weeks before writing my review! My lashes are very long, and heavy, all of my old curlers never kept my lashes curled or volumized. This one, however is phenomenal! It&#x27;s not only cute, spring loaded, and easy to use, it&#x27;s got a&lt;br /&gt;Great pad, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eye lashes in any way! The only con I can think of is maybe the length of the eye part itself. For those with a wider set of eye lashes, you may just have to curl the hair on the end of the eyes sort of separately! This is a great product, and I&#x27;m actually going to order one for my mother, for Mother&#x27;s Day:). I recommend to anyone looking to upgrade or replace their curlers!</li>
    <li> I already love this pretty new eyelash curler! It is easy to curl my lashes and I don&#x27;t pinch my eye like I have with other curlers.The design of the handles make the curler simple and easy to use,which is great! It gives my lashes just the right amount of curl to make them look fuller and to give my eyes that extra pop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed of how good this curler works with so little effort it&#x27;s nice and sturdy.. it comes with a clear case and a refill band.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had too many pinch my eye when trying to use them, no issues there. Gives the perfect curl.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works so much better than the crappy metal ones I had since high school.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes remain curled even after you take off your make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use. Impossible to pinch your eyelid. Use with blowdryer as specified for better result but honestly it works even without (unlike the metal ones that do not do anything without blowdryer).&lt;br /&gt;Also, no mascara clumps when using this one (unlike with metal ones again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy &amp; cute design,</li>
    <li> Not sure why this has such great reviews ?? News flash you hear any eye lash curler and it works 10 times better. This contraption was so big for my eye it would punch the skin under my eye. I thought maybe it was just me but nope my sister complained of the exact same thing. Waste of money ended up throwing it out!!! Wondering if some of these were paid reviews ?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never really used an eyelash curler until I purchased this one. This works great for my long eyelashes! Gives them a nice curl before I put my mascara on. I love the little travel pouch it comes in too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this whole purchasing experience. Product arrived when stated nicely packed. And it is awesome! Very happy I ordered it.</li>
    <li> First time in years I have found an eyelash curler I could use. Being a Senior Citizen, I have some extra &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; and  this curler allows me to curl my lashes without pinching. No matter how hold you get, you still want to look as nice as possible. Love this curler for helping me to do that!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used.  Really doesn&#x27;t pinch at all.  Great product. Arrived quickly.  So worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Super best eyelash curler ever!</li>
    <li> The cutest lash curler I&#x27;ve seen yet! Looks plastic, but it is metal &amp; constructed very well. Looks like it will last. I love the color combo.</li>
    <li> I received the INSTA-CURLER and I&#x27;m really impressed. I have very long lashes and I&#x27;ve always used the drugstore curlers, like Revlon, and while&lt;br /&gt;they work just fine I really love the high impact that your product delivers. I haven&#x27;t even tried the heated option yet, but just yesterday I&lt;br /&gt;curled my lashes with the cold/room temp insta-curler and when I went to bed I noticed my lashes had held the curl fairly well (and without&lt;br /&gt;mascara). Love it!</li>
    <li> Such a wonderfully practical and easy-to-use makeup tool! The construction ensures ergonomic comfort. I would definitely recommend giving it a try! It will be your next favorite makeup instrument!</li>
    <li> Curl doesn&#x27;t last ,and doesn&#x27;t curl well instead breaks my lashes</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me for review. I&#x27;m surprised that the material is a wonder. The way they design the holder is very easy to use and it is very comfortable. It far surpasses​ name brand eyelash curlers. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the first curler I&#x27;ve ever used or purchased. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it correctly or not, but all the directions and videos are easy to follow. I don&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I just don&#x27;t see any effect. Do I pull away from my eye as I use it? I would think so, but the instructions say to simply press down. It took 4 tries and some light pulling away from my eye to see any kind of result. Some lashes bent and others aren&#x27;t curled properly. It does the job I guess.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best eyelash curler ever invented! I just purchased 3 more for my family and friends. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like but the seller was great</li>
    <li> Reviewed this as soon as I got it and I have to say, I&#x27;ll never buy one in the grocery store again. It curls exactly the way it should, and I absolutely love the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; features!  1) Ergonomic grip 2) Case that has a place for the spare pad (always used to get lost because they are so little) 3) Not sure what you did, but it seems as if it&#x27;s easier to get the curl you want with this one - able to do it with only one try</li>
    <li> An amazing eye lash curler! Definately not gonna leave in the bottom of my makeup bag! love love love it!</li>
    <li> Did it job perfectly 👍</li>
    <li> I have difficult eyelashes as my eyes are round shape. It works very well. There is no pain as well.</li>
    <li> I love my new insta-curler! My old drugstore one was hard to squeeze and hurt my joints (I have arthritis) but this one is so easy and I love the results. No pinching!</li>
    <li> Nice eyelash curler.  Doesn&#x27;t pinch when being used.</li>
    <li> superb!!  what more can i say.  Love this curler!</li>
    <li> Good and easy to use!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!  Because of the design, it catches my skin under my eye on my upper cheek and cut it!  This thing is going in the trash!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!! I have very fine eyelashes and it curled them beautifully without pinching.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler rocks! I use one everyday, I keep one in my bag and in my car, anywhere I might do my makeup, lol. This is by far the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the best quality!</li>
    <li> The travel bag ripped as soon as I received the item. Also did not come with a refill pad and the other one falls out all the time. I saw such great reviews too bad.</li>
    <li> does an amazing job curling my lashes! LOVE it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> okay so i am one of those girls who has gone through about 500 eyelash curlers since i have started wearing makeup...just because, you know, they all do the same thing.  Well, this one is ways different.  My eyelashes were actually COMFORTABLE being curled! normally its like that painful pull for 5-7 seconds and then its done.  but not with this one!  Like i said...it was comfortable! I was confused.  I was like wait...i can&#x27;t be doing this right.  But then when i moved it, my lashes were curled better than ever!!!  Not that weird curl straight up that you get from cheap curlers.  This was like an elegant, natural looking curl.  And it lasted for hours even after i applied my mascara. Buy this and never go back to cheap, crappy lash curlers again!!</li>
    <li> The one thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is that it is a tad more difficult to hold the eye lash curler in place due to the locking/unlocking mechanism.If you had any type of arthiritis or carpal tunnel syndrome, you might have problems.  The other point is that it is made out of metal and is cold when you hold it against your face.Nice that they have included an extra sponge for the curler.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected from all the reviews I saw. It was hard to curl my eyelashes. I thought it would be an amazing eyelash curler, but I have used $3 eyelash curlers that have done the job even better.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! I have super curly lashes and I have to use a curler to straighten my lashes. It has cut down my lash time in half! With my old curler it would pinch, sometimes bleed, well not anymore! Don&#x27;t hesitate! Just buy it! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipping! Excellent Product! Love it! I used SHU Umera eye lash curler previously and I like this one even better!&lt;br /&gt;I have super short thin lashes and this curler makes me look like my 13 lashes turn into 30! Thanks Fuchia!</li>
    <li> The INSTA-CURLER eyelash curler is a big upgrade from the average curler&#x27;s from the drugstore.  I was so tired of pinching my eyelids and ripping out eyelashes.  *Shivers at the thought*.  This eyelash curler feels durable, it&#x27;s comfortable to use, and it is cute.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Bam! This curler knocks all of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; curlers out of the park! Easy to use, high performance, accessory that delivers! Pleasantly surprised and immediately included in my daily makeup routine!</li>
    <li> After a couple useages it just didn&#x27;t do the job, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works as described. Extremely happy with the purchase! Would recommend</li>
    <li> Great curler, I use eyelash strips and this works awesome on them... does not stick or pull</li>
    <li> I love it!  This takes the guesswork out of how to use an eyelash curler.  Even better, it doesn&#x27;t pinch my skin like other eyelash curlers have in the past.  I love the little extras too!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I probably prefer my Tweezerman for everyday use. That said, if you follow the directions and use a blow dryer for a few seconds on this before curling, my daughter says it works crazy well! So, would be great if you are going out and want to look extra polished without overdoing the makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler!  It presses your lashes gently and it doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt your eyelids. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> First of all, the packing is so pretty. Very feminine and girlie. I was excited about these because I have never owned or used and eyelash curler before. These don&#x27;t pinch and they make my lashes look great.</li>
    <li> this is a gift hope they like it</li>
    <li> Great curler but nothing out of the ordinary for the price!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest curler I&#x27;ve tried.  The quality is really good.  I like the scissor like mechanism. It makes holding it and clamping down easy.  I think anyone who orders this will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product description is right on, no pinching which is awesome.  Love it when a product is as expected.</li>
    <li> Im so in love... not only is it super cute but it works AWESOME. I have been thinking about buying a higher end curler but no need to now.. im super pleased... ty :)</li>
    <li> I love this curler!!!  Not only is it very pretty but it is does not pinch when I use it! I haven&#x27;t been able to use curlers because they always hurt too much but with this curler no pinching and easy grip!  My eyelashes are looking so gorgeous now!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Shipping came in fast</li>
    <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Mehhhh... not all that.</li>
    <li> This is a nice fancy eyelash curler ... I find that the old fashioned metal ones did exactly the same job though...</li>
    <li> I like the way this curler leaves my lashes, but the curl won&#x27;t stay for long, like in other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! Probably one of the best eyelash curlers I have ever used and I&#x27;m talking about using it without heat. Yes, your lashes really do curl more using the low heat setting on your blow dryer for just a few seconds.I also love that it comes in it&#x27;s own little pouch.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler. I didn&#x27;t realize how hard I had to clamp with my previous curler, not with this one, barely have to clamp. I love the funky and vibrant pink colors. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler. Not once have I pinched my eye or had uncomfortable pulling. Seems very sturdy and fits comfortably in my hand. Also my lashes look great after using it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s okay in my book.  I have tried other curlers that did a much more effective job at curling my lashes.  This is a nice looking curler.  I love the colors!  I like that it comes with a plastic clip to close the wand, and the clear plastic bag to store it in.  The price is not bad.  However, I had a little difficulty getting it close enough to my lashes to do the best job curling all those lashes.  I still can&#x27;t put my finger on why that is. I might need to try it after applying my mascara.  I will try it that way and update this review, if my opinion changes.  I honestly like my Shiseido eyelash curler much more.</li>
    <li> Love these! They curl my eyelashes really well.  My sister asked me if I had fake eyelashes on!</li>
    <li> This is the first eyelash curler that i own and i love it.It does it job very well.I don&#x27;t think i will ever buy any other curler,very easy to use and no twitching or pinching felt while using it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used an eyelash curler, DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE! It&#x27;s a good first curler; yes it&#x27;s cute and a pain free device, but it&#x27;s unless as a curler... I WANT MY $15 DOLLARS BACK! (please note I did NOT heat up the wand as suggested in the User&#x27;s Manual, but not necessary for use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I bought my first manual curler (made by Revlon) at an outlet store. I used it for years, but I wanted a new one and found one on Amazon I liked. After it arrived I quickly noticed is was the wrong one! Amazon gave me a refund and I went back to my Revlon one. After finding this one and reading reviews, I picked this one for it&#x27;s design, feel and &amp;#34;no pinch design&amp;#34;. I&#x27;M SO DISAPPOINTED! I&#x27;m going to my local Walmart, and re-purchasing my first Revlon eyelash curler for under $3.</li>
    <li> I give 4 star because when I tried I still felt pinching a little but it is way better than regular eyelash curler. loved it!</li>
    <li> Yep! No more pinching!! Great tool ❤️</li>
    <li> Wow love this curler use it twice and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with my new curler it compares to no other. I&#x27;m super picky about my eye lash curler and u all have made my day .. and my eyelashes. . I can&#x27;t say enough good ..I love how it springs back on it own .. and the fact the it&#x27;s black and pink ... my favorite colors ... make this curler even better . thanks so much ..</li>
    <li> It barely curled my lashes...don&#x27;t always have time to use the hair dryer with it...</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Love them!</li>
    <li> I love this curler! It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull your eyelashes off like all the others do. I strongly recommend it you will love it! I was a little leary at first but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try cause I won&#x27;t use any other. Their customer service is also exceptional. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> OMG, no pinching &amp; heat the pink pad for a few seconds w/the blow dryer @ you have perfectly curled lashes like a baby. Love these!</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister and she says it&#x27;s ok. Curls her lashes but still pinches a lil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this at a promotional price.  My review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I am impressed. This works so much better than the standard curler. Comfortable grip, good tension, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Totally love the quality of this curler, it makes everything so easy and didn&#x27;t take my eyelashes out after using it. It also comes with cute packaging. Good product!!!</li>
    <li> Best Eyelash curler I ever owned! I love everything about it! Great Curler! So glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I curled my eyelashes without the heat and it&#x27;s alright. Still didn&#x27;t have the time to try it with heat, so I hope it won&#x27;t be a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This product has good value, will worth your dollars.</li>
    <li> Wow! This eyelash curler is great! It makes a huge noticeable difference with my eyelashes. It&#x27;s very easy and straightforward to use. I never really use to bother much with eyelash curlers, but I recently decided to give them a try. I&#x27;m so happy that I did, and that I chose this brand. Honestly one of the best eyelash curlers around. Also the customer service is fantastic! They check-up on you and make sure everything is going great for you. I felt like I truly mattered as a customer. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the curler but it says it comes with a refill pad and mine did not. I&#x27;m reaching out to see if it&#x27;s just described wrong ir if my package was incomplete.</li>
    <li> I love this curler. The shipping was fast. The seller is in contact with you to make sure you receive the product. I feel ver happy/ satisfied with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I have long straight eyelashes. This is a tool I have to use everyday or I will look sleepy all day, being so I need a good eyelash curler. It took me a while to get used to its different design compared to the previous one I used, but now I really like it. Within seconds I have curly lashes.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Have it, love it, won&#x27;t live without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what makes it different or better, but it&#x27;s definitely better; I threw my other (pretty decent!) eyelash curler in the trash!  I hated using it because it hurt my lids--  this one does NOT,  and I LOVE it!!!!  I would say &amp;#34;life-changing&amp;#34;, but that might make me seem a little loser-ish-  over an eyelash curler -  but I really do love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! I was never a fan of curlers, however, This one is exempted! It gives you that perfect curl :)</li>
    <li> I received my Insta-Curler and I love it.... It was shipped fast and got here before it was scheduled. Loving my Insta-Curler and the color is so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am baffled by all these outstanding reviews, I just do not like this curler at all. It doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes, and it&#x27;s way too big and technical. I like the grips on it and the color but that is it. I feel sad that I just wasted $10. My cheap drugstore one works way better than this one and I guess that is what i&#x27;ll be sticking to from now on.  **Customer service is outstanding, they gave me a full refund of the product without me having to send it back. The product didn&#x27;t work for me but this was worth mentioning!</li>
    <li> Love my new deluxe eyelash curler. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> wow! best curler i&#x27;ve ever tried...love the way it curled my lashes!!</li>
    <li> I am sure there are plenty of you out here that use these things and love them. Not me, I don&#x27;t know if I am just not using it right or what but they do nothing for me.</li>
    <li> hi. let me begin my review by saying i have tried probably about ten different lash curlers in my lifetime. i&#x27;ve tried all the middle range brands (revlon, sally hansen, sephora) and some high-end ones (shu uemura, tweezerman, chanel).  ALL of them promised to &amp;#34;never pinch&amp;#34; but unfortunately all of them did!  i accepted this fact to be one of those things i could never change and thus accepted my morning eyelid pinches as &amp;#34;just one of those things.&amp;#34;  however, despite my daily pinches, i was always on the lookout for an alternative.  i have to admit, amazon has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; site for most of the things in my life. so naturally, i researched eye curlers on amazon and came across this little beauty. first of all, i love pink so OF COURSE the name alone caught my attention. and then i read the reviews and was totally wowed by every single one. i popped the curler in my cart and two days later had it in my hand. BUT before it even arrived, i received an email from cammy, a co-founder of &amp;#34;fuchsia&amp;#34; the company that manufactures. in her email she thanked me for ordering her product and saying she&#x27;d be in touch once i&#x27;d received it to check if i was happy with it! then another email to find out if i had received it. talk about customer service! i&#x27;ve never experienced that level of professionalism from a company and that alone set the tone for my overall expectations from the curler.  once i received it, i noticed the packaging is phenomenal. the curler was safely ensconced inside a plastic see-through travel case. it is very lightweight which means it doesn&#x27;t require much effort to press together and curl your lashes. the very best part is it DIDN&#x27;T PINCH AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yipeeeeeeeeeee!!!!! finally, lashes curled and no watery eyes!  but wait, it gets better. not only did the curler not pinch my eyes, it left my lashes so sexily curled and full, my mascara immediately clung on and right now i have the eyelashes i&#x27;ve dreamt about for so long and didn&#x27;t shed a tear to get them!  so, to recap, the product is amazing - it does what it says and the customer service is outstanding. i would definitely recommend this curler to all my friends and to all of you, dear amazon shoppers!for so long and didn&#x27;t shed a tear to get them!  so, to recap, the product is amazing - it does what it says and the customer service is outstanding. i would definitely recommend this curler to all my friends and to all of you, dear amazon shoppers!</li>
    <li> This has been the only lash curler I have purchased that actually does what it says its does....curl!  The heating aspect is brilliant!  This will be my curler from now on.  Thanks Fuchsia!</li>
    <li> Best Eyelash Curler I have ever purchased.  It curls much better and it lasts longer.  This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the bomb! I was was skeptical that it would really work as well as they claimed online, especially since I had gotten quite comfortable with my cheap drugstore brad curler that always seemed to do the bare minimum for my lashes. I am pleased to say that I was proven very wrong! I curled my eyelashes yesterday morning, and they are still curled!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was graced with stick straight, hard to curl lashes, and I think I have found my holy grail of eyelash curlers!&lt;br /&gt;I did have to get used to curling with it, as the shape was a little different than my drugstore one, but it is a good change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> great, just as advertised, great experience as a purchaser.</li>
    <li> Very durable product, works great and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This is just the right curler for me, when positioned right against my eyelid, it doesn&#x27;t pinch. It curls very well! The finger grips are also very comfortable. The item itself seems durable and it feels like it is very well constructed. And of course...it is also a very pretty looking device! Just judging by how well this feels constructed, I don&#x27;t anticipate having to buy another curler for a good while!</li>
    <li> The DELUXE Eyelash Curler is a stylish and super attractive looking eyelash curler. In the past when I have used the cheap eyelash curlers, they would pinch my eyelids, or pull my eyelashes, making it very painful, plus they never would get the inner corners of my lashes when I would curl them, so I quit using them. The Deluxe Eyelash Curler is similar, but very different. First off, I love that it doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids, or pull my beautiful lashes out!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for full and gorgeous eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Love....they works so well</li>
    <li> The DELUXE Eyelash Curler has a very professional and beautiful design.  I love the pretty fuchsia color.  That adds a very nice and feminine touch.  The curler does a great job curling my eyelashes.  It does not pinch my eyelids nor does it pull out my eyelashes.  I give this very well made product a five out of five stars.  I do recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler.  It is comfortable to use and it safely curls my lashes in the prettiest way.  It comes with a nifty little storage bag and an extra pad, and its happy fuschia color makes it easy to find in my somewhat messy makeup drawer!</li>
    <li> Somehow it does not curl my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler, it holds my lashes up all day. Many of the eyelash curlers that I have used usually weighs my lashes down, and it goes straight after about 5 hours. This curlers has a pretty color to it, and it clamps the lashes very tight. I have noticed a big difference when I use this eyelash curler compare to other brand of curlers. This curler also doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent this Eyelash Curler for review through FUCHSIA Line on a discount. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective.</li>
    <li> Yeahh I am so happy with this curler. Easy to handle and soft against my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have a nickel sensitivity so have always had to use a plastic curler. The only problem is that they don’t last very long. I was excited to find this curler that had such strong reviews PLUS a comment that someone with a nickel sensitivity didn’t seem to have a problem with this curler but she also said the metal doesn’t come into contact with her skin. I don’t know what she meant, but the metal part of the curler definitely contacts my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the curler does not allow me to get close to the lash line and I have to press it against my face such that it leaves a mark. Then when I curl one side, it looks no different from the uncurled side. So far, after about 3 uses, I have not a nickel reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this an extra star for the very responsive customer service. Cammy encouraged me to return the curler for a refund since it doesn&#x27;t work for me so that is exactly what I am going to do.</li>
    <li> I placed a order for this curler 3 days ago and received it within two days ! Also got a email from the manufacturer thanking me for my purchase and was told I will be hearing from them in a couple business days asking how I&#x27;m liking my purchase ( I really liked that) not most manufacturers take the time out and send their buyers and email ! KUDOS! ... As far as the curler it does its job well. I have pretty long lashes and it seems to be curling it just fine, but unfortunately it makes couple of my eyelashes stick together because the excess mascar from the lashes stick to the top of the curler which cause the eyelashes to stick together when using it. Maybe, after a couple of uses I can better utilize it and figure out how it won&#x27;t stick my lashes together, but till then 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler. I am going through menopause and losing my eyelashes and this curler makes it look like I have thick eyelashes. I curl them and just put on a coat of mascara and I&#x27;m good to go. Very well crafted. Love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Valtri</li>
    <li> I opened it up and threw it away because the pad was missing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really try a lot of different things when it comes to make up or anything to do with my eyes... I saw this eye lash curler and I for some reason had to try it... I LOVE it❤️ I don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure and I don&#x27;t feel like it is ripping out my eye lashes... I would recommend this to anyone who likes to show off their eyes❤️</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the instructions and tried it both heated and not. I think it may be a little too wide for my eyes. However, the curler seems very well made and like it would last a long time. I was just going to cut my losses and throw it in a drawer, but I received an email from Cammy, co-founder of the company, asking me how I liked it. I explained the above to her and she responded indicating she had issued a full refund. I had not even asked for a refund! WHAT AMAZING SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while this didn&#x27;t work for me (maybe my lashes just suck?), I would still recommend others give it a try. Thank you, Cammy!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to open the package and try this item!!! This is probably the cutest curlers ever. I LOVE PINK! the grips are super comfortable. I love tue fact that it comes with a spare cushion, just in case. Great product!</li>
    <li> It was a very nice touch of the company to include an instructions manual, I have never seen that before with a curler;I like the black and pink color combination and it has been working great.</li>
    <li> works great!  this is the first eyelash curler that doesnt pinch my skin when i use it plus its cute!</li>
    <li> I have the straightest eyelashes  I couldn&#x27;t believe it actually curled my lashes and they stayed curled  they didn&#x27;t hurt me either  great product</li>
    <li> This is a good curler for the price. I love the colors.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this eyelash curler and I was skeptical, is it really that great? It is. I had an older one that I had bought at a drugstore and it was doing funny things to my lashes plus it would leave a mark on my face after I used it. I saw this one and it&#x27;s reviews and decided to order. This one gives your lashes a natural looking curl, the lashes are not bent (like my old one would do) 2 swipes of mascara and I have great lashes all day! I haven&#x27;t pinched myself and it only leaves a tiny spot where is rested on my cheek instead of a whole line, like my other one. I like the color of it too! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews. I was first impressed that I received a thank you email directly from the seller. Like I truly matter. This increased my excitement to get my product. I was weirded out by the option to slightly heat the curler with a blow dryer but I tried it anyhow! I am delightfully impressed. My lashes are as straight as they come, nothing would curl them, until this curler. .</li>
    <li> Love my eyelash curler! Well made, easy to use, gentle, and works very well on my eyelashes!</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I really thought this would be great but it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes very well. It took several minutes to make my lashes curl the way I wanted it. So its not as great as I expected!</li>
    <li> Bought a ton of stuff from Amazon before but this is the first product that makes me wants to write a review! This eyelash curler is amazing!!!!!! I have tried the shu uemera which claimed is one of the best one on the market, but was not happy with end results. So when I saw this product with hundreds of positive reviews, I decided to give it a chance. People, let me you this: this curler will not and does not pinch you eyelid! It also fits perfectly in my eye socket. Best lash curler ever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Would be happy to purchase again when needed - thank you so much for making a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt, I love it!</li>
    <li> I received theINSTA_CURLER and love it! I have been using it and it works really nice. My lashes get that nice curl and it helps the mascara shows nice. I don&#x27;t like to use fake eyelashes (last time I tried they destroyed my lashes)  so I rely on the curler to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; the lashes after applying mascara and it works beautifully. Thanks</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the curler.  It curls without pinching or crimping lashes at an odd angle. I&#x27;m able to curl my lashes &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; with this curler, which makes my lashes look longer (cause they are pointing toward the sky, but in a good way!). This is the best curler I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used some of the best.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy. I&#x27;ve had other curlers that fell apart or the grips on the handles fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating it up slightly on warm really works and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the curler warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying these!</li>
    <li> GREAT CURLER...AS ADVERTISED AND VERY PROMPT DELIVERY. COMPANY CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS, EXCELLENT FOLLOW-UP.</li>
    <li> I tried it with and without the 5 second, low heat hair dryer option. It worked better with the heat, in fact, my eyelashes stayed curled almost  all day! Don&#x27;t believe I have ever had that happen before. The curl usually lasts only a little while if I don&#x27;t use mascara. It&#x27;s a little bigger and thicker than other curlers I have used, but isn&#x27;t difficult to use and seems well made and like it will last a long time. And the cost is less than a lot of the curlers I have tried, too. I think the cost and the effectiveness  of this curler make it one of the best options out there!</li>
    <li> Works soooo good! Isn&#x27;t rough with my lashes at all I feel like I can curl them really well with this!</li>
    <li> As good as the other branded curler. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality eyelash curler.  it does not hurt or pinch my eyelids.</li>
    <li> For the price I expected to be wowed. It&#x27;s a basic curler and I actually think my off brand I bought from Marshall&#x27;s last time works a lot better for 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> First off, when you use it it pinches your eyelid. Second of all, no matter how hard I try I cannot get this product to curl my lashes that great, and yes I know how to use an eyelash curler. When I do finally manage to somewhat curl them they drop in less than 5 minutes. It&#x27;s also really hard to grasp my lashes with this curler since they&#x27;re not that long. I was able to curl my lashes way better with a spoon.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have not had an eye lash curler that has really done the trick. But this one does.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best curler I&#x27;ve ever used. Feels very high quality for the great price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Also, super sweet follow up from the company to make sure I was happy with it. Great product and service.</li>
    <li> This was an overpriced curler. It is no better than store curlers at half the price. Even tried using heat as described in the instruction booklet but did not deliver. Very unhappy!</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty!  This eyelash curler is very well constructed and will last FOREVER!  It&#x27;s easy to use and fits well on my hands. It doesn&#x27;t get stuck on my finger and thumb like my old pair did.  Have already recommended to friends and family!  The users guide was helpful and love that it comes with a travel bag.</li>
    <li> It arrived yesterday and I tried the eyelash curler this&lt;br /&gt;morning.  YES, it does work better than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried or used&lt;br /&gt;(and I&#x27;m 66).  I just checked my lashes now (3 hours after curling them)&lt;br /&gt;and they are still pretty much curled.  My problem has more been when I got&lt;br /&gt;outside and the lashes get hit with outdoor air - especially now in&lt;br /&gt;Wisconsin when it is winter.  That happening is not the fault of any curler&lt;br /&gt;but rather my super straight lashes - which match the stick straight and&lt;br /&gt;very fine hair on my head.  Anyway, yes they do work better than anything&lt;br /&gt;else and now I can&#x27;t wait for the weekend to curl and then apply some&lt;br /&gt;mascara.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out lashes like most eyelash curlers. Easy to use with good control and results.</li>
    <li> Great Eye lash Curler does not pinch at all great quality easy to manage fashionable to carry in your purse curls beautifully I have let many of my friends try it out for themselves but its mine so they have to get their own.Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> After buying this product, I realized that I look weird with curled eyelashes. Too girly for my manly frame. And so I gave it to my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. My girlfriend has curled eyelashes now!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:968b25857ad44f1211ac4c2a8fec9db2]] This is a little product review, just my opinions on this lash curler and showing you all what you get when you buy it.  I was very impressed, I use lash curlers everyday and this one not only has a better and more comfortable curl but it&#x27;s also nice looking and comes in pretty packaging. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a better lash curler and to anyone looking to purchase a gift for someone who loves makeup.  The thing I liked best was that in the pamphlet it comes with it tells you you can use a blowdryer on it to enhance the curl effect.  I got great results without doing that, but it was cool to know I could step it up from there too! Has a cool little clear bag to keep it in along with the extra rubber insert.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have never tried curling my eyelashes before receiving this attractive tool and have to say this tool made it so easy</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t crimp or pull out my eyelashes.  The hinge that rests on your cheek while you&#x27;re curling your lashes does push into your face a little, but overall a great little eyelash curler.  The company is awesome, they follow up with you and give you tips on how to use it.  Wonderful seller communication!</li>
    <li> I have been needing a new eyelash curler and I was very happy with this purchase.  The design is cute and I love the colors and the fact that it comes with the refill pads.  They are very gentle when curling your lashes.</li>
    <li> We all know how an eyelash curler works right? If not, it curls your lashes and gives them a nice fuller look when you apply your mascara. My fave part of this one is definitely the color and design! No pinching and just absolutely adorable.</li>
    <li> Swanky eye curler, cant wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Love this eyelash curler !it doesnt pinch my eyelids and my lashes stayed curled all day.</li>
    <li> Great product. Seems durable. Will update in a few months.</li>
    <li> Not only is this stylish and cute, it works perfectly! I have never curled my eyelashes before and just thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelash curler! I had never used one before, and the instructions made it super easy. It also came with a cute travel bag, and as promised, it did not pinch my eyelids. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This works well. I just have a hard time getting my lashes to curl. This product does not pinch my lids like others have. I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have really short eyelashes. I have 15 minutes to get ready in the morning so putting on makeup and primping isn&#x27;t high on my list. This curler is easy, quick, and effective! I was really surprised by the results. I can curl my eyelashes and it lasts all day. On most days, I don&#x27;t even use mascara (because I&#x27;m usually running so I don&#x27;t miss the bus) and it still makes a difference. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my lashes and some folks even think I&#x27;ve been going to salons to get them done. A great product!</li>
    <li> Insta curler works nicely much better than any of the average metal curlers. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is pretty phenomenal. I am a mom of five kids with short eyelashes and very little time to spare. But this product curled even my crappy short lashes in no time. The curler is sturdy. It feels well made and definitely not flimsy. I love the way it fits in my hand as though I am wielding a quality product. I think it is locally made -- although I am not 100 percent sure but I am sure the company is local. When I had a question, the response was very quick and they were extremely helpful (and they spoke good English!!!). I highly recommend this product especially for busy moms who know what its like to have to try and put on makeup with a toddler tugging on you.</li>
    <li> An ok lash curler, nothing special.  Best thing about it is the big handle.</li>
    <li> This is the best curler I have ever used. I absolutely love it! I will definitely purchase again when I need a replacement!</li>
    <li> My husband gave me this eyelash inst-curler and I love it, even kept it&#x27;s cure box, it looks and works great, just in time to replace my old crooked Shu uemura, I&#x27;ll definately get one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Perfect eyelash curler and no pinching!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the Cadilliac of eye lash curlers. No longer with I pinch and rip out my eyelashes with those other eyelash torture devices. I will be buying these for stocking stuffers this year to ensure that mine doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34; disappear&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This curler is great! Its honestly my new favorite curler! Its easy to use, doesn&#x27;t crimp my lashes and is really good quality!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy. I was afraid it would be cheaply made and was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived. High quality and more comfortable to use than my old one. Looks good too.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler!!!! Much better than the cover girl brand</li>
    <li> i love it and the color is so cute tho i hate you have to join  a membership in order to get it for 1$ but otherwise LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this curler, and the seller! I decided to purchase a new curler after my eyelashes proceeded to get stuck in my old one multiple times. It was painful and made my eyes water. I noticed that this curler had amazing reviews, so I decided to purchase it. It&#x27;s very comfortable, works wonderfully, and the colors are super cute. Also the seller has some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever seen. They emailed me and asked me to reply with my feedback about their product. They are super friendly.</li>
    <li> I curled my right eye eyelashes, held it for 30 seconds then moved on to my left eye by the time I got out my mascara the curl on my eyelashes on my right eye had gone down by 75% - this has never happened before. The only good thing I can say is that they don&#x27;t pinch my eyelid. But other than that I&#x27;m totally disappointed and I&#x27;m going to go back and use my old Revlon Curler until I can buy another one.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived with flakes of the black paint already off in the package. The holes for your fingers are very small making it hard to grasp and the curve of the curler is too steep; it doesn&#x27;t fit well against the eye as a result. Returned.</li>
    <li> Love the Fuchsia it works great and nothing was wrong with it. I ordered two. I love the way is curls my lashes and it doesn’t pinch my eye lid which it wonderful. And the curl in my lashes last longer by heating it with my blow dryer on the low setting for 5 seconds. I really needed an eyelash curler and I am glad I purchased this one.</li>
    <li> This is the first eyelash curler I ever owned that didn&#x27;t pinch! Its easy to use and I love the color. What a great beauty product. I will be getting more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I love it! It works well for my thin, short eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler ever. Beside it being pretty and easy to use, it didnt pinch my skin !! What a great product !!</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my daughter and she said it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler she has ever used. She absolutely loves it and has been using it everyday.</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curled I have tried! I love the ergonomic handle, very easy to use and comfortable in your hand. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I wish the curling end of it were a lighter color and not black. It is hard to see my eyelashes up against the black when I am curling them. I like to be sure I have all my lashes in and they are evenly spread out in the curler.  Because of the black color it makes it more difficult to do this.</li>
    <li> It looks nice, but I think the effect is over rated, also I don&#x27;t think it is suitable for Asian girls, the construction makes it push against my cheek bone under as Asian girls usually have smaller faces.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Feels nice and sturdy, easy to use, and does an amazing job of curling lashes comes with refill and a case, what more could you ask for!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on your lashes and it works very well. The design makes it comfortable in your hand and not awkward at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week now and I will have to say I LOVE it. It doesn&#x27;t pinch, the curler part is a nice size and should fit all eyes perfectly. The curl stays all day too! I will be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> This has worked no better than a $4 drug store lash curler....  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> great curler! Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pinch. Comes with a little carrying case and an extra pad. Great customer service too.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler that I have ever used. I really like the grips because I have many times had my old curlers slip and rip out my eyelashes. The crimp is great and makes a pretty curl.</li>
    <li> An improvement over traditional drug store metal curlers... but then anything is an improvement over those.</li>
    <li> After having most of my thyroid removed, my eyelashes would not curl no matter what I tried. This curler works great and does not pinch. I will be buying several more. One for my office and one for each of my daughters and granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I was happy that I was able to find an eyelash curler for a Christmas present that didn&#x27;t break the bank. This worked out great and my friend loved it!</li>
    <li> Happy Tween She loves it. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. I always use an eyelash curler or my eyelashes poke me in the eye. I had found a really great one a couple of years ago, but it was plastic and I dropped it and it broke. Since then I&#x27;ve used several different kinds. They all work, but eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know WHY I love this one. But I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I do. Something about the way it rests against my face makes it hit my eyelashes at the perfect spot, without pinching my eyelid. It curled REALLY fast and easily. And while I don&#x27;t usually have the problem with curlers pulling my lashes, this one... well, I can barely feel it. You&#x27;d think it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, but it definitely is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t had any &amp;#34;kinks&amp;#34; in my lashes so far. Sometimes with the other curlers it was almost like they&#x27;d fold my lashes right in half and give them a right angle. Not exactly what I&#x27;m going for, ya know? So far this one hasn&#x27;t even come close to doing that. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s capable. I even squeezed a little harder today to see if I could make it do it and it didn&#x27;t happen. So maybe this is my answer? I&#x27;m wondering if I can order more pad refills because I&#x27;d like to buy them NOW in case they go out of business before I need more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyelash curler for a couple of weeks now and am very impressed so far. I like the comfortable feel on my fingers when using it. The quality seems very nice and durable. The curler itself works great and adds a nice curl to my lashes that are naturally sort of short and straight. It is completely painless to use and does not yank any lashes out. It does a great job of prepping my lashes before I apply my mascara and really opens up my eyes. An added bonus is the color combination of hot pink and black, super cute!</li>
    <li> its alright ,ten dollars too much.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use.  It does not pull out my lashes from getting stuck and i have yet to pinch myself (thought that is user error vs design).  It is super cute and love the travel bag and that it comes with a replacement pad.  The plastic piece that holds it closed is nice and sturdy as well.  Good Buy!</li>
    <li> Great deal for a trendy makeup tool. Packaging is great quality as well.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing. Gave to a friend of mine, so I do not have first hand experience using this product, but my friend assures me it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I received my curler Tuesday and have used it 3 days now. Every curler needs some getting used to. I typically curl my eyelashes before applying mascara because they are already quite long and dark. This curler is of high quality look and feel. My last cheap one wouldn&#x27;t hold the curling pad toward the end of it&#x27;s life. This one seems like it will last longer, in my case it will last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative thing about this curler is it has trouble grabbing my small top lashes on the outer sides of my eyes. It likes to curl those few bottom hairs up. I think it could be a little small for my eyes. I will find techniques to better grab those lashes the more I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate all the fine reviews and I was pleasantly surprised to feel the luxury of this eyelash curler. I do hope the pads last long as well.</li>
    <li> Not only does it come in my favorite colors, but this curl has some weight and keeps steady when attempting to curl some rather short lashes - well, i thought they were until I used this and then some mascara - it works real well, much better than the cheap ones - (I rarely use make-up, but when I do, I like to look not so made-up - this works for that)</li>
    <li> I bought this curler and have been using it for the past 5 months and I absolutely love it! I took into consideration while reading other reviews that the holes where your fingers go through to hold it are a little small but since my hands and fingers are on the smaller side, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it. I put on makeup frequently so I use this curler almost daily and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Seriously the BEST customer service EVER! I received my package without instructions so I replied to an email I had received from Cammy thanking me for my order to let her know- I got an email almost instant with a little note attached and the instructions. That says a lot about a company! I am very happy : ) I tried the curler and it lives up to all the hype, I will not ever use any other eyelash curler. My lashes curled better than they ever have, they look amazing and adding my mascara to them, wow my eyes look so much bigger, brighter &amp; sexier. Not to mention that the product is just so pretty in pink!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome worth the money curler! I totally recommend it! So soft and gentle and curls well!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is built well and sturdy, made of strong metal instead of the flimsy stuff you normally see.  The pad is also not made of that craptastic foam material you see in other curlers, its a sturdy rubber material and comes with an extra one just in case.  It was easy to use and did not pinch me at all.  I would definitely buy it again if I had to.</li>
    <li> Fuchsia Line deluxe eyelash curler professional - bought on a review promo and boy did I need a change - I have been using the old metal Revlon one for like a million years.  Why!!!!!!! I love the finger grips on this it doesn&#x27;t fly out of my fingers - the metal one is slippery. Does a great job my eyelashes curled and I could get down to the base with this curler - love love love!!!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, product exactly as described. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is not only really pretty but it also works really well. I love the black and pink colors and I think it actually makes it stand out from other eyelash curlers. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it curled my eyelashes very well specially since my eyelashes are short and thin. I personally think this eyelash curler is the perfect size for my hands and for my eyes. I also love the box that it comes in which protected it from being damaged through the delivery process! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same eyelash curler for years, and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing! I didn&#x27;t heat before curling, and I still got much more of a curl than with my old curler. It&#x27;s also a lot more comfortable to use than the all metal type.</li>
    <li> GOT FOR DAUGHTER,She LOVES IT, The Color The Ease of Curing lashes Now! Getting Me One, Next Order...</li>
    <li> It works great, no pain.</li>
    <li> This really does make my lashes much longer than regular curlers. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Stylish and very effective! Makes my lashes super big! Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool! Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. Well made. Fast service. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Best of all great curl and no pinch.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - more comfortable to use than the generic metal curlers and long lasting curl</li>
    <li> Amazing product. No pinch like most eyelash curlers. Would  buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and customer service was excellent!</li>
    <li> Very fancy and cute..</li>
    <li> I love the softness of this curler, as it feels less like a torture tool than the others I have owned.  So much more gentle and yet very effective at curling my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product that works well mechanically.  I just felt that my eyelashes did not stayed curled that well with this product.</li>
    <li> very attractive tools!!!!</li>
    <li> The handles look like that of a scissors. The whole thing is very easy to grip because it&#x27;s fully cushioned and quite bulkier than normal stainless curlers made of pure stainless steel. It curls my lashes really well. I used to count 1 to 20 before with my old curler but with this, I only have to count to 10 to have perfectly curled lashes. I really like it plus the color is so cute!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, not as hard as i thought. Does curl your lashes</li>
    <li> This is easy to handle. Wish the plastic case closed better, either a button or different case to keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this has replaced even wearing mascara all the time (I still love my mascara though).</li>
    <li> I love the style. It works fine</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the appearance of the eyelash curler. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It curls great...I would feel confident just curling without using mascara afterwards. Leaves a dramatic impact on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made eyelash curler.  It has very substantial construction, and I feel it would last for quite awhile.  It curled my lashes very nicely.  The reason for 4 stars, is that the thumb hole in the finger grip is a bit small.  I&#x27;m a tall woman with large hands. In fact, I can&#x27;t really use the curler well, without bruising my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the customer service from this company (specifically Cammy) is beyond reproach.  I received an email asking for my opinion about the curler, and I mentioned that the small thumb hole was keeping me from using the curler.  Unfortunately, I had thrown away the packaging materials, and didn&#x27;t feel that I could return it for a refund.  I was resigned to losing the purchase price of the eyelash curler.  Cammy interceded on my behalf and issued a refund, stating that for a Fuchsia Line customer to experience a loss was unacceptable.  WOW!</li>
    <li> I was a little leery to buy this curler at first. Usually, I stay away from unknown brands in the beauty department. I have fairly long lashes so you would think that finding a good eyelash curler wouldn&#x27;t be an issue but it definitely is. I bought the Japonesque eyelash curler last year and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I ended up giving it to my sister in law. I tried this curler without mascara the first day...my lashes were still curled by the end of the day! I&#x27;ve tested it out all week and can say that this is the best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned! I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler that I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works fine! I haven&#x27;t tried the heating way but I noticed I do have to press more to curl my eyelashes. The quality is great and it is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty solid curler. I just need to learn to use it a little deeper on my lashes bc it a little thick it&#x27;s harder for me to get lower on the lash. Customer service is top notch! Would be loyal to brand for that a lone! Need more companies like this!</li>
    <li> I received the product completely broken,horrible experience</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m older and my lashes have thinned.  The Cutler helps to give the impression of fullness</li>
    <li> Curls eyelashes well, doesn&#x27;t hurt a lot unless you decide to move. Makes my lashes look superb!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the best makeup tool I&#x27;ve used. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase</li>
    <li> goooood!&lt;br /&gt;thank you~~~</li>
    <li> The Insta-curler is a great eyelash curler.  The packaging is pretty and I love the travel pouch and extra pad they included.  They also included a booklet that includes useful info.  The curler is extremely easy to use and very comfortable! I did not pinch myself once and that has happened a lot with other curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past, including high end ones.  I was able to get right up to the base of my upper eyelashes and give a tight squeeze on the handle giving me the tight curl I wanted.  The curler gives a nice tight curl that makes my eyes look wide and bright.  I love it!    Cammy, a co-founder of the company, is so nice and a dream to communicate with.  Cammy contacted me first asking for feedback on the curler.  Cammy really does care if you like the product and I find that is a rare trait in this world.  I know if I ever have a problem, I can count on Cammy to make it right.  That&#x27;s all I need to continue purchasing from them.</li>
    <li> This thing is incredible. I was iffy about it, as every eyelash curler tells you its going make you look like your eyes are outta this world. But this one reallllly delivers. Works great cool, or heated up quickly with a blow dryer. Great product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it has many fine qualities.  Unfortunately, both finger holes are the same size and that size is too small for my thumb.  It&#x27;s quite uncomfortable. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I just love these! Manual was missing but seller was quick to produce one for me!</li>
    <li> Have only used 2x.  Incredible results (with NO pinching) have converted me into a believer.  Had been using a Tarte eyelash curler...this is far superior.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about getting this lashe curler. Read all the positive reviews and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. It does not pull my lashes like other metal curlers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love my new eyelash curler! Has a very comfortable grip while curling your lashes. Comes in a handy clear reusable pouch along with an extra pink pad. Curls the lashes great! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> In love! This is the nicest lash curler I have ever owned. It is so well made. the handles are nice and solid for easier grasping and control. There is no pinching. My lashes were perfectly curled and ready for mascara application! Not to mention the are so pretty! I am happy to recieve this fantastic curler to review. I love it!</li>
    <li> So I tried this eyelash curler a few times already. With that being said, 8 was not too impressed. I have purchased other ones from Walmart and they seemed to work better. They were hard to get a good grip on your lashes, but when I did manage to I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. I got them at a discouted price so it was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> The product works great. It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> Effective and stylish curler!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever had and I am sixty something so been around for a while.  Super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt your fingers when you squeeze handles together.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gone through many eyelash curlers. The first one I ever had was a cheap, metal one from Walmart. So i dont have much to compare this too lol. It&#x27;s cute, very high quality, and it does what it says. My lashes curl flawlessly with this thing and I always notice a difference if I forget to use it with my mascara. I was kind of surprised to read that the unit should be replaced after 6 months. With the quality of the product, I don&#x27;t see why. But I guess I&#x27;ll see in 6 months if it falls apart on me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She said that her eyelash curler is her most-used and favorite beauty accessory, and she adores the Fuschia Insta-Curler.  Thanks so much for making such a wonderful product - it earned me major brownie points!</li>
    <li> It is very fancy, practical, and leaves beautiful eyelashes</li>
    <li> Works as it should, heated it up, curled my lashes! Perfect! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love if it&#x27;s cute easy to use and it&#x27;s so cute ..</li>
    <li> Good Eyelash Curler. Love The Color Of It The Most But Works Like Most Eye Lash Curlers You Can Purchase From Any Drugstore.</li>
    <li> I believe this is my first review..and I buy a lot of products on amazon. This product and company truly deserves 5 stars. The product itself works extremely well. I have Asian eye lashes, which means that they are extremely straight and difficult to curl. Then when you do get it to curl, applying mascara will make them straight again. When I use this eyelash curler not only do my lashes curl they stay curled after applying mascara. If only I had found you sooner. I use this in combination with It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you ever have any issues with your order, FUCHSIA Line will resolve them immediately. They respond to e-mails within a couple of hours and have excellent customer service. All I can say is, I am done searching for an eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I threw out all my eye lash curlers. I had a top notch gold and black one from Revlon, the pink and silver one from Avon and the cheapo from Maybelline that I kept because I had so many extra refill cushions. My biggest pet peeve about the top brands is that the cushion rings inside the finger slots always come out so you keep putting them back in until it pisses you off enough to just throw them away. I know you all know what I&#x27;m talking about. Granted, this one is more pricey so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase it at a introductory Amazon launch price I jumped at the chance to try it. First off, they don&#x27;t sell curlers like this at the store. I&#x27;ve personally never seen such quality which makes this the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It has heavy duty one piece construction. Holding it and using it is ergonomically correct unlike the others. It curls in a quick 5 seconds per eye instead of having to do 3 sets of 5 like a work out.. It appears to be unbreakable and even the curler cushion looks highly more durable and longer lasting than all the others and they provide you with a spare. Don&#x27;t lose it!</li>
    <li> Great product, bought it for my wife, and she loves it. She advised that it is easy to use, and very effective and durable.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler!  In comparison to the metal &amp;#34;makeup name brand&amp;#34; one I was using from a drug store, I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-that the part you put around your eye has a more compact shape so that you can get in closer to the eye to get a good angle on the eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;-the grip/handle is more comfortable&lt;br /&gt;-It has a good tension that makes it easy to use/control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hung on to my old one for a couple of weeks while I tried this out, just to make sure this was going to work for me, but once the verdict was in, I tossed the old one!</li>
    <li> Still pinches, though a more &amp;#34;cushiony&amp;#34; pinch.</li>
    <li> As good as my MAC curler. has a very nice grip and doesn&#x27;t lose any lashes as you curl. Evenly grabs and curls. the rubber insert stays in place, versus my MAC which always falls out. This has definitely become my favorite curler.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service. It actually works on my impossible to curl lashes and it keeps them curled, which is something I&#x27;ve never gotten ANY lash curler to do.</li>
    <li> I received my eyelash curler two days ago, I used it today and I absolutely love it. There were not problems or defects that I have noticed thus far and am very satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Morgan</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are very hard to curl.  This curler was actually able to get them all in and do the job with no pulling or stretching</li>
    <li> Hope this help some gals out there who love to have nice curled lashes like me.  I decided to give this eyelash curler a try based on reviews and to try something new to see if it could give my lashes a better curl.  This curler was nothing special, save your money...this curled just as good as the Revlon brand eyelash curler I normally get for half the price.  Sure the color is a cute pink, and the packaging is nice.....But, all in all, not impressed and would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is comfortable to grip, doesn&#x27;t pinch my lashes at all and leaves long lasting curl all day long. I also love the little plastic piece that holds the curler together so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my makeup bag. Also, it&#x27;s pretty so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use and works very well.  I even bought a 2nd one for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler I have owned, and I&#x27;ve owned a lot. This one maybe a little more expensive, but it does not pull out or tug on my lashes, and i don&#x27;t have many to lose. I have yet to lose a lash from curling them. I won&#x27;t go back to the cheaper brands! You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It curls your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t pinch, it&#x27;s easy to use.  Definitely the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried.  Just seems to be the right size and degree of curve.  They recommend heating the curler for 5 seconds with a hairdryer first, which does improve the quality of the curl you get and how long it lasts.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this curler, I asked for it for Christmas and was excited to try it, when I used it I fell in love with it! I do heat it with a dryer so I went through the refills pretty quickly.  so, I went to re-order some but couldn&#x27;t find any,  so since the curler was on sale I bought 3 because I was afraid it was going to disappear and I would not know where to get them.....I absolutely love the no pinch, I can get sooooo close to the lid and curl away! This is by far the best investment in a curler I&#x27;ve ever made.  my lashes never have a bad day, and I&#x27;m getting so many comments on my eyes! I am so glad I investigated this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m not a fan of this curler. With all of the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d found an end to my search for the perfect curler...no such luck. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a defect, but the area around the spring was slanted (warped maybe?) when I got it. Maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me or maybe that&#x27;s just how it was made.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler!!!! I have short eyelashes and other curlers would pinch my eyelids. This curler does not pinch at all! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this isn&#x27;t working as well as I had hoped. I have been trying to find a really good eyelash curler for awhile and my search is still on. This one is too large for my face and eyes. It&#x27;s difficult to see around the curler when I curl my left eye. I&#x27;m right handed. It also removes all of my eyeliner if I try to pump it hard to get some curl.</li>
    <li> Just received this yesterday. The packaging was beautiful and very well put together. It comes with a nice clear bag and a plastic bar to hold the two sides together to allow the curler to fit perfectly within the bag. It comes with a refill little cushion too! Love the colors of it and how comfortable it is to hold. It worked great for me, didn&#x27;t heat it up yet, but hoping to try that tomorrow. Also on the packaging, it says to contact them after 6 months to receive 50% off a replacement product, which I think it such a great way to get repeat customers! 5 stars for an overall awesome product!</li>
    <li> Does not work properly. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> got this product for review and Love it!!! i have eyelashes that dont show very well and this helps give them some pop with i apply mascara!!</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday. The delivery was super fast but the results were amazing!!! I have literally bought hundreds of eye lash curlers and never has these results. And customer service is even better My refill didn&#x27;t come in and they quickly made the situation right even though they would still get five stars in my book! I will be buying all three of my girls one, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I must say, I thought all eyelash curlers were created equal until I tried this. It fits against my lashes perfectly, produces a nice curl (not a kink like some) and is super comfortable to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but so far I really like it!  Seems to curl better than a lot of other products.</li>
    <li> Very nice curler and did not pinch skin.  Love the seller&#x27;s personal touch of writing when you buy something from them.  Very professional company.  The only negative was the plastic pouch it came in.  The band you slip the top through was broken and plastic very very poor quality, this they could improve on, just threw it away.  Other than that all positive</li>
    <li> I really hoped it was going to be a great product but it really sucked!</li>
    <li> I really like this that&#x27;s why i just want to write a review for this..it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I was so excited to try this. But after trying it, I&#x27;m so disappointed! Not sure if I got a faulty one but this barely curls my lashes. It did nothing no matter how long and tightly I held it. The directions say to put the curler under a blow-drier for optimal resuLts and I have to admit I didn&#x27;t try that. Who has time to for that every morning!? Is it too much to ask for to be able to just use an eye lash curler and expect somewhat curled lashes. So not worth the $20 (with shipping).</li>
    <li> Very high quality and sturdy product for a great price. I had previously used a Revlon eyelash curler, which was complete junk. The Fushia eyelash curler feels comfortable in your hand and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes in any way when using it. This company also makes it a point to reach out and contact you (via email) to ensure you are 100% happy with their product. That is something I&#x27;ve never experienced before (unless I contacted a company first due to a problem); to me, it demonstrates that this company cares about it&#x27;s customers and it&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyelash curler based on its high reviews. The item arrived on time as expected. When i opened and inspected the eyelash curler, the mechanism (as you can see in the picture) is not aligned properly and it looks like one end is loose. But when I used it to curl my lashes, it worked fine. It does its job, inspite of the crooked mechanism. The eyelash curler is great, it really does curl my lashes and &#x27;opens up&#x27; my already sparse lashes lol. I&#x27;m asian, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good eyelash curler that would work on my eyes. In order for my lashes to stay curled, the only mascara that I use that really keeps the curl, is the Maybelline Volume The Rocket mascara. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the only mascara that works miracle on my sparse lashes lol. High recommend Deluxe eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I was just about to email my daughters to tell them of the fantastic results I got from using your curler along with a new It’s So BIG mascara all from Amazon.  My curler is working well — I find the heated suggestion to be especially helpful!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler. After trying it I immediately threw away my old curler. It works great and doesn&#x27;t get stuck. I love the spring that keeps it open.</li>
    <li> good curler. and easy to hold. does not hurt my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler. I have arthritis in my right hand and this is the first curler that fits my swollen fingers. It also allows you to curl all of your lashes easily.</li>
    <li> I really like the design of this eyelash curler.  Very light and easy to use, however it takes a few times to getting it right or using it properly,but once you do,you will get great results every time.  I warm it up with my blow dryer for a few seconds and use it, the curl will last all day that way. I&#x27;m in love with this tool. It really is made of great quality and should last a long time even with daily use. I highly recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I buy most of my makeup from Sephora/Nordstrom, and after realizing my 15-year-old eyelash curler was ripping out my eyelashes, I realized I needed a new one! I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $15 on an eyelash curler, so I looked on Amazon and am SO glad I found Deluxe&#x27;s fuchsia. It&#x27;s affordable, well made, and works perfectly. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite Eyelash curler. It doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Good quality at affordable prices</li>
    <li> I admit to using a rather sad looking older curler so saw this and thought why not?  Glad I did as they are comfortable in your hand and work very well!  Nice product!</li>
    <li> Sturdier than any curler I&#x27;ve used, and it really seems to hold the curl. The pad is also very thick. All in all, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product, and it looks like it will last for some time. Shipping was nice and fast, and I appreciate the follow up emails from the company to check in on customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Just got this a couple days ago but used it today.. Love this product nice cruel lashes. It really work plus no pinch. Best thing is that its black and hot pink</li>
    <li> These are really nice. It works well and I like the colors of the eyelash curler. This is a nice addition to my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> It was love at first sight, and the feelings didn&#x27;t change with use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was on the spot thankful for purchase and follow-up making sure of delivery and delight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several - including heated battery operated junk, this works great. Packaged well with a clear pouch too keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And PRETTY too.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great, really makes my lashes look wonderful</li>
    <li> I had previously bought one of those $22 fancy big name curlers, which broke on me after about 3 months of poorly curling my lashes... I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This curler really does the trick and gives my thick lashes the boost they need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the chance, open the manual that comes with your curler and read the heating instructions. Though this is just a regular curler, preheating it for a few seconds with a blow dryer makes the curl last hours longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, great value!</li>
    <li> Provides a really great grip for better curling! The cute look and color are bonuses!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. My eyelashes are a pain to curl and I&#x27;ve used so many curlers even as far as spending a little bit more on am expensive brand. I was going to purchase an expensive brand once again and I saw this on amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! For one it doesn&#x27;t pinch and two it curls my eyelashes and they stay! I&#x27;d recommend this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that I loved the fact that I received an email from the company (FUCHSIA) making sure I received it and if there was any defects to the product. They even went as far as giving me a tracking number. So all in all Great product and excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> You can use a variety of useful products are also recommended, we will use</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Thus far I love it, no pinching, works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertised. It enhances my non-existent eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I used to use Japanesque eyelash curlers and was disappointed with the decline in their quality (some have suggested the ones from Amazon are counterfeit but I have no proof of this).  Anyway, that left me searching for a new replacement eyelash curler.  I had high hopes for this one, but I don&#x27;t use it.  On the plus side, as advertised, it doesn&#x27;t pinch eyelids.  On the negative side it doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my lashes well either.  I also REALLY hat the black color because if you have dark eyelashes as I do it is difficult to see your lashes against the curler.  I had no clue this would matter to me until I could not see them.  So lashes can get missed and you do not know until you pull the curler away... So I am still searching for a good eyelash curler.  This one will sit in my drawer...</li>
    <li> Feel free to revoke my girl card now: I&#x27;ve never used an eyelash curler. It&#x27;s always sounded like a joke; &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just gonna be here watching grass grow and curling my eyelashes.&amp;#34; But since I&#x27;ve recently grown some very nice, longer eyelashes, I wanted to give it a shot. These are very easy to use after the first few fumbling attempts of an eyelash-curling novice. They really work, giving my eyelashes a lovely upward sweep for enhanced batting effectiveness. I didn&#x27;t need to use a hair dryer. They don&#x27;t damage, pull, or pinch - I&#x27;d say a very high-quality product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue to curl my eyelashes? Only on special occasions (like watching paint dry!), but I have a good curler should the urge come upon me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Love this curler.  Works great and their customer service is stellar!</li>
    <li> What a great eyelash curler! Easy to use and does a great job. I struggle with putting eyeliner on so I line the eyelash curler and then use it to curl my lashes and apply the liner all at once. Love this thing!!</li>
    <li> Works very well and it heavy duty, not flimsy.  Love it and for a great price!</li>
    <li> I really love this curler.......  It seems to curl well, and because of its oversized pad, I don&#x27;t feel like it will cut my lashes ( happened before with a traditional curler).  It has been years since I curled my lashes, and now I remember why I did....... wow!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I just got my Insta Curler, great quality and under $20, it’s a shame I did not came across these before spending $35 on a heated one that takes AGES to warm up.</li>
    <li> Just recieved this the shipping timeframe was amazing, and this work GREAT as well</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler. It doesn&#x27;t smudge my eyeliner as my previous curler did. I&#x27;ve had no issues with pinching.</li>
    <li> I recently bought these when my cheap pair died. I love love love this eye lash curler!  They are durable and the finger holes are a good size. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new eye lash curlee!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the curler! I admit I was skeptical. I have tried many eye lash curlers and found the pinching and pulling to be too much to handle. I was drawn to this product because of the removable cushion. It appeared to be a thicker cushion than what I normally see on an eye lash curler. I was not let down! I tried the curler with and without heat and the results are fantastic! I am not the type of person to take ages getting ready and I love that this product is quick and simple. The heat is perfect for a more formal look.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the curler is slightly larger than the other eye lash curlers I have, but it really is the perfect size! It is just big enough that I don&#x27;t have to rest my hand on my cheeks while using it, thus preventing the need to touch up blush or foundation. In my case I use a mineral powder and do not need to re-blend any powder after using the eye lash curler.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about the need to replace the pad on the curler. I figured it would probably pop out but never go back in quite right. I am happy to say that the removal and replacement of the pad is simple and no struggle at all.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a durable, comfortable product and I will not be shopping around for any other curler. No pinch, no pulling, and extremely amazing results!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is wonderful, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is too cute and I just love the results I get using it!</li>
    <li> From what I can tell after using this several times, it is a far superior product to most for the price.  No pinching, at all!  I got it for a great deal, and I&#x27;m not sure where it was being shipped from but I literally received it in the mail the day after I ordered it.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have straight eyelashes and this curler curls my eyelashes easily! By far, this is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love your product. I received the coupon and thought its only $5, that&#x27;s a steal!! I like the way the curler is shaped and the way my hand fits to it; usually my hand feels contorted in some strange way with other curlers. It looks very solid and durable. I love that it didn&#x27;t pinch my skin which is a problem I often have with other curlers. Over all, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.  I will be returning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother. She has been using eyelash curlers for at least forty-five years. She wanted a new one, and was having trouble finding something that fit her hand well, was comfortable near her eye, and didn&#x27;t take her eyelashes with it when she finished. She fell in love with this one. It met all her needs and opens softly through a spring action. This is a nice feature for anyone, however, for the individuals with arthritis or other needs this little action helps immensely. Thanks for thinking this out so thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the wonderful product, I want to commend FUCHSIA on their exemplary customer care. Not only did I receive notice of all processing as it happened, I also received an email asking if I had received the product, and was I satisfied. I will be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is the first and only review I have ever done.  I was so impressed with this product thati just HAD to let others know great it is.  I have tried just about every size, shape and price eyelash curler available and this beats them all  Fantastic productt!!!!</li>
    <li> Decent eyelash curler.  I prefer my metal one but this one is good as well.</li>
    <li> I really like these lash curlers. They are padded so they don&#x27;t grab your your lashes and pull them out like the old fashion metal ones. They are cute and have great gripping for your fingers so no slipping. They come with a latch to keep them closed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about about getting the pads messed up that&#x27;s great. I would truly&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this lash curler as part of anyone&#x27;s daily routine. Thank you..,</li>
    <li> I love the Insta-Curler. It is fabulous. It does not hurt to curl my lashes and really helps make them stand out. Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the INSTA-CURLER. Upon first use my eyelashes looked amazing and I have used it regularly since then. It curls my lashes beautifully and it is very easy to use, with only smooth and light pressure needed to receive the curl.</li>
    <li> Am loving the eyelash curler. It does not pinch as advertised, and it&#x27;s quite ergonomic. Gives my lashes an extra lift before applying lengthening mascara. I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars for the price. I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced even though it does measure up. I just feel like it should be possible to be a bit less. But I&#x27;m not sorry to have paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter, but didn&#x27;t work for me. My eyes set a little to far back.</li>
    <li> Love the color and durability of it curls really nicely</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyelash curlers that I have used.  It came in a plastic pouch with an extra refill so if the original one eventually wears out.  I would def recommend</li>
    <li> It is REALLY good quality, and since I basically have no eyelashes I need a  curler to help out.</li>
    <li> works great my wife love them and very well built</li>

    <li> Love this item, keeps lashes curly as noted in the instructions!  I highly recommend this item and you should get it and try it out!  You&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler.  The design is unique and I love the fun colors.  It curls my lashes perfectly.  I am very pleased.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on your lashes like other curlers.  Also the pink cushion part is very well made &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel like it will lose it&#x27;s spring.  Great product!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> WOW, what a treat these were. Forget the $ store junk. These are worth the price. The build quality is great and my lashes love them. Very easy to use. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully to curl your lashes. Its also made really well.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler! Fast shipping! Best part of all, AMAZING customer service! Ladies, you need this eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> I love the color, and it works like a charm. Ive had problems with eyelash curlers not being strong enough because I have thick lashes. This one works amazingly!</li>
    <li> REALLY nicely made!  MUCH better than the old fashioned metal ones!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this &amp;#34;pinch and pain free&amp;#34; when I first bought.  But I have it a try! Boy was I glad that I did. First of all, their customer service skill was off the hook. The first item I received broke during transit, the seller followed up with me and I let them know. Within 2 days i received the replacement. I followed the instruction and boom- my very hard to curl, super soft lashes are curl as it was curled naturally! Very easy to use- curl lasted the whole day!!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true to what it says. It curled my eyelashes good enough. One thing though,  it did pinched me once but I guess it was just me.</li>
    <li> I loved this item. It was honestly one of the best I have ever had! The company actually sent me an email to see if I was satisfied with the product and o can honestly say I was!</li>
    <li> Product as described! Very good curler.. And very pretty!</li>
