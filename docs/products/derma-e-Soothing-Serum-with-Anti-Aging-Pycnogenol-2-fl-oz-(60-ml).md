    <li> this does nothing for redness. My dermatologist told me it is just an expensive moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and this does help to calm the redness, and burning. I use in conjunction with my moisterizer and other products in the mornings, and under makeup. This is a much better price than I was able to find at any of my local health food stores.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for my roscea skin.  Does not cause flare ups and soothes the skin if I have been out in&lt;br /&gt;the sun and get over heated.</li>
    <li> I have fabulous results from this serum in only a week so far! I have had mild to moderate rosacea for the last 10 yrs and I have tried prescription creams from a dermatologist which didn&#x27;t work at all (and put chemicals on my face), but this has definitely worked to reduce the redness! I see the difference in my face every day.  It doesn&#x27;t take all of the redness away, but it significantly reduces it and I am happy with the results.  (to help reduce redness even more, try Larenim Hocus Pocus concealer UNDER your foundation.  It is light green, but you don&#x27;t see it with foundation on top).     Dermae is on the pricey side for such a small bottle, but be happy with Amazon&#x27;s price at $16.47 as it is $12-$14 MORE on other websites and even in my local natural food store!  Thank you Amazon!  Please keep this item in stock.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It soothed my skin when it was upset because of changing hormones.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it at least twice a day as it absorbs well,  and in my opinion has helped my face: fewer wrinkles, lesser actinic keratoses, smoother skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It really helped with my redness. I use their vitamin e cream over it. Definitely recommend using a moisturizer with this product.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this product has saved my skin.  It is soothing and moisturizing.  It is light weight and absorbs nicely into the skin, nevery greasy.  Thank you derma e for this product.  I get NO flare ups when I use this.</li>
    <li> Soothes &amp; helps control redness. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> After just a couple days I got redder, itchy skin that turned into clear pustules (think poison ivy). This was uncomfortable, and lasted about a week after I stopped using the product. It was also noticeable to others.  There is something in this product that causes allergic reactions in many people - read the reviews and pay attention. I wish I had.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a change.</li>
    <li> Made my rosacea worse. I felt my skin getting irritated and bumps appeared soon after. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really great for women&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Been using for several years now in companion with the cleanser and moisturizing cream. Apply morning and night. Also if in wind and/or sun, I apply the serum only as added protection.  My face went from red and splotchy to clear.</li>
    <li> This serum is light and very smooth, with a lovely fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using derma e products with hyaluronic acid for years. Someone asked me not long ago why I don&#x27;t have those fine lines around my mouth (I&#x27;m 62) -- I DON&#x27;T have them, and I attribute this to the eye cream with hyaluronic acid, which I also use around my mouth and on my neck. Just started using the serum too, which I feel is a reinforcement to the good effects of the eye cream.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any redness improvement after using this stuff for over a month. It is a nice gentle moisturizer, though. For the price, it&#x27;s okay, but it didn&#x27;t help my problem much, if at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have combination skin that is still acne prone. This does not break me out and is lightly moisturizing. It is a great daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the Derma E products. They are very gentle and nonirritating.</li>
    <li> Was ok at first but not for sensitive skin. Eventually I got a very bad rash from using it.</li>
    <li> Really like this.  Does not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for less than a month, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Package and product exactly as shown. It matched what I was buying and I am happy with this purchase. thanks</li>
    <li> Only cleaner I can use on my VERY SENSITIVE SKIN. Found about 6 months ago last a long time.</li>
