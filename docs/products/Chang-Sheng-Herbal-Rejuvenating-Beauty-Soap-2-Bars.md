      <li>Pretty good, my wife loves this www.ntsolutions.biz</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for several years now, and it is very good at controling my rosacea, just as the ads claim.  </li>
      <li>elsewhere, so this is a good bargain if the shipping is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Very soft on complexion and effective for problem skin!</li>
      <li>They were very quick to turn the procduct around</li>
      <li>(it wasn&#x27;t cheap 15 yrs ago either).</li>
      <li>The company could not take it back because of the nature of the product but the customer service guy was very nice and gave me a 30 percent discount.</li>
      <li>Everyone says my skin is amazing for a 67 year old.</li>
      <li>I bought soap for my rosacea, it has helped some, leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>The Chang Sheng herbal Beauty Soap was a product I found years ago and luckily found again here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Found this vendor on line a couple of years ago and have been very pleased with their service and will definitely continue to buy this product from them.</li>
      <li>If you have nightmare skin like I have, this is definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>It is also really very gentle.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for several years and have found it very effective for keeping my facial roseacea under control.</li>
      <li>I have been washing once daily most times for 4 weeks now</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it was drying at first</li>
      <li>Will pass it on to somebody with younger, more oily skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give this product a higher rating</li>
      <li>Although this was the best price I could find for this soap - it is ridiculously expensive...   </li>
      <li>It sounded so much like what I was experiencing that I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>After the first week I began to notice a reduction in  breakouts.</li>
      <li>I find this soap a good way to keep my rosacea under control without resorting to antibiotics or medicine too harsh for my skin.</li>
      <li>The redness reduced very quickly and did not dry out the skin.</li>
      <li>will quit buying it if the prices on this stuff doesn&#x27;t come down...  reduces redness but kind of drying to the skin.</li>
      <li>The soaps last a long time and do a good job of cleansing.</li>
      <li>The Democidin is really strong and only for severe skin problems -- even then you may want to switch off between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t be certain which is the fix...</li>
      <li>This soap is not as harsh as some cheap cheap branded soaps though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It had been recommended by my TCM doctor and he was absolutely correct.  </li>
      <li>and we recieve it much sooner than expected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I have faith after this much progress in a week</li>
      <li>This product has worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>2 bars cost as much as $40.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>It really helps with her roseacea.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried several different soaps, but none was as effective as Chang Sheng.  </li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t like to take powerful medications for what is a visually unattractive but non-fatal skin condition like rosacea, this soap is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>have passed it on to other people i meet with rosacea problems and they also love it.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that in addition to being effective it does last a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for different types of skin but results vary, what works for one person might not improve overall results for the next.</li>
      <li>Formerly covered with the itchy scales, I have been free and clear for 5 years.</li>
      <li>They have not come back since using this soap, thank goodness, but I have also changed my diet to mostly organic and eliminating highly intolerant foods such as all processed foods and limitiing dairy, corn, nuts, gluten.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything else out there including proactive and high end department store products and nothing compares.</li>
      <li>I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THE SOAPS</li>
      <li>might not understand that the uses of a new product takes time for your skin to adjust to the change.</li>
      <li>My mom first told me about this soap several years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
      <li>Clears up sebacious infection and keeps your skin clear.</li>
      <li>alot of my redness clear up.also</li>
      <li>company also makes a Chang Sheng cream which helps keep the skin clear</li>
      <li>After a week of using this on her, she is almost clear.  </li>
      <li>I think it will take mine much longer to totally resolve itself</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using the soap for about three weeks and has seen marked improvement in his redness and breakouts.</li>
      <li>Thanks you for providing such products</li>
      <li>I use it not only for my face, but for whole body too.</li>
      <li>I looked online for natural recommendations to help him and found a review of this soap.</li>
      <li>my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>completely cleared up my rosacea.</li>
      <li>The bar is long lasting and economical to use.</li>
      <li>highly recommend then for future purchases.</li>
      <li>It sounds like a strange gift, but when they use it, I get the thanks.</li>
      <li>I am seeing major improvement with my clogged pores.  </li>
      <li>It comes in two other strengths that are less strong)    </li>
      <li>My pores have been getting smaller and the facial inflammation (Rosacea) is almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>Several years ago, I developed red, scaly patches on my chin.  </li>
      <li>One bar lasts almost a year for me - certainly no more expensive than antibiotics, and much more biologically/ecologically friendly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get this out of the way, the soap is great to help with flare-ups, no doubt about that.  What&#x27;s ashame is the fact that I paid $8 to ship a bar of soap (see other reviews) from NJ to PA and when the mail man shows up he leaves a envelope telling me I have to cover the shipping shortfall for the company.   They have been less than responsive in fixing the situation.  Bottom line - if you can find the soap elsewhere, I suggest you do...</li>
    <li> Although this was the best price I could find for this soap - it is ridiculously expensive...   will quit buying it if the prices on this stuff doesn&#x27;t come down...  reduces redness but kind of drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have a skin condition called Rosacea that worsens if I go any amount of time without using this soap. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of acne cures, and nothing works as well as this product. The Chang Sheng soap is a weaker version of the Democidin soap, and is the best place to start. The Democidin is really strong and only for severe skin problems -- even then you may want to switch off between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company also makes a Chang Sheng cream which helps keep the skin clear (I swear it makes you look younger if you use it as a night cream) and a shampoo which I haven&#x27;t tried yet. The cream smells a little weird, so I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased to see this available on Amazon! It&#x27;s often hard to find and I don&#x27;t like to run out of it. 2 bars cost as much as $40. elsewhere, so this is a good bargain if the shipping is reasonable.</li>
    <li> My Mom has suffered from rosacea for years.  After using this product for a few weeks, there was absolutely no improvement in the redness or texture of her skin.  She&#x27;s since started using an OTC face scrub by Pond&#x27;s and her face looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face because of a skin disorder.  It has kept the problem from coming back or getting worse.</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap over 15 years ago. It&#x27;s difficult to find, and yes, expensive (it wasn&#x27;t cheap 15 yrs ago either). But if you don&#x27;t like to take powerful medications for what is a visually unattractive but non-fatal skin condition like rosacea, this soap is worth the cost. A bar will last a long time, as it&#x27;s hard-milled. I use a liquid soap for washing hands, and only use the Chang Seng bar for daily face-cleansing. One bar lasts almost a year for me - certainly no more expensive than antibiotics, and much more biologically/ecologically friendly.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I developed red, scaly patches on my chin.  Nothing, even steroid creams, would make them go away for long.  I came across an advertisement for Chang Sheng soap and learned about the Demodex parasite.  It sounded so much like what I was experiencing that I thought it was worth a try.  I started using this soap and the skin plaques disappeared completely in a very short time.  I have continued to use Chang Sheng soap daily since then, with no recurrence.  I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Chang Sheng products for about 6 years. The soaps last a long time and do a good job of cleansing. Everyone says my skin is amazing for a 67 year old. Most people think I am in my 50s.</li>
    <li> I have suffeered with terrible skin for years. I saw this soap in a catalog years ago and did not order it because it was expensive. Years later I found the catalog but it was out of business. I found the soap on Amazon and ordered it because I was desperate. I read all the reviews online before I got it. Everyone LOVED it, and so do I! After YEARS of trying every product that did not work and going to specialists, I have FINALLY stumbled upon something that ACTUALLY WORKS.  I ordered the companion products immidiately. (Face Surgeon II Soap and Chang Sheng Beauty Cream.  I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THE SOAPS but the cream is not for me.  It feels &#x27;smeary&#x27; and my skin does not need the moisture.  Yours might, because the soap is drying).    I use the soaps twice a day but actually leave it on a little longer than directed. In the morning I immediately follow with Vita-C2 CLEAR STEP 3 while my pores are still open.(It&#x27;s a 3.7% Benzoyl Peroxide lotion like the STEP 3 of Pro Active).  I wait at least 30 min for it to absorb and dry before applying make up.  In the evening I again use the soaps.  I wait 20 minutes and apply a perscription ccream. (Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP 0.1%.  It comes in two other strengths that are less strong)    Always wait at least 20 minutes after wahing your face and applying moisture or medication to put on make up.  This gives your pores time to close and the ph balance to adjust.  (I never knew this until someone at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office finally told me)    I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but made an exception here.  I know what it&#x27;s like to suffer with bad skin and nobody has the answers.  ***THIS PRODUCT IS THE ANSWER***</li>
    <li> I have always had to order  through a catalog before.  I found this much more convenient.  Thanks you for providing such products</li>
    <li> My son uses the soap for acne breakouts on his back.  He has been using it for over 6 months and likes the soap as it has cleared up his skin but not completely.</li>
    <li> Although this soap is expensive, especially the shipping, my husband feels that it is well worth the money for keeping his rosacea under control.   Another plus is that in addition to being effective it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> Does the job on my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Never got a chance to evaluate effectiveness of product because it was too drying on my skin to keep using it. The company could not take it back because of the nature of the product but the customer service guy was very nice and gave me a 30 percent discount. Will pass it on to somebody with younger, more oily skin.</li>
    <li> I think the Chang Sheng soap is a great product and would recommend it to anyone that has a problem with rosacea.  I have used this soap for about 2 years and do not use any other soaps on my face.  It has helped get rid of the redness of rosacea when my dermatologist could not with prescription meds.</li>
    <li> For sensitive skin---particularly if troubled by rosacea--this is the soap to use. It&#x27;s the only face soap I have used fdor years.</li>
    <li> This soap makes my face dry but it has made alot of my redness clear up.also the the postules and I think Im see ing smaller pores.I wish there was a lotion however with these ingredients,for I feel Im defeating the results by the lotion I put on.I have been washing once daily most times for 4 weeks now</li>
    <li> An excellent face soap.... I have used it for years and  have recommended it to friends and they have loved it too.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product on her face.  It really helps with her roseacea.  They were very quick to turn the procduct around and we recieve it much sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend then for future purchases.</li>
    <li> Great relief for psoriasis. Formerly covered with the itchy scales, I have been free and clear for 5 years. No trace at all.&lt;br /&gt;I always keep this on hand for when I meet someone who is suffering with this skin problem. It sounds like a strange gift, but when they use it, I get the thanks. So, THANK YOU, for making this available in the United States ! It&#x27;s AMAZING. (p.s. don&#x27;t read the box, the description will scare you)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I am using this kind of soap probably for 10 years. It really works. I bought it to work with my rosacea and eczema. I use it not only for my face, but for whole body too. Sometimes I stop using it, but when I use it regularly for my face it works with clearing some wrinkles too. I would definitely  recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> It is for my mom. She has been using it for at least 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me. My pores have been getting smaller and the facial inflammation (Rosacea) is almost completely gone. I had some small hard bumps that are characteristic of Rosacea that I could not get rid of and I&#x27;d made up my mind to go to the dermatologist to see if she could remove them. They have been fading and getting smaller since I started using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Although it was drying at first I have found that, over time, the drying effect is not so great. Also, I no longer need to exfoliate as I find that after washing my face the dead skin just rolls off when I towel-dry. Blackheads are slowly disappearing as well.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> My mom first told me about this soap several years ago and have been using it ever since. I had a rash on my face that wouldnt go away with any prescription or over the counter face soap. This is the only soap that keeps the rash away and prevents oiliness. I have tried everything else out there including proactive and high end department store products and nothing compares. I have been without it for two days now because I accidentally left it when I went out of town. I&#x27;m dying and my face feels dirty and oily. My husband didnt believe how good it was and now he&#x27;s hooked too!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years now, and it is very good at controling my rosacea, just as the ads claim.  Found this vendor on line a couple of years ago and have been very pleased with their service and will definitely continue to buy this product from them.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap. I cleans my face sooo well. I have zero blemishes. I have used it for about a year in a half now and I don&#x27;t see myself ever changing it. It is also really very gentle.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from rosacea. I looked online for natural recommendations to help him and found a review of this soap. I purchased it along with 100% jojoba oil and we&#x27;ve had great results! He&#x27;s been using the soap for about three weeks and has seen marked improvement in his redness and breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this soap and used for about one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels like it works mildly.&lt;br /&gt;  This soap is not as harsh as some cheap cheap branded soaps though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Too too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The one from FaceDoctor looks the same as this one but costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I see no ingrediants on this soap and I wonder why.</li>
    <li> Very soft on complexion and effective for problem skin! The bar is long lasting and economical to use. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Didnt work as described</li>
    <li> arrived in time hope this will work and my daughter started using this bar ,hope to get a wonderful result</li>
    <li> Pretty good, my wife loves this www.ntsolutions.biz</li>
    <li> I find this soap a good way to keep my rosacea under control without resorting to antibiotics or medicine too harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought soap for my rosacea, it has helped some, leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. I wish it was un scented.</li>
    <li> i have used the soap for years. completely cleared up my rosacea. have passed it on to other people i meet with rosacea problems and they also love it. i use it to shave with. excellent!</li>
    <li> A very effective soap. I have been using this soap for about a month now. After the first week I began to notice a reduction in  breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for a week on my face and my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s.  My daughter was starting to get little bumps on her forehead and crusty red splotches around her nose.  It was heartbreaking to me to think she might suffer the same skin woes I have.  I didn&#x27;t want to make her self-conscious but wanted to do something before it got too bad.  After a week of using this on her, she is almost clear.  Her skin is now almost peaches and cream with a few tiny bumps that are hopefully on their way out.  My skin is a nightmare and has been for many years.  I am seeing major improvement with my clogged pores.  Lots of gunk has come out.  Ughh!!! A few cyst type bumps that I have in various locales (back, chest, neck, etc.) are getting smaller and clearing.  The redness which was horrible even seems to be getting better.  I think it will take mine much longer to totally resolve itself but I have faith after this much progress in a week that it will.  As others have said, this soap is a bit drying although my face seems to have gotten used to it.  If you have nightmare skin like I have, this is definitely worth a try.  I lather it up and put it on my face while I&#x27;m in the shower and let it soak.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like artificial fragrances.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating my skin, however, which is usually the case.  It does smell like some old-fashioned product my grandmother would have used.  A small concern, though.  I will update again soon.  Best wishes to everyone looking for a skin solution.  I, too well, know the pain and agony of this and hope this soap helps us all feel better about our skin</li>
    <li> The Chang Sheng herbal Beauty Soap was a product I found years ago and luckily found again here on Amazon. It&#x27;s good for different types of skin but results vary, what works for one person might not improve overall results for the next. Acne suffers might benefit from the fact that the soap doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily or dry, usually it&#x27;s one or the other. I&#x27;d give this product a higher rating but I don&#x27;t want to make this out to be a miracle product and mislead. I like it but to the next person that uses the product for under a week and gives it a 1 star rating might not understand that the uses of a new product takes time for your skin to adjust to the change. Would I recommend it? Yes, try it and take a chance at improvement for your complexion!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and have found it very effective for keeping my facial roseacea under control.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out and seems to control trouble areas.  I had some issues with redness around my nose and sometimes chin with occasional breakouts.  I also had hard white plugs that you had to pull out with tweezers.  They have not come back since using this soap, thank goodness, but I have also changed my diet to mostly organic and eliminating highly intolerant foods such as all processed foods and limitiing dairy, corn, nuts, gluten. So I can&#x27;t be certain which is the fix...but I still like the soap and will continue to order.  My daughter also like it.</li>
    <li> Clears up sebacious infection and keeps your skin clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried several different soaps, but none was as effective as Chang Sheng.  After several months of use, I&#x27;m no longer experiencing patch dead skin and scaling.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I think this soap is excellent. I am using it for my rosacea and it has helped with the redness and bumpiness that comes with rosacea. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin continues to improve. I would recommend this soap to anyone with rosacea. The price is good as well.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for a soap...what was I thinking??!!!  It may be alright, not bad, just too expensive to order again.</li>
    <li> This soap works.  It had been recommended by my TCM doctor and he was absolutely correct.  The redness reduced very quickly and did not dry out the skin. I now recommend Chang Sheng soap.</li>
