      <li>i bought this from The Gap (which happened to be pretty hip at the time).</li>
      <li>Most would say it&#x27;s for the younger crowd</li>
      <li>I would say this is more of a younger scent though</li>
      <li>Not having to constantly spray yourself to revive the scent really gives you more bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care but thought I&#x27;d mention it.  </li>

      <li>The first christmas that we spent together</li>
      <li>I could barely smell it after 2 hours of simply sitting in my car then in my office.  </li>

    <li> Great purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great summer scent! It was one of my favorite for years until Gap stopped carrying it. Very happy to find it on amazon for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Es un buen regalo, es muy agradable el aroma, siempre lo compro para mi madre, es un fresco aroma y no es muy fuerte. lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> use to get this product from Gap store years ago, no longer sales it.&lt;br /&gt;Product has a sweet smell. I purchase to bottles.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. Lightly citrusy and feminine, you get a faint scent of grapefruit and flowers. I&#x27;m told Gap stopped selling this in their stores and was pretty disappointed. Luckily, I got this as a gift. The 3.4 oz size has held me over since last December (It&#x27;s already April) and going strong! Highly recommend this scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this particular scent from Gap. So glad I was able to purchase this online. It Arrived on time and the product was intact. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Had to ask a stranger what scent she was wearing it smelled so nice....Promptly ordered some and love it... Will reorder again.</li>
    <li> Terrible not the real thing. It is a scam, it is fraud. Zero stars. Stinks! They stole my money! The real gap so pink is a beautiful smell! Been wearing it for years!</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Always receive compliments from everyone.  It&#x27;s not strong yet fruity and tasteful.  I will continue to use this perfume for another 20 years.</li>
    <li> Not &#x27;perfumie&#x27; light and femine.&lt;br /&gt;For all ages. Not &#x27;sexy&#x27;. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the body mist too. Never overbearing in any environment</li>
    <li> By far, this has been my favorite perfume for over 5 years. Now I have found I can get this alot cheaper online.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite! Light and citrusy.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent. Been buying it for over a decade. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more lemon scented than floral. Came well packaged with a bunch of trial perfume vials and coupons.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical if this was the correct item and it was!!! This is one of my favs &amp; the Gap stopped carrying it. So I am extremely glad I found this on Amazon. I will be a repeat customer for this product.</li>
    <li> i love this scent. I am just sick that they have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! They close the gap store and I was going crazy with out it... definitley a must have</li>
    <li> So Pink was one of my most favorite perfumes to wear as a teenager. I bought it just for the nostalgia of it. Still smells just as great to me now as it did then. I love the citrusy sweet smell &amp; the fact that the scent lasts all day. Not having to constantly spray yourself to revive the scent really gives you more bang for your buck. I highly recommend it to ladies of any age. Most would say it&#x27;s for the younger crowd but hey... give it a try!</li>
    <li> Back in high school i had a girlfriend who played a pretty significant part in my life. The first christmas that we spent together i bought this from The Gap (which happened to be pretty hip at the time). Typical male that i was, i had no idea what to get her. Eventually, i just bought a lot of things and put them together. It was this very scent that signified our past. She loved it and wore it all the time. I loved smelling it on her. Things have changed since 2001-2002. We broke up after YEARS of being with each other, but now its 2012 and we have bumped into each other again. I couldn&#x27;t find this in The Gap as i don&#x27;t think they sell it in stores anymore (&amp; The Gap isn&#x27;t so \\&quot;hip\\&quot; anymore) and I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase in time for the holidays. The citrus smell is just so mesmerizing. Her and I are friends and we appreciate our paths and i think this is a great gift that takes us to fun summer times without reminding us of what once was.</li>
    <li> The second best perfume I wear I Love it and get soooo many compliments when I wear it I always try to keep it in stock!!!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect spring and summer fragrance that reminds me of grapefruit and other florals on a refreshing breeze.</li>
    <li> my favorite fragrance by Gap. Sometimes cheaper here than in the store. Love it, light, get a lot of compliments on wearing this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume because a coworker wears this and I love it and will order it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I looove this perfume it smells sooo good. my cousin bought me the body spray &amp; I really loved it so I had to buy the perfume!Soft flowery smell. Shipping was fast &amp; worth the price!</li>
    <li> I can say it is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The quality perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Love it love it love it</li>
    <li> If you love citrus scents then  buy this. Its smells like sweet grapefruit and lemon but in a very pleasant way. But dont spay too much; it&#x27;s a very strong scent. I would say this is more of a younger scent though, itll make you feel young! It smells like Summer to me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s owesome i bougth it for a gift and the person was so happy about have it, everyone said that like her perfum that they also wants one, and i personally like its smell so much it&#x27;s sexy :p</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost like a scent you would layer. Light and fresh, whenever I wear it, someone comments on how good I smell. I was cornered in daycare two women wanted specifics!!&lt;br /&gt;The top of the bottle broke which gave me the sads. I will most likely re-order.</li>
    <li> My go-to perfume. light, feminine and sweet. Almost smells like roses with a touch of grape fruit.</li>
    <li> I first tried So Pink years ago and was instantly hooked to its sweet floral scent.  I had forgotten about it until I recently needed some more perfume (I don&#x27;t shop at Gap that often) and remembered how much I loved the stuff.  I was psyched to see that I could order it on Amazon (what doesn&#x27;t Amazon have??) at such a good price.  The Givenchy perfume I&#x27;ve been using for over a year is $75.  So Pink?  20 bucks!  Anyway, it&#x27;s great.  I did have issues with the actual perfume cap like some of the other reviews mention, but I set the cap back on the sprayer and am careful when I press down to spritz it on and also whenever I put the larger cap back on.  Not a big deal at all.  Also, this perfume stays on all day.  That $75 stuff I mentioned using?  I could barely smell it after 2 hours of simply sitting in my car then in my office.  As I write this review, it&#x27;s 2:30pm.  I sprayed 4 sprays of So Pink on at 7:15am and I can still smell it (even after going for a slightly sweaty lunch time walk at work).  Smells great + lasts a long time + cheap price &#x3D; winner.</li>
    <li> This product is not as advertised. The image has the caption \\&quot;So Pink PERFUME\\&quot; by Gap etc. This is not the case. I thought I was buying perfume, I was given eau de toilette. I am not happy with the product, which I discovered, cannot be returned. Do not recommend spending any money with this seller.</li>
    <li> The cap does not attach to the perfume bottle top because a metal part disconnected prior to use.  I discovered this after taking the perfume out of the wrapped box.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Godchild whom is in her second year of college.  She absolutely loves it.  She says she loves it so much, she has a hard time letting her roommate borrow it.</li>
    <li> ...I unboxed it, removed the cap, now the cap won&#x27;t sit tightly back on the bottle.  It spins loosely around.  I don&#x27;t really care but thought I&#x27;d mention it.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve used Gap&#x27;s So Pink for years and the product itself is wonderful.</li>
