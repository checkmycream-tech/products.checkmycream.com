### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good scent, excellent odor/moisture guard.</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT &amp; PRICE IS GOOD!</li>
      <li>This does not irritate my skin at all, and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>and I had my hopes up that it would work great.</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this product to be very effective, and I appreciate that it is odorless.</li>
      <li>This always starts out with a great smell, but it seems to change during the day sometimes into something not quite as pleasant.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up under stress-sweat, but if you wash off and re-apply, it&#x27;s a good deodorant.</li>
      <li>Superior product.</li>
      <li>The odor is nice, the packaging good (the shape of the container and your ability to hold it in your had and apply it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The killer though, ahem, is that it does not do the job over a period of time.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for many years, whichever part of the world i am, i purchase &amp; use it, not found anything as good as it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s texture and shape is very nice and the perfume is just right.</li>
      <li>I was glad that I did, because my shirt smelled like pits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy it this way, saves me time.</li>
      <li>I find it better than all that I find in the supermarkets.</li>
      <li>Most deodorant makes my skin break out in a rash, but not this one.</li>
      <li>Well this is the best I have found for as long as I have used these products.</li>
      <li>Very nice scent, high quality product</li>
      <li>The deodorant is great for even those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>pleasant scent, not overpowering, but on a normal day your stink won&#x27;t outshine it.</li>
      <li>This worked fine for me</li>
      <li>This is a very nice smelling deo, but as notes by others, it does not last all day.</li>
      <li>I like the clean masculine scent of the deodorant, but I&#x27;m not at all pleased with the performance.</li>
      <li>My impression is women pick up and enjoy this scent quite readily.</li>
      <li>But right now for me</li>
      <li>Been searching for the right deo.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide on very smooth, and shortly after application, my underarms felt sticky.</li>
      <li>Actually really nice, no real scent or dye.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve also tried Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s Nomad and liked it (the shop closed here).  </li>
      <li>All of you people expecting this stuff to last 18-24 hours need to shower more often.</li>
      <li>I will however give it another try when it&#x27;s not so hot and humid to see if that helps.</li>
      <li>, it really lasts for the whole day.</li>
      <li>and I really like the scent.</li>
      <li>Seems to work better than other brands but for a shorter period of time.</li>
      <li>It let me down, and I&#x27;ve had better results with cheaper products.</li>
      <li>It has more of a cologne scent than some of the typical deodorants but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Also, my favorite after shave is Hermes Eau d&#x27;orange verte, and when I am at one of the high-dollar malls, I am going to see if they have, gulp, deodorant for less than a thousand dollars.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nobody really needs 24 hours out of it, but 16 hours is necessary for most, and this one does not last that long.</li>
      <li>and for $6 it the quality of a designer brand deodorant but at the price of the more common deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was not physically active at this event.</li>
      <li>Also, on the package I received, the top was broken.</li>
      <li>I use Body Shop products all the time, but this one really let me down.</li>

<li> The only  deodorant that made me smell myself within a half hour!</li>
<li> Overall I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase and would not recommend it to other men.</li>
<li> Stick to the other brands.</li>
<li> It was fairly hot and humid that day, but I had no idea my deodorant was going to fail.</li>
<li> This product is not worth the upscale price.</li>
<li> has a smell that the ladies, who are on average at nose level with my armpits, dig.</li>
<li> It slows down the sweat but won&#x27;t stop it.</li>
<li> It has a slight scent and works well.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money at all!</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyway, there is something missing in the Body Shop stuff.  </li>
<li> but it is not available here in Thailand.</li>
<li> Not cheap</li>
<li> I was disappointed because this was my first upscale deodorant</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
<li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years, because i&#x27;m not a huge sweater, but i am a little stinker.</li>
<li> And I am not a particularly smell person, unless people are afraid to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work, unless you don&#x27;t mind bad BO the same day you put it on.</li>
<li> I am addicted to this deodorant!</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> I guess I am stuck with the expensive stuff if I want deodorant and not anti-perspirant.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a FAIL.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve found this product to be very effective, and I appreciate that it is odorless. I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy it this way, saves me time. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this after smelling it in a Body Shop in Thailand.  Not cheap but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I object to the deodorants that actually block perspiration and this said there was no animal testing so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a while I have to say that I will not get it again.  The odor is nice, the packaging good (the shape of the container and your ability to hold it in your had and apply it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The killer though, ahem, is that it does not do the job over a period of time. At the end of the day, I would lose friends if they got too close.  Enough said?  And I am not a particularly smell person, unless people are afraid to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine but it is not available here in Thailand. So back to the drawing board.  I guess I am stuck with the expensive stuff if I want deodorant and not anti-perspirant.  What&#x27;s up with that anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve also tried Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s Nomad and liked it (the shop closed here).  And the Polo deodorant I used I like and may go back to that.  Also, my favorite after shave is Hermes Eau d&#x27;orange verte, and when I am at one of the high-dollar malls, I am going to see if they have, gulp, deodorant for less than a thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there is something missing in the Body Shop stuff.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I am not a very sweaty person.  This worked fine for me and I really like the scent.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the upscale price. I like the clean masculine scent of the deodorant, but I&#x27;m not at all pleased with the performance. I Showered and applied this deodorant to my armpits before I went to an outdoor cookout. It was fairly hot and humid that day, but I had no idea my deodorant was going to fail. I was not physically active at this event. Later that afternoon I came home to freshen up. I was glad that I did, because my shirt smelled like pits. I had to wash my pits, reapply deodorant, and get another shirt. I was disappointed because this was my first upscale deodorant and I had my hopes up that it would work great. It let me down, and I&#x27;ve had better results with cheaper products. I need something that will last all day in the heat and humidity of the southeast. I should also note that the product doesn&#x27;t apply well. It doesn&#x27;t glide on very smooth, and shortly after application, my underarms felt sticky. I&#x27;m beginning to wonder about some of these European deodorants. I believe this Body Shop product was made in the UK. I once tried Umbro which I think is European but made in Canada, and it didn&#x27;t work either. Overall I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase and would not recommend it to other men. I will however give it another try when it&#x27;s not so hot and humid to see if that helps. But right now for me it&#x27;s a FAIL.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, high quality product</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years, because i&#x27;m not a huge sweater, but i am a little stinker. has a smell that the ladies, who are on average at nose level with my armpits, dig. pleasant scent, not overpowering, but on a normal day your stink won&#x27;t outshine it.</li>
    <li> This always starts out with a great smell, but it seems to change during the day sometimes into something not quite as pleasant. Also, on the package I received, the top was broken.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this deodorant! It has more of a cologne scent than some of the typical deodorants but not overpowering. and for $6 it the quality of a designer brand deodorant but at the price of the more common deodorant. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I will buy. Superior product.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Even deodorant with no dyes or perfumes tend sometimes bug me. This does not irritate my skin at all, and it smells great. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as long lasting as some of the more artificial chemical deodorants on the market.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s a deodorant not an antiperspirant. It slows down the sweat but won&#x27;t stop it. It&#x27;s also not harmful though so choose your battles. I wasn&#x27;t smelly after 10-12 hour days. All of you people expecting this stuff to last 18-24 hours need to shower more often.</li>
    <li> What can one say about a simple roll on deodorant stick. Well this is the best I have found for as long as I have used these products. It&#x27;s texture and shape is very nice and the perfume is just right. I find it better than all that I find in the supermarkets.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smelling deo, but as notes by others, it does not last all day. Nobody really needs 24 hours out of it, but 16 hours is necessary for most, and this one does not last that long.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. But overpriced as it&#x27;s just deodorant.</li>
    <li> It has a slight scent and works well.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up under stress-sweat, but if you wash off and re-apply, it&#x27;s a good deodorant. It gets 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work!! The only  deodorant that made me smell myself within a half hour! I use Body Shop products all the time, but this one really let me down. Not worth the money at all!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT &amp; PRICE IS GOOD!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years, whichever part of the world i am, i purchase &amp; use it, not found anything as good as it, it really lasts for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The deodorant is great for even those with sensitive skin. Most deodorant makes my skin break out in a rash, but not this one. Plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> We should ALL come together and use non-aluminium deodorant.....this exceeded my expectations, thank you!  Been searching for the right deo. for a long time, search over!</li>
    <li> Very good scent, excellent odor/moisture guard. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, unless you don&#x27;t mind bad BO the same day you put it on. Stick to the other brands.</li>
    <li> My impression is women pick up and enjoy this scent quite readily.</li>
    <li> Actually really nice, no real scent or dye.  Seems to work better than other brands but for a shorter period of time.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to everybody</li>
