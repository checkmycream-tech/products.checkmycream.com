      <li>but it makes it much better and not as embarrassing.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products that seem to help for a time and then just stop working for whatever reason.  </li>

      <li>The Devrom has eliminated about 75% of the phoophs I pass, and, more importantly for me, 85% to 90% of the odor from the phoophs that do escape.</li>
      <li>easy to order</li>

      <li>It is really amazing and has allowed me to live my life again in public without being embarrassed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident that my surgery issues of gas are solved as long as I take this product.</li>
      <li>2 tablets before a large helping of veggies -- does what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll find that Devrom costs half as much at the manufacturer&#x27;s own site.</li>
      <li>This has really worked well for me.  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
      <li>These really work.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>At any rate Devrom is helping me to get through the days when the gas is really out of control.  </li>
      <li>This really works to neutralize the bloat and gas associated with IBS.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well for an embarrassing condition.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I had serious doubts, but I am thrilled to say that this product worked for me the first time I took it.</li>
      <li>Black poo seems more plaguey-deathy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>After gastric bypass and with any HIGH protein diet, foul smelling stool or gas is a given.  </li>
      <li>have experienced excessive gas for many years with various products seeming to help for a few weeks and then suddenly not working anymore.  </li>
      <li>I also took a double-dose for the first 2-3 days (which is a little more than the daily recommended dosage) to help it build up in my system.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised but it does work.</li>
      <li>If people order this product I think they will be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first, but pleased so far.  </li>
      <li>I am seriously considering stockpiling it just in case it ever goes off the market.  :)</li>
      <li>Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to, but I kind of prefer my poo to be green rather than black.</li>
      <li>I bought this internal deodorant and one other to switch between when one seems less effective.  </li>
      <li>As a rule, not everyone responds to a medication exactly as every other person does.</li>
      <li>Tuba, playing a loud F#), but the odor is usually either not noticeable or mild.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap (but, also not horrid), but for me it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I had tried other products such as Gas-X, Beano which did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
      <li>The gas is just horrible and eating sugar - free  candies or any thing that is sugar- free is very embarrassing!  </li>
      <li>If I take two Devrom first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and the same at bedtime, there is absolutely no odor.  </li>
      <li>was becoming so frequent, loud and hideously smelly that I was beginning to be afraid to go out in public.  </li>

<li> The first time I tried it the results were not very good, but on a whim I decided to give it another go.  </li>
<li> Black is not the new brown.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be surprised if your health care provider has no idea that this product exists, so you may need to tell him/her the active ingredient of Devrom.</li>
<li> thing I&#x27;m doing differently this time is that I take three capsules first thing in the morning on an empty stomach as opposed to taking it at random times during the day after eating, which is what I was doing the first time.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with foods that contain a little nonfat dairy, but drinking milk or eating cheese causes major problems, even though I take Schiff&#x27;s Lactose Intolerance enzymes daily.</li>
<li> It has very significantly reduced the amount of unpleasant odors produced by my body, and if you have a similar need for some help with this sort of thing I enthusiastically recommend that you give Devrom a try.</li>
<li> I will be taking this product for as long as it stays on the market!</li>
<li> I was constantly embarrassed by my extremely foul odor.</li>
<li> The phoophs usually return some time in the afternoon, and can still be rather loud (think:</li>
<li> The past few years everything I eat seems to bother me and the after effects are very troubling and embarrassing.</li>
<li> only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with gas resulting from dairy products, so I have to be careful about what I eat.  </li>
<li> and then another 2 capsules in the afternoon, again on an empty stomach.  </li>
<li> total waste of money</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first</li>
<li> Since it is a capsule, easier to put in pill boxes with other medications for the day to make it part of routine.</li>
<li> I have tried other gas relief products but nothing worked.  </li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to work or at least not enough to warrant cost of product.</li>
<li> Changed the odor of my flatulence from sulfur dioxide to something much less offensive.  </li>
<li> It cuts gas odor in half.</li>
<li> It is chemically related to products like Pepto-Bismol, but it is much better-suited (in my opinion) for long-term daily use to reduce/eliminate nasty smells.</li>
<li> Directions say take 1-2 caps up to 4 times/day, no more than 8 in 24-hr. period.  </li>
<li> I am not sure what my body does to some foods</li>
<li> but there are nights when I can hardly stand to be around myself.  </li>
<li> Common sense suggests that you check with your physician before self-medicating, and I urge you to do so.</li>
<li> Now, the gas is still there, but at least no one knows.  </li>
<li> Results are hard to believe!</li>
<li> If you suffer from offensive or unpleasant odors produced by your digestive system, Devrom deserves your serious consideration.</li>
<li> Made no difference in terms of skin appearance or joint stiffness and pain--might as well have been taking nothing, sadly.</li>
<li> and I was skeptical.  </li>
<li> Is that weird?</li>
<li> A side effect of having gastric bypass surgery is bad breath, farts, stinky body sweat and bile smell because our food isn&#x27;t getting process well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work wonderfully, however, be aware they do change the color of stool to almost black. This is a terrific product!</li>
    <li> I had bariatric surgery and this product was recommended, so I bought some and I LOVE it!  It really works.</li>
    <li> I experience what is called leaky gut, and it is when you smell like feces all the time. This product did not help me with that.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life.  I no longer am running away from myself in embarrassment or pretending I don&#x27;t smell anything.  I&#x27;m confident that my surgery issues of gas are solved as long as I take this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> best product I have found to be helpful to prevent/retard gas--but MUST use as per directions</li>
    <li> Maybe just my body chemistry but it didn&#x27;t seem to work or at least not enough to warrant cost of product.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my husband with body odor and bowel odor.  If people order this product I think they will be pleasantly surprised.  My husband&#x27;s doctor recommend Devrom</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver, love it! I will be taking this product for as long as it stays on the market! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This has really worked well for me.  Since my weight-loss surgery I have had a problem with odor. My weight-loss surgeon recommended this and it has worked great. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Simple the best, give me another life.</li>
    <li> The swallowable capsule reduces the smell of gas.  The chewable version can turn tongue chalky for a bit, but this does not.  Since it is a capsule, easier to put in pill boxes with other medications for the day to make it part of routine.</li>
    <li> This is the best!! It cuts gas odor in half. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what my body does to some foods but there are nights when I can hardly stand to be around myself.  If I take a couple of these, it seems to get rid of the rotten egg smell.  I was skeptical at first but this stuff does work.</li>
    <li> As a rule, not everyone responds to a medication exactly as every other person does. So, before investing in a &amp;#34;lifetime supply&amp;#34; of Devrom I&#x27;d advise that you try it out first. That said, I wish that I had discovered this product decades ago. It has very significantly reduced the amount of unpleasant odors produced by my body, and if you have a similar need for some help with this sort of thing I enthusiastically recommend that you give Devrom a try. Common sense suggests that you check with your physician before self-medicating, and I urge you to do so. Don&#x27;t be surprised if your health care provider has no idea that this product exists, so you may need to tell him/her the active ingredient of Devrom. It is chemically related to products like Pepto-Bismol, but it is much better-suited (in my opinion) for long-term daily use to reduce/eliminate nasty smells. If you suffer from offensive or unpleasant odors produced by your digestive system, Devrom deserves your serious consideration.</li>
    <li> easy to order&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take&lt;br /&gt;Working?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know yet, seems to take a while to start up.&lt;br /&gt;I (and my family &amp; co-workers) are hopeful.</li>
    <li> Made no difference in terms of skin appearance or joint stiffness and pain--might as well have been taking nothing, sadly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t give up on finding the internal deodorant that works for you, in the end you get your life back.  Hang in there!!  I bought this internal deodorant and one other to switch between when one seems less effective.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but pleased so far.  Eliminates odor but not gas.  I take 3 capsules in morning, 2 mid-afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;and 3 before bed.  I have tried other gas relief products but nothing worked.  I am a gastric bypass patient.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised but it does work. I still have gas but there&#x27;s no odor. That makes all the difference.  Edited Nov 4, 2011:  Google the product name and you&#x27;ll find that Devrom costs half as much at the manufacturer&#x27;s own site. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a friend. He loves it an may get more in the future.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> These capsules are magic. They work. Buy them. You do not even need to take the full recommended amount to get results.</li>
    <li> This really works to neutralize the bloat and gas associated with IBS.  Results are hard to believe!</li>
    <li> This product really works, and I was in doubt at first, but was satisfied with the results. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this works,finally the pill that does what its says!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a God-send!  I have horribly smelling gas.  If I take two Devrom first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and the same at bedtime, there is absolutely no odor.  Now, the gas is still there, but at least no one knows.  :)</li>
    <li> A side effect of having gastric bypass surgery is bad breath, farts, stinky body sweat and bile smell because our food isn&#x27;t getting process well. This product has helped mask all odors. I recommend this product for people like me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I was constantly embarrassed by my extremely foul odor. After one dose of this product I was odor free. It certainly does what it claims to do.I had tried other products such as Gas-X, Beano which did absolutely nothing for me. I feel that I got my life back because of this product.</li>
    <li> After gastric bypass and with any HIGH protein diet, foul smelling stool or gas is a given.  A friend, who is also a gastric bypass patient, recommended this to me and my husband and it WORKS!! We&#x27;ve taken it for 5 years and very happy with how well it works.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This is actually my second time trying Devrom.  The first time I tried it the results were not very good, but on a whim I decided to give it another go.  I am so glad I did because this time it&#x27;s working great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m doing differently this time is that I take three capsules first thing in the morning on an empty stomach as opposed to taking it at random times during the day after eating, which is what I was doing the first time.  I also took a double-dose for the first 2-3 days (which is a little more than the daily recommended dosage) to help it build up in my system.  So I took 3 capsules first thing in the morning and then another 2 capsules in the afternoon, again on an empty stomach.  I have not noticed any side effects from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced excessive gas for many years with various products seeming to help for a few weeks and then suddenly not working anymore.  I have tried so many products that seem to help for a time and then just stop working for whatever reason.  I think I may have a candida problem which is a nightmare to get rid of from what I&#x27;ve read.  At any rate Devrom is helping me to get through the days when the gas is really out of control.  I thank God for this product and hope they never discontinue it!!!  I am seriously considering stockpiling it just in case it ever goes off the market.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with gas resulting from dairy products, so I have to be careful about what I eat.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with foods that contain a little nonfat dairy, but drinking milk or eating cheese causes major problems, even though I take Schiff&#x27;s Lactose Intolerance enzymes daily. It also seems to take a few days to start working properly again if I consume too much dairy, so I double up on the double dosage again to help get things back on track.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great price</li>
    <li> I had gastric bypass 10 years ago and have had bouts terrible smelly gas.  Even I would leave the room.  Not idea in an office setting.  This does not eliminate the odor but it makes it much better and not as embarrassing.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Just heard about this and I was skeptical.  But being such a veggie lover, i tried it.  Amazing!  2 tablets before a large helping of veggies -- does what it says it will do.  No odor.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to write about this... but maybe it will help you.  I Wish I knew about it years ago.</li>
    <li> Product was very nice</li>
    <li> I had a gastric bypass in 2005.  The gas is just horrible and eating sugar - free  candies or any thing that is sugar- free is very embarrassing!  Devron is great and the only  thing that will help me.  I have to take 3 or more for it to work.</li>
    <li> Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to, but I kind of prefer my poo to be green rather than black. Is that weird? Okay, it&#x27;s weird but think about it this way: green poo seems very naturey. Black poo seems more plaguey-deathy. Just a quirk.</li>
    <li> Work Poopers rejoice! Take these and you will no longer have to hold it all day, or risk getting caught after a dump! Wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> These really work. I would recommend to anyone who gets smelly gas.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Devrom for some time now (1-2 yrs, maybe).  I don&#x27;t have post-surgical issues.  Before I started using it, my gas (for antiquated reasons--I&#x27;m old--I dislike using the word fart, so of course I made up a word--phooph) was becoming so frequent, loud and hideously smelly that I was beginning to be afraid to go out in public.  The Devrom has eliminated about 75% of the phoophs I pass, and, more importantly for me, 85% to 90% of the odor from the phoophs that do escape. Directions say take 1-2 caps up to 4 times/day, no more than 8 in 24-hr. period.  I take 2 capsules at breakfast and 2 around lunch time.  The phoophs usually return some time in the afternoon, and can still be rather loud (think: Tuba, playing a loud F#), but the odor is usually either not noticeable or mild.  As with all supplements, vitamins, and even prescribed medications, efficacy varies from one person to the next.  For me, the Devrom works, and I no longer feel like hiding in some basement closet, armed with spray bottles of Febreeze.  It&#x27;s not cheap (but, also not horrid), but for me it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who has IBS and therefore is embarrassed often when he needs to use the bathroom.  These capsules seem to be working well for him.  He has asked me to reorder them on a couple of occasions and as he is on a limited budget, I am sure that he would not be asking for more if they were working for him.</li>
    <li> I have had gastric bypass surgery my nurse told me about this product, I found it online and tried it. It is really amazing and has allowed me to live my life again in public without being embarrassed. It works fantastic a great product for gastric bypass patients.</li>
    <li> Black is not the new brown.  I really dont think they are worth the humongous price.</li>
    <li> Came on time!!! great product!</li>
    <li> Tried many products but this beats all by far!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.....total waste of money</li>
    <li> I had serious doubts, but I am thrilled to say that this product worked for me the first time I took it. The past few years everything I eat seems to bother me and the after effects are very troubling and embarrassing. I have been using the Devrom capsules for about a week and have had only one time that I didn&#x27;t think it worked well. I&#x27;ll take those results any time, compared to what I have been dealing with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase more and will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Changed the odor of my flatulence from sulfur dioxide to something much less offensive.  At times I didn&#x27;t notice any odor.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for an embarrassing condition.</li>
