    <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND OR ARE ALLERGIC TO FRAGRANCE DO NOT USE. TERRIBLE ON THE EYES. I just had to pay 150.00 for an eye perscription to get rid of the allergies brought on by this soap!!</li>
    <li> This soap is not super cheap considering that you can get 2 things of Dove soap for about the same price. The difference is that this soap feels amazing on your skin in the shower and then continues to moisturize and smell fantastic when you get out of the shower and dry off. I prefer the squeaky clean feeling and shy away from body washes and this soap is the best bar soap I have found. It feels really pure and has enough scent that you can tell you are \\&quot;clean\\&quot; but isn&#x27;t too perfumy or heavy feeling.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this soap.  It is mild, yet leaves the skin clean.  One bar lasts about 3-4 months. It lathers nicely and washes off with no residue.

I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 years and often wonder if the compliments I receive about how young I look can be attributed to this quality face soap.</li>

    <li> I love the Skin Trip moisturizer so I thought the soap would be great too.  It was so stinky I had to throw it out after using it a couple of times.  Maybe I got a bar from a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know, but I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>

    <li> This soap is very gentle for sensitive skin, non-drying, with a wonderful lather.  Also, I asked the company and they said:  \\&quot;None of our products are made in China or made with ingredients imported from China.\\&quot;  So you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about all the toxic ingredients in OTHER soaps that do import ingredients from China.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is natural, lathers well and has a wonderful coconut scent. I like the other products as well.</li>

    <li> Love this soap! It is the only one that I use that doesn&#x27;t have the residue feel. Plus, the scent is wonderful! I wish they made a natural oil scent you can wear.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I picked up a bottle of Skin Trip Moisture lotion to use for after-sun care on a beach vacation. The product worked so well on my sensitive, fair, easily-sunburned skin that I came to Amazon to see if the company made any other skin care products. Since then, Skin Trip coconut soap has been part of my beauty routine, not just at the beach house during the summers but in my shower all year long. Keep it dry between uses; don&#x27;t allow it to sit in a soggy soap box. That&#x27;s the key to getting the longest use out of each delightful bar.</li>
    <li> If my wife happens to drop a bar of this soap in the shower....  Needn&#x27;t say much more, need I?</li>
