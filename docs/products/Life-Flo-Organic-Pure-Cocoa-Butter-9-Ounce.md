      <li>I enjoyed making my body butters with this cocoa butter.  </li>

      <li>You will love this...</li>
      <li>I love switching up my skin care (shea butter Vaseline gel, coconut oil, and now this).</li>
      <li>I take my thumb nail and scrap it across the top and a lot comes off</li>
      <li>I was expecting something more like a lotion, but thicker.</li>
      <li>My friends really enjoyed it as well.</li>
      <li>You will need to heat up for easy application, but I just rub my hands together with the butter, and my body heat makes it more manageable.</li>
      <li>This is a great natural product that I use for my skin.</li>

      <li>It has a strong cocoa smell .</li>
      <li>the smell is extremely strong.</li>

      <li>Makes me skin smooth.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
      <li>This was an inexpensive cocoa butter; however, it is the kind that is already hardened and cannot be easily rubbed onto your skin, it must be warmed up on the stove top or microwave in order to become liquid enough to spread.  </li>
      <li>Terressentials Cocoa Butter Rich Body Oil.</li>
      <li>I am impressed with this cocoa butter because, although it is compact, it rubs into my skin very well and it leaves me feeling soft, silky, and very hydrated.</li>

      <li>also works great on dry feet.  </li>
      <li>I love that this is pure cocoa butter.</li>

      <li>Super greasy.</li>
      <li>in fact, cocoa butter is high in antioxidants, which helps fight off free radicals--and free radicals are the cause of skin stressers and signs of aging.</li>
      <li>I put it in warm water to melt it and mixed it with virgin coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!ely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Please remember that a diet filled with fruits and vegetables should be the main source of nutrition, as it can heal from the inside out.</li>

      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I heat this product up in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute depending on how much of my body I want to cover in this oil.  </li>
      <li>I really noticed a difference in my skin</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Frustrating that I now have so much of this that I won&#x27;t be able to easily spread on areas of my body that need it.</li>
      <li>It is a nice size jar and should last me a long time, too.</li>
      <li>I can tell its a high quality product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cocoa butter is hard as a rock. I have to dig some out and microwave each time. Too time consuming.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed making my body butters with this cocoa butter.  It was pretty solid and so I had to melt it a little but that&#x27;s standard from what I understand.  It smelled really good and worked wonderfully on my skin.  My friends really enjoyed it as well.</li>
    <li> I can tell its a high quality product. It will be hard though. Not soft. Had to scrape out flakes and melt them to use.</li>
    <li> Use it to make body butter.  Very good.</li>
    <li> smells strong.&lt;br /&gt;hard most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;as per instruction to microwave, it should add may have to microwave at every use.</li>
    <li> Hope you love the smell of chocolate. I heat this product up in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute depending on how much of my body I want to cover in this oil.  My skin feels great afterwards especially during the winter.  But sometimes the smell of the cocoa makes me nauseous!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast Shipping!!!</li>
    <li> The real deal, purely organic. Had to be warmed in microwave before each use and the smell is extremely strong.</li>
    <li> You have to heat the jar up every time you want to use it otherwise it is completely solid. When you heat it up it becomes a runny liquid. I was expecting something more like a lotion, but thicker.</li>
    <li> great for scars and wrinkles.  also works great on dry feet.  a little goes a very long way, I highy recommend it</li>
    <li> Too hard to use as a cream.  Can&#x27;t even get it out of jar. Then if u heat it, it makes a mess.. SUPER RUNNY AND GREASY!  So I don&#x27;t even bother trying to use it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and few other butters for my natural hair and my body. My hair is sooo soft and full. My skin is soft to. Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I made my own whipped body butter and this was one of the products I used.  The smell was wonderful and I can feel the moisturizing effects of the cocoa butter.  It&#x27;s a little hard to scrap out of the container...but with the right utensil, it really isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I used a small spoon and would have used a grapefruit spoon, I had had one.  This comes in a glass jar which is awesome as I am attempting to minimize my exposure to plastic.  This jar should last me almost a year for this recipe.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a natural moisturizer... was trying new things.  This came, smelled great, but was pretty hard.  I put it in warm water to melt it and mixed it with virgin coconut oil.  After it solidified again, it was a consistency that was soft enough to use as a lotion... of course I need to warm it in my hands first... and I smell like yummy coconut and chocolate!</li>
    <li> Terrible smell solid form not what i excepted</li>
    <li> This cocoa has worked for my husband. He uses this everyday and likes how it makes his face look and feel.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I use it as a lip balm and skin moisturizer. Good quality product.</li>
    <li> It Works Very Good on the skin. You can put in the microwave and heat it up that way it transform into liquid form. Preferably for people with brown skin.</li>
    <li> Warning: You have to heat it up before using it every time. If you&#x27;re willing to do this, it&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing and you will smell like chocolate all day :)&lt;br /&gt;It really is great for those dry areas of your body like elbows, knees, hands, feet, etc, they will feel significantly softer overnight :)&lt;br /&gt;Rub it on your feet at night before going to sleep, and put some socks on - your feet will feel great in the morning!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s annoying that I have to melt it every time i use it. It smells like I fell in a pool of chocolate after using it.</li>
    <li> it was terrible.  I&#x27;m pregnant and do not like that you have to put in the microwave to soften it.  never again will I order this</li>
    <li> You have to heat it up and it gets everywhere. You can&#x27;t sleep in it b/c it gets on your clothes/sheets. Super greasy. not a huge fan. I tried it twice for stretch marks during my pregnancy. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this cocoa butter because, although it is compact, it rubs into my skin very well and it leaves me feeling soft, silky, and very hydrated. It also smells incredible! This cocoa butter is pure, as it does not contain harmful additives. I will tell you a little more about it: Cocoa butter comes from the cacao bean which is found inside the cocoa pod that grows on the cacao tree. The cocoa pod is a large gourd-shaped fruit. Inside of the fruit there is 30 to 40 cocoa seeds. These seeds must be fermented in banana leaves, dried, roasted and pressed, releasing the vegetable fat from the beans, which we know as cocoa butter. How Does Cocoa butter benefit the skin? It contains antioxidants-- in fact, cocoa butter is high in antioxidants, which helps fight off free radicals--and free radicals are the cause of skin stressers and signs of aging. Cocoa butter is also a Stretch Mark Reducer and it is widely noted to help reduce stretch marks. In addition, people say it has helped heal scars and it provides deep hydration.Cocoa butter is high in fatty acids and that may be why it hydrates the skin so deeply. Cocoa butter is also a sensitive skin Healer and it has been noted to help skin irritations such as eczema and dermatitis. Please remember that a diet filled with fruits and vegetables should be the main source of nutrition, as it can heal from the inside out. Our skin needs lubrication and protection-and cocoa butter gets the job done! Keep this jar in a fairly warm place so that when you use it it will spread easily. I take my thumb nail and scrap it across the top and a lot comes off and I spread it wherever my skin needs hydration. I also use it on my face and I must tell you that the moisture from the fatty acids hydrate my skin for four days. Wow! Typically my moisturizers only last one day and my skin skin feels dry again-- not anymore thanks to my Life-Flo Organic Pure cocoa Butter. You will love this... it lasts a very long time, so it is definitely worth the money. You can spread it anywhere on your body and your body drinks it, so it truly hydrates. I love it! Enjoy!ely worth the money. You can spread it anywhere on your body and your body drinks it, so it truly hydrates. I love it! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was gonna used this for my hyper pigmentation scars but It tended to break me out a little(not a lot). For moisturizing the rest of your body it&#x27;s good and honestly you can just pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute(depending on how melted you want it) and then you can use it from there. I don&#x27;t understand all the complaining about how it&#x27;s really difficult to use. If you unfortunately don&#x27;t have a microwave then yes, it is tedious to use.</li>
    <li> Is this supoused to be hard like a rock??? I can not use it like this, reallyyyy??? I really don&#x27;t like it. It is not my tipe, probably I am gonna trow it away.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a plastic bubbly wrap , in a cartoon box. It has a strong cocoa smell . Solid , yellowish color . I applied it for the first time , it softened my hands to a degree. Leaving it a little  bit shiny.</li>
    <li> GOOD DAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY GOOD PRODUCET , I WILL REQUEST AGAN AND AGAIN FROM YOUR SIDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AND HAVE ANICE DAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS,</li>
    <li> It is so hard it has to be microwaved or soaked in hot water for 30 min each time you use it. Not worth the trouble really. When you do it, it is good cream for damaged skin though.</li>
    <li> Very nice, pure cocoa butter! I&#x27;ve been switching from store brand facial creams to all natural and this has been wonderful for helping to heal my skin and get it back to its natural soft, clear complexion. It is a nice size jar and should last me a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Good product. Solid form. To ale soft just warm with your blow dryer.</li>
    <li> The glass jar was smaller than expected but I love what&#x27;s in it nevertheless. It comes rock solid but to soften it I just  put it in the microwave without the lid for a min or less &amp; I was good to go. It smells like chocolate &amp; yes I gave into temptation &amp; tasted it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t taste how it smells either :P... After the very 1st use my body was glowing after my skin absorbed the cocoa butter &amp; I still felt the moisture in my skin hours later. This is my 1st time using this product in it&#x27;s pure form &amp; I would definitely buy again! Can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after I finish this jar. Hope my review was helpful.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing after a shower and smells deliciously like chocolate that it lifts my mood :) Will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> i ordered this for the organic face cream im makeing i also use it for chap stick, the idem is great</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter! It smells so good I pulled eat it!  I rub it on my belly daily!</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter arrives in a glass jar. The cocoa butter content is rock solid cocoa butter. You have to nuke it for a minute every single time you want to use it. I&#x27;ll never buy this brand again and will have to go back to my old brand: Terressentials Cocoa Butter Rich Body Oil. It never gets too solid for use. It does get to the consistency of margarine, so when I get it, I nuke it, then pour it into a glass &amp;#34;Tupperware&amp;#34; lidded dish and keep it in my bedside drawer for easy access moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I was so sad when I developed an allergy to this. It smells great and is super hydrating. I hate that I&#x27;m allergic</li>
    <li> I love that this is pure cocoa butter. It moisturizes well and I feel like it gives my skin a slight glow. The only thing is its rock hard and and pain the butt to remember to microwave it every time before taking a shower. Then after the microwave it&#x27;s more like cocoa oil. I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to microwave it every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I love switching up my skin care (shea butter Vaseline gel, coconut oil, and now this). My skin is dry and these products all do the job. I loved this! My skin never feels dry throughout my day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars because this is an organic, SOLID rock cocoa butter. Yes, you can shave off shavings but it does not work as well as if you heat it up. I have to heat it up every time (or I leave it over the heater vent over night). But when it&#x27;s melted it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Nice product for making homemade products. Makes me skin smooth. The only thing is that the smell of tbe cocoa butter is stronger than the essential oils I put in my products and cant&#x27;t smell them.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural product that I use for my skin. As long as you don&#x27;t mind the hard texture and the strong smell ( seriously, you will smell like a chocolate bar! ), it&#x27;s awesome. I even mixed avocado, almond, and coconut oil into mine. You will need to heat up for easy application, but I just rub my hands together with the butter, and my body heat makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> Always has to be melted before it can be applied. I mean who has time for that?!</li>
    <li> This was an inexpensive cocoa butter; however, it is the kind that is already hardened and cannot be easily rubbed onto your skin, it must be warmed up on the stove top or microwave in order to become liquid enough to spread.  Frustrating that I now have so much of this that I won&#x27;t be able to easily spread on areas of my body that need it.</li>
    <li> good size organic cocoa butter.i would purchase again. This product is 99 percent pure cocoa butter.9 fluid ounces of pure cocoa butter</li>
    <li> This product is very high quality but you probably won&#x27;t use it much because it will require heating it up every single time in order for you to apply it to your skin.  Unless you have a microwave in your bathroom this will become terribly inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Heating it up is kind of a hassle but other than that it&#x27;s great. I saw improvement in my skin in a week and it smells great! I going to keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> leaves your skin super smooth. Great for stretch marks! smells great. natural state. I really noticed a difference in my skin</li>
