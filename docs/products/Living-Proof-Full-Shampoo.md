      <li>I have used so many products</li>
      <li>Love all Living Proof products...</li>
      <li>I do remember that they &#x27;pitched&#x27; it to Jennifer Anniston, who fell in love with the way it made her hair feel and look.</li>
      <li>I was using BedHead products, which were my favorite, all though my 20s</li>
      <li>but after I bought the shampoo for $28, the ingredients sure looked like chemicals.</li>

      <li>I gave 2 stars because I love the smell (light grapefruit scent)</li>
      <li>I love the Living Proof Full products.</li>
      <li>My hair looks really healthy, full, not overly-styled, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is, hands down, the best volumizing shampoo that I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
      <li>What I love about this shampoo is that it makes my hair look like it never has before--thick, BOUNCY, SHINY, and so EASY to get a brush through it, right out of the shower--and it&#x27;s very rarely easy for me to get a brush through this hair--it tangles SO easily.</li>
      <li>I am 50+ and have fine wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone with fine hair to use these products.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried every sulfate free shampoo out there and most don&#x27;t lather very well or really feel like they&#x27;re doing a good job.</li>
      <li>Sound like a &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; might be in order.</li>
      <li>I was looking for sulphate free products and tried this shampoo and matching conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never even used cheap shampoo and conditioner that have looked like they have damaged my hair like this.</li>
      <li>Your hair comes alive, it shines, it stays cleaner longer--I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo this good before.</li>
      <li>I hope Living Proof hits drug store and other store shelves, so that more women can use this great shampoo, as well as the conditioner and setting lotions.</li>
      <li>Although this line of products are more costly than the norm, they require so much less product to achieve great results.</li>
      <li>and I never noticed any significant change in my hair.</li>
      <li>I do like the clean smell</li>
      <li>Leaves hair shiny and clean and manageable.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt clean, but not stripped.</li>
      <li>When paired with the full mousse, my hair feels full, bouncy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product along with the line of products from Living Proof Full.</li>
      <li>I washed/conditioned with the Full shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I like how the full mousse works.</li>
      <li>- maybe I need to use it longer for the full effect.  </li>
      <li>[I am using the Full Shampoo and Full Conditioner so this review is about both.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enter Living Proof Full.</li>
      <li>I just went out and purchased this product along with the full conditioner and extender product</li>
      <li>but it is not nearly as bad.</li>
      <li>I have fine, very straight hair.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, the results were fantastic.</li>
      <li>I also bought the conditioner and thickener, and they&#x27;re my new favorite products.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, I think I will reserve them to be used only for special occasions when I really need my hair to be gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and smells clean.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use it daily, but when I do...absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>light weight, sulfate free, not drying, ok for dyed hair, my hair is fuller WHEN YOU BLOW DRY.  </li>
      <li>Really helps my baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not colored or permed.</li>
      <li>I have very baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>But I am willing to bet that you will love it, just like me :) Seriously, this is amazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love all Living Proof products...they are a step above.</li>
    <li> Developed by scientists at MIT, this formula is activated by heat and really does make the hair appear full and thick - only use a tiny amount - it&#x27;s expensive but long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I like how the full mousse works. However I have purchased 2 containers that did not produce fluffy mousse. One can lost its pressure and the other came out runny and lacked any mousse texture at all. Bummer---it is expensive. I am getting gun-shy about making further purchases. I have read other reviewers experienced the same problem. Sound like a &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; might be in order.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this product. I love the Living Proof Full products. They smell great and I really like the way they make my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Psoriasis in my scalp for 8 years...used every shampoo and medication on the shelf and prescribed by the doctors. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that keeps my scalp calm, no constant scratching and much less flaking than anything I have ever used! There is no cure, but this sure comes close. Not to mention how shiny my hair looks and it does not destroy my color.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know a difference from my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really helps my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine thin hair. Always looking for a product that does what it says. My hair has improved, shine, body. No disappointment in the shampoo. Will buy again and yes even pay the shipping I like  I like it that much.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for the last two years.  It is perfect for my hair!  I will continue to purchase this shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is  very good to make your hair fuller and so it has body.  I think this is a good product..</li>
    <li> Living Proof shampoo fulfills all of its promises. Your hair comes alive, it shines, it stays cleaner longer--I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo this good before. I don&#x27;t remember how I chanced upon Living Proof, maybe I saw an article about it, where the developers explained in detail about all of the research that went in to making their products. I do remember that they &#x27;pitched&#x27; it to Jennifer Anniston, who fell in love with the way it made her hair feel and look. I also seem to remember that she invested in the company, but cannot advertise for them because of contracts she has with another cosmetic brand. I do remember, she loves the shampoo.  So do I.  Of course I&#x27;m not beautiful, I don&#x27;t have a gorgeous head of hair like Anniston does, but I can say that Living Proof fulfills its promise of a new life and lift for your hair. I am so pleased with it that I&#x27;ve purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my daughter and my two little granddaughters to use. They like it too. I hope Living Proof hits drug store and other store shelves, so that more women can use this great shampoo, as well as the conditioner and setting lotions.</li>
    <li> For the amount of money you pay for these products you&#x27;d expect them to work. I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not colored or permed. I tried this product along with the line of products from Living Proof Full. I was not impressed at all with the results the shampoo didn&#x27;t feel like it had cleaned my hair at all. My hair was greasy feeling and it wouldn&#x27;t hold curl anymore after using this line of products. I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone with fine hair to use these products. I will be returning these products. I&#x27;m shocked that the people from MIT would put out a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it&#x27; supposed to. I&#x27;ve tried several different amounts and still got the same results...flat greasy hair. Shameful that they would charge the amount they do knowing this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have been out of this shampoo for about a month &amp; I have been having bad hair days everyday!! I washed my hair every 2 or 3 days when using Living Proof. With other (cheaper) shampoo, it needs washed everyday. I am 50+ and have fine wavy hair. I usually wash, condition &amp; air dry most of the way, then add a mousse for enhancing curl. Blow drying does add even more volume. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It really could use some improvement! If it smelled better it would get a solid 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> This line is the best to come around in a long time.  No harsh chemicals for my chemically treated hair and the scent is divine.  You will love this product and the \\&quot;full\\&quot; line truly adds stunning body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the Living Proof line of products.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t changing my life though and there are other products that will make your hair feel as good as this product and cost half the price. Terax for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like the packaging and the actual product, I will probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I have thinning hair which is worn short by necessity.  I was skeptical when I first tried this product but loved it immediately.  Shortly after I began using it, I had a haircut.  My hairdresser commented on how much thicker my hair seemed.  I have been using it for some time now and the effect has not worn off.  I have recommended it to others and they have had the same result.  In at least one case the hairdresser also commented on the improvement in fullness.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve entered my 40&#x27;s, my hair has been thinning out- especially at my temples.  I&#x27;ve tried countless products and Living Proof is the only one that has showed a noticeable difference almost instantly.  When paired with the full mousse, my hair feels full, bouncy and shiny.  The thickening cream weighed my hair down a bit so I wouldn&#x27;t buy that again , unless using a tiny drop of the product.  The only down fall of this product is that it is pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.  The mousse applicator literally stops working with 1/4 of the product left (can design flaw).  If you can afford this luxury- go fo it.  It works.</li>
    <li> made my hair flat I did not like this product</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo! My hair stylist used it and I thought my hair looked, great. Very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> How do I give this zero stars? I am sorry to say, but this shampoo damaged my hair. I have fine, thin hair and used the Full products. I used it twice and my hair looks so bad I simple can&#x27;t use it again. I&#x27;m actually a bit panicked about it. It&#x27;s limp and it looks like what hair looks like from over-processing. (I don&#x27;t color treat my hair at all.) I&#x27;ve never even used cheap shampoo and conditioner that have looked like they have damaged my hair like this. So disappointed and out $45! And now praying my old shampoo can help restore my hair. Maybe the No Frizz is better, but not willing to take the chance.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny and clean and manageable.  Doesn&#x27;t thicken as much as some other brands.  Not good for my thin hair</li>
    <li> I have really oily hair, mainly by the scalp. I&#x27;ve tried all the remedies but this shampoo is by far the greatest I&#x27;ve tried! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 and my hair has thinned nearly half the amount I had two years ago. I&#x27;ve tried everything from hair supplements and diy hair masks.  I should also mention I&#x27;m constantly trying new shampoos that are designed for fine thin hair. Recently I&#x27;ve been trying the higher end shampoos and I thought this one would work for me after reading mostly positive reviews. I tried it for a few weeks and I never noticed any significant change in my hair. All that I did notice was that my hair was falling out more. This shampoo may work for women with thicker hair but I would not recommend this to girls with hair on the thin side.</li>
    <li> I just went out and purchased this product along with the full conditioner and extender product and I am extremely disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so looking forward to getting a little more body added to my hair. When I finished blow drying it I couldn&#x27;t believe how FLAT it came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, live and learn...</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for smooth, silky hair with volume.</li>
    <li> When my stylist used this on my hair, she said it didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it but after I bought the shampoo for $28, the ingredients sure looked like chemicals. Never the less, I used it twice and my hair was snapping and popping off. I am wondering why they cannot take this back and refund my money. I continue to use my previous shampoo.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair felt thicker same day. Great Product!</li>
    <li> My hair smelled excellent, looked great and healthy along with that extra lift and body that was frizz free.  I got comments that my hair looked really good even after days of not washing it.</li>
    <li> Living Proof Full Shampoo is a great shampoo. It has given my hair more volume and improved the over all health of my hair. I wish however this product was more affordable for all people.</li>
    <li> I really like what this shampoo does to my hair.  The real test will be during the summer months though, when the humidity is particularly high!</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo for occasional use ONLY.  It does provide lift, bounce, and manageability......but cannot be used daily.  If used daily.....it definitely is drying.  I have long thick straight hair and did not seem to be able to withstand daily use.....my hair became dry and lost its luster after several wks use.</li>
    <li> Over the past few years i have tried endless thickening products. This one is by far my favorite. While the price is high you dont need that much so it will last a while. My hair has never looked or felt better. Its soft but not the unmanageable soft that a lot of products produce. No more flyaways and no additional products needed i used the shampoo and conditioner and mousse and only needed a little hairspray. Hair looks just as good at night as it did in the morning. Does not weigh down hair at all. Highly recommend and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it and this shampoo and the conditioner did the exact opposite of what it claims.  It left my hair flat, lifeless and actually greasy by the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve used many &#x27;body building&#x27; shampoos/conditioner&#x27;s and sadly very few actually do what they claim.  I gave 2 stars because I love the smell (light grapefruit scent) but that&#x27;s about it.  Bummed.</li>
    <li> I was one of the fortunate few to be able to buy this shampoo as part of a trio via a special offer. I rec&#x27;d the shampoo, conditioner and thickening cream for less than the price of just one of these. Holy cow.. this is amazing stuff! My hair has never looked this great before! It is smooth, shiny and SO bouncy!. I have fine, very straight hair. I shampoo, condition, towel dry and work a little of the thickening cream through my hair and it looks and feels amazing. I normally use a little bit of flat iron cream to style my hair with the iron but did not need it with the LP thickening cream. I will really hate when I run out of these products as I cannot see myself paying 60+ to replace them. In the meantime, I think I will reserve them to be used only for special occasions when I really need my hair to be gorgeous.</li>
    <li> All right, everyone. Let&#x27;s get real about our hair. Mine is a little on the thin side but not extremely thin. I do not color treat. I do not use any post-shower product. By the end of the day I usually have extremely oily hair, enough so that I have to pull back into a pony tail. Whatever body I had in the morning is promptly gone by the afternoon. Once a week I used Neutrogena&#x27;s build up removal shampoo (that smells like crap by the way) but it does the final cleansing I need for the oily build up I get. I usually use shampoos for normal to oily hair and am very cautious about using too much conditioner or getting it near my roots. I have tried every sulfate free shampoo out there and most don&#x27;t lather very well or really feel like they&#x27;re doing a good job. Enter Living Proof Full. I gasped at the price but my sister swore by it so I bought it have been using it for about two weeks. [I am using the Full Shampoo and Full Conditioner so this review is about both.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of the product, I could feel a difference. My hair felt clean, but not stripped. The body I had was great. However, this product is not magic, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. I still get oily hair in the afternoon but it is not nearly as bad. I can leave my hair down all day and not be self-conscious about my hair looking oily. Example - I shampooed and conditioned yesterday morning and am writing this review the next morning. Before Living Proof Full products, my hair would be so oily right now it would be borderline disgusting. But I can run my fingers through my hair right now and although it feels a little heavy and limp, it physically looks ok. Another bonus - I&#x27;ve noticed fewers breakouts on my back in the last week or so. --&amp;#62;Bonus!&amp;#60;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is high, but for my needs it&#x27;s completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are small, but you really do use less of the product than traditional shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great results for this oily-haired gal.</li>
    <li> This definitely adds some oomph and manageability to my fine, straight hair, which is a rare find in a sulfate-free shampoo. Unfortunately for me, something in the ingredients doesn&#x27;t agree with my super-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Makes my hair much thicker.</li>
    <li> I Love this Shampoo,I have used so many hair products to get rid of frizz and this has proven to do just that,my Hair is not dry and seems to be fuller! A big Plus,Compared to Alterna that i thought was my favorite,Living Proof seems to work better for my Hair type.There are alot of products i still will use from Alterna that work great but for now i am happy with the switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and I have to say...I keep purchasing it.  I started off using the conditioner too but found that I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I would use a cheaper conditioner, so I stopped buying it.  The likes: light weight, sulfate free, not drying, ok for dyed hair, my hair is fuller WHEN YOU BLOW DRY.  That&#x27;s the key, the ingredients react to heat.  Dislikes: the price.  Conclusion, I will keep purchasing until it get&#x27;s too expensive for my budget.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seemed to just leave my hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I noticed an immediate change, for the positive, in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple times (the full version) and thus far my thin hair doesn&#x27;t seem fuller - maybe I need to use it longer for the full effect.  I do like the clean smell but I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for sulphate free products and tried this shampoo and matching conditioner. Love it! My hair is soft and looks fuller. I&#x27;m anxious to try some styling products in this line too!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  Very gentle and smells clean.  My hair which is getting old and grey reacted very well to it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Works great on my hair.  Wash it every other day and still looks good on Day Two.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair greasy and flat.  The product doesn&#x27;t work on my hair at all!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought the trial size of this shampoo. The first time I used it, the results were fantastic. That was the end of that though. Every time since then, my hair has been flat and greasy, even though I made sure to get it all out. And now, my hair is starting to fall out. I won&#x27;t be using it again. Ever.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look wonderful!  I get many compliments and my hair feels better after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you get some!</li>
    <li> Great product- A bottle lasts a long time and hair stays cleaner longer. I can tell a gib difference in volume of my hair</li>
    <li> I will use this for life unless my skin changes again. I was using BedHead products, which were my favorite, all though my 20s but when I got into my 30s my skin completly changed. Dry dry dry. I am a product junkie and I cannot tell you what wonders this has done for my hair. I was blessed to have pretty decent hair before but now my hair is even softer and shinier. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch. It is also sulfate free which is good for you, and it smells good. This plus the amika hair dryer makes my hair look the best it&#x27;s ever looked. I am so thrilled that Amazon carries these but you can also purchase in Ulta. I have used so many products but I can honestly say that I will use this for life unless my body chemistry changes again. I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
    <li> Use very little, I have short hair and use a dime sized amount and it lathers plenty!  Although this line of products are more costly than the norm, they require so much less product to achieve great results. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  I&#x27;ve spent years trying to find a shampoo that cleaned my hair but also left a natural body to it.  Living Proof performs the job for me so much so, that I now buy several other Living Proof products.  It may be slighly higher than shampoos in the stores but it works and it lasts quite a long time.  Well worth the money.  My hair thanks you!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair. In terms of hair volume (number of hairs on my head), it isn&#x27;t thick or thin --- kind of in between. This shampoo leaves my hair full and fluffy all over. It absolutely does NOT leave my hair flat on top or anywhere. (I&#x27;m surprised by the review that said it leaves her hair flat on top. I wonder if she is putting conditioner on her roots?) I&#x27;m careful not to use conditioner at the top of my hair. The only problem is that over time this shampoo left my ends very dry and fly-away, even using full conditioner every day. Ironically, dry, fly-away ends make my hair look thin. In an effort to moisturize and calm my ends, I used other Living Proof products: No Frizz Styling Spray, Restore Spray (aerosol -- forgot the name), Restore Targeted Repair Cream, No Frizz Leave-in Conditioner, and No Frizz Styling Cream. None of these products worked to moisturize and defrizz my ends! Finally, I figured out (duh) to stop using Full Shampoo. I&#x27;ve since switched to Living Proof No Frizz Shampoo. I use it with Full Conditioner, Full Styling Cream, and No Frizz products (I&#x27;m still trying to work out which product is the best for me). The result is fluffy, bouncy, conditioned, juicy (for lack of a better term -- I mean full and healthy at the ends) hair. I&#x27;m still tweaking products to combat frizz.</li>
    <li> ME: Color treated dry-ish medium length thick naturally wavy hair. I usually wash with Goldwell Colorsense every 2-3 days, use Moroccan oil after wash/prior to styling. I blow dry with a round brush, flat iron, or use a curling iron to style (I do NOT have \\&quot;wash n wear\\&quot; hair). Normally use a Goldwell spray wax for styling, hairspray for special occasions. Normally takes me about 30-45 minutes to style \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hair from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to large well-known beauty supply store for a dry shampoo to extend the time between washings. Salesperson directed me straight to Living Proof and asked me what my needs/requirements were. She then told me that the \\&quot;Full\\&quot; line is designed to extend the time between washings and improve the fullness and life of your hair. She also showed me a conditioner and the Prime style extender cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on day 1 in the evening before bed I washed/conditioned with the Full shampoo and conditioner. I towel-dried and applied the Prime extender as directed. I then blow-dried with a round brush into a style. Went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: woke up, brushed, used a curling iron on maybe 3 errant pieces of hair. All in all took me about 3-5 minutes. My hair looks really healthy, full, not overly-styled, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: same thing. No change. I told my coworkers this and they don&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t washed my hair. I have no other products in my hair because I don&#x27;t need them. No hairspray, spray wax, pomade, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge skeptic and am COMPLETELY surprised by this. I do of course want to give this a few more weeks to see how it holds up, but so far, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of volumizing shampoos...I have very baby fine hair. I bought a sample size of this shampoo &amp; the mousse.  The combination of the shampoo  (I used pureology conditioner I had left over just on the ends) &amp; mousse has made my hair the fullest it has ever looked! It also seemed to bring out my months old highlights...barely have to style my hair and looks great. Just wish it were a little more affordable...don&#x27;t use it daily, but when I do...absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has fine/thin hair.  Gives an incredible amount of volume!!!! Works even better if you use all 3 products together (the shampoo, conditioner and mousse)</li>
    <li> love this product! worth the money!!</li>
    <li> For a sulfate-free shampoo it lathers well, gives lots of volume and oh, so much shine and silkiness!  I am in LOVE!  Same goes for the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trial size shampoo, condition, and cream from my stylist because it was &#x27;on sale.&#x27;  After using it a few times, I was not impressed.  My hair looked dull and had no body.  It had a ton of fly-aways and my hair felt like crap. I get better results from the less expensive shampoo and conditioner I bought at Wal-Mart.  This is one product I will not be buying again.  I was glad to have only purchased the trial sizes and don&#x27;t feel too guilty about wasting my money. It is too expensive and does not deliver on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best volumizing shampoo that I&#x27;ve EVER used. I first was exposed to the product when I received a couple mini samples (the shampoo and the conditioner) from Sephora. Background: I am 26 years old and I have thick-ish (but not very thick--getting thinner all the time) hair, very fine strands, lots of them. I noticed a difference the first time I used this shampoo and conditioner, and if I can afford it, I&#x27;ll never use anything else. I would like to try the thickening cream next. What I love about this shampoo is that it makes my hair look like it never has before--thick, BOUNCY, SHINY, and so EASY to get a brush through it, right out of the shower--and it&#x27;s very rarely easy for me to get a brush through this hair--it tangles SO easily. My hair smells great and feels incredibly clean, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this stuff--use as little as possible, and make it last longer! Another tip: when you only have a little of the shampoo left in the bottle, fill it up with water. What&#x27;s left of the shampoo will mix with the water and, voila, you have a whole new bottle of shampoo--a lot runnier, but it still works!! You can even do the same with the conditioner. Believe me, if I&#x27;m going to spend this kind of money on shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;m going to milk it for all it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? If you have thin hair that you&#x27;re just not happy with, buy this shampoo and conditioner in the SAMPLE sizes. They are only a couple bucks, and you will get to see whether or not the product is for you. But I am willing to bet that you will love it, just like me :) Seriously, this is amazing. My hair is soooooo thick and lovely, I just can&#x27;t stop touching it. And my boyfriend can&#x27;t, either!</li>
    <li> really expensive for my budget but its a great designer shampoo to have for nights out and special hair days!</li>
    <li> I really like this line of products.  Amazing amount of suds with less than a pea-size drop of the shampoo.  My hair looks great after using the shampoo.  I also bought the conditioner and thickener, and they&#x27;re my new favorite products.</li>
    <li> Pricey but still a good clean shampoo.</li>
