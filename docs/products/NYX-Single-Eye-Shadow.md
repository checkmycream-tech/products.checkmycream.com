      <li>Awesome pigmentation!</li>
      <li>I bought this to draw my eye cavities as a day-of-the-dead skull, and it worked perfectly.</li>

      <li>All I have to say is this is an amazing product!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with the cheaper alternative!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re thinking about buying MAC, consider this one first, it works perfectly.</li>

      <li>Cheap too!</li>
      <li>I love nxy makeup</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>but I never have to reapply, I have used what&#x27;s still on but worked into my creases and create a more Smokey look on my eyelids for the evening.</li>
      <li>could have been packaged a bit better- when it came</li>
      <li>i love this stuff tho and if i could find it in a store id just buy it there.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a plus. :)</li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>This is a fraction of the price, and frankly much more pigmented.  </li>
      <li>I love how matte and sexy it makes my eyes.</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeshadow that I have come across, and I have tried many different brands.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m confident this will work fine for that purpose</li>
      <li>I Start off lightly then add more if needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they are best worn wet which allows them glide smoothly and makes it easy to apply.</li>
      <li>the powder will break up easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly this is easily making powder.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>Quite the contrary, it goes on easily with a good brush and stays put better than my old faithful crayon stick liner.</li>
      <li>Easy blending.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the NYX line.</li>
      <li>No animal testing, goes on smooth, and stays put.  </li>
      <li>This is an absolute essential product in my makeup routine and this is the best quality you will find on the web-</li>
      <li>I love the color very much.</li>
      <li>Works great for lining top of eyes with a little smudging.  </li>
      <li>This single eyeshadow is great.</li>
      <li>sometimes i feel like touching it up, but it usually looks great.</li>
      <li>The pigment is fantastic and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Best long last shadow!</li>
      <li>I really like this shadow because it is easy to apply and stays in place.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product that&#x27;s cheap with high quality I suggest this.</li>
      <li>Blacker than black, good for lining your eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found some black shadow without sprinkles! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It really sucked the fun out of it, even if the pigmentation is still unrivaled.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>i am giving this product 3 stars because of two things: the first time i got it from amazon</li>
      <li>Exactly what my mom wanted (:</li>
      <li>it was a bit more smaller than i thought it was be, but overall im satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;ll take more frequent spot checks if it means having such the rich color.</li>
      <li>But, for a shadow as dark as this...I can easily forgive the cheap texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice matte black with a buttery texture.</li>
      <li>However this could be a good think because this will last a very long time and applicators should be replaced periodically for health reasons anyway.  </li>
      <li>Great matte black that last all day.</li>
      <li>I ordered the color skin tight and the color was really nice</li>
      <li>Nice, very dark eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>An absolute staple in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.  </li>
      <li>and it went on really fast.</li>
      <li>Way too much fallout with this.</li>
      <li>This is really pigmented.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t even need primer to appreciate its intense pigment (although I would recommend you use primer to extend the staying power of it if you tend to have oily lids).</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>[ i attend a LOT of funerals ] and it always goes on smooth and has lasting power.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Very buildable.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY pigmented stuff!</li>
      <li>this is the second time I purchased this product, it lasts a long time and has amazing pigment .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to discover a product that&#x27;s an improvement and helps the day start off a little easier!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for deep blacks to some lighter greys, it does get little powders everywhere but just gotta wipe your face.</li>
      <li>use this mainly for darkening existing eyeliner lines and it works like a charm.</li>
      <li>Please spend a little more money and buy a better quality black eye shadow.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s blends perfectly with my eyeliner, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t flake, lasts for such a long time considering the low price and a little goes a long way since it&#x27;s so pigmented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy dark coverage,</li>
      <li>Deep, rich matte black color, just as good if not better than MAC &amp;#34;Carbon&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with MAC&#x27;s Carbon...believe the words of other reviewers as well as mine, this one IS darker.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m not a big fan of eyeshadow, so I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it is nice enough that I ordered other colors</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best long last shadow! From eyeliner to gray cover! it is on till you take it off.</li>
    <li> black eyeshadow, simple and straightforward. i expected it to be slightly shimmery which it is not, but that&#x27;s fine. could have been packaged a bit better- when it came it was just loose in the box with the other items i ordered, and as a result some of the eyeshadow had crumbled.</li>
    <li> I ordered the color skin tight and the color was really nice so i decided to order another on in the shade Aloha. when i received it the plastic pane was broken off and just thrown in the bottom of the mailing envelope half of the actual eye-shadow had crumbled away and i was really upset i tried to glue it but it looks terrible and i jut threw it out. if i could give it 0 stars i would</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I hav used all kind of makeup in the world, but this one is one of the terrible one, it runssssssssss and stain your skin, i had a bad experiency with.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow.  This color is very bold and dramatic like I wanted. I bought this eyeshadow in white and was very disappointed as it barely showed up. This color in particular was dark and didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> NYX single eye shadows are the bomb!!&lt;br /&gt;they are best worn wet which allows them glide smoothly and makes it easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the NYX line. They go on very well and are extremely long lasting. This is a true black.</li>
    <li> this is the second time I purchased this product, it lasts a long time and has amazing pigment . This is an absolute essential product in my makeup routine and this is the best quality you will find on the web- trust me, i spent hours looking.  Great price, great product, fast delivery.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using black eye shadow to create my signature smokey look since 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Deep matte pigment, long wear.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Flakes throughout the day, hard to wipe off smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll take more frequent spot checks if it means having such the rich color. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED::: I had to stop using it because, in fact, the spontaneous smudging/running got so bad my husband kept having to be on a perpetual vigil. It really sucked the fun out of it, even if the pigmentation is still unrivaled. I&#x27;ve heard that setting it with a mist of water helps to prevent this, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
    <li> I got my product and I will have to say its very nice to the touch I use this for the eye lids of my eyes.  I can say to have that dark eye effect I have to use a lot of product to make it very dark which I thought it was a real dark eye shadow, but it&#x27;s very nice I like!</li>
    <li> i use this makeup every single day for my normal look [ i attend a LOT of funerals ] and it always goes on smooth and has lasting power. sometimes i feel like touching it up, but it usually looks great. i am giving this product 3 stars because of two things: the first time i got it from amazon it arrived broken [ please put any kind of powder makeup in bubble wrap otherwise it will probably shatter in transit ] and because the actual pigment tends to run. i love this stuff tho and if i could find it in a store id just buy it there. it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this eye shadow. I got these from other sources and here in Amazon, and i am very sure Amazon is selling fake ones. I&#x27;ve tried to order here from different sellers, but most of them I&#x27;ve tried sell fake ones!!!!When you look at it, you can tell even its color is weaker and its constitution is much less stickier!</li>
    <li> Way too much fallout with this. Please spend a little more money and buy a better quality black eye shadow.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow fell into my cheek barely half an hour after I applied it. I like the colour on my eyelid but definitely not on my cheek. Can anyone share their experiences applying this eyeshadow?</li>
    <li> NYX is as good an eye shadow as any that exist on the market. They blend well yet stay put all day, and are one of the few shadows strong enough to use as an eyeliner. Once you&#x27;ve tried one you&#x27;ll never want to pay for a high-priced shadow again.</li>
    <li> This single eyeshadow is great. The pigment is fantastic and it&#x27;s worth the price. If you are looking for a product that&#x27;s cheap with high quality I suggest this. I use this all the time, especially when doing freelance work.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeshadow that I have come across, and I have tried many different brands. The quality is not only better than mac and other high end makeup, but it also costs less. While this eyeshadow is not a cream, it almost had a cream/velvet feel to it. I bought this in Black.</li>
    <li> The pigment in this eye shadow is very, very black.  Works great for lining top of eyes with a little smudging.  Only drawback, does not come with an applicator.  However this could be a good think because this will last a very long time and applicators should be replaced periodically for health reasons anyway.  I really like this shadow because it is easy to apply and stays in place.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t joking when they say black. This isn&#x27;t the kind of eye shadow you layer on to get the ideal darkness; you need one layer and you&#x27;re all set. I really like it, but it&#x27;s definitely a nighttime look.</li>
    <li> Great matte black that last all day. Little bit of fallout, but nothing anybody can&#x27;t fix or work around. Best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this Black Eye Shadow she picked out for her Halloween Costume Theme &amp; theirs always more for next years theme usage.</li>
    <li> I love nxy makeup&lt;br /&gt;And this black eyeshadow is the real deal</li>
    <li> the item was not sealed properly and broke apart during transit.. Like 1/4 of the product was inside the lining of the box .....probably an unfair review cause I haven&#x27;t actually used the product but  I just want something to set my liquid eye-liner so I&#x27;m confident this will work fine for that purpose</li>
    <li> This is a really good matte eyeshadow. It&#x27;s good for deep blacks to some lighter greys, it does get little powders everywhere but just gotta wipe your face.</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation. Be prepared for some fall out while applying. Very buildable. Doesn&#x27;t crease. Use a wet brush and use this as a liner.</li>
    <li> This one good for smoky make up.&lt;br /&gt;You can make your eyes looks sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this is easily making powder.&lt;br /&gt;Not that good quality.&lt;br /&gt;But it is good product compare price and quality.</li>
    <li> I love how matte and sexy it makes my eyes. I applied this makeup on my eyelid and it made my eyes look fierce and sexy!</li>
    <li> An absolute staple in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.  It works for creases, eyeliner, darkening an existing shadow.  I used to use M.A.C. carbon for this.  This is a fraction of the price, and frankly much more pigmented.  You cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> Nice, very dark eyeshadow. Seems to stay on long enough for my needs, though I tend to only need it to last half a night (usually 5 hours at most...)</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the black one because i heard it was a dupe for MAC carbon but one came in slightly broken</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! it was a bit more smaller than i thought it was be, but overall im satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented. A little goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve had this little case for about 4 months, use it daily for Smokey effects and contouring and I haven made a dent. Be careful because it is hard to get off and 1 sweep with a brush will give u the blackest eyes. I Start off lightly then add more if needed. It has definitely last a long time. I use a eyeshadow primer and it seems to stay all day. I do have oily lids but I never have to reapply, I have used what&#x27;s still on but worked into my creases and create a more Smokey look on my eyelids for the evening.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my mom wanted (:</li>
    <li> Got here fast, has a very dark matte color. Great for smokey eyes. Definately will be restocking on this when I run out.</li>
    <li> Awesome pigmentation! I used it to darken an eyeshadow color for a performance.</li>
    <li> For a fraction of the price, this thing works as good as (if not better) than the MAC Carbon!!! I am in love with this eyeshadow. Really great saturation. Easy blending. Long lasting. Love.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is this is an amazing product! HIGHLY pigmented stuff! Cheap too! I can&#x27;t believe how little is needed. I&#x27;m so glad I found some black shadow without sprinkles! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Was thinking about purchasing Mac Carbon eyeshadow but heard this was just as good.  I&#x27;m so glad I went with the cheaper alternative! This eyeshadow has good texture and staying power.</li>
    <li> This is dark, opaque, and with very little shimmer. I bought this to draw my eye cavities as a day-of-the-dead skull, and it worked perfectly. Easy dark coverage, and it went on really fast. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually so dark and opaque that it might be tough to get a good smoky eye with. But it&#x27;s also great for lining the eyes if you like to use powder for that!</li>
    <li> goes on very smooth. A staple for the smokey eye look. However, I&#x27;m not a big fan of eyeshadow, so I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it is nice enough that I ordered other colors</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is an &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; to MAC Carbon. It&#x27;s a nice matte black with a buttery texture. Would recommend this shadow a 100 times over. A matte black is a staple to your makeup kit.</li>
    <li> The product itself may not be bad, but because it was packaged so poorly, I have not used it yet. It was shipped with two other things and there was black eyeshadow all over these items and everywhere inside the box. I was very disappointed with the way this was shipped. The seal on the container looked like it had already been opened and it was not compacted in the container at all. When I did finally open it all the way, it went everywhere.</li>
    <li> The blackest black. Even more than MAC&#x27;s Carbon. A little goes a long way. Other NYX eyeshadows should be this pigmented.</li>
    <li> Deep, rich matte black color, just as good if not better than MAC &amp;#34;Carbon&amp;#34;. The clear plastic on the lid is not attached on mine for some reason, can&#x27;t figure out how to get it to stay without gluing it, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that. But I bought it for the color not the package so I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for anyone who loves black matte eyeshadow it is super dark pigmented just just tap off your brush before applying and you should have minimal fall out great size also I would purchase this 100 times over ...pretty much you can&#x27;t go wrong with NYX products they are a dream👍👍👍😍</li>
    <li> Great shadow at a very good price.  No animal testing, goes on smooth, and stays put.  I use it as a liner and it works as well as more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> this was a bog let down for all the nyx eyeshadows. the colors are dull and sot only that but it does not give you a lot of product in the pot save your money and buy another eye shadow i would not pay 5 dollars for this product.</li>
    <li> This is the blackest eyeshadow I&#x27;ve found as of yet. You don&#x27;t even need primer to appreciate its intense pigment (although I would recommend you use primer to extend the staying power of it if you tend to have oily lids). If you are familiar with MAC&#x27;s Carbon...believe the words of other reviewers as well as mine, this one IS darker. The only drawback of this shadow is that it is VERY fragile...the powder will break up easily. But, for a shadow as dark as this...I can easily forgive the cheap texture. Its a keeper!</li>
    <li> very opaque matte black. dependable and does not budge. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, MATTE, not sparkly or shimmery, black eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and have heard this compared to MAC&#x27;s Carbon in quite a few make up tutorial videos so I grabbed it when it came back in stock. I have 2 other NYX single eyeshadows that I love so I didn&#x27;t expect a bust from this one and it&#x27;s definitely not.&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly for darkening existing eyeliner lines and it works like a charm. It&#x27;s blends perfectly with my eyeliner, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t flake, lasts for such a long time considering the low price and a little goes a long way since it&#x27;s so pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying MAC, consider this one first, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations and was in stock, shipped when needed! As usual the product met all expectations and there was nothing wrong with it</li>
    <li> I use it as the brow powder, and it works just as what I want. I love the color very much.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be only l black shadow in the order, and instead there were 4!  The shadow applies easily, looks and wears great.</li>
    <li> I have the coastal scents 88 shimmer palette and the black in that palette is what I would use for smokey eyes. It was of course shimmery and it would overpower any other color I used. I&#x27;m almost out of it so I decided to try this. I am so glad I got this because my smokey eye turned out really nice! This is really pigmented. I&#x27;ve heard that this is a dupe for MAC&#x27;s Carbon eyeshadow so that&#x27;s a plus. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner for 50 years and just recently decided to try this product after reading reviews here on Amazon. I am so pleased that I did! I&#x27;d never have considered using a powder as I assumed it would be messy, flakey, drift onto my lower eyelid, etc. Quite the contrary, it goes on easily with a good brush and stays put better than my old faithful crayon stick liner. It&#x27;s so nice to discover a product that&#x27;s an improvement and helps the day start off a little easier!</li>
    <li> Blacker than black, good for lining your eyes.</li>
    <li> I found black shadow across the street, but it was Maybelline or Cover Girl - companies that test on animals. This was comparably priced. It came today, very well packaged and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
