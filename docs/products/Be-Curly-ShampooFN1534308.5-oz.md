      <li>Best shampoo for curly hair</li>
      <li>I use Be Curly Shampoo and Conditioner as part of my \\&quot;perfect hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the conditioner, because I just can&#x27;t afford it, but I splurge on the Be Curly Curl Control which works wonderfully on holding the curls and keeping away frizz.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and works.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, my best friend who has wavy hair loved the definition it gave her waves.</li>

      <li>Why do all good brand name shampoos have to be costly</li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing and smells so good.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>In the months leading up to my wedding, I was on a quest to find the perfect shampoo and conditioner combination to ensure I had beautiful, frizzless hair on my big day.  </li>
      <li>I normally use protein shampoo which does an excellent job of eliminating frizz.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and recommend to try.</li>
      <li>I love Aveda</li>
      <li>My curls love it.  </li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
      <li>it is ok?</li>
      <li>I love them all.</li>
      <li>Use this all the time and love it.</li>
      <li>I have very curly to frizzy hair, and have found the Aveda products to be great for my hair.</li>
      <li>also discovered and love their eye cream.</li>
      <li>and if you don&#x27;t overdo it (you won&#x27;t need to because it&#x27;s very rich)</li>
      <li>Natural and great for curly hair.</li>
      <li>I always bought cheap products and it works for a while.</li>
      <li>Even after the first wash, I was able to see and feel the results.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair very clean and soft though I have not noticed more curls like some have said.</li>
      <li>Does not enhance my curls and this seller sent me a not quite full bottle.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does not require half a bottle to get a good, wonderful-smelling lather, and leaves my hair fresh and smooth, even before conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves a little residue over time, but it works great for curls.</li>
      <li>Results for me was softer hair and with my natural curly hair more tighter curls and just looks like I came from the beauty shop every time.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s worth being a luxury.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Always looking for the perfect shampoo that will clean my thick, wavy hair and scalp but not dry (color treated) or make my hair frizzy or unmanageable.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on hair.</li>
      <li>Even on some humid east coast days my hair held up pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I have 3c wavy hair and thought I would try this to see if I could get the most curl out of my hair as possible.</li>
      <li>My curls bounce again and they are right now super soft.</li>
      <li>Aveda&#x27;s natural products can sometimes be less than stellar (strangely, I did not like the companion conditioner as much but have no issue with mixing and matching products), but when they hit it right, they are perfect --I</li>
      <li>but it is well worth the money and is used in high in beauty shops.</li>
      <li>I never used much of the shampoo</li>
      <li>This series of products really help turn the frizz to ringlets.</li>
      <li>On a side note, I also have very oily hair and need use a separate shampoo to combat that</li>
      <li>I find it very drying, and I don&#x27;t feel it cleans my scalp well.  </li>
      <li>If it dries out too much, it&#x27;s frizz</li>
      <li>I have been fighting my curly/frizzy hair my whole life.  </li>
      <li>are not so much curly wavy</li>
      <li>I switched to Aveda Be Curly Shampoo, Conditioner and Moroccon Oil Intense Curling Cream.  </li>
      <li>Really birngs out the curls.  </li>
      <li>I like how it makes my curls do better and less frizz.  </li>
      <li>but now that I&#x27;m older the curl and waves</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo, just wish it wasnot so expensive.  </li>
      <li>Worth the extra money!</li>
      <li>This shampoo helps my curls hold their shape even months after getting a new perm.</li>
      <li>it definitely makes your curls tighter, but a little to much for my liking; it also made my hair feel kind of dry.</li>
      <li>A great shampoo for keeping that expensive perm lasting longer.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft, shiny and NOT FRIZZY.  </li>
      <li>My curls are soft, yet defined.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the old Pantene curl enhancing shampoo and it just doesn&#x27;t hold the curls as well.</li>
      <li>Only use small amounts cause lather is more.</li>
      <li>But after growing so long and the new country (dry air, other water quality etc.), my hair needs much more attention.</li>
      <li>I recently decided to stop flat ironing it straight and embrace the curl.  </li>
      <li>so I wound up giving it away to someone from my church that has very thick, but very soft and fine curly hair</li>
      <li>I will go back to my Paul Mitchell Awahpui with Wild Ginger.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much - the key to curly hair with no frizz is to have a little extra product in your hair to keep it oily.  </li>

    <li> A great shampoo for keeping that expensive perm lasting longer.</li>
    <li> I choose to perm my hair into loose curls and my hair stylist (who owns an Aveda concept salon) recommended the Aveda Be Curly line. I do, too!!  This shampoo helps my curls hold their shape even months after getting a new perm. I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent. I&#x27;ve used the old Pantene curl enhancing shampoo and it just doesn&#x27;t hold the curls as well. I don&#x27;t use the conditioner, because I just can&#x27;t afford it, but I splurge on the Be Curly Curl Control which works wonderfully on holding the curls and keeping away frizz. If you want to define your curls/waves without the frizz, this is the shampoo for you!  On a side note, I also have very oily hair and need use a separate shampoo to combat that (I wash once with the clarifying shampoo and once with the Be Curly).</li>
    <li> It leaves a little residue over time, but it works great for curls. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like regular shampoo.</li>

    <li> Use this all the time and love it.</li>
    <li> In the months leading up to my wedding, I was on a quest to find the perfect shampoo and conditioner combination to ensure I had beautiful, frizzless hair on my big day.  Aveda got me there!  The shampoo itself is a little smelly, and I combine it with Paul Labrecque Curly Condition Milky Cream Conditioner which hides the smell.  Don&#x27;t use too much - the key to curly hair with no frizz is to have a little extra product in your hair to keep it oily.  If it dries out too much, it&#x27;s frizz galore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo delivered and kept my frizz at bay while making my hair shine in the sun.  Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love Aveda Be Curly Hairspray and Aveda Be Curly Curl Cream and have used them for years.  I was excited to try this shampoo and am very disappointed.  I find it very drying, and I don&#x27;t feel it cleans my scalp well.  I gave it two stars because it does leave my hair shiny.  I will go back to my Paul Mitchell Awahpui with Wild Ginger.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo. It is great for curly hair. Something about the packaging told me it came from overseas. It looked like it had to go through customs. I think I will buy the shampoo locally from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, just wish it wasnot so expensive.  I like how it makes my curls do better and less frizz.  Why do all good brand name shampoos have to be costly</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing and smells so good. Its alittle pricey but it is well worth the money and is used in high in beauty shops. Results for me was softer hair and with my natural curly hair more tighter curls and just looks like I came from the beauty shop every time. I love this shampoo and recommend to try. Only use small amounts cause lather is more.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me along with the conditioner and Curl enhancer.  I love them all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Wen, and just about all other products and none work as well as this one. It makes the curls stand out. Worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> my faborite shampoo, with a vage smell of lemon, will buy again and again</li>
    <li> my lady loves the shompoo</li>
    <li> doesnt truly leave my hair curly?&lt;br /&gt;but it is ok?</li>
    <li> I use Be Curly Shampoo and Conditioner as part of my \\&quot;perfect hair day\\&quot; routine. They are  expensive, but they are a guaranteed way to make my curls look fabulous.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Natural and great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos for curley hair, which did not give me the results I expected. However, this shampoo is great.  I leaves your hair feeling and looking great.  Really birngs out the curls.  Expensive, but guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

I use it everyday on my above shoulder curly hair without it over drying or leaving residue behind. It is expensive but for now it&#x27;s worth the price for difficult to please curls.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has turned to frizz. This series of products really help turn the frizz to ringlets. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Does not enhance my curls and this seller sent me a not quite full bottle. Avoid the shampoo and the seller.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works.  Very gentle on hair.</li>
    <li> Like this shampoo a lot</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair without being abrasive.  My curls love it.  If cost wasn&#x27;t a factor, I&#x27;d use this all the time!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and so I have no idea what I was thinking when I bought this shampoo-- it definitely makes your curls tighter, but a little to much for my liking; it also made my hair feel kind of dry. HOWEVER, my best friend who has wavy hair loved the definition it gave her waves. I never used much of the shampoo so I wound up giving it away to someone from my church that has very thick, but very soft and fine curly hair and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for curly hair</li>
    <li> This is in my opinion the best shampoo for curly hair.  It leaves hair soft, shiny and NOT FRIZZY.  Also smells great.</li>
    <li> (and the price here on Amazon is the best.)  I&#x27;ve been using Be Curly for a few years - I have always had curly/wavy hair but now that I&#x27;m older the curl and waves are not so much curly wavy - they&#x27;ve become rather lackluster and half hearted.  This shampoo (and the conditioner as well) help immensely. It&#x27;s pricey but not off the charts and if you don&#x27;t overdo it (you won&#x27;t need to because it&#x27;s very rich), it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemony fragrance is sublime, btw.  It&#x27;s a luxury that&#x27;s worth being a luxury.</li>
    <li> I have 3c wavy hair and thought I would try this to see if I could get the most curl out of my hair as possible. I normally use protein shampoo which does an excellent job of eliminating frizz. This shampoo did not control the frizz enough. I had to compensate by using extra spray that combats frizz while rejuvenating curl. On a side note, I was not a fan of the scent. I will not be using this again.</li>
