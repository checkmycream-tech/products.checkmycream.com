<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wanted to finally try this product, as I have not used a vitamin C serum before, and my skin really needed it. I live at higher elevation and the sun is intense. I have used this product as directed, without missing a day. I can say that my skin feels smoother over all and has a more even tone to it. I just ordered the toner and am looking forward to seeing how the combination steps up the already seen improvements.</li>
    <li> The vitamin serum of this company has given me the chance to be alright. The especial ingredients of this vitamin C syrum 20z pump action bottle have made it exceptional. I recommend this product for ever also your price is unique.</li>
    <li> I like this product, this product is very good,  It is the one product that I have been using off and on the last couple of months and have really seen and felt results on my Skin. you price is very good, watch your pocket and your body.</li>
    <li> I really like this particular formulation. I went looking for the best quality and I have to say I am very pleased with my product. My skin problems have been reduced to the furthest extent possible, and the large size and the concentration of serum vitamin C of this brand has lasted me a long time. Vitamin C is essential for skin care, in my case, and I would definitely recommend this brand to others who have similar problems. love the way my skin texture is smooth and refining. I use this daily and love the result. It was what I needed</li>
    <li> Probably works great but it is very sticky and stays tacky for a while.</li>
    <li> Fast result. Fast application. All is good with thase vitamin c . One the my best buoyed. Is good product with the you gonna see the result in short weekends... the price is good too for the product.. I recommend for all that need an good vitamin c.</li>
    <li> This product def. tightens skin &amp; make your skin look more clear.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum, is the best one that i&#x27;ve tried, the way is applied on the skin is very good, actually is very stickier which makes it better to use it. You can watch as the depths of lines around the mouth and cheeks immediately start reducing. It minimize and almost disappear the sun marks and the skin decoloration. Excellent for thin and sensitive skin. Use without burning or stinging sensations. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough for full effects, but feel as though it is working nicely.</li>
    <li> So far I have used one full bottle and I&#x27;m currently on my second one.  I feel it is making my forehead lines blend in more and are a lot less noticeable than before I started using the Vitamin C Serum. I noticed the lines between my eyebrows are not as noticeable as they were when I first started using this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the lines around my mouth yet, but will continue to use as these are just deeper and may require more time.  I use one pump of the serum every morning on my face and neck/chest area. I can feel a light tightening of my skin as it dries and it gives my skin a nice natural glow. I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product; I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom as she said she was getting wrinkles on her face she said she was going to get Beutox I told her to save some money and I bought this for her and so far it&#x27;s worked great we have noticed changes withing a few weeks just as expected as I was sketchy about this but not anymore works great</li>
    <li> I love the product.  The only thing is that both bottles i couldnt get open without air hitting the vitamin c serum.  That is the reason i orderd the pump bottle because the eye dropper bottle lets air and light hit it and after a few times is not stabalized and not effective. My husband had to pull the cap off and take a pliers to get the thing that pumps the serum out of the cap.  I think everything is ok because the air only hit it for a minute or so.</li>
    <li> This is a great Vitamin C product for your face.  The best I have found on line.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product, for some time had been suffering from dry skin due to the large exposure of my skin to the sun, in a short time the results have been very favorable, I&#x27;ve noticed the change that has given vitamin C my skin. I think I will use this product for a long time</li>
    <li> This is my first vitamin c serum. I mix this with my retinal and moisturizer day and night. It has helped improve skin tone and has definitely brightened my skins appearance.</li>
    <li> When i opened the package, the box it was in was falling apart. Then when i took the product out of the box, it had orange residue on the outside. Didn&#x27;t make me feel like I was getting a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has a very light citrus smell. It is perfectly clear. The serum is the consistency of oil - thin but not runny. It feels great on my face and delicate skin. Hyaluronic has been shown to reduce visible wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders for shaving rash around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottle. The pump delivers a small dot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I like the way it makes my skin feel nice, moist and soft. It does help the laugh lines not be as noticeable. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> Quality product. My skin feels smooth after using it, I will continue to use this daily in my skin routine.  </li>
    <li> Great gift for my mom!!</li>
    <li> i really like this product. i had another vitamin c, but prefer this one. it moisturize and leaves you with a nice glow</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a bit of difference.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have two months consuming these vitamins c, and since then I have not had flu or colds over. I used to live ill, with constant sneezing but since taking these vitamins that is past.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best vitamins I&#x27;ve had, my skin feels better than ever and has taken away many of the imperfections he had. works great and works fast and you will feel younger than ever.</li>
    <li> I received this item on time.  I can see some improvement in my skin, but will continue to use it for more results.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is very good, has many benefits and product achieves amazing results when applying it feels so soft and pure, and gradually your skin is changing notes that looks younger, more bright, firmer, less wrinkles, better hydrated, I&#x27;m very happy i want to buy a new bottle will wait to make it available again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, although not very sturdy, is practical and protects the product from light and oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C, hyaluronic, ferulic, and lactic acid are awesome ingredients that will do wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;25% Vitamin C is perhaps the highest concentration you will find out there, and this ingredient is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Has a sticky gel texture that sits on the skin for a while. I use it at night so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;The gel texture makes it easy to apply and cover the entire face, which is not always practical with thinner fluids.&lt;br /&gt;Your face won&#x27;t change overnight, don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this a one star except that its the lowest rating.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great serum, my face always feels v moisturized and nourished after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> to spend time in our face are deformed those fine lines that make us unique . with Vitamin C Serum helps you get those fine lines so it will soften skin leaving you a feeling of freshness.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C adds glow to the skin and makes you looks great, I tried many products with vitam C to make my skin looks great iy literally glows and it feel healty, This is a great alternative if you want a good healthy skin that looks great is easy to apply and is considerably cheap</li>
    <li> I like this product. Not sure if it has had a huge impact but I reallly like the gentleness of it. I can even use it around my eyes and mouth with no problem. It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use. I feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my dark spots! I had some nasty dark spots on my skin before and it made me lose my confidence within myself so I turned to online to look for a solution and found this treatment. I&#x27;ve used it for around 2 weeks and I have seen results, it has nearly taken away all my dark spots! I love it and would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
