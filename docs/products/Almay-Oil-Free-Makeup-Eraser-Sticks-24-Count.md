      <li>I thought the concept of these was brilliant especially for travel.  </li>
      <li>Great for busy people who need to do a quick make over!  </li>
      <li>These certainly come in handy.</li>
      <li>it is when you get your eye makeup just perfect, but then your mascara rubs on your eye lids or there&#x27;s a little smudge of eye liner or mascara you want to get rid of.</li>
      <li>and these give you the perfect moist tip for getting the little details</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to follow directions.</li>
      <li>They work effectively and gently, they pack well</li>
      <li>These are simply perfect for that runny eyeliner or mascara or misplaced eyeshadow or anything else that requires a clean, precise swipe.</li>

      <li>They are nice for removing excess mascara and eyeliner, but other than that, they are okay.</li>
      <li>These are great for dance recital time, especially when the younger girls decide to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; their make-up without any help or a mirror.  :-)</li>
      <li>I love these handy little eraser sticks to clean up under eye-makeup debris during the day.  </li>
      <li>These are great for little mascara smears</li>
      <li>They are useful and work well.</li>
      <li>Maybe if they made it more like a light stick when you snap it in the middle, then you can use both swabs.</li>
      <li>They pack in my purse ready to clean up the unavoidable smudges in my eyeliner in the afternoon.</li>
      <li>but this is my first experience with the oil-free version.</li>
      <li>exactly what i was expecting, thanks!</li>
      <li>Love that I can buy these from Amazon as they aren&#x27;t always in local stores.</li>
      <li>the cost is too much when applying from home, considering its basically a q tip that can be dipped in some remover - even water - but fantastic for mistakes either professionally or on the go</li>
      <li>These are fabulous for quick touch ups, especially at the end of the workday when the mascara has smeared from too much face-palming.</li>
      <li>These are absolutely a &amp;</li>
      <li>I like this product, but found I was not using it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really like having to break the end off.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really mind because I don&#x27;t need these often</li>
      <li>If this isn&#x27;t done, it&#x27;s no more effective than a q-tip would be.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get that many in a box and only one end is usable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>These little sticks are a must have for those of us who love to wear eye make up</li>
      <li>#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; item in my makeup bag.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the first product that actually corrects those \\&quot;oooop&#x27;s\\&quot; we tend to make applying mascara!!!</li>
      <li>Non messy makeup touch ups made easy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes &amp; there&#x27;s no messy lotion or anything on your hands after.</li>
      <li>I like these little sticks very much!</li>
      <li>These work really well for minor make-up mistakes, especially smudged mascara.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t have any of the chronic over-breaking issues that I&#x27;d heard about with them - I&#x27;ve had only one of the tips break completely off</li>
      <li>I love this idea... and the solution does seem to work well, but the design is poor.  </li>
      <li>These really remove my stubborn bottom eyeliner, and I don&#x27;t have to purchase any other type of makeup remover.</li>
      <li>The only draw back is that you can&#x27;t really use the other side once you snap it</li>
      <li>Instead of having to try to rub it off with a q-tip &amp; probably mess up your whole look, you just use the tip of the eraser stick &amp;</li>

<li> Now I can fix it without messing up any of my other makeup!</li>
<li> These little sticks look just like q-tips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are absolutely a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; item in my makeup bag.  Why did you stop making these, Almay??  Good luck finding them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find anything this revolutionary for those annoying times when mascara gets where it shouldn&#x27;t.  With the unique design, they are perfect for travel and last a long time - I don&#x27;t have to use them often.  These are something you need to have in your makeup arsenal.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the first product that actually corrects those \\&quot;oooop&#x27;s\\&quot; we tend to make applying mascara!!! leaves no residue of any kind either. will purchase again without a doubt. love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are so awesome and convenient. I keep them everywhere. In my purse, in my car, in my travel bag. They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> exactly what i was expecting, thanks!</li>
    <li> Im not big on makeup but i do like to do my eyeshadow and these give you the perfect moist tip for getting the little details so ur eyeshadow is perfect.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t competely remove the eyemake up for me not even just for spot correcting.  It just smeared it around a bit so you get that \\&quot;walk of shame\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> Best solution for quick &amp; easy clean up of makeup mess-ups while putting on your face. :) I hate throwing them away, tho&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Love that I can buy these from Amazon as they aren&#x27;t always in local stores. They are useful and work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m physically incapable of putting on mascara without getting it on my eyelids... Now I can fix it without messing up any of my other makeup!</li>
    <li> These are simply perfect for that runny eyeliner or mascara or misplaced eyeshadow or anything else that requires a clean, precise swipe. One light touch and the pesky makeup is gone! These certainly come in handy. The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get that many in a box and only one end is usable. But I don&#x27;t really mind because I don&#x27;t need these often but when I do - SCORE!</li>
    <li> These little sticks look just like q-tips. I carry some extras around in my purse in case my eye makeup starts to get smudgy or smears under my eyes during the day, works as a quick fix. Also good to have on hand while putting on your eye makeup, one quick swipe and the mistake is erased. There&#x27;s no pulling on the delicate eye tissue area, and it&#x27;s not oily at all. I like these little sticks very much!</li>
    <li> This is not my usual eye makeup remover and it is unlikely to completely replace it, however I do travel quite a bit and I try to avoid packing liquids as much as possible so I thought I would give this a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. They work effectively and gently, they pack well both in a suitcase and in a purse/carry-on. I haven&#x27;t have any of the chronic over-breaking issues that I&#x27;d heard about with them - I&#x27;ve had only one of the tips break completely off but it was still usable. I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use them.</li>
    <li> These are just okay. Not really easy to use. I would prefer something more in  a pen form. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I bought it; however, this time I only received one pack instead of two! It&#x27;s still a good product nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Perfect for spot cleaning smeared mascara, eye liner, etc. I have these on automatic delivery. The plastic container keeps them clean and enclosed and perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> There seems to be a few in each package (I&#x27;m on my 5th) that the tip won&#x27;t break off, it just bends &amp; doesn&#x27;t release the liquid. Otherwise they are great for removing eye makeup/mascara goofs.</li>
    <li> Great for that pesky under eye mascara that won&#x27;t come off or errors putting on make up.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> the cost is too much when applying from home, considering its basically a q tip that can be dipped in some remover - even water - but fantastic for mistakes either professionally or on the go</li>
    <li> Throw these sticks in your makeup bag, gym bag, and your going out bag and you will always look great. Non messy makeup touch ups made easy. Love them so much I bought for girlfriends this time.</li>
    <li> Favorite eye makeup remover. Perfect for sensitive skin, and works great without messing up the makeup you just put on</li>
    <li> Love these things. Provide them to patients with &#x27;table-face&#x27; in chiropractic office and massage room.</li>
    <li> Great for busy people who need to do a quick make over!  Will continue to purchase them for my use and to recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> I love that these are so convenient and easy to use!  They pack in my purse ready to clean up the unavoidable smudges in my eyeliner in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling!  I used to put make up remover in a ziplock bag with cotton pads, but this has made my toiletries bag so much more organized!</li>
    <li> These are okay. They do the job but after all the hype I was expecting more. When you bend the top part to release the liquid, sometimes it works great, and other times the liquid stays put or it breaks; even if I bend it very gently. They are nice for removing excess mascara and eyeliner, but other than that, they are okay.</li>
    <li> It is a great product - wish it was still in the stores and didn&#x27;t have to order it online all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome!! They&#x27;re just like q-tips, but way easier since you don&#x27;t have to put anything else on the q-tip to take your makeup off. All you do is snap one end, and the eye-makeup remover slides to the other end to moisten it. Then you simply rub the moist end on your eyes and your makeup comes off instantly! It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes &amp; there&#x27;s no messy lotion or anything on your hands after. You can also use it for eye makeup touchups. We all know what a pain in the ass it is when you get your eye makeup just perfect, but then your mascara rubs on your eye lids or there&#x27;s a little smudge of eye liner or mascara you want to get rid of. Instead of having to try to rub it off with a q-tip &amp; probably mess up your whole look, you just use the tip of the eraser stick &amp; any imperfections come right off, leaving the rest of your makeup perfect &amp; untouched. I cannot recommend this product enough!!!</li>
    <li> These work really well for minor make-up mistakes, especially smudged mascara. It&#x27;s important to follow directions. The tip with the line must be snapped to release the remover into the other tip. If this isn&#x27;t done, it&#x27;s no more effective than a q-tip would be.</li>
    <li> Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> use everyday…takes off only makeup area you want</li>
    <li> no matter what I do, there&#x27;s always mascara left after i wake up in the morning. These do the trick - although i do wish they were a little bigger! I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I thought the concept of these was brilliant especially for travel.  However,  the tips usually break off when you pop it.  When the tip does pop properly, the make up remover doesn&#x27;t flow.  Very disappointed.  It&#x27;s easier to just dip a q-tip in make up remover</li>
    <li> I love these handy little eraser sticks to clean up under eye-makeup debris during the day.  It just takes a little break at the end of the stick, the solution comes down to the other end, a few quick wipes and done. I&#x27;m on my 4th box.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I buy these things all the time and I love them! They are a great way to remove eye make up, so convenient, and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> These DO work but I don&#x27;t really like having to break the end off.  You get one use and there are only 24 in the pack.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.  Maybe they are good just for travel...</li>
    <li> I like this product, but found I was not using it as much as I thought I would.  might purchase agin in the future.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something else...sw this and decided to try. Glad I did. Works very well. Well with the cost.</li>
    <li> These are great for dance recital time, especially when the younger girls decide to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; their make-up without any help or a mirror.  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years but this is my first experience with the oil-free version. The best!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for cleaning up an uneven lip line or a little eye shadow  that&#x27;s fallen.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly - just as advertised.  You can take a few out of the pack and tuck in your purse for an evening out.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! They are not greasy and take off the leftover makeup from under your eyes with ease.</li>
    <li> I love this idea... and the solution does seem to work well, but the design is poor.  If you snap the end just a bit too much, the end falls off and makes stick useless.  If they make cotton portion of the stick further down, it may solve the issue.  I will not buy this product again, unless I see that they fix the issue.</li>
    <li> These are great for little mascara smears</li>
    <li> These are so great when you just need to tidy up, but don&#x27;t want to start all over. The only draw back is that you can&#x27;t really use the other side once you snap it, it kind of just breaks off. Maybe if they made it more like a light stick when you snap it in the middle, then you can use both swabs.</li>
    <li> I use these to remove my bottom eyeliner at night.  Then I wash my entire face with regular cleanser.  I don&#x27;t need makeup remover because everything else comes off with cleanser and water.  These really remove my stubborn bottom eyeliner, and I don&#x27;t have to purchase any other type of makeup remover.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous for quick touch ups, especially at the end of the workday when the mascara has smeared from too much face-palming. No more looking like a raccoon.</li>
    <li> These little sticks are a must have for those of us who love to wear eye make up but hate when it smudges. With one swipe of this little q tip like swab I can erase any signs of  of smudging. Raccoons are cute but I don&#x27;t want to look like one.</li>
