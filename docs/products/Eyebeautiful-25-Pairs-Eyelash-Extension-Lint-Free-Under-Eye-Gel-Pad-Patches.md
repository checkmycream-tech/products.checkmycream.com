    <li> I use these eye pads on a professional level for my eyelash extension clients.  They are very nice, lint-free, and feel cooling to my clients skin - however, they tend to slide a little during the application process, so I often have to add a little medical tape to keep them in place.  But overall, they are a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 months now and I love it.  My clients say they are comfortable and i like how they stay in place.  They are easy to remove without hurting my clients.  I am a return customer.</li>
    <li> Good patches! Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Pads stick well but outer surface is hard and slippery.  Makes it hard to lash when my tool is slipping.  May be good for others with different technique but I prefer a pad with a softer gel-like surface.</li>
    <li> These are the best product I&#x27;ve found. The price is good too. I will be ordering again for sure. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are my favorite undereye pads for my clients during eyelash extension services.  They are a great shape for almost every eye, they don&#x27;t move around, and the gel doesn&#x27;t ooze out of them.  It&#x27;s the best deal on 25 pairs I have found.  I have ordered them 3 times, and each time the packaging has been different which makes me nervous that they are going to change the eye pads.  They are perfect, don&#x27;t change them at all!</li>
    <li> these work just fine. they come in plain grey packages. if using for lash extensions you need to tape them down so they don&#x27;t slide into the eyes. creates a canvas so lashes are easily seen making application of extensions easier thus saving time so worth the buck apiece.</li>
    <li> My clients love these eyepads. They are phenomenal. They feel great and are lint free.  Great for lash extension application.  I will use these for now on unless I find a better one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting on eyelash extensions! Cool and soothing. Go on and off easily, and create the best white background for hard to see lashes!</li>
    <li> I didnt have good luck with these, /they dont stay down very well in the inner eye area. Kinda bulky.</li>
    <li> These really help hold down the lower lashes while applying your lash extensions. They are cooling and comfortable for your client.</li>
    <li> I love how these didn&#x27;t stick to my skin and the delicate skin under my eyes actually felt moisturized and better after I used them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, perfect for eyes extension lashes:), loved, thanks</li>
    <li> Very good product for a good price</li>
    <li> They do not stay in place even when using medical tape. They were sliding up within seconds of application.  I do not recommend these pads. Seller agreed to take them back however it would cost almost as much to send them back to China than the refund itself.</li>
    <li> This product has been wonderful for most of my clients with the occasional fiber catching with the adhesive when I&#x27;m doing lash extensions, however, I recently had a client who experienced extreme pain, swelling, &amp;#34;sick looking&amp;#34; eyes that lasted a week after. We initially thought it was the adhesive but after yesterday we determined it was the gel patches because she immediately experienced the pain and I had not begun using the adhesive. We wiped the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; off her lower eye and used medical tape and she was fine. Very scary... even her eyeball was red at the bottom where the gel patch was closest to her eye. Overall, no problems but some people may be allergic... I am looking into the full ingredient list so I can get a better idea of what she may be sensitive to. Hope this helps us lashers to keep our clients safe, happy and coming back!!!</li>
    <li> I like them with my customers!</li>
    <li> The backing would not peel off well.  A lot of the get was stuck to the backing, like they were old or had been exposed to heat.</li>
    <li> I really liked the eye patch. It has a very good hold and it doesn&#x27;t move when I fix eyelash extensions.</li>
