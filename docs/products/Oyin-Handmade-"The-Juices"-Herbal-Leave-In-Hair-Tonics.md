      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

      <li>This smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I put the spray in my own heavier duty bottle and that even clogged eventually.</li>
      <li>so I know that I am good for about 2 more months.</li>
      <li>I honestly could not believe how good this stuff smells and most importantly, it works AMAZINGLY WELL.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this and although it is probably a great product for people with thinner hair, it didn&#x27;t really moisturize mine.</li>
      <li>If it works this well on my lovely kinks, I can just imagine how well it works on looser curl patterns.</li>
      <li>I love you guys</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made my hair incredibly moisturized, soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I love the Oyin Juices &amp; Berry.</li>
      <li>But I will soon be placing an order for some more :-)</li>
      <li>This leave-in hair tonic is full of nourishing properties for my hair, and keeps it smelling juicy too!</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly special about this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like my hair requires a fine line of moisture.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair really soft, love the smell!</li>
      <li>Keeps hair moisturized for a full day</li>
      <li>the smell is a bit sweet for some</li>
      <li>I love the scent it makes my hair smell awesome, its a bit strong at first but then died down later on</li>
      <li>I used to use the Carols daughter Black Vanilla leave in which smells great but doesnt moisturize my 4C hair as it needs.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out (and by the size of the bottle, that won&#x27;t be for a while!)</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of moisture needed on my hair.</li>
      <li>but im sooo making another order right away.</li>
      <li>This stuff right here, BUY IT.</li>
      <li>The reviews are COMPLETELY right.</li>
      <li>I first mist my hair with either water/glycerien or with Hydratherma Mist, depending on the day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest rinsing your spray bottle under hot water routinely.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product off and on for many years, and love how it moisturizers and refreshes limp end-of-day, second-day, or even third-day curls!</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my spritz</li>
      <li>I ordered it with high hopes and i was NOT dissapointed!!</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>but please go back to the original scent oyin!</li>
      <li>i tend to need much thicker products for that.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a light tonic that I can use daily to refresh my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Not quite what I expected, I have fine hair and the juice and berries</li>
      <li>It has an okay smell but just a little too &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; for me.</li>
      <li>and I now that I have braids, it really helps keep my natural hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily use it as a leave-in (I prefer something creamy for that purpose), but some may find that it works just fine.</li>
      <li>To be honest, water with a little glycerine would probably work just as well, but I couldn&#x27;t get enough of the scent!</li>
      <li>When I actually tried it for the first time, my hair felt refreshed (if that makes sense).</li>
      <li>I really like this product for my hair type which is heavily wavy and dry on top.</li>
      <li>As far as the scent?</li>
      <li>It makes my hair SOFT.</li>
      <li>However, they have changed the scent and now instead of being refreshingly, irresistibly fruity, it is too sweet and almost nauseating, like artificially flavored candy.</li>
      <li>I have had a dry scalp for until I can remember, and this really helps eliminate my dandruff.</li>
      <li>It makes my natural Afro soft instantly.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at a local retailer and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how moisturizing this product is!</li>
      <li>Its the easiest way to replenish moisture to dry hair without having to do too much work throughout the week especially when in a protective style and it works well to detangle my kinky type hair as well.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for this product as much as other that I have tried it will do in a pinch.</li>
      <li>Im not sure il necessarily use it as a leave in right after washing my hair</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair, either good or bad.  </li>

<li> I saw this as was thinking &amp;#34;omg please don&#x27;t disappoint me&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, dry, none of that.</li>
<li> I used this as a refresher during styles, and when I take down my 2 strand twist.</li>
<li> Have you smelled Jamaican Black Castor Oil?</li>
<li> It is not sticky, even for the heavy handed user like me!  </li>
<li> This is seriously the softest my hair has ever been.</li>
<li> Having paid $20 (including shopping) to get my newest bottle and receiving a newly scented bottle of juices and berries that I can&#x27;t use without feeling sick, I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
<li> My hair sucks in moisture like crazy and it did for this product.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> I used this as a refresher during styles, and when I take down my 2 strand twist. It&#x27;s amazing. I use to use the carols daughter black vanilla leave in spritz but that actually dries out my hair. I saw this as was thinking &amp;#34;omg please don&#x27;t disappoint me&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, dry, none of that. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product...it&#x27;s a keeper!  Number one leave in and smell great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair, either good or bad.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly special about this product. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use Oyin Handmade Juices as the liquid part of my &amp;#34;LOC&amp;#34;.  I first mist my hair with either water/glycerien or with Hydratherma Mist, depending on the day and then I spray the Oyin Juices and apply coconut oil and then the cream and do my twist.  It stretches my twist on my 4c hair.  Just misting with water tends to shrink my hair.  Smells great and not oily.</li>
    <li> smells great and I now that I have braids, it really helps keep my natural hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and although it is probably a great product for people with thinner hair, it didn&#x27;t really moisturize mine. My hair sucks in moisture like crazy and it did for this product. It has an okay smell but just a little too &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; for me. I&#x27;m sticking to my homemade spritzer for my hair.</li>
    <li> This products is just what I was looking for it&#x27;s a light tonic that I can use daily to refresh my natural hair. I use it at night before bed and in the morning before I head off to work.  It is not sticky, even for the heavy handed user like me!  the smell is a bit sweet for some but I have no problem with it.  I will be odering agian!!</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this leave-in. I ordered it with high hopes and i was NOT dissapointed!! It smells amazing and feels soo god. Just the right amount of moisture needed on my hair. I used to use the Carols daughter Black Vanilla leave in which smells great but doesnt moisturize my 4C hair as it needs. Im not sure il necessarily use it as a leave in right after washing my hair cos i tend to need much thicker products for that. Its great as a refresher and to spray on protective styles and braids. Iv only used this for 3weeks but im sooo making another order right away. *Cant be without it*.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local retailer and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how moisturizing this product is! I used this in conjunction with a Shea Moisture product and boy, let me tell you! I got soooooo many compliments on how moisturized my hair looked! Usually my hair is dry with only using the Shea Moisture product, but this product kicked up the moisturizing levels several notches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make this product a staple in my arsenal of hair products.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Has helped restore the moisture to my hair after getting highlights. I have curly hair and have notice a big difference in my curls- bouncier and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted to try this product because of all the great reviews I saw online and I was drawn to the name...it sounded yummy. When I actually tried it for the first time, my hair felt refreshed (if that makes sense). Its the easiest way to replenish moisture to dry hair without having to do too much work throughout the week especially when in a protective style and it works well to detangle my kinky type hair as well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily use it as a leave-in (I prefer something creamy for that purpose), but some may find that it works just fine. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my spritz and I would order again.</li>
    <li> This spray smell just like its name juices and berries...I love the scent it makes my hair smell awesome, its a bit strong at first but then died down later on also it moisturize my hair perfectly along wit my burnt sugar to seal it in...try it</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair type which is heavily wavy and dry on top. This tames my hair and gives moisture. I have had a dry scalp for until I can remember, and this really helps eliminate my dandruff. I wish there was a tea tree oil one!! ;-)</li>
    <li> Love it. Reminds me of frozen cups and it keeps my type 4b hair moisturized</li>
    <li> Lightweight and refreshing!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I heard a lot about it a few years back and just never tried it. But, I got it at Target a couple weeks ago and my hair has been on point ever since. It&#x27;s made my hair incredibly moisturized, soft and manageable. I have really weird hair and so far nothing has really been the bee knees for me.  Until this product. It&#x27;s like my hair requires a fine line of moisture. The only thing that really sucked is that it seems like the product is too thick for the sprayer it has, it clogs. I put the spray in my own heavier duty bottle and that even clogged eventually. I&#x27;d suggest rinsing your spray bottle under hot water routinely. Surprisingly enough though I don&#x27;t have any heavy stickiness in my hair. This is seriously the softest my hair has ever been. As far as the scent? Compared to some other natural products it shouldn&#x27;t even be a complaint. Have you smelled Jamaican Black Castor Oil? It works fantastically. Customer for life, and I plan to try other products as well.</li>
    <li> Abosultely the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Used it on myself and my daughter&#x27;s hair. It leaves our hair soft and extremely manageable.</li>
    <li> I love the Oyin Juices &amp; Berry. It makes my natural Afro soft instantly. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, I have fine hair and the juice and berries left it a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> The reviews are COMPLETELY right. This smells AMAZING. I honestly could not believe how good this stuff smells and most importantly, it works AMAZINGLY WELL. I&#x27;m floored. I have 4c hair (I say this just for a point of reference) and did a loooottt of research to find the best spray leave in for my hair that fits my regime. This stuff right here, BUY IT. If it works this well on my lovely kinks, I can just imagine how well it works on looser curl patterns. It makes my hair SOFT. When I do wear my hair out, it stays moisturized ALL DAY. ALL. DAY. I&#x27;m so enamoured with this. I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out (and by the size of the bottle, that won&#x27;t be for a while!)</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft, love the smell!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for many years, and love how it moisturizers and refreshes limp end-of-day, second-day, or even third-day curls! To be honest, water with a little glycerine would probably work just as well, but I couldn&#x27;t get enough of the scent! However, they have changed the scent and now instead of being refreshingly, irresistibly fruity, it is too sweet and almost nauseating, like artificially flavored candy. I&#x27;m no longer a fan. Having paid $20 (including shopping) to get my newest bottle and receiving a newly scented bottle of juices and berries that I can&#x27;t use without feeling sick, I&#x27;m highly disappointed. I love you guys but please go back to the original scent oyin!</li>
    <li> I definitely have ZERO COMPLAINTS about this product. I use it about 4 to 5 times a wk, but don&#x27;t over do it so I know that I am good for about 2 more months. But I will soon be placing an order for some more :-)</li>
    <li> This leave-in hair tonic is full of nourishing properties for my hair, and keeps it smelling juicy too! I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this product as much as other that I have tried it will do in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair moisturized for a full day</li>
