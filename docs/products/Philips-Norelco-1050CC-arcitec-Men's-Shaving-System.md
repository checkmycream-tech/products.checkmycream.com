<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing works perfectly.  Have owned Norelco razors in the past but have not had one in about 8 years.  This one is the best yet and the cleaning system is good also.  It shaves just fine, I expect the people that have problems have never used a norelco before.  The trimmer is a little small but works perfectly and it is a TRIMMER not a barber tool.</li>
    <li> My husband got this for Christmas from me - he likes it. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade - he has to shave the next evening following shaving on a morning. You can feel the new beard growing in - not see it at that point. He likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and packaging was very well handled. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, and he likes it very much, so this time I bought two more for him. He said he is going to give them as gifts to his friends.</li>
    <li> Amazon I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the products and serices you offer and this razor was one of them. I can&#x27;t begin to say how great I think this razor is.  This is the best Norleco I have ever owned.  I have been an electric razor shaver for 35 years and this is by far the best I have ever owned.  Oh by the way all of them were Norleco&#x27;s.  Close shave, comfortable.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice razor. I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of people have been comparing this razor to Braun, and I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if people at Braun wrote those negative reviews.     My face was really starting to get irritated from daily shaving with a disposable razor. I thought I&#x27;d switch to this one to see how I liked using an electric.     I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days and I absolutely love it. I will never go back to traditional shaving because this one gets a pretty close shave, is less expensive than disposables, and makes my skin feel and look better.     The automatic cleaning charger is really cool too. Every time I pick it up to shave, it&#x27;s very clean.     I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (even thought it&#x27;s $30 cheaper), I bought it from Target instead. I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could return it the next day and get my money back or exchange it for a different brand. Luckily, I ended up loving this one.     Everybody is different, but I do recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> The razor is ok, I&#x27;m not blown away by how close it gets or how well it shaves my neck...I have a super sensitive neck and it does do a good job of less irritation, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily do the best job at removing all the hairs.  Also, the fact that you must unplug the charger from the wall when you don&#x27;t want the razor to charge is a ridiciously idiotic design flaw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco Electric Razors for almost 40 years and this has to be the closest and fastest shave yet. I do not shave every day so I have a bit of stubble going on when I do shave. With a 2-3 day growth all my past Norelco&#x27;s would have taken 4-5 minutes for a shave and I&#x27;d still need a steel-blade razor on my neck for it to be as smooth as my face. The 1050CC had my face and neck shaven smooth in about 2-3 minutes and that was with a 3 day growth. My last Norelco was a Spectra 8865XL, which I purchased 2 years ago and is still working fine (I replace the cutting combs-heads every year) but it could never get the neck area as close as the face. If you are a user of electric shavers then the 1050CC is the shaver for you!</li>
    <li> This new Norelco Arcitec razor provides a great shave with little irritation.  I had a Braun Syncro previously, and it would leave little hairs everywhere on my neck.  This new designed head flexs and pivots in all different ways to have more contact with the skin.      The jet clean station works good and is interesting to watch.  It does a good job of cleaning the razor heads of hair and debris.  There is however, one annoying issue.  Norelco says you should not charge the razor until it needs it to maximize battery life.  The jet clean system however, automatically goes into the charge cycle after cleaning and a two hour dry time!!  If your like me, you will probably be at work two hours after shaving.    My solution to the unplugging is:    I picked up a plug in rocker switch at Home Depot to go between the wall outlet and the Norelco Transformer plug.  I then shave a little earlier in my morning routine and clean the razor in the jet clean system.  I then turn the switch off while the system is in the 2 hour drying cycle.  This is ok since the razor is basically air/drip drying anyway.  If it needs charged, I turn the switch on while I know I&#x27;m going to be home for and hour then turn back off.  This is a bit annoying, but if I spent almost $200 on a razor then I want it to last.  You could also just unplug it during the drying mode, but I like the switch so I don&#x27;t have plugs and cords everywhere.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a gem of a design.  It looks good and it feels good in your hand.  As advertised, it shaves all the hard to get places around the chin and neck well.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.</li>
    <li> What happened to norelco?? I have had a norelco power shaver for years! and it has been great.  It just lost its recharge ability and I think the blades are now just a bit dull, however, always a quick, close shave.  This new, HIGHLY OVERPRICED shaver is TERRIBLE!  Its quickness is like that of a snail, its shave is like that of a choppy lawnmower, and its charge is like that of an old used duracell!  this is supposed to be the revolution in shaving!??? I think not.  The only reason I bought it in the first place is because I had been so happy with my old shaver, at least 10 years old not, I expect this one to last a mere few months, if that, and never even come close to the shave of its predecessor.  Shame on you Philips Norelco, you should pay some real designers to try and mimic all the designers you obviously outsourced to INdia.  Lame......</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000PKMA2G Philips Norelco 1050CC arcitec Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]  My husband is having good results from this system but he had a little trouble using the cleaning system so called the company. They told him he had to plug it in before entering the razor and that worked. Now he has a reference number that he can give if he has anymore questions.</li>
    <li> I knew that this shaver would probably be better than my last one but I was surprised to discover just how extraordinary this shaver is.  It&#x27;s like running a cold laser over your face.  It cuts better, faster and more efficiently that what came before it.  The new head design is the most ergonomic I&#x27;ve ever seen or felt.  Keep up the great work Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric shavers for the past 40 years. This model is by far the best yet. It gives a better, closer shave than I&#x27;ve enjoyed from any other electric razor. My facial hair is varied and provides a challenge to electric razors, but this unit is certainly up to the task.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor with some misgivings due to the reviews posted on this site. However, this is a wonderful electric razor. I have used a variety of brands of electric razors over the years. This one gives a closer shave, more comfortably, than any razor I have ever used. For me, this razor gives a closer shave than a blade without all the nicks. I could not be happier with it.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and in perfect condition as advertized.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone as long as the are willing to read and follow directions.</li>
    <li> This Philips Arcitec shaver has exceeded my expectations from the first time I used one.  The self-cleaning feature has made my life much easier.  Perhaps one sign of the popularity of this shaver is that it was the only thing stolen from my luggage on a recent flight.  The downside was that Southwest Airlines significantly depreciated the value of the shaver, even though it was only a year old.  But, I like the shaver so much, I immediately ordered a new one.</li>
    <li> Hi all..well, after having a Braun Series 700 for about a year, I switched over to the Norelco Arcitec with the cleaning station.  Each unit has their advantages. Braun cleaning system is better ( no need to unplug afer two hours; probably cleans a bit better than the Norelco.) BUT, the Braun was hot against my skin after a minute of shaving, and I even cut  myself with it! Hard to believe..maybe I shave too hard!  The Arcitec did a far better job with its rotary heads on my neck on the underside of the chin.  The Braun never got this area closely shaved and I had to contort the razor in different directions to get the hair shaved closely. No need to do that with the Arcitec...a faster shave. Arcitec less heavy and easier to hold.  Yes, the trimmer is a bit small - but it works.  I sent the Braun to my son - we will see how he likes it. But for the now, the Arcitec stays with me!</li>
    <li> ::I own the standard 1050 Arcitc razor without the cleaning contraption (CC), so my review is solely for that portion of the product::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drawn in by the sleek modern looks of this razor. I&#x27;m always used Philips Norelco rotaries in the past and have been very happy with them. My last razor was a [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco SpeedXL]] and I&#x27;d still be using it today if I had not worn out 2 of the blades after 4 years of heavy use. In fact, I keep it around to help get the stray hairs the Arcitec misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your stubble is medium to heavy thickness, then this razor will annoy the heck out of you. What used to take me about 2 minutes now takes more than 5. It just doesn&#x27;t want to cut ...and if you have more than 2 days&#x27; growth, you are really in for a problem. It takes multiple passes with me stretching my skin to try to get the hairs up for this razor to get at them, and even then it misses some. It is less than 6 months old and it&#x27;s as if the blades have gotten dull. But they don&#x27;t pull at the hairs so that is not it. It took 2 years for my last razor&#x27;s blades to dull. This one just refuses to cut well. I clean and charge it religiously, so that isn&#x27;t the issue either. To top it off, the small extendable straight razor is all but useless because the main shaving head gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good looking razor that holds a charge for a long time, but that is where the pros end. I wish I could return it but I waited too long. I&#x27;ll be going back to the bulkier (but quieter) XL style after this one, or maybe even convert to a Braun. You let me down with this product Philips.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about two weeks. It does a good job, no better then my old razor no worse. My one complaint is the trimmer. Its hard to use because its small and the heads get in the way.</li>
    <li> The idea of the floating shaving head and each rotary blade having it&#x27;s own pivoting point to contour to your face sounds great but the fact isThis razor is terrible. It did not shave nearly as close as my previous norelco shaver. This arcitec caused more irritation and razor burn than any other razor I have used including cheapo disposable single blade razors. Reason being is I found that I would have continuously pass over the same area over and over and couldn&#x27;t get the hair Shaved especially on my neck. It literally took about 15 minutes to obtain an acceptable shave. Note that I do have sensitive skin and a tough beard. Anyway I returned the razor and purchased norelco 8260 with the jet cleaning system and I have to say the shave with it is amazing. I got a shave that is as close as a blade with very little irritation in about 5 minutes. Save yourself (...) buy the 8260CC</li>
    <li> I have used a regular razor for years and was getting tired of expensive blades and cuts and nicks. I finally decided to try an electric razor again after having had one years ago and not being satisfied with the shave I was getting. I must say I am very happy with the arcitec shaver from Norelco! It&#x27;s quick and easy and gives a good close shave. I love the fact that it automatically cleans itself which makes my life easier and prolongs the life of the rotary blades. I give it a two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> well i&#x27;ve used regular razors for 20 years and never could find an electric that would cut the hairs on my neck...plus electrics irritated my neck alot...i found the arcitec for $50 brand new in the box so i thought i would try it out....it worked pretty good and cut all the hairs but it took some going over certain spots several times to get a smooth shave...it is almost as good as a regular razor shave....the closeness isn&#x27;t the problem....it irritates my neck pretty bad leaving redness that takes a day or two to go away...i shaved with it for a month hoping my skin would adjust to it but it never did...i tried everything...i even ordered a sensotouch 3d head and tried it since it fits the arcitec razor...it seemed to irritate my skin even more...both heads cut pretty much the same...the 3d may cut slightly faster but it nicked my skin more often and caused more irriation on my neck...i tried using that nivea for men shaving stuff that is supposed to help with irritation and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference at all...my face, chin, and mustache areas were fine but my lower neck always got irritated pretty bad...i&#x27;ve used gilette mach 3, fusion power, and proglide power and they all would irritate my neck some but much less than the norelco....the best razor i&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck is the schick hydro 5....even shaving upwards...but it would irritate on each side of my lips if i shaved upwards so i was forced to only shave downwards leaving a not as smooth of a shave....the arcitec on the other hand does a great job on my gotee (chin/mustache) area...this part of my beard is really thick and the hairs are stiffer...it shaves it smooth as a razor with very little irritation...i kept trying things hoping i could stick with either an electric or a regular razor...but both have their faults...at least on my face....so i&#x27;ve found the best solution for me is to use both.....the electric on my gotee area (chin/mustache) and the regular razor on my neckand face...this way i can get a smooth shave all over without irritation...for now this seems to be the only solution i can come up with lol</li>
    <li> i purchased this norelco from best buy it looked cool and was the most expensive one there so i figured it has to be good. came home was very excited opened it was very stylish i had a light 5 ocklock shadow going on so i decided to shave it. i had to go over FIVE times to cut most of my beard off and it left behind many little hairs.  very sloppy job.i spent a little more and got the BRAUN shaver which is 10 times better even though it doesnt look as stylish and is bigger.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of Norelco shavers.  Recently I purchased their new 1050X ARCITEC shaver.  I do NOT like it.  The grip (motor unit) is too small and not comfortable to hold while shaving.  The floating head unit is too flimsy.  The unit requires that the shaving units be opened and cleaned on EVERY use - a pain in the neck.  I like the basic Norelco units and really like their SPEED-XL series shavers, which by the way are much less expensive than the Arcitec units.  I my estimation, the Arcitec shavers are not worth their expense and I regret wasting my money on one.  Stick with their standard units and enjoy their performance.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Norelco for over 15 years, and I have always loved it, but recently and due to malfunction of my norelco I decided to try the braun 8575, and it was a nightmare, shaving time quadrupled with very poor result, I gave the shaver enough time (3 months) then had to return and get this one. I appreciate norelco shavers, this one is really great compared to all I used before, shaving time about 3 min. the jet clean system however is not very effective, it does clean but the solution is alcohol free so it does not disinfect. additionally you still have to manually rinse the shaver before placing it in the cleaning system as cleaning system alone does not do the job!</li>
    <li> Pros:    - Great looking design. Feels great in your hand and you can really notice Philips used high quality materials to make this (not cheap plastic).    - Jet cleaning system won&#x27;t take a lot of space in your bathroom    - Relatively silent    - Captures the majority of the facial air from the shave leaving the sink spot clean    Cons:    - Didn&#x27;t feel any difference in terms of shave quality from previous low end models that I owned in the past (like the 8200 series). At this price point I was expecting more    - The Jet Cleaning System is a joke - very poor engineering: The instructions manual repetitively warns you to not leave your razor in the cleaning system after the cleaning cycle is complete because it will kill the battery of your razor. Problem is that the cycle takes 2 hours and they advise you to use it after every shave. So, you have to wait for 2 hours and then unplug the jet cleaning system from the power plug, or it will mess up your razor. This makes no sense to me, I just want to be able to plug it in the system and leave my apartment while it does the cleaning - but with this one you can&#x27;t do this    - Philips 45 day (not 60 as advertised here) money back guarantee is painful. You can only return after 3 weeks of use (but before 45 days) and you need to pay out of your own pocket, mail postage and insurance. But before that you need to call Philips customer service, wait on the phone for 30 minutes and they&#x27;ll send you by mail a return form. If you decide to return it, I suggest you count on the return policy of the retailer you buy from     All in all, I was expecting more from a Philips high end product.</li>
    <li> I have had Phillips Noreclo shavers for years.  They have almost always shaved closer than the best screen shavers; and I use both types every day, as some work more easily on some types of facial terrain and the rotaries do by far the best job on the neck.  This one is the best and closest shaving razor ever.  It is small and fits well in the hand.  The heads are the most flexible ever.  It works better with a little thin oil than with spray lubricants.  I love the transporting device that also allows recharging within it.  But the best of all is the self cleaning device.  It works dramatically well, and is the main reason I purchased the whole system instead of just the razor.  I still have my older Norelco and it works fine; but I wanted the self cleaning device.  the price for the whole system is only slightly higher than that for just the razor, alone.</li>
    <li> THIS KIND OF SHAVER IS VERY GREAT TO USE. I USE IT EVERY MORNING. It give me a bright face, SO I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This expensive electric shaver is worth every penny.  It gives the best shave I&#x27;ve had in 78 years (including a few early years when I didn&#x27;t even have peach fuzz). The cleaning attachment appears to work well, based on a month&#x27;s experience.  I have had many electric shavers dating back to Sunbeam days and through earlier Norelco models and this is far, far superior.</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco Shavers for over 30 years. This model was painful to shave with. It took excessive pressure against the skin to shave. The trimmer does not pop out far enough to be useful. The only thing I liked that I didn&#x27;t think I would like was the cleaner. My older Norelco shaved closer, did not miss hairs, and was comfortable to use. The shaver does look pretty and inovative but dosen&#x27;t shave worth a hoot!</li>
    <li> I just bought this razor today and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not doing a little research first.  It does look cool and the floating head made me think that it would give me a nice, close shave with little razor burn...not even close.  I had to apply A LOT of pressure for it to even do what it&#x27;s supposed to (which is shave hair off my face) and that gave me some awesome razor burn.  Thanks Norelco!  You will not get a consistent shave if you buy this razor.  It&#x27;s an over priced piece of junk and it&#x27;s getting returned today.  Thanks you.</li>
    <li> I had need of a new shaver as one of our dogs chewed up my 5 year old (in perfect working order prior to \\&quot;the meal\\&quot;) Was a Norelco (Phillips).&lt;br /&gt;At first blush, I would consider this the WORST shaver I have ever owned in 45+ years of use.&lt;br /&gt;There were certain areas of my neck that seemed to be purposely eluded by some of the previously used shavers.That was STILL THE EVIDENT WITH THIS NEW UNIT. It cut quickly in all other areas.&lt;br /&gt;HERE IS ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM WITH THIS SHAVER. NOISE !!! This is the loudest shaver I have owned. On a whim, I took it to a neighbors home.He is a medical doctor. He confirmed that use of this shaver should be done with EAR PROTECTION (Ear plugs). The sound level is dangerously high !!! BE AWARE OF THIS BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR DOLLARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the \\&quot;Jet Clean\\&quot; system is concerned, well I did not have to get that (but I did) as the heads can be held under running HOT tap water to effectively clean. Takes up a lot of counter top space and must be plugged in to work. Add the cost of the \\&quot;Jet Clean\\&quot; fluid and I would not buy that toy again. THE SHAVER DOES NEED A LOT OF CLEANING AS THE AREAS FOR CUT WHISKERS UNDER THE 3 CUTTING BLADES ARE VERY VERY VERY SMALL. MUST BE CLEANED EVERY 2-3 SHAVES. Even then, whiskers seem to get out of head area and drop on whatever you may be wearing. ALSO, BE AWARE OF THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER TO ANYONE FRIEND OR FOE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 21, 2013 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Bought a Braun Series 3.  Wow !!!! This is a shaver !!!&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS FOLKS..............Sold the Norelco on the Internet. Went to MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY  Cost me $36.60 postage !!.........Isn&#x27;t the Internet wonderful....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;Springfield, OR</li>
    <li> The Arcitec 1050cc is essentially the 1050 plus a cleaning station (hence the &#x27;CC&#x27; suffix).  This review is basically about the shaver portion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Braun shaving customer for over 20 years. I find I&#x27;m able to get almost as close as a blade. So, why bother with any other shaver? Well, I&#x27;d always been fascinated by the triple-head design that Norelco pioneered back almost 30 years ago. The last time I tried one was about 10 years ago, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. With the latest Arcitec design, I figured it was time to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arcitec Models&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco makes so many different models, I can&#x27;t figure them all out. However, the Arcitec stands out by having a very distinctive slender look, the triple head surface on a flat conical piece that is affixed to a pivot, unlike the \\&quot;neckless\\&quot; other models. There are 3 main Arcitec models: 1050, 1060, and 1090. There are also two suffixes: X and CC. I think the &#x27;X&#x27; means there is no cleaning station, while &#x27;CC&#x27; means a cleaning station IS included. You may see some models shown without either suffix--this is the same as the &#x27;X&#x27; (before they changed their naming convention). So, why is there a cleaning station if the heads can be rinsed under water? Competition. Braun provides one now... and with the scented alcohol solution, the shaver seems \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; after the cleansing bath. So, Norelco had to keep up. But in reality it&#x27;s overkill; don&#x27;t bother with one if you&#x27;re thrifty. Rinsing the heads under water works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, here&#x27;s the difference: The 1050 has only 1 indicator for battery recharge needed, the 1060 has several LED indicators showing how much charge is left, and the 1090 has an LED double-digit display showing how many minutes of shaving are left. Quite frankly, the 1050 is just fine. When the battery gets low, you&#x27;ve got about 5 minutes left before the shaver will quit. Even still, for every minute the shaver is plugged in, that is how many minutes of shaving you get. Plug the shaver back in for 5 minutes, and you&#x27;re ready to go for your shave. So... although this \\&quot;early warning system\\&quot; looks cool, it&#x27;s overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, onto the shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance and Design&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, it is a beautiful looking device. Very futuristic. Adorned in several shades of black, dark gray, and silver, with catchy real carbon fiber side panels and a matte rubber finish along the backside for good grip. The three silver shaving discs contrast the black theme nicely. The shaver is lightweight and the heads have a lot of flex to them. The shaver comes with a charging base that serves as a resting stand, which secures the razor magnetically--very tasteful. There is also a \\&quot;travel pod\\&quot; included that allows you to charge the shaver while it is housed inside it. Certainly, the accessories are more impressive than what Braun offers. It looked to me like Braun has met its match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, onto the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving Experience&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec 1050 is rather quiet, compared to my Braun 8595 Activator. I watched a couple of YouTube posted reviews of the latest Braun Pulsonic 9595, and that shaver sounded about as loud (if not louder) than my Braun 8595 Activator. So... Norelco certainly wins the prize for most quiet shaver. Actually, the sound is a low drone... it gives the impression that the shaver is a slow, antiquated device. The Braun sounds Bold and Busy with its Bounding Buzz. But in reality, the Norelco is formidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I touch the shaver to my face. I hear and feel the nibble of whiskers taking place. I begin to go through the motions... cheeks, chin, lip areas, then the neck. It feels comfortable. The discs are gentle. I don&#x27;t feel anything like the reports of \\&quot;heavy tugging\\&quot; at the whiskers. I make a full double-pass across my face, then check the smoothness with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh... not enough. Still rough. No immediate advantage over the Braun. So, I make another few passes. I pinch and pull at my skin as I would with the Braun. I do two more passes and check the smoothness again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh... not enough. Better, but not as close as the Braun. I continue... I probably ended up shaving about 2-3 minutes longer than with the Braun. I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness. It just takes a little longer. But the trimmer on the Arcitec? Awful. There&#x27;s this little ridge on the backside of the shaver. A side switch partially extends and activates it, a small bank of cutting teeth. It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line. When you encounter a hair with it, there&#x27;s a rather loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound. The Braun&#x27;s trimmer is about twice as wide and zaps the hairs effortlessly. Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes. The Norelco captures the whisker debris inside the heads and keeps it there, unlike the Braun which will dump a bunch of it on you if you turn it sideways or on a downward angle. For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts Replacement&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends replacing the heads every 12 months. Braun recommends doing so every 18 months. The Braun Pulsonic series tells you when head replacement is necessary... not sure how this is done (number of shaves?). The Norelco Arcitec has a little \\&quot;head replacement\\&quot; indicator. The Norelco replacement heads are about 30% more expensive than Braun&#x27;s Series 5, and 8000 series, although the new \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; system with the Pulsonic is about the same. So, cost of maintenance might be higher. Also, I&#x27;ve seen mixed opinions about how long they last. Some people have complained having to replace them at 6 months, while an acquaintance says he replaces the heads every 10 years--when he changes shavers! He was once told that the heads are \\&quot;self sharpening\\&quot;. That sounds a bit unrealistic to me. In any case, I can&#x27;t report the replacement time here just yet... I&#x27;ll need to use this shaver for a while. But I&#x27;ll have to give it to Braun for a longer time between head replacement and at a cheaper cost (because it is also said that you can get away with replacing just the cutter block, if the foil is still intact, which drops the cost by 50%... can&#x27;t do this with the Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;So, the conclusion? The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin. The Norelco Arcitec 1050 puts up a very good fight. I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out. Especially if the girlfriend is still asleep and I want to be super quiet. That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet. And it is great about trapping the whisker debris (I shave before I get dressed, so it&#x27;s not a critical factor in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which shaver do I prefer? Well, at the moment it&#x27;s the Braun. It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip. It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco. I&#x27;m planning to keep both... and will alternate between them from time to time. If I need to shave and make minimal noise, the Norelco will be my choice. For travel, I prefer the sturdier Braun. The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final analysis&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Accessories: Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Quiet: Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Cleanliness: Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Charging: --tied--&lt;br /&gt;Parts cost: Braun&lt;br /&gt;Trimming: Braun&lt;br /&gt;Speed: Braun&lt;br /&gt;Closest: --tied--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note:  If you are concerned about the cost, do not bother with the cleaning station.

    <li> after research, i found that this is the best shaver in the market now with all these options</li>
    <li> I had the SpeedXL prior to this and dropped it just after a year of owning it so I upgraded to this razor. It looks sleek and professional and has the quality of shave to back up the price. I have owned this razor for just about a month now and last night was the first time charging it since it&#x27;s initial charge. I have also travelled with it and the travel pod is a nice secure place to store it in your suitcase. The very flexible shaving heads get really close behind my jaw and neck area where there is the most curves. Running warm water over it after every shave is good enough to keep it running at peak performance between charges. When I charge I run the jet clean system. I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Cleaning machine works well but is very heavy - not practical for travel.  Pod intended for travel protects the shaver very well, but is very heavy. Unfortunately, the shaver must be in the pod or cleaning machine to charge it. The good news is that you can go a long time between charges, so for a short trip you just take the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have never used electric shavers I&#x27;m 20 years old and I have always used razors, in the past year I had been using the Gillete Fusion (5 blades). It was great but I had to shave every other day, becuase shaving everyday was just painful, irritated my skin etc. So I decided to buy an electric shaver since friends kept telling me it worked so great. So I struggled a lot trying to decide which electric shaver to buy. I just bought this Phillips Norelco 1050CC with the Jet Clean System 4 days ago over Amazon and I truly think this machine is awesome!!! It gives me an extremely close shave. Of course to achieve this I have to go over the same place like 2 or 3 times. Maybe, it is just lack of experience. The neck was really hard to shave, but again maybe it&#x27;s just lack of experience. I still have got to learn the techniques and ways to achive the perfect shave. However, when it comes shaving the face around the check and the jaw area, it truly gives you an extremely close shave almost unvelibable.    The best thing is also that if I shave in the morning (against the grain) I can do this again at night that same day \\&quot;pain free.\\&quot; Which was impossible to do with the other Razor.  The machine said you need up to 3 weeks for your skin to get used to this system. However, my skin has not gotten irritated or anything from this system I would recommend it to anyone.   Also, the Jet Clean System works great it keeps the Shaver brand new and extremely clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally pleased after using the shaver for about three weeks. I had a Remington, the type where the whole cutting head is supposedly to be replaced monthly ( for almost $6.00 ) and was very unhappy with it.  The Norelco is expensive but as I shave daily I think it&#x27;s worth it. I found the instruction booklet confusing at times.</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed to Afghanistan, and have gone through three electric razors since arriving. None of the previous razors have been as easy on maintenance as this on, nor as durable. its self cleaning feature has cut one of my daily &#x27;chores&#x27; out of the picture, and give a remarkably smooth shave in half the time of other electric razors. the charging pod it comes with is also great for transporting it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Norelco 1050CC (shaver and cleaning system).  Here is what I like and don&#x27;t like:    Pros:  -Shaved great for an electric  -Cleaned up well in the automatic cleaner  -I know others complained but I had less razor burn than other shavers    Cons:  -Beard/Sideburn trimmer is ineffective and located in a very poor place.  -The angle of the trimmer seems awkward to use.  -MOST OF ALL the recharging system is a complete disappointment.  Basically you start the cleaning cycle and have to wait around to unplug the shaver so that the battery doesn&#x27;t get ruined.  It even tells you in the instructions not to leave it plugged in if your battery is charged--which is 90 percent of the time.  VERY VERY stupid.      I would have kept this razor otherwise if it wasn&#x27;t for the illogical charging/cleaning system.  You pretty much have to choose between waiting 5 minutes watching your razor clean itself every morning or be okay with ruining your battery.  It is enough of an inconvenience that I am returning it and going back to my Norelco quadra trac.</li>
    <li> Over  a years I had three deferent models from Norelko. Philips Norelco 1050cc worst shaver  EVER HAD.iT IS TAKE FOREVER TO SHAVE. And even after forever I don not have good shave.STRONGLY RECOMENDET DOnT EVEN think TO BUY THIS SHAVER</li>
    <li> This is probably my 5th Norelco in 20 years. I have tended to buy a higher-up model each time and I was happy until the Arcitec.  For a while it seemed to give a so-so shave but i spent a *lot* of time going over areas and trying to get stray whiskers.      Now, after only a few months, the blades have become very dull, and it is useless.  I pulled an older Norelco out of a travel kit and am using that for now.  The replacement blade head is about $35 and I am not sure I will bother.  At the rate this went I could spend $140 a year on replacements.  And everybody seems out of stock, anyway.  I wonder why :(    I think guys who rate this highly must either have very easy beards or be suffering from cognitive dissonance -- I spent a lot of dough so it *has* to be good!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when using this razor is how smooth it felt against my face. Secondly, even after the first use, it was a fantastically close shave.  The battery is plenty long enough. I&#x27;ve had it off the charger for a week with daily shaves and no loss in power. The cleaning system is simple and straightforward.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving system, incredibly flexible shaver head allows for easy shaving over all the contours of your face and neck.  The shaver is easy to clean, simply rinse under water, and even comes with a cleaning and recharging system.</li>
    <li> very nice get my neck close would be 5 star but it recharges every time after its done cleaning and the manual says run it down then charge or will shorten batt life amazing how the new head can move in all dirrections  please note you cant take out the cutters in this model you have to replace the entire shaver head</li>
    <li> I love the razor and cleaner.  The only issue I have is that the if you let the cleaner go through the entire cycle it will charge the battery even when you are told in the instructions to fully discharge the battery before charging.  The problem is easily solved by unpluging the cleaning stand right after cleaning is complete. When fully discahrged I let it run the full cycle.  The razor shaves as promiced and gets places that I couldn&#x27;t with my spectra!</li>
    <li> This works as described.  First, the razor is great.  For the first time I use an electric razor that does not make my face burn after use.  It is very light and smooth, but my facial hair is a little thick so after shaving you can feel your face still a little rough (this is why I gave it 4 stars).  Not too concerning for me, because it still looks good.  Second, the cleaning system is something new to me.  It is a little bulky so is not very convenient for traveling.  It does what is supposed to, clean the razor.  The soap is good for 2 weeks and each bootle is only good for 2 uses, so you have to get a new bottle every month.  Third is the charger/carry case.  This is slightly larger than the razor and is for traveling.  It is very hard plastic so I would not worry about my razor while in it.  You don&#x27;t have to use the cleaning system to wash your razor, but all you do is set the razor on it and push a button, rather than opening up the shaving head and rinse with water for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for 30 years and this is the only one that has ever disappointed me. It creates skin burn and takes forever to actually shave your beard and I don&#x27;t even have a tough beard.  After 6 months, the cleaning stand system quit working.      I pulled out my old Norelco Cool Skin 7775X, recharged it and was surprised at how much better of a shave I got with the old razor.  Now I need to find a replacement head for the old one and trash the Arcitec.    Norelco makes great products, this is the exception that proves the rule.</li>
    <li> This razor worked great but would never hold a charge for longer than 5 min.  We called the company and they sent a new one out right away.  Unlike many other companies that we have dealt with, Norelco even paid to ship the old one back.  Great company, great razor</li>
    <li> I recently read reviews of the Arcitec before buying it.  The reviews generally indicated that it was an OK product but not any better than the XL.  Based on reviews I purchased new heads for the XL to make it a fair contest.  The Aritec was a considerably faster shave especially in area of the neck. It might be a little closer and more comfortable.  Also, cleaning it is a great deal easier.  I am planning to give the Excel with the new blades to my son in law.   Jim</li>
    <li> I bought the new Philips Norelco 1050cc Arcitec Shaving System, returned it for a refund after 30 days, and then purchased a the new Braun Pulsonic 9595 Shaving System. Since I&#x27;ve had experience with both now, I thought my experience might be of value to others. I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco shavers over the past 20 years. The 9595 is my first Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Closeness - The Braun definitely gives a closer shave and in less time, although the Norelco is acceptable. One reviewer commented about getting nicks from the Braun but I have not had that problem at all, even around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - The Braun feels heavier (I didn&#x27;t actually weigh them) but I found the Braun more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - The Braun is noisier, especially during the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status Indicators on the Shaver - The indicators are better on the Braun; however, I&#x27;ve since learned that&#x27;s mostly because I had the 1050 model. I now see that the 1060 or the 1090 models would have been better and probably would equal the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging/Cleaning Stand - The Braun is more convenient to replace the cleaning fluid but about the same cost (about $1.00 per week). Both seem to clean equally well. The charge and cleaning status lights on the Braun are easier to see and give better status information. But the big difference here is the way the charging system works. With the Braun, you simply place your used razor in the stand, push a button, and the cleaning &amp; charging are taken care of. However, with the Norelco, there are a number of warnings in the book to unplug the unit after it completes its cycle. This is a major inconvenience if you have to hang around and remember to unplug the unit. Also, the lack of an on/off switch seems a poor and cheap design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - To even off my sideburns, I found the Norelco somewhat difficult to use because the trimmer did not stick out far enough beyond the shaving head. This was not a problem withthe Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost - The Braun cost about $20 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return Policy - 60 day money back with Norelco; only 30 days with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-Line - I started with a bias toward the Norelco because of my past experiences but in my opinion, this new Braun definitely surpasses the Norelco in terms of shaving closeness and convenience. Braun is clearly worth the extra $20, although the Norelco is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 17 years now and this razor would be good if you just had peach fuzz and don&#x27;t get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by noon.  I used this razor for a week thinking I would give this a try with the money back offer.  Here are my opinions:      It feels like you have a piece of plastic in your hand instead of a sturdy shaving system.  You cannot get a close shave on the neck.  Even after grinding the shaver into my neck for several minutes it still looked the same.  Forget about using the trimmer I could do better with my nose trimmer for my sideburns.  Price...for what it delivered it was not worth it.    Pros:  I liked the cleaning system, but that is about it.      Needless to say I switched to another brand (it was just as expensive) and have been very happy.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that anything could top my former Norelco but this one is fantastic.  2 months later I still can&#x27;t get over the closeness of the shave and ease of this shaver.  Do not even think about buying another brand or version.</li>
    <li> I just picked this up this evening and unboxed it a few minutes ago.  I&#x27;m already a bit disappointed with it so far.  I had read the reviews here on Amazon, and knew that some people were finding a rough shave with it.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try that yet ... but the cleaning system is a bit of a disappointment.    First off, the cleaning solution that they provide contains no alcohol.  My Remington with cleaning system had an alcohol-based solution, and I was always sure my razor was clean and sterilized.  But this?  No alcohol?  Hmm.    Secondly - my Remington (and the Brauns, too) had a small filter packet that was supposed to catch all the little bits of whiskers that were going through the cleaning solution.  This one?  No such thing.  So you mean weeks-old whiskers are going to be floating around in the non-alcohol based cleaning solution?  No thanks.    The \\&quot;unplug after it&#x27;s fully charged\\&quot; thing will probably be a bit annoying - but I have a feeling some people are worrying a bit too much about this.  I left my Remington in the stand constantly for 5 years.  Eventually the battery burned out - and I realize it was probably my fault (I didn&#x27;t read the manual) but I don&#x27;t think you need to get obsessive like some reviewers have here and get it unplugged *immediately* after it&#x27;s done with its cycle.  When you get home from work in the evening would probably be find.  Just give it a full charge once every several days.    Even though I haven&#x27;t even given it a full charge yet, I have a feeling it&#x27;s going to be going back and I&#x27;ll be buying the Braun instead - even though my face seems to prefer a rotary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cool looking and works fantastically. The cleaning system is great too, but you really don&#x27;t have to clean it every day.</li>
    <li> I got my Philips Norelco 1050CC arcitec for Christmas and love it. I have used a Norelco for about 15 years and this is the best one yet. I love the cleaning system it works great I have read orther reviewer&#x27;s that didn&#x27;t like the fact that it dose not turn off when it&#x27;s done cleaning but there is a simple soloution just use one of those plug-in timers and set it for two hours and you can use the cleaner when ever you want to and you will have no worry&#x27;s about running the battrey down. The shave is very close and confortable.The only bad point is the Trimmer is in a bad location.I like that shave head is all one unit that makes it easy to keep clean and replace.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for 2 weeks. Works great and gives a close shave. The only thing I don&#x27;t understand is the cleaning system. It is the same as the Braun shavers, but the instructions tell you to unplug the power after the cleaning stage so it will not affect the battery life. If you look at the instructions it takes 2 hrs for the cleaning and drying cycle to finish then your instructed to remove the power. After the cleaning cycle if finished it automaticly goes to the charg cycle. If you are like me I am at work by then in the morning. Come on Norelco, whats with this. Poor design on Norelcos part. The shaver does give a nice close shave and is great looking.   I&#x27;ll only give this product 4 stars because of the cleaning/charging system. How many of us are going to remove the power after cleaning. Are you going to stand there and wait. I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve found with less irritation.  Very smooth and comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> The swiveling head and comfortable grip of the arcitec allow for a great shave.    Pros:     Battery life is phenomenal - lasted nearly a month on one charge    Can charge product in the cleaning station or in protected case/pod    Excellent contouring to the face for a great shave    Cons:    Cannot charge while shaving - must be in the cleaning system or charging pod    Does not charge while cleaning - requires some battery and then charges the device after the cleaning cycle is complete    Trimmer that pops out from the back-side is mediocre at best    Expensive</li>
    <li> Over the years, have purchased many models of Philips shavers. This model give me the closest shave so far. While it does require more frequent cleaning than older models, the cleaning system is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the Norelco Arcitec, I read reviews on Amazon and on various review websites I found with a simple Google search.  Some of the criticisms I&#x27;ve seen regarding the Arcitec are somewhat true, and many are not (at least in my case).  All people are different, and as such so is our facial hair, so please keep that in mind when reading any of these reviews including mine.    The Arcitec is my 2nd electric razor.  I tried a Braun foil-type razor about 6-7 years ago.  Basically the problem I had with the Braun razor is two fold:  1)  It didn&#x27;t shave hair with any consistency, if at all.  Getting a close shave was impossible.    2)  Absolutely tore my face up.  Irritated my skin more than it shaved.    At that time I decided to go back to a standard razor and gel and let technology catch-up to my \\&quot;dream razor\\&quot;.  I have zero problems with using a standard razor and gel - I&#x27;m able to get a close shave without any noticeable razor burn or irritation.  I just like not having to pick up a pack of razor heads and gel all the time, my schedule is simply too busy to even make it to the store, hence I buy things online and have them shipped to me.  I like having gadgets and hoped one day I could have a razor that worked well, looked great, and would provide a great shave for a long time to come without constantly needing to go get something for it or special maintenance.     Fast forward to today and I&#x27;m overly surprised at just how good the Norelco Arcitec is.  I&#x27;ll go over the basics of the particular model I have (1050CC), the differences between the models, and what things I would consider pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.    The Arcitec Razor  First things first, this is an absolutely beautiful razor!  It looks and feels even better in your hand than on pictures on the Internet.  This is now the 4th day I&#x27;ve had and used this razor and feel I&#x27;m at a point where I can accurately describe my experience.  My first shave took about 10 minutes with 2 days of growth.  After my 4 day,I&#x27;m in and out in just a couple of minutes.  Each day the shave is truly better and faster.    +Pros+  1)  I&#x27;m able to get an extremely close shave. Easily rivals what I am able to do with a standard razor and gel.  2)  The hardest area to shave is the neck/jaw line.  With a few days practice I have been able to get these areas quite easily.    3)  Norelco recommends using this razor by itself for 21 days for your skin and beard to become accustomed to using the Arcitec.  I&#x27;ve had ZERO razor burn and/or irritation since the first day I&#x27;ve used it and yet somehow, everyday the shave is better, easier, and faster.  It&#x27;s ADDICTING.  4)  The trimmer on the back is not near as useless as other reviewers are making it out to be.  Simply, the trimmer works well.  The only downside is that the shaving heads can get in the way of being able to see what it is that you&#x27;re trimming at certain angles.  I have a separate cordless Norelco trimmer, but honestly as long as you&#x27;re not doing ridiculously-extravagant facial hair, you should have no problem pulling out the trimmer on this product and cleaning up your sideburns, mustache, or other simple facial hair.  It IS NOT a toy like some reviewers are saying, it makes a nice clean line and cuts real close.  5)  The Jet Clean system is absolutely awesome.  I have no idea why other reviews have said to not get this.  Keeps the razor looking and feeling brand new, everyday, with no effort.  What is not to like?  I went on an Amazon subscription for the Jet Clean solution, so they send me a new bottle for like 3$-4$ shipped each month and I don&#x27;t have to do anything.  This is reasonable.  Unit does ship with 1 bottle of solution which will last a month if you follow Norelco&#x27;s suggestion.    -Cons-  1)  It&#x27;s relatively expensive compared to most of the market.  Amazon&#x27;s got a decent price on it, I personally picked mine up on Ebay for a fantastic price from a well-rated seller.    2)  The only criticism, other than price which is completely subjective, that I have read on reviews that holds any truth is the charging method.  Here&#x27;s the deal if you haven&#x27;t read this before:  The Arcitec comes with two methods of charging.  One is a travel case/charging pod.  I have yet to use this, however I can say that it is a well-made plastic case that the Arcitec fits inside.  On the outside of the case is a plug so it can be charged without having to take it out.  Other users were somewhat disappointed that the case is somewhat large and takes up a bit more space that older models.  Non-issue for me, honestly it&#x27;s not that big at all and would easily fit in any bag I own except maybe my quite small Kenneth Cole laptop messenger bag that I use for work, in which case I&#x27;m working and not shaving.  The 2nd charging method is the Jet Clean/charging dock.  As mentioned previously the Jet Clean system works great, however the problem is that you CANNOT leave the unit plugged in.  What happens is you shave, either blow/wash out/brush out hairs in the Artitec (very easy by the way), then you place it on the Jet Clean system/charging dock and push power.  This initiates the cleaning cycle.  It takes only about an hour to clean, then a 2 hour dry-time.  PROBLEM: you cannot leave it in the Jet Clean system without unplugging the unit from power after the cleaning cycle is done because it will start charging automatically as soon as the cleaning cycle is done, and it will decrease the life or affect the health of the battery because you&#x27;re supposed to completely charge, then use until completely dead (similar to other small electronic devices like cell phones, MP3 players etc).  Why Norelco didn&#x27;t fix this problem is beyond me.  I plan on buying a power-timer that will allow me to finish shaving, put the timer to around 2 hours and then I&#x27;m free to leave without worrying about my Arcitec investment.  I have the same problem with my Norelco trimmer, luckily both shave and trim well, which is what they ultimately need todo for me to be a happy customer.  3)  The 1050CC model does not have the minutes left of charge on the display of the Arcitec as the other models that don&#x27;t come with the Jet Clean system do.  Why is this?  I would have liked to have had that, but I knew this prior to the purchase and I&#x27;m happy no less.    All in all, I find no reason to not recommend this product.  The Arcitec is the best shave I&#x27;ve had, it looks great (can easily be left on the bathroom counter, it&#x27;s a work of art), the Jet Clean system and charging dock are well designed and work excellent, comes with everything you need, and Amazon&#x27;s always looking out for me with great things like their new subscription service that will allow you to automatically receive things you need routinely around the same time frame, such as the Jet Clean solution.  Something like $3 or $4 will have it automatically sent to you each month with no hassle and no time wasted.  I think YOU will be happy with the purchase of a Norelco Arcitec as well!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my face with Norelco razors for over 30 years and the last 4 or so I have been shaving my head as well. The added stress on the razor is huge. While I probably have had 3 razors in the space of the first 20 years of shaving I have had three in the last 5 years including this one. While I was satisfied with the previous versions of the Norelco this one stands out. It does a much better job on my head without sacrificing the quality on my face. Time will tell on the life of this razor, but I can already testify the quality of the shave is outstanding.</li>
    <li> If you were 15 and just starting to grow &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; maybe this is a good solution for you. I have to say.. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have fair hair so I am not a dark bearded many, your skin never gets a smooth feel. Thought it might be a solution to have in the office for late meeting and business dinners. Not a good solution. - Sorry. Buy Disposable Bic&#x27;s and some foam .. you will be better off.</li>
    <li> husband love it. use everyday!</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than my Braun razor. light weight and cleans easily. would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 1050CC shaver is an exceptional product.  Provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Only negative observation is the instructions for the cleaning and recharging features.  Instructions for the cleaning base are inadequate/incorrect.  They say to insert the razor in the base and push it down.  They fail to mention that the cleaning base must be plugged in before razor is inserted into the base.  Once it is plugged in, the razor is automatically drawn into the base.  Attempting to push it into the base without it being plugged in will damage the razor.  Recharging is somewhat inconvenient.  It must be accomplished in the cleaning base or in the portable container.  There is no way to plug the recharging cord directly into the razor.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Norelco user for 25+ years, but there are so many things wrong with their latest model that I am now trying out all the competitors to see which I should switch to. Because of the following product flaws, my Norelco Arcitec is on its way back to Amazon for a refund.    -Whiskers are not captured in the shaving head, and instead I get a light \\&quot;rain\\&quot; of little hairs as I shave. This alone was enough to turn me off of this new model (especially when the wife saw the whisker rain and informed me that the shaver would be leaving the house), but the rest of the problems makes it even worse.    -Charging/cleaning system works well, but the instructions expect you to unplug the base unit after the cycle is complete. For ~$200, I expect to be able to to hit a button, have it do its thing and I don&#x27;t have to think about the shaver until its time to use it again the next day. The instructions state multiple times that the shaver should not be left to charge once the charge is complete. But - the cleaning cycle takes about 10 minutes and then needs another ~2 hours to dry, implying that the base unit should be unplugged 2 hours after you push the button to start the cleaning cycle. REALLY? - isn&#x27;t everyone at work by then?    -The hard shell travel case provides good protection (probably needed since the head unit with the blades seems like it could break off). But - the case is so big that I would have to buy a new travel kit just to hold the thing. It would easily take up 1/2 of a standard sized dopp kit.    -Trimmer blade is useless. Mentioned in other reviews...really - it is completely useless.    I DID like the cleaning system and was surprised at how well it worked. Having a freshly cleaned razor every morning is a compelling feature, so I&#x27;ll be looking for that in the next model I try out. (Braun is looking like a winner).    I was open to experiment and try out this Norelco Arcitec model, but there were just too many problems to justify the cost. Hope they study actual customer feedback and come out with a re-design that makes me want to come back to their brand.</li>
    <li> This was my first rotory razor I purchased. I thought I would try something new, and the Philips name has always been good. I would have thought that a high name would have a better product and I figured that rotory razors should have come along way in the past 10 years. I have always used foil razors for years prior to this.  I used the razor for a week; trying different preshave chemicals to help reduce the burn I was receiving. The razor felt smooth to the skin, but it left my neck red and burning feeling all day long. Nothing helped to reduce that feeling either.  The only positive attribute is that Philips has the money back guarantee. There wasn&#x27;t a catch at all, but it does take 4-6 weeks to receive the refund.  Needless to say, I went back to a foil razor, which happens to be a Panasonic Vortex. It is what I left to buy this Philips razor. I was never so happy to get rid of something. The Panasonic takes me half the time to shave, gives me a closer shave, and no burn. All of the razors already positive features where enhanced when I continued using the remaining Electric Shave preshave prior to shaving with the Panasonic.  I will never purchase another rotory razor again! It was the worst shaving experience I have had with razors.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over 35 years.  For the first time, I am dissatisfied.  I have been using the arcitec 1050cc for almost three weeks, and I have yet to get a decent shave.  It leaves lots of stubble.  Also, caring for this shaver is a real pain in the neck.  I am probably going to go back to my Norelco 8240XL.  [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco&#x27;s since I first started shaving many many many years ago. My last Norelco was huge disappointment, as I had to take a good 15 to 20 minutes to get a mediocre shave, often having to decide between irritated skin from endless shaving or settling for sandpaper skin. After reading the other reviews for the Norelco 1050cc Arcitec, I decided I had nothing to lose. First, the shave is FANTASTIC. No more than 3 minutes gets me a fantastic shave. Second, the head design is much more flexible which makes it easier to follow the natural curves of your face. Third, the ability to wet the heads (lightly dampen them) and shave makes for an unbelievably smooth shaving experience. Norelco, my skin thanks you. This shaver was done right.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Arcitec is the WORST shaving electric razor that Philips Norelco has ever made!!!! Stay away from it and the 8260XL  which is just as bad.  If your looing for a good electric razor that delivers a close comfortable shave then get the Philips Norelco 7340XL.  It shaves WAY better than these higher priced models and it is on sale at Walmart for $39.99. While these other razors sell  anywhere from $150.00 to $249.00 and they are a waste of money and dont shave worth a crap!!!! Please see my review of the 7340XL and if you have any questions email me at [...] Good Shaving-Michael P.S.-This review was written May 25, 2010, not December 20,2007!!!</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a Christmas gift after telling my girlfriend about it and it frustrated me a bit when it just didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected it to.  I thought I was going to have the most amazing shave of my life, and most convenient and comfortable to boot (especially for the price of this shaver).  Well I&#x27;m sorry to say I eventually got a decent shave by the 3rd try, but as for my expectations well it just didn&#x27;t happen.    Some background, I used to use a really basic Norelco triple rotary head as my first razor when I got it in my early teenage years to get rid of my meager beard.  That was about 20 years ago, and I long ago abandoned using an electric razor.  So even though I don&#x27;t normally use one, instead preferring to use a triple blade and shaving gel every 2-3 days, I knew what to expect.  And after reading the literature, the description/outer packaging, and viewing ads on TV I thought this unit would be head and shoulders about anything I&#x27;d used before.    I hate dealing with shaving and the possibility of any nicks/cuts/razor burn and ingrown hairs so in addition to avoiding that I wanted this for convenience and to save time, but the first problem I had with this shaver was that it took almost as long to shave using it as it would with my old razor and shaving gel.  I used this Philips/Norelco 3 times to make sure I&#x27;d given it ample opportunity to perform and there wasn&#x27;t any fluke, then if I still didn&#x27;t like it I&#x27;d return it and go back to what I was doing or get something else.    Shave #1 - Fresh out of the box.  Had about a 2.5 - 3 day beard going (I have a medium growth of mostly straight hairs) Was impressed how it felt and balanced in my hand.  Unique flex head didn&#x27;t flex as much as I thought it needed to, but probably not much of a detriment.  Not atypical for me, but a good amount of hair to get rid of for any shaver.  Used it to shave with dry skin.  Had to get used to the most effective way to use/hold it, but it did well near my cheekbones (the easiest part), OK on my moustache and goatee area, and so-so on my jawbone and neck.  Hardest part was my neck but also near my jaw.  Had to go over the same areas several several times using medium pressure - much more than expected.  And since I knew it takes a few shaves for your skin to get used to it and there is much more likely to be some discomfort the first time I thought OK no big deal.  But I could tell there was a lot more \\&quot;chafe\\&quot; on my face than I expected and the neck area had quite a bit of razor burn / redness even though I really wasn&#x27;t pushing hard or using it at what I would call a bad angle.  Did not really cut the sideways hairs as well as I expected, since they advertise it will obliterate those and I have quite a few on my neck.  Rinsed the thing under water, dried with towel and put it away.  Put a bunch of lotion on my face to help, still feeling some light discomfort / itch all over immediately after.    Shave #2 - 2 days later.  Opted to go with some water on my face since that is how I&#x27;m used to shaving and normally expect to get slightly better results, and a bit less irritation.  It worked pretty well, but the shave still took around 8 minutes or so, a bit too long and I still needed a mirror the whole time.  My face wasn&#x27;t quite as irritated as the first time, meaning slightly less chafe and razor burn on my neck, though a few ingrown hairs had made themselves known directly under my chin from shave #1 and I did whatever I could to get rid of those with a tweezer beforehand.  Sideways hairs still wouldn&#x27;t cut quite as well as I expected, though I didn&#x27;t quite have to go over my neck and rear of my jawbone quite as many times as the first shave.  After this shave I still managed to have a few stray hairs that either would not cut easily even after 5 or 10 direct passes or (for a few) if they were facing sideways, then not at all.  I went back with the tiny but fairly effective trimmer and knocked these out, but didn&#x27;t expect to have to do this and added another minute or two to the process.  Not much razorburn this time, put a normal amount of lotion on my face and I was good to go.  Pretty good shave.  Emptied the heads into the sink and rinsed and dried with water.    Shave #3 - 2 days later.  Easily the best shave of the three, which was what I was hoping for.  Still went with the wet shave, meaning I made sure there was plenty of water on my face to start.  Again upper cheek was the easiest and took almost no time, then moustache, goatee, jaw and sideburns, and then neck.  Initial shave took roughly 7 minutes.  Not as bad but not what I would call super fast.   The rotary heads got almost all the hairs this time, except for 1 or 2 stubborn / sideways hairs on my neck near my adam&#x27;s apple.  Some hairs / areas took 5-10 passes with the shave head but went away with the appropriate pressure/motion.  Almost no razor burn on my neck and a pretty low amount of chafe.  Was impressed how it got the hairs right under my nostrils this time, due to my practice and the shape of the head.  After the shave, I had to go back to get about 3 hairs that didn&#x27;t make the cut (literally).  This again added 1-2 minutes of shave time.  I applied the usual amount of lotion and rinsed and dried the heads.  The weird thing was this time, for some reason due to the water when I opened the heads to clean it, there were almost no hairs inside.  Usually with a dry shave and 2-3 days of growth the heads get pretty full quickly.  But in this case there was none, and not many showed up in the sink or countertop either.  Weird, I guess the water had some strange effect where they either disintegrate into much smaller hairs and/or made them fly out somewhere I couldn&#x27;t see.  Either way I was done.  Still, I didn&#x27;t think this performance was quite up to my initial expectations, or the billing that Philips/Norelco gave it as their \\&quot;most advanced shaver\\&quot;.  But, it was \\&quot;close\\&quot; to a wet shave with a blade.  Maybe a 8 /10 this time.  However I didn&#x27;t like having to use a mirror the whole time still.  And for the price, especially since it&#x27;s described as waterproof shouldn&#x27;t you be able to take it in the shower for the ultimate convenience?  I dunno, I figure with a top-of-the-line shaver from this company, you should.    I didn&#x27;t bother with the cleaning / charging compartment since I didn&#x27;t know if I would keep the razor or return to the store, and didn&#x27;t want to learn something I wouldn&#x27;t need to know, nor use up any of the shaving fluid or dirty it up if I planned to return.  Just more hassle.  I really think it&#x27;s a little pointless to do this full cleaning process every time, maybe every few shaves but that&#x27;s just me.  Water works OK and the blades are billed as self-sharpening which means less worry and as long as you pat dry after the clean it should be OK.    The carrying case is the alternative charging mechanism, and you can take it with you on the go.  It also comes with a slide-on head cover if you&#x27;re just going to put the unit away say in a drawer until the next use and don&#x27;t need to charge it.  One problem, the plastic head cover that slides on doesn&#x27;t work with the travel / charging case.  Why they made it so this won&#x27;t fit, I don&#x27;t understand.  You&#x27;re prone to lose or break it I think if you can&#x27;t keep it inside, and why else would they give it to you if you can&#x27;t take it with you in the travel charging case?    My take is this shaver probably works best if you have a light or medium beard and you shave every 1-to-2 days.  Otherwise, stick to a blade and heavy shave gel if possible.    Strengths:  - Good overall shave and closeness, with patience  - Reasonably comfortable shave  - Flexible head, very unique design adds an extra dimension  - Strong trimmer for the size  - Very quick 1 hr. charging in either the cleaning unit or travel case  - Works with wet or dry skin (warning: not designed to work in shower or submerged)  - Good for people with light to medium beards that shave every day  - Self-sharpening heads  - Motor seems strong and good RPM  - Cleaning unit makes maintenance a bit easier and worry-free  - 2 year warranty  - 30 day money back guarantee / trial  - Made in Europe, not China    Weaknesses:  - Price / Value  - Too many passes to get all hairs &#x3D; longer shaving time  - Had to use a mirror entire time to get accurate shave  - Trimmer is absolutely tiny and I&#x27;m not sure how sturdy over time  - Plastic head cover doesn&#x27;t fit in travel charging case, or have a home when not in use  - Doesn&#x27;t cut sideways hairs near as well as advertised  - Charging and cleaning processes require more attention than desired  - Not good for people with very heavy beards who only want to shave every 3 or 4 days  - \\&quot;Clean shaver\\&quot; icon is not smart - it always appears even after rinsing heads under water  - Can&#x27;t use in shower  - Overall, just not quite as &#x27;advanced&#x27; as advertised    Time for me to bring this back and try another high-end shaver from another european-based company which should remain nameless.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Day.  Just opening the storage pod is difficult and putting it back in is almost impossible.  I was surprised that there was no place to put head protective cover.  Since you don&#x27;t us it while self cleaning and it doesn&#x27;t store in the pod it is sure to get lost.  My dad wanted something that was self cleaning because he has a tough time putting the older units together afterward.  I suspect that this shaver will just sit in a drawer regardless on how well it shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this.  Great Shaver....great cleaning system.  Performs as advertised.  However, he will keep his old Norelco for traveling.  New one would be bulky to travel with if he took the cleaning system with it.</li>
    <li> After an extended try out of more than a year, I have to conclude this is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever seen. Neither the shaver shaves, nor the cleaning system clean. This thing is so bad, that I don&#x27;t know how to dispose of it. I wouldn&#x27;t give it to anyone I know, I wouldn&#x27;t accept any money for it. It is shamefully bad.</li>
    <li> Still going after 6 years</li>
    <li> Pivoting heads broke after about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Junk now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco no longer makes sturdy shavers. Save your money; go somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s, Jim Belushi said, \\&quot;Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything\\&quot;. Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-29-07&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&amp;R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.

    <li> this beautiful electric razor never had a chance.  when opened christmas morning we tried to set up the razor on the charging station.  the place where it should sit was loose and when we pushed the razor into place on it, the razor sprung off onto the wooden floor and then one wheel flew into pieces.  it&#x27;s all plastic toy pieces!  I hate to think what would have happened if it had sprung onto a hard bathroom floor.  a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and have been told that it is the best shaver they have used.  It is easy to use and clean and now think that I will buy one for myself.  Great Product</li>
    <li> I was going to write a glowing followup review given that I just passed the 6th anniversary with this razor and no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I discovered why the Subscribe &amp; Save option stopped for this razor AND the Philips Norelco that I bought our son.  Philips stops making replacement heads, and IF they offer a different head that fits, it is much lower quality at double the price.  This is gouging their customer base, so my and my son&#x27;s first Philips Norelco shavers are our last.  We will be replacing both with another brand after research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay FAR AWAY from Norelco if you value your hard earned dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************Original Review*********************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for approximately 30 yrs.  The quality has been dropping over the past 15 yrs, and the last one I had was just plain junk.  I decided to try rotary this time around and after doing a lot of research, decided to go with the 1050CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial thoughts were that compared to the several Brauns, it felt and sounded like a toy.  It&#x27;s extremely light and the sound it makes while cutting beard hairs sounds like a kid&#x27;s toy shaver.  Not that this is anything of substance, just a little strange for this first time rotary user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a long, thin face with a large Adams apple so the rotary is a much better fit than the straight Brauns.  I took my time shaving the first 5-6 times to get used to the difference and it was worth the time invested.  I am on week 2 of shaving with this and have received only one nick and a much closer shave than the last two Brauns gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning action works well; leaving no hairs and dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very small and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of cutting power, so I decided to buy a separate mustache/sideburns trimmer.  To be fair, the trimmers of my last two Brauns were the first thing to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can think of to improve beyond the trimmer is to add battery monitoring to the charger.  It will continue to charge the batts to the point of killing them unless you unplug it.  It&#x27;s a small pain, but most owners won&#x27;t bother to read through the instructions to learn that they should keep the shaver constantly unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this shaver two thumbs up!to charge the batts to the point of killing them unless you unplug it.  It&#x27;s a small pain, but most owners won&#x27;t bother to read through the instructions to learn that they should keep the shaver constantly unplugged.    I give this shaver two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I like Norelco&#x27;s products. I bought this shaver and tried it for a couple of weeks and found it delivers a really harsh uncomfortable shave with lots of razor burn.</li>
    <li> My son has really liked this.  He has had it for over a year and still loves it.  He has a heavy beard and it works great for him</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s not my every day shaver, to be honest. I use it for a quick shave or when I need to travel and know I&#x27;ll have long days where I need to look as good in the evening as I do in the morning (considering what I have to work with, that is!) I still prefer a blade shaver for truly close shaves but this is also very good for use when I have less than 3 days of growth. Beyond that this won&#x27;t be very efficient. It&#x27;s worth it for me and I think you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
