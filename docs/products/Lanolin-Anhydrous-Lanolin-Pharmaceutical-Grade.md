<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I discovered Lanolin for my chapped lips a couple years ago after trying pretty much everything under the sun (including prescriptions) after suffering with chronic dry, peeling and cracked lips (and the area around) for years and years. I started out using the brand marketed for breastfeeding but after discovering this brand I haven&#x27;t looked back. I love the quality, consistency and the customer service of the company was fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great for making your own moustache wax !</li>
    <li> A good quality lanolin  without odor. Not as thick and gooey as the lesser quality lanolin s.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My lips have been dry and kept peeling for months. I tried vaseline, olive oil, honey and many brands of lip balms, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I searched around and found this product. At first I was debating getting it, but now I&#x27;m so glad that I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected the texture of this product would be like vaseline. But it&#x27;s actually much much thicker. It&#x27;s like wax. The first layer is extremely thick and sticky. It was hard to get it out and apply on the lips. However, the more I use it, I feel like it kinda melts down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lanolin for a few months, and I absolutely love it!  My hands and cuticles get very dry in the winter, and this has made a noticeable difference.  I also have dry lips and I like to slather some on my hands and lips every morning and every night.  I feel that it has helped reduce the overall dryness.  My daughter has started using it and she really liked it, as well.  In fact, I need to order some more for her.</li>
    <li> This stuff has worked miraculously on my dry, cracked heels! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with product. Delivered when promised. Will definitely do business again.</li>
    <li> I would buy again works great .</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of another for conditioning my handlebar moustache. You need just a tiny bit, like equal to a drop of water. Works great, but it isn&#x27;t meant for shaping or styling. Enriches the natural color of your hair, tames it a bit. Be sure to wipe out the excess with a paper towel. Was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, dry lips, dry pretty much everything.  The average humidity where I live sits right around  20% with about 8 inches of rain fall yearly.  It is never a moist heat just very dry and very hot.&lt;br /&gt;I am a rock climber, mountain biker, hiker, and horse back rider.  With all the outdoor activity I do my skin is very dry.  I was most concerned about my lips and my nose.  I had bloody noses all the time, and my lips were in a constant state of cracking and healing.  I have dealt with these problems since I was about 9 years old.  I went to my doctor and he gave me some to put on my lip since it was bleeding during a routine skin cancer screening.  It was amazing.  For over a week my lip didn&#x27;t even crack.&lt;br /&gt;I have used ever kind of chapstick under the sun, never finding something that worked.  I ordered this days after the first use.  I have used it now for a couple of months and will never go without having some of this around.  I have taken old lip gloss tins and put the lanolin in them so that it will fit in my pocket while I am out doing activities in the sun, or in classes.  I would strongly suggest this to anyone who has suffered from dry skin anywhere on there body.  I even got rid of my bloody noses by putting a little of this inside my nose after saline rinsing once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that I never heard about this before, it is truly a miracle in my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for really rough, tough calloused feet!</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s the best thing she&#x27;s ever put on her lips... should I be worried?&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though... fast shipping, amazing quality, awesome customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future to keep my Mrs&#x27; lips happy ;)</li>
    <li> Great for cracked skin. Using this on cracked heels in the Winter and use it for the eczema on my husband&#x27;s hands that he has had since he was a child. Works great. Moisturizing and healing.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, great price. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> The shipping was super quick and product was just as described--it did not have too much of an odor, either. This product was recommended for preventing heat rash, which is why I chose it. My only real complaint is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to apply--super sticky and very difficult to rub on skin. But I don&#x27;t really know what lanolin is supposed to be like, so my input must be taken with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> I made a salve for my tired muscles.  Used some aromotherapy oils with it.  My  muscles feel so much better.  so easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff as a follow-up to a piece of advice from another musician, and it&#x27;s true. Anhydrous lanolin is the worlds best cork and slide grease! It is far superior to any product that&#x27;s actually made for that purpose. You apply very little, tuning slides glide as never before, and they continue to for months. Literally! Clarinets go together and come apart more easily than ever before. Other than that, it&#x27;s just an average product.</li>
    <li> This, I used as nipple cream while breastfeeding. This is much better then other creams I have tried. Including the more popular brands.</li>
    <li> I ordered a container of lanolin from Koru Naturals.  They sent it out immediately, and I greatly like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With study and experience, it turns out that lanolin is a natural healant, with a little pain deadening thrown in.  It is a wax rather than a grease, and it pretty waterproof.  It has greatly helped some problems with my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, trying to buy it is very difficult.  Only Rite Aid pharmacy has it locally (Denver, CO area), and then only in a formulation for nursing mothers.  (There may be some available in a medical supply store away from my location, however).  Their tube was $12 for a 1.4 oz that was heavily processed.  Koru sold a container of 2 oz for $11.89 with shipping.  It is unadultrated, pure lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the highest recommendation for Koru and their product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Hard to fine lanolin of this high quality.</li>
    <li> I discovered lanolin many years ago after surgery on my lip to remove a mole left my lips feeling tight and dry all the time. I had been using, in recent years, a brand advertised for nursing mothers but they \\&quot;improved\\&quot; their product to where it now seems very much thinner and less effective, doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all. So I was looking for a brand that was maybe truer to the native product, maybe less ultra refined... I didn&#x27;t know. I just needed something thick and \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; that would really adhere for a long time and do the job. Of course, over the years I began using lanolin as well for my hands and in general ANY scrape or wound or other skin problem that came up. I was very surprised to discover its pain killing qualities. I did not understand why pure lanolin would be a pain killer for a cut or wound (still don&#x27;t) but it is absolutely essential for paper cuts, hangnails, sore cuticles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway recently I searched the web and ordered 4 different brands of \\&quot;pure\\&quot; lanolin, that was all I could find, except for the brand I was abandoning. I wanted only anhydrous lanolin - no water added.  So I have tested them all and must say Naturals New Zealand came out on top for the qualities I need. All do the job of moisturizing well. But I need something that will stay on awhile. Before my old brand changed their formula, I could apply it to my lips in the morning, then brush my teeth and eat and drink coffee, and it would still be there, not greasy but I could feel the softening of my lips (under my lipstick). I would only apply it maybe one other time later in the day. Same for my hands - plus it would seem to dry on my hands, to the point where they were not greasy. I could do normal stuff without greasing up everything I touched and even use water and some detergents to a certain extent, and my hands were at least some protected. I was also prone to those bleeding, painful cracks on my fingertips, before starting to use lanolin. Never had them since. But this New Zealand brand fills the bill on all counts for me, it stays on better (though not quite like the old brand), does an amazing softening/hydrating job anywhere I use it, and it has no odor that I can detect, either. It also helps my decision to use it, that it is pharmaceutical grade, since I am using it on my lips; however that isn&#x27;t that critical to me since I don&#x27;t eat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was swift. I am very satisfied with this product and relieved that I have found something I can depend on now that I am so dependent on the use of lanolin. I don&#x27;t bother buying any other lotions or moisturizers at all, not for many years. Heaven knows how much money I&#x27;ve saved over the years. Lately I am also experimenting with a hint from another review, too, and that is rubbing just the slightest coating of lanolin through my hair for shine and conditioning purposes. So far I probably haven&#x27;t used enough to make much of a difference, but it seems we all overwash and over-chemical our hair these days (ladies) so I am sure a touch of this natural hair conditioning element must be a good thing. It is simply leaving out the middlemen - all the unwanted chemicals we normally get with conditioners and other hair products. I personally use nothing but baby shampoo on my hair but I do use more hair spray than I really like because I need the hold power. The lanolin does seem to somewhat counteract the superglue effects of the spray, so far in my experiment. But I am running my hands through my hair after the lanolin has already dried on my hands. I am not globbing it on from the jar. The next step I suppose will be to apply just a tad more when my hair is wet after a shampoo. I know it won&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior citizen and I do have wonderful skin, always have. I credit my father&#x27;s genes for this more than anything.  The ladies on his side of the family had incredible skin, as did he, up through their 80&#x27;s - NO WRINKLES AT ALL! But you can&#x27;t discount thebenefits of using lanolin all these many decades, as I have, and especially for my hands. The skin on my hands is babysoft and smooth.  And I have never been one to overprotect them with gloves as I probably should have. But without the lanolin I am sure they would be the hands of a 100 year old cotton picker by now. It is simply a product that can&#x27;t be improved upon in my opinion, by adding chemicals, or watering it down. There is just nothing that is anything like it that you can buy at any price. And this brand is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Hands very smooth</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to love it, but I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t take long!!! 2 days &amp; I can&#x27;t put it down!!!</li>
    <li> This lanolin gave my newborn baby a rash around her mouth.  Medela tender care is the way to go if you&#x27;re breastfeeding.  I&#x27;m sure this lanolin is great for other things - just have to find them and then I&#x27;ll pby change my review rating.</li>
    <li> NATURALS NEW ZEALAND ANHYDROUS LANOLIN: It&#x27;s so hard to find a good, simple, natural product to use for dry cuticles, elbows, feet, etc. I love pure lanolin for all these and it&#x27;s wonderful for children&#x27;s skinned knees to help reduce scarring. I put a very little bit on my finger to let it warm up from my body warmth and then lightly touch each area where I want to apply it. I then gently rub it in until it is has been absorbed. I usually do this just before going to bed at night so it has time to do its thing. Just don&#x27;t expect to polish you nails immediatly after using it for dry cuticles. I can&#x27;t find anhydrous lanolin in the drug stores anymore and was so glad to find it available from Naturals New Zealand through Amazon. The price is a little high but the product is well worth it. I received it very quickly and the packaging was great.</li>
    <li> Lanolin is great stuff. It really works, and (for me) doesn&#x27;t cause any allergies.  Great for dry hands, skin, lips, scars, wrinkles and hair...  In addition, it can be applied to leather and wool as moisturizer and waterproofing,  it can polish your furniture and it is an excellent anti-corrosion grease...  Got this very fast in the mail, in a very neat package. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t using Lanolin on your lips to solve dry, cracked, chapped lips, you are doing it wrong.  Use this everywhere!</li>
    <li> perfect for what i need it for.</li>
    <li> It works! This is something you use daily or keep in your medicine chest for future use. Seller is very open with being contacted at any time, includes info with order. The web site is amazing and easily understood for info or ordering.  personally I love this product, the uses are so many for body, hair, home uses, shoes, etc...  I like the fresh natural scent, being a pure, highest quality grade, natural made product from organic farming/ranching of sheeps wool. I buy this product knowing all the importance of the what&#x27;s and why&#x27;s and will buy again from this knowledge.  I like the ease of application, it melts so readily and soaks in imediately, it is luxury! My cracked to the flesh hands heal quickly my nails look better, the cracked heels soak it in and regain softness look decent just as when applied to my winterized high desert lizard lips. my hair is shiny, strong, with no static, curls gently with radiance of natural color high lighted. my boots are gently cleaned, perserved and buffed to a slight shine from the lanolin, a little goes a long ways for all jobs. It works very well for my needs.  It was packaged carefully, then wrapped, boxed and shipped in a timely matter. Also was a hand written note besides the packing slip.  I know this must sound too Pollyanna, but hey... YOU try it for yourself and see the truth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lanolin for almost one month and it has been working beautifully.  It even keeps my hands moisturized between washes.  I opted for the pharmaceutical grade quality since I was worried about possible chemical contaminants which might cause my skin undue irritation or harm.     I have very sensitive, very dry and eczema prone skin and I have sensitivity to most cosmetic brands.  I have therefore been relying primarily on pure unrefined shea butter to keep my skin moisturized however I was still not completely satisfied since I have to keep re-applying the shea butter throughout the day to keep my hands, especially my knuckles, properly moisturized.    I like my products to have multi-purposes uses so I have also been using it:  i) on my bikini and underarm areas (in conjunction with aloe vera gel &amp; castor oil) after epilating to prevent/reduce ingrown hairs;   ii) as a night time facial cream (in conjunction with non-comedogenic neem seed oil &amp; shea butter);   iii) as a lip balm to prevent dry chapped lips    CON:  It is a very sticky wax so a lanolin cream would probably be more suitable if you wish to use it over large areas of skin.</li>
    <li> Needs warming to get onto your fingers.  I have used this on lips, hands, and feet.  This stuff softens skin like you would never believe. This tiny can will likely last me another year or two even though I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT as a lip balm, and on Type 4a/4b hair ends (to help minimize splits/knots). I will buy again..</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Saving feet and leather goods.</li>
    <li> Really like this lanolin product.  It heals my lips better than Chapstick without being as &amp;#34; medicinal&amp;#34; as the really in depth healing balms.  I like the stronger balms, I just don&#x27;t always need healing and this works really well as protection for lips, around eyes etc.  is absorbe quickly instead of just sitting on the surface.</li>
    <li> Im not sure its for lips but its the only thing that really stays on very dry chapped lips. Seems to penetrate a little more than other lip products Ive usee. It keeps the coating through my workouts too.  Great on dry heels and cuticles.  Dont need much.. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Up side.  Lanolin smooths skin  far better than the expensive natural \\&quot;body butters\\&quot;.  Down side.  It still \\&quot;smells like a wet sheep\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice now, and both times from this vender.  I received the product quickly, and it was carefully packed.  The product is amazing.  I live in a dry climate, and I work with lots of mail and paper.  This is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin from drying and cracking.  I bought some for my coworker, and she loves it too.  It only takes a small amount, once per day, so this tub will last a long time.  The last one I got lasted about a year.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works great for my elders&#x27; dry skin patches.</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips and I love. I was using Dr lipp brand and found it to be very overpriced. This is less expensive and seems more pure and of higher quality. It is thicker and stickier than Dr lipp. Especially straight on dry lips. This sticky feeling drives me nuts personally. At night I just spread a thin layer of lip balm (usually clinique or eos) on first. Then I put on a layer of this to seal it in. I put it a little over my lip line too. I wake up and my lips are plumped and hydrated and smooth. And a little littttle bit goes a long way. Its unscented and the natural smell of it is really mild and inoffensive as well.</li>
    <li> In the winter, as I have aged, the skin on my heels just won&#x27;t stay hydrated , and will split and crack and can be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have tried many creams- and a few were sort of OK - but none really worked well enough to buy again- or keep my heels from cracking. Nothing seemed to have results that even lasted 24 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read a couple of these recommendations for the Australian Golden Lanolin, and figured I try it ( it&#x27;s very affordable and has no odor ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow - It delivered right away.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty greasy, so a little bit goes a long way.  I have to put socks on for at least a half hour after I rub it into my feet though, as that&#x27;s about how long it takes to penetrate ( and I don&#x27;t want to stain my couch by putting my feet up too soon.. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as an extra bonus, it&#x27;s really done wonders for my hands by just doing my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for dry cracked feet!.</li>
    <li> After researching many moisturizers/creams/gels, etc., I read the reviews on this product. It has exceptional - yes, sticky and thick, but you won&#x27;t be sorry, I often mix it with my ponds moisturizer for my face and chest and use it straight for hands and feet.  People are always telling I have great skin...really believe this product is a good investment. Great seller, quick delivery and special offers for multiple purchases. Worth the investment</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and sticky.  I applied it for a at least a week hoping to soften my skin ,  but the results were almost unnoticeable. I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use anhydrous lanolin for mixing into creams and lotions.  I use all natural/organic ingredients in my creams, and this one works great.  It can be used on its own, but it&#x27;s unscented, so not everyone may like the way it smells (like a sheep :)). But it is an EXCELLENT ingredient for a body creme.  Just add some base and essential oils, whip it all up and you have a wonderfully rich creme.  The seller is very quick to ship the product and takes great care in packaging.  Great vendor and great product!</li>
    <li> Lanolin lotion from Natural New Zealand has kept all the rough spots on my skin incredibly soft. During winter my elbows always start to get rough but a little bit of this stuff every night does the trick.</li>
    <li> Looked high and low for pure lanolin here in Anchorage to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100% lanolin is smooth and free of odors or colors feels great on the dry chapped skin of an Alaskan winter and the excema of allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold, will definitely be ordering again when supply gets low.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for dry skin and cuts.  The skin on my hands often crack and bleed when the weather is cold and I have had my hands in water a lot. This oilment is great for putting on a cut or on dry hands or lips. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how quickly this arrived!! I ordered it about a day ago and it&#x27;s already here. My boyfriend&#x27;s hands are cracked, we have tried everything, and this was our last ditch effort. After one application his hands are already feeling and looking a lot better! A little bit sticky but honestly... we have tried everything, so a little sticky is nothing we can&#x27;t deal with.</li>
    <li> This products is wonderful - there are a few drawbacks...  1) product is EXTREMELY sticky, it DOES NOT wash off! As a matter of fact, it makes your skin 100% waterproof! I use this on my feet only, and apply it using a rubber glove. When I take my socks off in the morning my feet feel fabulous!  I would recommend this product to anyone with severely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I expected.  Kept my feet, elbows and knees soft</li>
    <li> Nothing else worked on my -yr old&#x27;s heat rashes. Every other lotion/cream/ aquaphor just made it worse. This worked like a charm. Sticky to apply, but rub it between fingers and then apply only a little. Rashes cleared up in a day and gone in two days. Love that its pharmaceutical grade, i.e. no pollutants.I am buying the 4-pack now.</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles for just about any skin issue.  I can;&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It helped remove Granulomas and repair viral skin damage.</li>
    <li> I love to cook and hands can get rough even sore. This stuff works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many hand lotions from bargain to the most expensive. I bought LIQUID LANOLIN from Home Health. It was advertized as nothing added, yet there is a warning not to apply to broken skin or rashes and do not use on children or animals. Something lost in the refining process. It is not as healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not allergic to lanolin I think you will love this pharmaceutical grade product. I keep it in every room.</li>
    <li> Koru Naturals 100% Pure Australian Anhydrous Lanolin Pharmaceutical Grade is excellent.  My fingers were cracked from the work I do, after a few days of using the Lanolin my hands healed and felt great.  An excellent product from  Koru Naturals.  Also, great on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Used a little bit of this for my face cream recipe. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, and buy in bulk to give to friends. It is very thick and I use it on my heels in the winter and cover with socks. I apply every time I shower on heels, elbows and hands. It has a thick ,sticky consistency but will soften with body heat.I really like it. Shipping is great, packaging too.</li>
    <li> This product works great for dry skin and heat rashes. Product came quick. I would recommend to anyone having skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for my lips, and they have stayed soft and supple even in - zero weather. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crazy thick this stuff, you really need warm hands to get it to spread, but if you apply it to any dry spots in a few days they are gone.  I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I had never purchased lanolin before and I was very satisfied with this product and the quality. Although I had never experienced purchasing lanolin before, I am an herbologist and the product is great quality and size for my need at the time.</li>
    <li> My husband has terrible eczema on his hands and feet.  This product really seems to calm it down.  There is no strong odor. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Super thick, no perfume, dyes or chemicals...only pure, clean, unscented (nearly odorless) high quality lanolin. I use it on my cuticles nightly; a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s very nourishing and I plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> An excellent and high quality product. I use this in lotions and creams I make and I find the quality excellent.</li>
    <li> This is working great under the mummy wraps of ace bandage to promote healing from a repeated mange attack on my person. The  Hot but not scalding spoon trick over the gas stove burner is extending the duration of this product nicely.</li>
    <li> I get cracks in my hands and feet and this stuff really works in solving it.  It is virtually scent free and rubs in well.</li>
    <li> This was a very nice product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Good Product, it did help clear some of the cracks in my mother&#x27;s skin. Great seller&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it as my fingers crack!</li>
    <li> I have chronic dry lips and this is the only thing that works! Great stuff :)&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes in a pot as trying to get it out of a tube on a cold day is impossible.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for everything to do with my homemade skincare products! I will be buying this item again when I run out!:)</li>
    <li> This product is thicker that I had wanted, but I&#x27;ve adjusted and now use it before I go to bed. I can tell a difference in my skin. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> i use this nightly as lip balm and on my cuticles and rough elbows and it keeps them feeling soft and unchapped. Yes, it&#x27;s thick and sticky and smells like lanolin, but it WORKS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a musician, and use it on the skins of my congas, as well as on my own skin (dry feet) here in the desert of SoCal with its low humidity, it works wonders ! Like it better than bag balm !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice departure from using hydro-cortisone cream. This won&#x27;t thin the skin which is an extra bonus. Worth the change.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a relative who has suffered from extremely badly chapped hands during the Winter. This lanolin is the only remedy he has found which brings him relief. He was delighted to receive it.</li>
    <li> Really good. Cracked skin on fingertips- gone. Hockey player.</li>
    <li> Not only was this perfectly natural, exactly as advertised, even the shipping peanuts were biodegradable.  I bought this to make my own salves with essential oils.  This will serve the purpose, perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Sticky but I blend it with lotion and lather it on.  So far it is the only thing that has worked relieving the cracks in my fingers during the winter months.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product. She doesn&#x27;t like dry lips and this product doesn&#x27;t take much to keep them moist. She is very happy to have discovered this product and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected and arrived in good condition. It was packed securely to keep the plastic container from getting cracked/smashed. In addition, it arrived earlier than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and the skin splits around my finger nails and is painful. This is the only product that heals it within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also used it on a split lip that wouldn&#x27;t heal for weeks and within 2 days the split in his lip healed!&lt;br /&gt;We will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for anhydrous lanolin for quite a long time. Also, I wanted it to be a natural product, with no other oils or chemicals blended in. I came across the Australian Golden Lanolin, and knew it was what I had been looking for. When it arrived, It was exactly what I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery service was quick, and efficient. There were no hiccups.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in lanolin.</li>
    <li> Sticky but otherwise great</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have tried dozens of products for dry, brittle, lifting fingernails AND heel cracking.  Have applied this Australian Golden Lanolin twice daily to my nails and heels and see noticeable improvement in just one week.  Pleasant, mild scent.  Absorbs quickly.  No greasy residue.  I will definitely be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> Whenever the seasons change, my lips degrade to a chapped, painful, gross mess. It&#x27;s awful, and after trying at least a dozen brands, this is the stuff that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not for mild suffers of chapped skin. If you have chapped hands, a moisturizing lotion will do, and if you have chapped lips, a decent lip balm will suffice. But when your skin is cracking regularly, you have to get something like lanolin that lays on thick, is anhydrous, and won&#x27;t tempt you to lick it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, I usually just dip my pinky and apply a thin layer so I expect this container will easily last a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need relief and have tried everything else, give this a go.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 7/01/09 and I received it 7/02/09. This is the Best transaction I have ever had. I always use lanolin on my hands and cuticles, and this is a great product. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and very sticky, but I use it overnight with a covering on really tough patches.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better for chapped or dry lips.  Only a very thin coat is needed to protect lips for several hours.  Unlike lip balm it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly. This lanolin has no odor and is nice and thick.  My only problem is that when my hair blows into my face it sticks to the lanolin!</li>
    <li> it is very goos for hand and feet. Deeply moisturizes. Only drawback is that its a little sticky. But works.</li>
    <li> Cracked winter hands a thing of the past! Not just for winter anymore - using a little at bedtime all year. Very good stuff!</li>
    <li> My immune system was overactive as a result of an allergic reaction to antibiotics and resin in a hydrocolloid adhesive pad. As a result of the reaction, my skin would swell, and become dry and die. I needed something to moisturize my skin during the dry process. Olive oil, coconut oil, everything seemed to make my skin angrier, bumpy and itchy. My naturopathic doctor told me she had a friend growing up who used lanolin to help her eczema. I decided to buy this product and give it a try. It works great!!! No reaction to it!!! The lanolin in room temperature has the consistency of a very thick vasoline and it can feel very thick if you use too much. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I just poke  my finger into the lanolin to get some on my fingertip, then I do quick dabs in different spots all over my dry skin and then rub it in. If you get the lanolin in a semi-hot temp, it is not as thick, so be careful because it will slide out!</li>
    <li> Bought this to condition my son&#x27;s baseball gloves.  This product is amazing and it keeps the leather soft and in great condition.  I minimally used this as a lotion but it works fine, though it has a distinct odor.  The good news is that this goes away in a short period of time after using.  This product is reasonably priced and I highly recommend to keep baseball glove in top shape.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make a cuticle cream I found online, prior to making it I started putting a little on my dry dry hands.  it&#x27;s sticky but melts quickly with your body heat and rubs in well.  It locks in moisture that&#x27;s in my skin and makes a difference right away!  I made the cream using moisturizing oils and everyone LOVES it.  The next one will have more lanolin in it so I can have added protection through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has a dry spot on her hand that has been there years, less than a month later it is almost gone!  She has tried everything to get rid of the dry patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> I want a big ol&#x27; tub of this to bathe in !!! It&#x27;s so smooth on the skin and not sticky at all. It is also unscented which is great for my lung ailments. So luscious. I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my feet , i ended up using it in my lips, hands it really provides a sense of relief to the skin,,,a little con is that the container is a little too small for the price,,still a good product</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT AND SO IS THE SERVICE.  THANK YOU.  NEE EAGLE</li>
    <li> My husband has extremely bad cracked feet, after trying just about every over the counter and prescription product, a friend suggested pure lanolin. I opted for this procudt because it has no additives (spring water, creams, etc) to dilute it. He&#x27;s been using it about 2 weeks now and there is a significant difference. There was an improvement even after the first night.  As far as shipping I ordered it on Wednesday and it arrived on Friday, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sticky and difficult to apply</li>
    <li> Used in my homemade skin products wonderful for my needs.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!  I use lanolin as lip balm and had been using a much more expensive product when I found this-- figured it was worth a shot for the money I&#x27;m saving...so glad I took the chance!!!!  Will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> Use this at night and wake up with soft, younger looking and feeling hands!  I also use it under my eyes, very sparingly!</li>
    <li> Pure and simple.  I have used pure lanolin for 30 years as a night cream for my lips.  This is an outstanding product, delivered speedily.</li>
    <li> In winter time, using shea butter is not enough, so I use it after shea butter, it keep my face moisture and soft 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 30 yet, and I have had &amp;#34;problem skin&amp;#34; (allergic to a LOT of chemicals, hives, break-outs, too dry, too oily) my whole life. I can use this on every part of my body (including my face), with no problem. Just a few minutes for a thin layer to absorb, and it makes the perfect primer for my powder foundation (I use bare minerals matte.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I had with lanolin before was a a slight &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell, but this is so pure it has no smell. I like knowing it comes from &amp;#34;happy sheep.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this product! Can use in so many ways: I use it on cuts, for cold sores, and to keep nostrils from getting too dry in the cold... I used to get nosebleeds very often, my nose was burning when it got too cold. With this product, it feels MUCH better. No smell, too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product a couple of days, so I cannot claim it has resolved all my skin issues yet, but I am feeling very optimistic that it will work.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s easy to work with. It&#x27;s pleasant, with no annoying odors. Actually and thankfully No Odors.  Therefore I do not mind using it a few times a day so as to get the best benefit from it. My fingers and face have suffered from chemo and radiation. So far after a couple of days my fingers don&#x27;t seem as chapped. My face was damaged extensively from radiation. It will take longer but I am starting to see some improvement all ready.&lt;br /&gt;  This Anhydrous Lanolin is packaged nicely. Has a good texture. Softens easily with just rubbing it a bit with my fingers. I am very happy with it. The best part, No Odors. I am sensitive and allergic to scents and fragrances/odors. I can happily say this lanolin has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;  It is a generous amount and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Quality stuff expensive but worth it. Make my own face cremes and lip emollient and this lanolin is super. And there is no sheep smell to this lanolin.</li>
    <li> This was thick and hard to apply . A bit sticky for my taste. Good for skin but application not easy</li>
    <li> While this may be a good product, I did not care for the way it is very hard to rub onto your arms.  Feels like pulling hairs off arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby and I thought about warming product up a little (to \\&quot;melt\\&quot;) and then rub onto arms.  I probably would not purchase this again.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Delivery was timely and product is perfect.</li>
    <li> Item described on time.  Good packaging.  Nice product.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> I get very chapped hands and lips in winter so I bought several lanolin ointments at my local drug store. All of the brands are not created equal so I decided to compare three versions of lanolin ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australian Golden Lanolin \\&quot;****\\&quot; (4 stars); This is a pharmaceutical grade ointment and was in the middle price range per ounce.  It is a thick tan paste with a moderate smell.  I like that it is in a wide-mouth jar and easy to scoop out.  I put it on my hands, let it sit a few minutes, then wipe it off with a wash cloth.  It stops the chapping overnight.  I like it, but the smell is such, that I don&#x27;t put it on my lips or use it around other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000I1OYNK Now Foods Lanolin Pure, 7-Ounce]] \\&quot;*\\&quot; (one star); This is the only ointment I bought that wasn&#x27;t listed as pharmaceutical grade and it was the cheapest per ounce.  It is a thick yellow paste that certainly looks like 100% lanolin but smells so bad, I simply can&#x27;t use it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000BUQO6S Lansinoh® HPA® Lanolin 2oz]] \\&quot;****\\&quot; (4 stars); This is a pharmaceutical grade ointment and the most expensive per ounce of the three types I bought.  It is a stiff paste in a squeeze tube.  I can detect almost no odor or taste from it.  It can be hard to squeeze out of the tube and is so thick, you have to warm it up in your hands for a few seconds before applying.  I apply it to my lips, let it sit a minute, then wipe it off with a washcloth.  It also works on my hands.  I can believe it would work well for breast feeding.  To solve the problem of squeezing it out of the tube, I cut a little flap in the tube and scoop out what I need.  Because it&#x27;s so thick, it doesn&#x27;t ooze out of the flap.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is somewhat pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY -&lt;br /&gt;Australian Golden Lanolin:  Easy to use, works wonderfully for chapped hands, not a bad price, a bit smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NOW ointment:  Relatively inexpensive but I can&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lansinoh:  Very useful, works wonderfully for chapped skin or lips, no obvious smell or taste, a bit hard to use, pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFHful, works wonderfully for chapped skin or lips, no obvious smell or taste, a bit hard to use, pricey.    Recommended!    CFH</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in making a salve using essential oils.  I am glad to find this pure, pharmaceutical grade product.</li>
    <li> I like this cream but I did expect more based on reading the other reviews.  Nice product and I continue to use it but its not a miracle cream, but I would describe it as a very good cream and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> As preface, folks today have largely forgotten the magical qualities of pure lanolin. I hope that after reading  this readers not familiar with lanolin will give it a try. When I first opened the jar of this product, I found the hardness offputting.  Then it occurred to me to soften it in the microwave before using it. Now, each time I want to use it, I first soften it in the microwave. Then it is applied liberally to my elbows,  which I then cover with a wrap of saran wrap. This, in turn, is covered with an athletic sock which has been cut off at the toe end. I pull the sock up to cover the saran wrap. Overnight my elbows are like baby skin. I do the same with my heels except that, of course, I don&#x27;t cut up the sock.</li>
    <li> This product arrived incredibly promptly, and is exactly as described. It&#x27;s odorless and a bit stiff at room temperature, but warms up quickly. I use it on my lips overnight in dry winter weather, and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews, but I was so happy with this product, I felt compelled. I&#x27;d been looking for a natural lip balm, and this is, hands down, the most wonderful stuff I&#x27;ve found. A fantastic value, as a little goes a long way, and the highest quality. It&#x27;s the most nourishing-feeling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my lips, and it lasts for hours. No weird chemicals or drying agents, no fragrances, just pure awesome moisturizer. I bought it specifically for my lips (as they tend to get very chapped), but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it on dry skin anywhere. Plus, it arrived BEFORE the estimated delivery date. I will absolutely be using lanolin on my lips from now on--and I plan to continue buying it from this company.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast, and the lanolin is just as described. No scent other than a mild clean smell, and it is thick-the consistency of toothpaste.  It is absorbed quickly and leaves the skin soft and helps create a barrier. Perfect for chapped or rough skin or for diaper issues.  I am very happy with my purchase and happy to support a family business, will reorder but expect the jar to last a long time.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Quite thick.  No &#x27;sheepy&#x27; smell.  Works well on dry hands.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is very moisturizing. It is also VERY STICKY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Lipp regularly and thought this would be similar in essence. It kind of is, but its somehow thicker and stickier, which makes it tough to apply to lips/hand/body/whatever. If you can manage to get it on your hands, it moisturizes great.</li>
    <li> just what it says on the can</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff since the purple tube changed its formula and made theirs softer... This stuff stays on and u dont have to keep reapplying to ur lips and it keeps them soft.... Luv luv luv this stuff! I do have to admit when i needed it for breast feeding i did want it softer but not for lips.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Would not be without it!  Very satisfying to the skin.  Thick and imperious. Stays on and gives relief to any dry areas</li>
    <li> It helped a lot!  My skin feels so much better after using this product! I would recommend it to others,</li>
    <li> I used on my mustache while waiting for another tin of wax. You cannot expect this to give you any sort of hold whatsoever.  That is not its purpose.  All this does is condition your mustache and give it a more natural look (whatever your mustache would have done normally).</li>
    <li> I do not give five star rating often but this product has earned it! The skin on my hands were deteriorating quickly due to the frequent, if not insane, amount of alcohol-based hand sanitizer we use each shift. Employee Health did not offer me much hope because I was already doing everything they suggested - frequent moisturizing before and after each shift and especially on my days off, avoiding harsh soaps, avoiding hot water, etc.. The irritation continued despite my best efforts and use of lotions, oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lanolin started healing the damage almost immediately. Initially I had to keep my hands covered in lanolin but that was not necessary after a few days. Skin healed and by the next shift four days later, there was a significant decrease in discomfort from the hand sanitizer. Lanolin is also compatible with nitrile gloves, another plus since petroleum-based lotions are not. Three weeks later, the deep fissures and thin spots have healed and the permanent fine-line wrinkles are slowly starting to smooth out ... never thought this damage was reversible but there is hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have learned I can apply a small amount of essential oils or coconut oil to my hands at home in addition to the lanolin to make it less tacky. Am applying it 2-3 times a day with excellent ongoing results despite the tacky, non-greasy consistency that pure lanolin characteristically has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand also works for careworn feet that suffer from these 12 shifts - the painful heel cracks and persistent callouses have all healed within 4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product. In the past it took months to get those cracks to heal and I&#x27;ve been treating the callouses for months with minimal relief until now.</li>
    <li> Tacky is a good way to describe it, but I love this stuff so much. Worth every penny, makes my skin feel so good</li>
    <li> I use this product instead of using a chap stick.  It is moist and less addictive.  The only drawback is that my dog loves eating  this product too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lanolin with hesitation because of using another lanolin product by a different company. The other lanolin product had a terrible smell, but this lanolin is smell free  and goes on wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Its probably the best lip protectant/repair product I have ever used. Its amazing for people who get windblown/chapped skin from cold temps and/or high winds. Perhaps the very best use though is as a diaper cream for diaper rash. I had NO desire to use desitin on my child&#x27;s rear end, and wanted something naturally water repellant, safe, non-toxic, and healing. Lanolin does all of this. My infant was very sensitive to chemicals (even the sensitive wipes would cause rashing), and so we started using a spritz of witch hazel cut with water to rinse him, and applied a bit of lanolin on the diaper rash and viola (!) the rash was gone within 24 hrs. The lanolin is great on minor cuts and scars to improve healing as well.&lt;br /&gt;Another great use is to waterproof woolen things: like wool diaper covers, felted wool hats, felted wool jackets, and leather items too. There are a lot of tutorials online for how to waterproof wool clothes by lanolin. However, only try to waterproof 100% wool items (not blends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, holds moisture extremely well. Not sure what all the complaints are about its smell - I love that there isn&#x27;t any perfume - it&#x27;s a very natural smell, subtle and not at all overwhelming or barnyardy. My boyfriend actually loves it. I am bummed only b/c I must not have read the reviews well enough. I bought this to rub on my preggo belly (to prevent stretch marks) but I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so STICKY. Not good for anything other than small areas like chapped heels or feet. Great for lips!</li>
    <li> Very good quality lanolin! Used it for one of the ingredients for my mustache wax.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Keep my feet and lips soft all the time &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Perfect for my chapped winter lips and cuticles.  Love this stuff....best thing ever.</li>
    <li> I have picked my chronically dry lips my whole life. This is the first product that has broken that habit. My lips are hydrated and smooth, and the stuff stays on for hours. It works wonderfully for elbows, nails, feet as well. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a magic! Works so well with trouble skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an active trumpet player and I use this product on the non-throw slides of my vintage trumpets.  Because this stuff is stiff AND slick, it makes an ideal slide grease for tuning slides on brass instruments. Several of my trumpets are 70-90 years old and the diameter of the tubing has been reduced due to decades of cleaning and polishing. This product has 2 advantages for this application.  It is quite tacky and will help \\&quot;seal\\&quot; worn tubes.  It stays put and won&#x27;t creep even when warm.  Nothing is more frustrating that to have a slide start to creep out of your horn during a performance making your instrument flat in pitch.  Especially the 3rd crook slide if you&#x27;re in the lower register and find yourself throwing that slide out a lot.  This product is ultra pure and is virtually odorless and is a cheap alternative to having your slide tubing swedged by a repair person.  I trust it on my vintage Bronx Bach, Old Recording and early Benges.  I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for softening skin, so I smear it on my slides AND my lips.  Excellent packaging and fast delivery. BEAUTY!!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty for sure......Lanolin, Anhydrous Lanolin Pharmaceutical Grade...A cross between crisco and vaseline. My son and his wife are type one diabetic so they really suffer from dry skin!~</li>
    <li> This was the most expensive Lanolin that I purchased.  Also, it is the highest quality.  It has a better consistency than the other lanolin products I tried.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my lips and other sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used Lanolin before and haven&#x27;t since this product. Given this, I am not sure if all Lanolin is as sticky as this was. It was difficult to scope out of the jar and very thing stuck to where ever I placed the product. It is almost the texture of raw honey with a bit of gel mixed in.That said, it was very effective as an occlusive (barrier creater) and moisturizes through preventing water loss in the skin barrier (a process called TEWL). With that, I&#x27;d recommend someone use an humectant  like glycerin as a prep layer, then put this on.</li>
    <li> This little container will last a very long time...a dab will do you.</li>
    <li> I am so fed up with being hooked on chapsticks that I know just make the problem worse.  So, I heard about using lanolin based products on my lips and I decided to go all out and get the real deal.  This stuff is wonderful and I&#x27;ve only used it for a day, but my lips are so soft and smooth with only one application.  It is very solid, so it is not messy at all.  This will be put to good use on my winter dry skin!</li>
    <li> My clone recipe for Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint lip balm called for lanolin and this stuff is really pure.  The lip balm is certainly great--I think even better than the original.  I&#x27;ve made enough for gifts and have plenty left over for the family--probably for a couple of years!</li>
    <li> Very good product.Use for scars cuts sunburn etc.My grandson uses it for acne scars he loves it! Great for rough feet</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I am a beauty product junkie. I have tried more products then I care to admit.  But this one was truly worth the little splurge.  My friend, whose beauty product obsession may actually be worse than mine, introduced me to this stuff.  As a lip balm, this give the appearance of a gloss and is waterproof.  I also have very dry, sensitive skin.  On the occasions where my skin starts to flake, I will cover my face in this before bed and wake up to renewed skin.  This is a large container, similar to the size of a body butter.  I keep leftover empty jars from small samples around the house so I scooped some out of this container into my smaller container and keep it in my purse at all times. Works great as a moisturizer and would also be great in soothing burns! You will not regret this purchse!</li>
    <li> From saddle sores, bicycle chaffing or wind burn, nothing works like a little boric acid mixed in lanolin. I use this to recreate the Borofax that used to come in the old blue and white tube.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for severely dry chapped areas. I put it on lips and cuticles before going to bed. Stays on and works overnight.</li>
    <li> I used this product to make my own lotion and it worked out great! I like knowing that I am using such a high quality product. I will definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> Nice odorless, thick as petroleum, lanolin to use with chapped hands, feet, and bad cuticles! A little of this thick all lanolin paste goes a very long way and is a must. Better than any lotion for chapped hands, etc</li>
    <li> Great product! My wife uses daily, kept on the kitchen sink.  I use to keep hands &amp;#34;shakeable&amp;#34; Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> excellent  purchased the small jar because I have had poor success in the past.  I will be purchasing a large jar in the future Thankx</li>
    <li> I purchased this lanolin because of its claim to help restore and protect the skin without artificial ingredients. I have only used it on my hands but it has proven to be true to its word.  As part of my regular winter routine, the Australian Golden Lanolin has done an amazing job softening my overly dry, sensitive skin.  The product is very thick with a light fragrance and it works almost overnight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a night-cream for about 3 weeks now, and my acne scars have already visibly faded. My skin has also cleared up considerably using this product, and the dry patches on my face are no longer flaky. The only drawback that I&#x27;ve found is that the product remains sticky on your skin for quite some time, especially if you apply a thicker layer of it.. It has a shine to it that means that you can&#x27;t really go out with it fresh on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I still heartily recommend this product, and the benefits have far outweighed the drawbacks.</li>
    <li> This lanolin is being used with a conditioner I made for my hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product on the suggestion of a friend.  I use it to keep cork connections on woodwind instruments in good shape.  I does an excellent job of keeping things easy to put together and protects the cork from damage and does not let it dry out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s nothing short of what you expect when you are ordering Lanolin. Simple &amp; straight forward.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  I have eczema on my eyelid and I have tried every product under the sun to keep it moisturized.  It is typically raw, dry, itchy, and flaky. Other products burn and help for only a short time.  But not this!  It&#x27;s pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t spread so easy, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.  I put a thin layer on probably 4 -5 times a day.  Especially before going to sleep at night.  I have only been using it for a few days, but I can already tell a tremendous difference.  No more dry flaky skin.  It seems to create a barrier from whatever allergens I am exposed to.  It actually feels like it is healing the skin, it&#x27;s crazy!  I have been to 4 doctors, spent hundreds of dollars on ointments, creams, lotions, etc.  I love this stuff!  It has tons of uses, my husband discovered it on a reloading website where someone recommended it for resizing shell casings.  I decided to try it because I tried so many other products, I figured, why not.  Glad I did.</li>
    <li> Real lanolin is hard to find.  Get familiar with pure lanolin&#x27;s characteristics before you buy this, though.  I use it sparingly on my feet, with socks. This type might be best used in a blend, if you make your own creams at home.</li>
    <li> Really good lanolin. Absolutely no smell. Well worth the cost. Really absorbs well on my skin. Very good vendor as well!</li>
    <li> This products works very well but it can be a bit greasy and can seep into clothes.  best to put it on and then wrap with cotton</li>
    <li> It makes a great gift and is a great value for the price. Lanolin FTW!</li>
    <li> I love the texture and quality of this product and it lasts forever.  Truly a wonderful all natural healing product.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Never purchased or knew the true consistency of Lanolin, so I didn&#x27;t know what I was in for :/ Very tacky and wax like and no matter how hard I tried to have it for my extremely dry cracked hands, it just didn&#x27;t work. The cracks on my hands would be back to white and dry once the texture started to finally work in from an annoyingly tacky state that you can&#x27;t touch anything until it tries to soak in. I even tried putting it on at night with gloves (extremely annoying!!) and my hands were just as dry as they were before I used it. I will find body butter mixtures etc to incorporate it into just so it&#x27;s not wasted.</li>
    <li> I used to get a cold sore every month.  I started using this stuff as lip balm years ago.  Now I only get one a year.  I dunno why it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> This worked really well on my rosacea areas on my face. The first time I tried this I put it on in the evening and by morning my rosacea looked a lot better!  I put in on in the morning (only on active rosacea areas) and at night.  My rosacea areas are less red and &amp;#34;chapped&amp;#34; looking, and are slowly healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on any chapped skin, eczema patches, and dry skin areas like my heels.  The trick to making it less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; is to use it very minimally and really rub it in well.  I think the rubbing helps &amp;#34;melt it&amp;#34; a little/ and it seems to absorb better.  And then let it &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; for a few minutes..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for awhile -- in the stores, glad to have found it online, This is a GREAT product.  I use it on my very dry, chapped lips, and now I can smile again without worrying about my lips cracking.  Thank you, Seller!</li>
    <li> I use this daily on dry heels caused by diabetes.  It lubricates well and stays on.  I wish I could get a larger container!</li>
    <li> This is a great, pure wonderful product  with no pesticides.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product&lt;br /&gt;Dr. S. L</li>
    <li> This roduct is great. It does not smell. It is thick like petroleum jelly, without all the harsh, synthetic chemicals. It has stopped my cuticles from cracking and bleeding after 2 weeks of daily use. I am very pleased with this lanolin versus others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many different lip balms I&#x27;ve tried. I couldn&#x27;t go a minute without having something on my lips, either lip gloss or chapstick, or something. My lips would get dry and irritate the crap out of me. There are at least 20 different lip balms around my house, strategically placed so I&#x27;d never be more than 1 foot away from lip salvation. I thought there was something wrong with me. why do MY lips always have to be so dry? It&#x27;s not like men keep putting lip gloss and chapstick after every single drink or kiss! But it wasn&#x27;t me. It was all those products! They provide temporary relief at first, but in the long run, they just contribute to the problem. Which is a good tactic, I guess. Otherwise how would they stay in business! Those punks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around Amazon for Bag Balm. One of my friends uses it on her feet and swears by it. This lanolin cream was one of the \\&quot;suggested items\\&quot; and I clicked on it out of curiosity! I&#x27;ve never been more grateful to Amazon for that feature! I only need to apply this thing once in the mornings and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day! I cannot begin to express how good it feels to not have to worry about your lips all the time! All the cracks have healed and my lips look plump and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived within 2 days of ordering. It was beautifully wrapped and very securely packaged! Thank you so much for keeping this pure! I hope it stays that way!</li>
    <li> This product works great for all areas of the body.  Face, hands, feet, elbows, etc.It stays for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent quality.  I use it on my lips and on skin areas that are rough.  I researched and talked to others who have this product, so that is how I made my choice.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Perfect for cracked heels. I also have been adding a TB to my body butter recipe for added smoothness. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use it on the nasal pillows a part of my VPAP and it stops Leaks completely.  My nose and nostrils have not gotten irritated.  This product is the answer to a difficult problem.  I truly believe this product is the secret to stopping air leaks in the masks and nose pillows of cpap and. vpap machines.  Worth ten times the price.</li>
    <li> This spreads like wax. I might get yelled at but I don&#x27;t care. I didn&#x27;t realize this stuff was suppose to be the consistency of wax. I couldn&#x27;t stand the feel of this stuff. Or how long it took to get it on. I tried putting it on before bed and the back of my hand stuck to the bed sheet leaving a sticky mess. Maybe it would work if I used surgical gloves. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I had a thought that maybe I could use it on old leather boots for waterproofing.</li>
    <li> The product is a little bit thicker than I expected (kinda wax-cream texture). It seem to be hard to apply on my skin if I don&#x27;t rub hard. I even wondered if I should \\&quot;heat it up\\&quot; to melt it before I use it. I scooped a small amount of lanolin on my palm and added a little jojoba oil to \\&quot;dilute\\&quot; it, then applied on my skin. It works well so far. I love the subtle smell of lanolin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Everything I had hoped for. I work as a nurse at a hospital and so my hands are subjected to harsh washing pretty frequently throughout the day. In the winter I end up with eczema all over them and it was in hopes of alleviating this that I purchased the lanolin. What a success! At first I was applying it several times a day, then, after about a week, once at the beginning of each shift. It provides an almost waterproof barrier that protects and soothes over which I can apply my hand lotion. And so far so good! My eczema is gone and my hands look nicer and feel softer than they probably ever have. I was especially happy with the fact that the lanolin was natural. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with persistent dry patches of skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for pure lanolin, which I need to keep my hands from chapping.  Lanolin cremes and hydrated lanolin do not work nearly as well.  My hands have been free of cracks, since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> I switched from petroleum jelly to this lanolin, and I love it. I mainly use it as a heavy-duty lip balm - it makes my lips very soft. It&#x27;s also great for cuticles and dry patches. I&#x27;ve put some inside my nose when I had winter nose bleeds, and it did the trick. It is medicine cabinet size, not purse size.</li>
    <li> So pleased with this! Odorless, but so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great quality, good price, quick shipment. High quality and definitely recommend to others! Nothing bad to say</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Better price than going to the store. It&#x27;s pure, the scent is very mild, and it has worked well for us as a diaper creme, lip balm, and more.</li>
    <li> I wish this was sold in stores.  A much better moisturizer than any petroleum-based product.  Nearly zero odor, absorbs fast, and works for a long time.  This 2 oz. will last you a while.</li>
    <li> Very thick, kind of greasy product. It&#x27;s great for super dry hands and feet before bed. You don&#x27;t want to put it on right before shaking anyone&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and replaces my creme abricot from Dior for $25, for .35oz. the basis is lanolin. It is about the same thing. I purchased it for my nails .</li>
    <li> for me this product is very heavy. I mean heavy. if you are looking for a very high consistency this is for you.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product! Consistently perfect quality.</li>
    <li> This product is very very thick and oily feeling so I have to dilute it with my moisturizer, both work very well together.  I no longer have dry skin.  I will use this product for ever!! I truly love it!</li>
    <li> I actually use this to lanolize my son&#x27;s wool diaper covers. It works great! I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom and since i gave it she has not yelled or anything so must be good and doing its job or caused some kind of mutation and kept my mom quiet anyway i am happy.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars because it works and last a long time.  Our granddaughter had a diaper rash that would not go away.  This stuff did the trick when prescriptions did not.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and there are many uses for it, not just diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would and do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good for dry, chapped skin during the winter months. I will say this, it does have a little bit of a smell to it (not sure how to explain it) but its there. Also, it can feel pretty sticky on the skin.</li>
    <li> Our skin gets very dry in winter heated rooms. This works very well. Just be mindful it is not fragrant smelling and it is sticky when first applied. With continuous use, old dead dry skin are easily rubbed off. It can be applied safely to feet, hands, near lips.</li>
    <li> No perfume smell.  Great for people who are sensitive to odors.&lt;br /&gt;A little sticky, but as it warms on your skin, it rubs in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL for those living in harsh climates, or who was hands a lot.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; again, after applying this morning and evening, for several days in a row.</li>
    <li> I had a real problem with dry lips and found this product in the tube/chapstick type form first. Then I saw this and realized that it&#x27;s so much more in quantity for the money. I still buy the tubes, to keep one in my purse, but since I was using my fingers or a brush to apply it, this just makes more sense at home. I start with a base of glycerine (Glysolid- also purchased inexpensively at Amazon and lasts forever), follow that with my lip liner and lipstick and then brush this on top. It gives a nice subtle sheen and feels so nice. I also noticed how many of the other products are loaded with ingredients I couldn&#x27;t pronounce and wondered how much of that I was ingesting. This is natural, pure lanolin, right off the sheep, can&#x27;t go wrong with that. My dry lips have gone away and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it. Really, really great product.</li>
    <li> I use this to refill my lanolin lip balm containers. It helps keep my chapped lips soft and feeling healed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s like a miracle salve. I decided to get it after visiting a fiber festival and rubbing raw wool with lanolin from a freshly sheared sheep on a cut I had. The next day the cut was nearly gone. Not quite as good I can put this on any cut and it&#x27;s still so much better than triple antibiotic ointment. It is also amazing for dry skin patches. It is not a lotion, and it takes a little getting used to but it heals and moisturizers. It has lasted a while and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Best lanolin product I have used!  breastfeeding mothers should all know about this product!</li>
    <li> Yes!!!  Love this, and thank you for a wonderful product, reasonably priced, with excellent delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells like A&amp;E ointment, not the best smell in the world, but not as terrible as some of the reviews say. I use it to keep my hands from cracking in the winter, and it doubles as chapstick nicely too. Really glossy and sticky, stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other lanolins I liked a bit better....they came in a tube and were simpler to apply to my moustache where I use it as a conditioner/styler.  But the tube product is 10 bucks for 25% the amount so I&#x27;m happy wiht this.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  My skin feels so soft.</li>
    <li> The lanolin came in on time and was what I was looking for to use to make homemade lip balm. It is a sticky texture but easy to handle to either moisturize your hands or use for homemade products, like lip balm.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great on hide drum skins as well as your own skin!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and generally dry skin as well.  This stuff really helps.</li>
    <li> I like to use balms around nails, knuckles and follow with hand lotion/creme.  That normally takes care of any gooey-ness and leaves hands soft.  Not with this stuff - still sticky.  However, it really works and coats well.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as promised, it got here so fast i think they must have sent it before I ordered it. I bought some lanolin at a local store after I ordered this. The Naturals New Zealand product is much lighter and smoother. It penetrates faster and doesn&#x27;t remain on the skin. My hands get so dry from my work that they split on the finger tips which is very painful. If I remember to use the Lanolin they stay nice and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been becoming more and more concerned about using hand lotions that contain petroleum. I remembered my Grandmother swore by Lanolin, plus she was a knitter and needed smooth hands. Unable to find Lanolin in the local stores I checked out Amazon and found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin is slightly sticky and not of a wonderful fragrance but this has has had some of the natural fragrance removed. I used it as soon as I opened the box and just love it. I&amp;#34;ll be getting more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do with the bottle was glass as I&#x27;m trying to eliminate plastic packaging but will do with this at this time.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face to keep it soft. At 71 I have been looking for a product&lt;br /&gt;with no harmful product in it. This is about as pure as you can get. It helps to soften the look on my face and after a few days use I knew I chose the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all to purchase this product. It was also shipped right away and the packaging was great. I would strongly urge you all to try it. This product is not just for the face but many other things. It is thick like Vaseline and holds in moisture and that is important living in Florida.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about lanolin. It has been my go-to for any problems with dry skin for years. It stays on for a really long time - perfect for chapped lips. No nasty chemicals or artifical ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t get any more pure than this!</li>
    <li> Works great for relieving heat rash!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a whole lot, but haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
    <li> I have had little red bumps on my upper arms my entire life.  I recently got a heat rash in Mexico, and after some research I found out that it could be caused by clogged sweat ducts.  On of the recommended preventative measures for these clogged sweat ducts was lanolin.  I tried this brand (Australian Golden Lanolin from Koru Naturals), as well as Superlan, and they both have done wonders.  They have the same consistency; the only difference we can discern is the scent.  Australian Gold smells a bit more like sheep&#x27;s wool to me (not in a bad way), but floral to my husband.  Superlan smells like apricots to me, but just like a mild oil to my husband.  Neither smells very strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on to the good stuff.  After getting home my heat rash was gone, but I had ordered the lanolin anyway so I tried it.  The tiny bumps on my arms are GONE!  They disappeared in a day!  I can still see faint red dots where they used to be, which may just be scarring unfortunately.  But for the first time in my life, my upper arms are smooth.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried exfoliants and moisturizers galore, and none have worked at all.  It is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use it for dry skin and callused feet, and I&#x27;m convinced it helps cuts heal faster (but that may just be my new found adoration of lanolin).  It stays on even when lightly washing your hands a few times as well.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough if you have these little arm bumps or for dry skin.</li>
    <li> As a professional musician, I use this as a lubricant for Brass instrument tuning slides. It is excellent quality and will last for ages.</li>
    <li> This a a great lanolin and lasts forever.  I will certainly be reordering it when i need to.  I use it on heels, cuticles and all rough spots</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to use on his trombone&#x27;s tuning slide.  This product was recommended by the maker of the trombone.  I have heard no complaints from my son, and if he&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.  Four stars because I have not used the product for myself to give a personal account.</li>
    <li> I was using Vaseline for my dry lips. That was the wrong choice. I now use this and my lips have never been better! It is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this lanolin! I use it on my lips daily, it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts or anything. Plus a little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> I mixed this with some other base, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son who has cronic chaped lips. He says its not really helping, but it does appear to me to be getting better. He&#x27;s a teenager so I don&#x27;t really get a lot out of him.  Not even sure he is using daily as instructed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Great for elbows and heels or any place you  have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing cream/salve/lotion whatever you want to call it, on the earth. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend J is currently serving in Afghanistan and he told me how bad his hands were chapped and cracked. I instantly went to amazon and ordered him the Lanolin. Not only was I shocked at how fast he received it, but after just the first use, J said it was already healing his hands. Three days in, totally healed. J is obviously a very manly man being in the military and all and this stuff is thick and a bit sticky so he had reservations about using it.  I told him to put it all over his hands before he went to bed and wallah! No more hurting chapped and cracked hands. He loves it so much now, I convinced him to start putting it on his lips too! This stuff is so amazing I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, when I moved from the East to the West Coast the biggest change for me was dry skin and chapped lips. I tried everything and while some stuff came close it wasn&#x27;t until my sister in law suggested I try pure lanolin that my skin was changed forever! I know it seems crazy but it&#x27;s true. I love this stuff I have one in the bathroom one in the bedroom and one in my purse. No more dry lips or elbows, heels or cuticles. When I have a boo boo- it heals it and beautiful soft skin appears. I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s now available  in the round container. When I first started using Lanolin, I could only find it in the form of nipple cream for nursing mothers! But I didn&#x27;t care, if it&#x27;s good for the nipps it&#x27;s good for the lips. Even now, if I go to the local drugstore I can&#x27;t find pure lanolin that isn&#x27;t for nursing mothers. Ordering this from amazon is so easy and well worth it. Don&#x27;t hesitate! Get this stuff and start loving your skin again!</li>
    <li> This lanolin creme is much thicker and more protective than expected. It really does the trick of protecting heels and elbows in our touch North Dakota winters!</li>
    <li> Great Lanolin for Lanolizing cloth diapers.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Worked for my chapped lips like nothing else has ever. Prompt reliable service. Would be and will be from this company again, and this very product of course. It&#x27;s a pleasure to find something that actually lives up to it&#x27;s claims. Lanolin, Anhydrous Lanolin Pharmaceutical Grade is definitely on my recommendations list to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s product is by far the best lip balm I have used. I have tried almost all kinds of them out there, even the expensive brand. Lanolin oil def. kept my lips moist all night (after 8 hour sleep) and doesn&#x27;t require frequent applications. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use it in my moustache as a natural wax.  Heat it up a little with your hair dryer first.</li>
    <li> I slather my feet with this at night, put on socks and in the morning my heels are a lot softer. I love this stuff it is very thick and tacky, so just know that. It is pure lanolin, after all. I also love that it&#x27;s pharmaceutical grade so I can put it on my lips. Will purchase again if I ever run out!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. We lost our last container, so I had to hurry and get a new one! My husband has super dry feet, and regular lotions just soak right in, doing nothing for the dryness. This lanolin is his favorite and he refuses to use anything else on his feet since trying it the first time. Highly recommend for dry skin!</li>
