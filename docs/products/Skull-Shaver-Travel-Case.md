      <li>but I think the fit could be better.</li>
      <li>I wish it shaved just a little closer, but it is a very good and handy shaver.</li>
      <li>frankly the bag that came with the shaving kit would have been fine.  </li>
      <li>I have to go over my head again with a razor to get that baby smooth feel and look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and take care of.</li>
      <li>I think you will enjoy it like I have.</li>
      <li>I thought the shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Yes, it did fit and hold the shave well upon arrival when I bought it, however he never used the case so his shaver got all torn up riding around in his truck console.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a close, smooth shave</li>
      <li>The skull shaver and charger fit well in this case.</li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>Thanks I love this item, very much so.</li>
      <li>I got this to keep my Bald Eagle Smart shaver secure and protected during travels.  </li>
      <li>Nice case with space enough for the shaver and accessories.</li>
      <li>Not as good shave as expected</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>Worth $100?</li>
      <li>Just the right size for packing.</li>
      <li>This carrying case for the Skull Shavor is sturdy plus the price is right..</li>
      <li>Maybe I was expecting more, but it certainly feels cheap, but it does work as a wet shaver.</li>
      <li>The case appears to be well made and certainly will protect the shaver.</li>
      <li>Purchased with my Bald Eagle Smart.  </li>
      <li>It is very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Not as close as a blade shave, but fast and convenient.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
      <li>I did not use it yet,but I tried and it looks like to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for travel.</li>
      <li>They say good things come in small packages!</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it needs to be just slightly longer, to better fit the shaver and charger without having to strategically place the items in the case..</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the Skull Shaver if your thinking about changing.</li>
      <li>The items&#x27; bulk don&#x27;t fit as well as I&#x27;d expected and</li>
      <li>Well worth the money even if you only travel once in a while.</li>
      <li>As a recent retiree, I  wanted to do something that was fun and new.  </li>
      <li>The shaver fit as designed and has room for other items you might need to bring along for your shaver.</li>
      <li>I emailed them and told them protector was found and not to ship the new one.</li>
      <li>They were going to send me a new one.</li>
      <li>but it is basically a semi soft pouch with a zip and a high profit margin.  </li>
      <li>The unit holds the Skull Shaver perfectly and is composed of material that would protect the contents of the case, while also giving a little to allow the contents to move inside just enough to avoid a direct tough blow.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
      <li>If you travel frequently I suggest you protect your investment with this case.</li>
      <li>So far every item sold by this seller has been a thumbs up from me. .</li>
      <li>no regrets in buying it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the military and require a very close shave.</li>
      <li>It is a nice and convenient travel case for your skull shaver and accesories, I gave it a 4 stars because I prefer a harder case to have extra protection, it is too weak on the zipper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have no idea why the the case is the only thing you can rate maybe it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s where it should stay. It doesn&#x27;t work. Even if I razor shave the following days it will not touch the hair that grows.&lt;br /&gt;I got ripped off.....</li>
    <li> Purchased with my Bald Eagle Smart.  The items&#x27; bulk don&#x27;t fit as well as I&#x27;d expected and frankly the bag that came with the shaving kit would have been fine.  This would provide some extra protection if there&#x27;s a danger of the items bouncing around in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> Thanks I love this item, very much so.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with the Skull Shaver Travel Case as it is designed to protect the shaver from damage when packed away in his suit case. He also mentioned the large heavy duty zipper not normally associated with a case the size of the Skull Shaver case. Good quality an practical.</li>
    <li> It is very convenient.  I wish it shaved just a little closer, but it is a very good and handy shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hard to please . I was Impressed the first time I used it and been using it for a couple months now wish I had purchased long before I did 😃👍👍</li>
    <li> Nice case with space enough for the shaver and accessories. The shaver (sold separately) leaves a lot to be desired though.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as close as I thought it would. I have to go over my head again with a razor to get that baby smooth feel and look.</li>
    <li> very poor product. Only lasted a month before the battery went out and shaver heads started breaking.</li>
    <li> Just made my first road trip with my skull machine, and this case is great, shaver, charger, nicely protected. If you travel, a must.</li>
    <li> This carrying case for the Skull Shavor is sturdy plus the price is right.. So far every item sold by this seller has been a thumbs up from me. .</li>
    <li> Love this travel case.  Keeps my Skull Shaver safe in a protective shell.</li>
    <li> Unimpressed with closeness of shave. Otherwise worked ok, but I returned it bc I&#x27;m in the military and require a very close shave.</li>
    <li> This Is a very good travel case for my Bald Eagle Smart.. Good price and provides good protection for the shaver.. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it needs to be just slightly longer, to better fit the shaver and charger without having to strategically place the items in the case.. But not a big deal.</li>
    <li> the case is made well like a hard drive case but I think the fit could be better. should keep it safe during travel . no regrets in buying it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing! I&#x27;ve always been a razor type guy and even tried an electric. I had my doubts at first but after using my Skull Shaver now for about 1 1/2 months my razors are gone for good. It gives me a good clean close shave on both my face and head. It does better on my head than the razors with no nics. It&#x27;s safe to use and holds a good charge. It&#x27;s easy to clean and take care of. For me, it gives me the best shaves I&#x27;ve had. They say good things come in small packages! This is one of those things! I thought I had lost my blade protector. I emailed the company told them what happened and the next morning I had a reply. They were going to send me a new one. Later that morning my wife found the protector. I emailed them and told them protector was found and not to ship the new one. Customer service was good. I would highly recommend the Skull Shaver if your thinking about changing. I think you will enjoy it like I have. Good Luck and Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> it works great...it cuts fairly close for an electric...  let me give it 6 months and see how it works out...</li>
    <li> Its ok but it is basically a semi soft pouch with a zip and a high profit margin.  Haven&#x27;t used it while travelling yet but will probably do the job.</li>
    <li> Nothing special but I wanted it for travel.</li>
    <li> Not as good shave as expected</li>
    <li> I received my Skull Shaver Travel Case yesterday. It is so compact I thought the shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit. The shaver fit as designed and has room for other items you might need to bring along for your shaver. Firm case and appears to be well suited for packing  it with your luggage.</li>
    <li> Worth $100? Not sure. Does it work? I guess.  Maybe I was expecting more, but it certainly feels cheap, but it does work as a wet shaver. You&#x27;ll want to run the head under the sink mid-way, as it will get junked up with shaving cream...even if a thin layer is applied.</li>
    <li> Works well fits nicely for travel.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say really.&lt;br /&gt;It is a case, and it does its jobs well as any case.</li>
    <li> Nice light case to throw in my carry on.  Pro fits in nicely.  If you travel frequently I suggest you protect your investment with this case.</li>
    <li> Nice product that allows quick and easy transport of the Skull Shaver!</li>
    <li> Fits the SkullShaverPro like a glove.  Nice &amp; compact, a perfectly designed case</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the shaver and solid case.  Great for storing in the cabinet and traveling!</li>
    <li> I did not use it yet,but I tried and it looks like to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> as advertised, just wish it were smaller for travel</li>
    <li> Bought the case with the Bald Eagle Skullshaver which has been used. My husband is very pleased with the shaver but has not yet used the travel case. The case appears to be well made and certainly will protect the shaver.We feel that both items will be around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Fits everything beautifully and is very sturdy</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a close, smooth shave this product is not what you are looking for!</li>
    <li> nice carrying case,protects shaver.</li>
    <li> Case actually hold and protects the shaver... Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Sometimes it works ans sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The unit holds the Skull Shaver perfectly and is composed of material that would protect the contents of the case, while also giving a little to allow the contents to move inside just enough to avoid a direct tough blow.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price at $15. Just the right size for packing.</li>
    <li> As a recent retiree, I  wanted to do something that was fun and new.  So I decided to shave my head.  Many friends of mine have shaved their head for years.  Many of them with razor scars and bumps.  When l found the Skull Shaver l knew l had found the answer to my concerns. I am really enjoying this product.</li>
    <li> It is a nice and convenient travel case for your skull shaver and accesories, I gave it a 4 stars because I prefer a harder case to have extra protection, it is too weak on the zipper.</li>
    <li> The skull shaver does not fit</li>
    <li> nice way to keep your shaver in a safe place</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son and he loves it. It gets👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I got this to keep my Bald Eagle Smart shaver secure and protected during travels.  It does a great job and it appears to be durable.  I recommend this item for storing your Skull Shavers.</li>
    <li> The skull shaver and charger fit well in this case. It&#x27;s very convenient for travel. And it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
    <li> A good place for my stuff because if I go on a trip the shaver and attachments are going with me.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money even if you only travel once in a while.</li>
    <li> fits and works to hold the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO YEARS LATER UPDATE:  I cannot tell you how well this case worked.  Yes, it did fit and hold the shave well upon arrival when I bought it, however he never used the case so his shaver got all torn up riding around in his truck console.  I think this box would have worked quite well to keep the shaver in working condition, if he had actually bothered to use it.</li>
    <li> Just big enough for Butterfly shaver, foil body shaver and cords.  Packed tight!</li>
    <li> Very nice travel case</li>
    <li> Best head shaver available</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Not as close as a blade shave, but fast and convenient. The Skull Shaver does a great job for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Good accessory for travel. Keeps everything tidy and since it is a semi-rigid case, it protects it too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very excellent product</li>
