<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these brushes, especially the kit that it comes in.  I would have loved if they printed on the handle what the actual use was for....I&#x27;m still learning!  I have sensitive skin, so the synthetic took a little time to get used to!!  I hope these last a long time!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Makeup and anything that deals with beauty products.  I have recently found out what finishes any look when dealing with makeup is the brushes.  This is the 2nd set of brushes that I own and all I can say is I wish I had these sooner.  They are soft and easy to hold.  This is a nice set with a variety of sizes of brushes each holding its own special purpose.  The price is great, the appearance is wonderful - this would be a great gift for any beauty lover in your home.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes were sent to me to review, while I didn&#x27;t pay for them I promised to share my honest opinion.  My opinions may or may not differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Beautiful package and good quality brushes. could make a nice gift for my makeup artist friend.</li>
    <li> I received mine i got as a gift about 2wks ago and let me say nice at first after a few days of use one of my handels unglued it self while i was cleaning my brushes and it was holw. some started to shead i mean shead really i wish i would have said buy me SIGMA brushes......</li>
    <li> Love these makeup brushes! Very high quality. The case is lovely and great for travel and for keeping them nice when I store them. Very professional looking too. I showed a makeup artist friend who said she will be purchasing soon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time as described. The carrying case is really quite nice, it has a professional look to it, and feels very durable. The brushes are very soft and feel great on my skin. I am not a makeup pro by any means, however I use my blush brush and eye shadow brush almost daily and these provide an easy application. Quality brushes. Great packaging if you wanted to gift this item to someone.</li>
    <li> Very classy looking makeup brush set. All eight brushes are very well made, the metal ferrule keeps the synthetic bristles tightly inside so there are no loose hairs falling out. I love the look of this brush kit, the brush handles are black with the company name printed in silver on one side of the handle, and the name of the brush printed on the other side. I like having the name of the brush on the handle, it makes it easy to know which brush to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are very easy to hold and feel comfortable in my hand. The synthetic bristles are soooo soft! And the light gray tipped bristles look frosted when you run your finger across them. I like the foundation brush, it works so much better than using a makeup sponge. The angled brush works great for adding a bit of shading under my cheekbones, while the powder brush feels great when I brush a bit of blush along my cheeks. I also like the eye shadow brush, it picks up color well and holds onto it without dropping too much shadow dust in and around my eyes. Some brushes are horrible for that, leaving you with tearing and itchy eyes for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has it&#x27;s own holder in the case, and also comes in a clear plastic sleeve. The larger powder brush, and the angled contour brush are the only brushes that also have a clear vinyl type protector that covers the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case looks very nice and wipes clean with a damp cloth. There is a magnetic snap closure that helps keep your brushes secure and the entire brush kit is compact enough for travel, or to just carry with you in your bag. Nice quality makeup brush set, would make a very nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received for review purposes.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:764caf4474f997083d012e651efa6ba7]] Fabulous brushes for beginners.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:7ff7c1160c2b2a99b7a98ed4de020a33]] I&#x27;m a sucker for new makeup brushes, and the collection I have is impossible to take around. This makeup brush set from Zozae is a great set that I can take with me wherever I need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current brushes are living in a large, round container in my bathroom that, while gorgeous, is hardly portable. This set comes in a small black case about the same size as the average clutch and holds every brush securely in place! The magnetic clasp is easy to secure and open, and even after throwing this kit into my purse for a day I didn&#x27;t have a single brush fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes in this kit are amazing! I was especially impressed with the eye shadow shader brush - it was completely loaded with powder after just one or two taps on my palette! The contouring brush and blending brush both blended everything beautifully, and the foundation brush was a breeze to use! I am very impressed with the variety and results I got from all of these brushes; I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on giving this set to a sibling but after looking at it, and especially after using it, I knew I was keeping it for myself! I did receive this brush set at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how convenient and tidy this kit is, nor does it effect my review.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these brushes.  I get very good control with these synthetic brushes.  It is much easier to apply makeup accurately and much easier to clean them, too.  So much nicer than horse, donkey, boar hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are so soft and gently on my skin, which aids in an even application.  They make blending a joy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles have stayed firmly in place; no shedding at all.  I like the matte black handles and the shiny silver metal shaft--such a nice contrast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice in the top, right picture that each brush is named with its proper use.  I like that added information.  Of course, you won&#x27;t need that after you get used to your new set, but I like the attention to detail.  On the opposite side of the handle from the descriptive name is the zozae logo--not glaring, just nicely shown in a light matte gray/silver paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the carry/travel case is a good, thoughtful assortment.  Covers most of needs:  To make my set complete, I&#x27;ve also tucked in my own short-bristled flat-top, perfectly round, very dense, Kabuki brush, for my liquid makeup.  You can use the foundation brush in the set just as well, though.  I&#x27;m just used to the flat top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a free e-book available for added information.  Plus they have a website, an email address and are on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a one-star review here, and I&#x27;m not sure about it:  Seems like someone pushing another brand of brushes, if you ask me.....  These really do &amp;#34;wash and wear&amp;#34; very well.  I have tried and cannot dislodge any bristles.  On the biggest brush I needed to trim a few bristles that were out of place, but for the most part these brushes are very well hand-trimmed and shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is sturdy, bristles are protected, and there is a quality magnetic snap-close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from zozae</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best set of makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. Truthfully, I&#x27;m incredibly cheap and spend less than 10 dollars on the sets I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. After seeing the price on these, I was skeptical if they&#x27;d be worth it. With the option of trying them for review, I jumped to try them. After trying them out, I am put in my place and so incredibly pleased with the quality of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a very nice faux-leather case with a magnetic snap closure. You get 3 large face brushes and 5 smaller brushes for eye and lip. These brushes are synthetic and I&#x27;m surprised at how well they do their job. With ALL others I&#x27;ve tried that were all natural hair, you always have the problem of the bristles going this way and that or them coming out when you clean them. I am putting these brushes through the ringer and they are holding up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that each one has the purpose stamped at the bottom of the handle, which helps someone like me who just grabs them willy nilly, using them for whatever. After using each one for their intended use, you can appreciate why each one is made with their specific density and angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this brush set. They really are incredible. The price tag is still a bit much for me to splurge, but I can really see why it is that, with the quality of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I blog so much about beauty that I wore out my last brush set that I used for contouring. When the opportunity came to received a complimentary brush set to rvw I jumped on it. For synthetic brushes I am amazed at how soft they are. They feel feather-light going across my skin. The brushes pick up powders well and retain just the right amount when you shake the excess off. This set works well with coarser powders as well as finely milled powders. Some may know that is essential. Like I hinted I used this set for light contouring. It blends like a dream leaving no harsh lines so your makeup just blends into each other with softness. The brushes are very easy to clean so no worries there. The set also comes in a very attractive clutch that is simple and modern-looking.</li>
    <li> I received this brush set as a gift and I am very pleased to have them in my makeup collection.  The brushes have silky smooth bristles and a easy-grip handle. I really like the case that the brushes came with. So now I have the Zozae tools I need for a radiant look.</li>
    <li> This set of Zozae Beauty brushes will satisfy every facial make-up need you’ll ever have.  They are shipped in an attractive carry along case with individual slots so brushes are easy to identify.  They are made from a synthetic material with bristles that don’t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The assortment includes: Powder Brush, Foundation Brush, Angled Blush/Contour Brush, Lip Brush, Angled Eyeliner Brush, Eyeshadow Brush, Tapered Blending Brush, and a Flat Concealer Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my brushes by swishing them in a little tepid water and a small drop of shampoo.  I rub them gently with my fingers and rinse under cool water.  Then they can be dried by laying on a terry towel.  The company claims: “100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!  These luxurious make-up brushes will not shed after washing given the correct care”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a lovely and inclusive set and would make an excellent gift for a sweet 16, a birthday or for your BFF anytime.</li>
    <li> First off, these are synthetic brushes at a pretty high end price. But if you ever price out a good, single make-up brush you will quickly see how the price of a quality brush goes on its own. By the time you add up the number of brushes in this set, plus the great carry case, this becomes a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really nicely made. They do start with a bit of an odor - like glue but that dissipates. The brushes are super soft and have perfect tapers and round edges. The sizes are great as well. From a large blush brush to a small eye contour brush. The case has just enough spots to keep these wrapped up and safe with a snap closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> work great my wife love them they are very high quality and look very nice</li>
    <li> The Zozae Premium Makeup Brushes are a great set of brushes to add to your makeup collection. Now ladies and gentleman I am a makeup brush addict....yes I said! I love trying new brushes especially when you realize they are very good quality! One of the best things  I noticed before using them was the quality. I always wash my makeup brushes before I use them. As I was washing them the brushes did not shed at all! The ferrule on the brushes did not become weak and wasn&#x27;t falling apart before the wash! That is a first sign of a bad brush when you wash them for the first time and they shed like crazy and the ferrule feels like it wants to fall off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the sleek black handle and the silver ferrule! It also came with two makeup brush protector covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used all of these brushes and love the way it applies my makeup and blends it very nicely! These brushes would be a perfect set to give as a gift or buy them for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> High quality set of makeup brushes! Very soft synthetic makeup brushes, gently applies my makeup with a smooth finish, and no streaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that all of the hairs in each brush are attached to the handle securely - none of the hairs fell out while I was applying my makeup. Normally when I get a new set of makeup brushes, even a good quality set will have a few stray hairs fall out while first using them - not the case with this professional brush set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a brush for every need - eyes, cheeks, foundation, liner, contour and lips. I even used one on my eyebrows to help form the shape and add a touch of color to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set, like many other makeup brush sets will need to air out when it first arrives to lose the factory smell. A very handy cases holds each brush into place and makes it easier to take on the go or pack up safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to pack this set into my travel bag to take with me on extended trips. All the tools I need are there to help me achieve a flawless look. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of brushes, like the product description says well crafted synthetic brushes are so much better than horse hair brushes as they are softer, blend better, the hair doesn&#x27;t come off as easily and are easier to clean and maintain. And they last longer too. This set is a little pricey but it includes all the necessary brushes you need for makeup for eyeshadow, blush, blending in a bronzer, foundation and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes: Powder Brush, Foundation Brush, Angled Blush/Contour Brush, Lip or liner Brush, Angled Eyeliner Brush, Eyeshadow Brush, Tapered Blending Brush, and a Flat Concealer Brush. The brushes come in a case that rolls up and is easy to carry. I had purchased a similar set from The Body Shop that had fewer brushes. If they lower the price closer to $30 this set would be an even better value.&lt;br /&gt;[Received a sample for review]</li>
    <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
    <li> these look like great quality, they look nice and elegant. I feel that they are not the best for application out in the market but definitely not a disappointment. Really liked the eye brushes and the big fluffy brush!</li>
    <li> These are beautifully packaged and great quality brushes.  I brought these for myself, but they would also make a lovely gift.  Very sleek and classy looking.  If you are in need of great quality make up brushes purchases these.  I love the feel, design, look of them.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging and how soft the brushes are to my face. They have worked very well and the choice of brushes are perfect to any need I would have to put makeup on! It does smell a bit stinky when first taking the product out of the bag, but it only took a day or two for the smell to go away. My guess is that it came from the brush case. Would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> These are pretty typical makeup brushes (I&#x27;ve tested a lot lately). They are synthetic so they&#x27;re safe for vegans. They&#x27;re soft and non-scratchy with the appropriate levels of firmness for the brush types. The handles are comfortable and the brushes are sleek in appearance. The bristles are well-secured to the handles and I noticed only a handful of shedding hairs (maybe five among all the brushes?) so the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These perform as expected. I like the shape of the powder brush, especially. I have a favorite powder brush already (from Morphe) but I think this one is a close second. I expect to get a lot of use out of it (especially when the other is being washed). My powder was pressed but I prefer application with brushes because the little sponge pads that come with pressed powder pick up oil too easily and make the powder surface gunky. These brushes don&#x27;t do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled blush brush did an excellent job. I tested this with loose powder blush. It picked up exactly the right amount of pigment (I tapped on the edge of the container just to be safe) and didn&#x27;t make me look like a clown (important because it was a very deep, bright blush color). I used various smaller brushes (perhaps ignoring the label&#x27;s advice) for eyeshadow (pressed) and I thought they did a good job of picking up pigment, especially in pans that were nearly empty. So these might help you get that last little bit of product out of the pans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed these by rubbing them over a wet bar of Dove soap (I&#x27;ve found this easier than using brush shampoo) and laid them flat to dry. They have survived so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I like about these: the brush handles are labeled as to what type of brush they are. I am pretty much self-taught when it comes to makeup and I always grab what I think looks right, but I&#x27;m starting to see the subtleties of different brush types. I like the labels better than having a separate card with brush descriptions, because I don&#x27;t have to keep track of any card -- the label is right there in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else I like about this set: the case has spaces for 8 brushes. I find that I use the same 5 or 6 types of brushes over and over again, so an 8-brush case is really all I would need for travel. This would take up less room in a suitcase or carry-on bag. Also, the case is a bit stiffer than some of the polyurethane rolls floating around with other makeup brush sets. This protects the larger brushes a bit more from bristle bending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price (around sixty dollars as of this posting), I wish there were more eyeshadow brushes. I use eyeshadow brushes more than any other type of brush (I am participating in a palette panning challenge on a forum this year). I typically wear at least three colors in a given day. I like to use a different (clean) brush for each color. I improvised by (mis)using other brushes in the set for colors two and three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: the product listing indicates that these brushes come with a makeup guide ebook. I am having trouble figuring out where to obtain this. I went to the company&#x27;s web page and it&#x27;s still clearly under construction (sometimes you have to register with vendors to get the free ebooks). I also did not receive an e-mail with any download link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.&#x27;t have to keep track of any card -- the label is right there in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else I like about this set: the case has spaces for 8 brushes.

    <li> My last set of brushes was from Bobbi Brown.  I love them so very much and they have lasted a long time.  When I started my search for a new set, I went to the Bobbi Brown site to take a look.  HOLY COW.. Okay guys, to replace a full set of BB brushes is well lets just say I could make a car payment with that amount of cash.  Soo, after some research I decided I could try out some of the less expensive brands.  I found four that I researched and ordered (and /still/ spent a great deal less)….  Sooo, here I am trying out different brands of brushes and looking for that perfect set and I thought I might as well take you along for the journey. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I’ve looked at following brands - Of the four sets I looked at, I find that I prefer the Shany Cosmetics with a couple of the EcoTools added to the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  EcoTools - These are synthetic bristles with bamboo handles in a eco-friendly storage pouch.  Brush sizes  are 6 1/2 to 7 inches long from brush-tip to handle base.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend these to a friend?  Yes&lt;br /&gt;— The handles are tapered and easy to manipulate when applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;— Each brush is labeled for its purpose&lt;br /&gt;— I cleaned the brushes and they handle cleaning well and had no loss of bristles&lt;br /&gt;— Their case is a zip pouch - made with natural cotton and hemp.  Great for the environment but not so good for keeping brush bristles well shaped. Perhaps adding mesh to the brush-tips to hold them would be a good addition.&lt;br /&gt;— The back of the pouch, being cotton and hemp, soaks up makeup and is a bit harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall -  A Winner.  A good set to fill in with while you look for that ‘perfect set’.  You may find yourself liking them more than you expected to.  For the price, I was shocked at just how much I am liking certain brushes from this set - specifically the Eye Shading Brush &amp; Concealer Brush quickly replaced my old Bobbi Browns., they apply product evenly and blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  SHANY Cosmetics  - SHANY Ombre Pro 10 Piece Essential Brush Set with Travel Pouch.  Brushes are 6 to 6 1/2 inches long from brush-tip to handle base.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend these to a friend?  Yes&lt;br /&gt;  — The set comes with a nice case.  The brushes are a bit cramped when inside it and I will be adding mesh protectors to make it easier to add / remove brushes from it without bending the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;  — Each brush is labeled with its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;  — So far they hold up well to being cleaned, no loss of bristles&lt;br /&gt;  — The bristles are soft, thick, well contoured and apply makeup nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Another Winner…a very nice set that I will be using to replace some of my older brushes.  Between this set and the EcoTools, I think I’ve found the brushes I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Zozae -  Professional Quality Kabuki Makeup Brushes; 8-pc Kit of synthetic brushes that comes with Organizer Case.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend these to a friend?  Yes&lt;br /&gt;  — You will want to open the case to allow it to ‘air out’ over night&lt;br /&gt;  — I cleaned the brushes and they handle cleaning well and had no loss of bristles&lt;br /&gt;  — A nice case the design protects the brushes well and will hold up to being placed in a suitcase.  But they will take up a bit of room…  These are full size brushes so don’t expect to toss them into a small purse and have room for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;  — The brushes apply makeup smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;  — In my opinion Zozae had the best case (easy access to each brush)&lt;br /&gt;Overall - The Zozae set would make a great gift set.  Take the time to air out the case and clean the brushes and then wrap it all up and make someone a very happy camper.  In fact I did.  Of the sets I have looked at, this one drew my daughter’s attention.  It has the best case and excellent brushes.  She is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  Be You, Beautifully  5 Piece Travel Makeup Brush Set .  Synthetic bristles, wooden handles. Brush sizesare 4 - 4 1/2 inches long from brush-tip to handle base&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend these to a friend?  No&lt;br /&gt;  — This set came with a tri-fold case that includes a mirror.  If you are carrying a small purse then this is a set that would easily to drop into your purse.&lt;br /&gt;  — The interior surface of the case is velvet.  I am not a fan as storing used brushes next to it means the material will hold onto bacteria and makeup.  I like to be able to clean both my brushes and my case.&lt;br /&gt;  — Each brush is labeled for its purpose&lt;br /&gt;  — The blush brush did not handle its first cleaning well.  The bristles began to separate.&lt;br /&gt;  — After washing, all the brushes tips began to curl outward slightly.  Once dry they picked up too much product and didn’t apply it smoothly.  I think more powder remained on the brush than on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;  — Bristles are not as thick as other sets&lt;br /&gt;  — The handles are short - which can be good for travel. But, in addition to being short, some of the handles are also thin - really thin, I prefer my brush handles to be a little thicker, easier to hold and manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;Overall — I am not a fan of the Be You Beautifully brushes.  They are a lovely set but not one that will hold up overtime.  If you are looking for a set of brushes just to get your through a week or so on vacation, these might work.  Though you may find yourself dropping into shops and looking for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;— — Clean your brushes! — —&lt;br /&gt;If your brushes cannot hold up to being cleaned then they are not really meant to be used over time.  Ideally, you should wash your brushes once a week to remove old makeup and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Even new brushes should be cleaned before use, you are removing anything the brushes may have picked up between the factory and your home - including that synthetic ‘smell’ some people notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run the bristles under warm water.  Careful not to get the clamp or handle area wet.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a drop of gentle shampoo (baby shampoo) to the bristles and work it into the bristles.  You will see old makeup coming from the bristles..&lt;br /&gt;Rinse the bristles thoroughly under warm running water and continue rinsing until the water runs clear.&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the interesting.. and somewhat silly.. bit. . . ‘listen’ to the bristles.  Lift the still-wet bristles up to your ear and rub them gently together - can you hear a sudsy/soapy sound?  - You know that sound .. you may have heard it when washing your hair - you think you’ve rinsed all the soap away only to run a finger through and hear the crackling of soap suds.  Continue to gently rinse the bristles until you are sure the soap has been removed.

    <li> I love this brush set!  So impressed with the quality of the brushes as well as the bag organizer!  It would make a great gift, but also keeps the brushes neat and organized.  Each brush has a plastic protector which I love because it keeps the bristles protected when I&#x27;m not using them. I also love the material of the brushes - they are so soft!  The powder brush and contour brush have the perfect firmness for their purpose.  I love the foundation brush - I&#x27;ve never used a brush for putting on my foundation and it creates such a smooth, flawless look.  The angled eyeliner brush works perfect when I want to use a powder for my eyeliner - I just dampen it slightly and it creates a great look. It also works great for eyebrows.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure the best way to clean the brushes as I just got them recently, but am hoping they hold up through cleanings.  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
