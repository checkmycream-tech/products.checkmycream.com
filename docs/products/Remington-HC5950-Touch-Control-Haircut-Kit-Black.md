      <li>I was impressed.  </li>
      <li>touch buttons were both positioned well and tuned perfectly.</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s nothing at all about how best to use the machine to give a haircut.</li>
      <li>Excellent machine for his price</li>
      <li>and I will do my best to answer.</li>
      <li>He declared this trimmer to be the best he has ever used.  </li>
      <li>But then we used it and it worked great !</li>

      <li>I ended up giving him a very nice haircut (a modified mohawk) and it came out wonderfully.</li>
      <li>My grandfather was a barber and my pop always had great tools.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The quality of the cut is great as well.</li>
      <li>It is a great advantage not to have a cord to get in the way.  </li>
      <li>You can charge it through a USB port, which is great if you</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice because it gives you the option of selecting barber values (use a number 3) or length (1/4 inch).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Touch controls are amazing!</li>
      <li>excellent purchase, more that my friend expect to get, even when it was not for me</li>
      <li>Awesome device, I love using it every day.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m even more impressed of the quality of this razor after doing so.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with how easy it was to cut with the trimmer</li>
      <li>This trimmer gives a good cut, once you get it working.  </li>
      <li>It holds a good amount of charge.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>Not a Pro motor, but plenty good for 1 person.</li>
      <li>Though the Wahl and Remington kits do a good job, they cost twice what the Conair does.  </li>
      <li>I am not a hairstylist, or want to cut my own hair, but having it for as a beard trimmer is very nice.</li>
      <li>Make sure to charge fully after getting!</li>
      <li>The charge, once full has a very good life which is nice and can work off the plug</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t get all the complaints-</li>
      <li>I like using my own clippers instead of going to the barber every two weeks.  </li>
      <li>The much lower cost of the Conair makes it the best choice.</li>
      <li>and they did their own thing.  </li>
      <li>so that might be handy.  </li>
      <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Remington HC5950 to cut off my beard and trim my goatee, the included attachments came in handy for that also.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice touch is you can charge this from a wall power outlet or USB plug.  </li>
      <li>how about some advice on the best techniques for a great haircut - and how to cut different lengths and finishes for both men and women (and kids)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>; kind of person, just set the length and cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a nice size, and the cordless makes things easier</li>
      <li>It was very easy to use and responsive.</li>
      <li>I liked that I was able to choose the lengths that the professionals use at the haircutting place (#2, #3).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m working on finding a good, comfortable way to hold it</li>
      <li>Its a nice idea for sure.</li>
      <li>This trimmer easily pays for itself!</li>
      <li>I first used these, they were great.</li>
      <li>- Since it is brand new, the battery holds a very good amount of juice.</li>
      <li>That instruction book had detailed advice on how to do a cut - and how to get the best cut - and included picture pages and blank lines where you could write in the lengths to set for a friend or loved one&#x27;s best length and look over their entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes the screen is a pain if it gets a drop of water on it or something, but for the most part the screen has given me no problem.</li>
      <li>I like the versatility of being able to charge from either a wall outlet or my computer, as this was purchased with travel in mind.</li>
      <li>I forget they are there most the time</li>
      <li>and I made sure to maintenance it as directed .</li>
      <li>and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>Once I get better at it, I plan on giving him a \\&quot;buzz and blend.\\&quot; Recommended.</li>
      <li>The three guards that come with the trimmer are high-quality, smoked plastic which looks sharper than you&#x27;d get from cheaper models and are more wear-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d hoped the Remington clippers would do a cleaner, simpler, better cut, but what I have is what seems to be a well-made clipper with three plastic attachments, that I will have to figure out by trial and error - since there are no instructions on how to do a cut.</li>
      <li>However, be sure to lock it every time or you will accidentally cut off one side of your mustache.  </li>
      <li>and overall i am very happy and have had no issues at all with it.</li>
      <li>so make sure to read the manuals...</li>
      <li>Be sure to charge it up as soon as you get it.  </li>
      <li>so be sure to lube it up after uses..</li>
      <li>wow amazing how it adjusts on the fly....</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
      <li>Most of the settings are accessed via a touchscreen type of interface.  </li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t for this, I would love these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep my own hair trimmed very nicely thus making far fewer trips to the barber.</li>
      <li>razor is also nice and light and easy to grip.</li>
      <li>When you adjust the blades you can choose between setting listed in barber sizes of millimeters, kind of cool.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a very nice cordless clipper that works great for typical haircuts.</li>
      <li>The different speed functions are great, although to be honest</li>
      <li>so far it works great</li>
      <li>, I find that the Remington gives a more comfortable haircut than the Conair.  </li>
      <li>It is by far-and-away the most comfortable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have no issues at all with the guard digging or the blade biting into my skin.  </li>
      <li>It went very quickly through the hair on my head but</li>
      <li>It does everything I want it to do with no surprises, comes apart easily for cleaning, is cordless</li>
      <li>It charges very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Clippers should be as easy as 1-2-3, this is as easy as 1-2</li>
      <li>They were easy to attach and remove as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The guards easily slide on/off this</li>
      <li>the micro usb charger (heck i can charge it from my cell charger on the road if needed!), and it comes apart with one button for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>In unlocked mode, it is easy to change the settings accidentally; however, the clipper will not run in this mode.</li>
      <li>If your looking for a quality, easy to use cordless haircut kit</li>
      <li>I am quite concerned that they will break easily.</li>
      <li>Strong motor which can be set to Low-Medium-High depending on the thickness of hairs being cut.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the blades are titanium coated, and they seemed to cut fine</li>
      <li>It would really make getting a nice fade easy since you can easily select which level you want without having to change the combs (and have to worry about storing 15 combs).</li>
      <li>However, I was less than impressed with the product once I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was more than happy to let him \\&quot;claim\\&quot; it as long as he talked to me as he used it.  </li>
      <li>While my hair still cut fine</li>
      <li>very high quality feeling device and despite its size , handles nicely and isnt too burdensome.&lt;br /&gt;(4)</li>
      <li>This razor has a huge learning curve and takes a while to get used to.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if you have any questions about the product feel free to leave a comment below</li>
      <li>This kit worked fantastic.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>(yay!), and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>However, my fiance saw the package when it came in the mail and declared it a dog free zone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Still charges off of USB, which is SO comfortable</li>
      <li>All in one shaver (no longer available - bought over 3 years ago</li>
      <li>You have to press and hold it until it gets to the length you want, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem that precise.  </li>
      <li>I found the trimmer to be very lightweight (for a rechargeable) and I liked the feel of the trimmer in my hand.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Okay, it looks super cool, but the razor sucks. It does slip all the time and messes your hair up. Also, it just randomly malfunctions and turns off - definitely not a user error and I made sure to maintenance it as directed . So irritating!</li>
    <li> Edit 2015-06-24: It finally broke. The motor seems to get jammed or something and the safety mechanism kicks in at unpredictable time. It really makes for a very painful pull on the hair since the moving blade stops while you are pushing the cutter forward.  Courtesy of Amazon Vine, I received this Remington HC5950 Touch Control Haircut Kit for review. Overall I like the trimmer and have used it to replace another Remington that I had for several years for my weekly use. Here are the pros and cons that I have used it in the last six weeks (so six times).  Pros:  - This is cordless, and it does make trimming quite a bit more natural when compared to my corded model.  - Since it is brand new, the battery holds a very good amount of juice. Since my weekly trimming is only 5 minutes long each, I have yet to deplete the battery after a full charge since I received it. The claim of 40 minute runtime is likely to be true.  - The blades are indeed very sharp. However, I have to note that many new trimmers on the market feature these so-called self-sharpening titanium coated blades.  - I like the fact that there are three different motor speed, although so far I have always stayed on the lowest in my actual use. In terms of testing, I did notice that the higher speed seems to cut smoother. But of course, you trade run time since this is battery-powered.  - One comb to do them all. Although this trimmer is shipped with three combs: fixed 1.5mm, variable 2-23mm, and 22-42mm, in my routine I only need the middle comb. That means I don&#x27;t need to change combs at all.  Cons:  - No tapered comb. The one thing I really miss from my old corded model is the pair of tapered combs. This makes cutting the side (around the ears) a bit difficult.  - The touch buttons are a touch too touch-sensitive. :O The length of the comb is adjusted by a motorized clip, which in turn is controlled by two touch-sensitive buttons (like your laptop&#x27;s trackpad). I already had to reset the trimmer two timesso far to reset the touch sensitivity, or else I can trigger those buttons in the air, as far as over a quarter inch.  - The reason I am not sure this will last long is this: you still need to take out the comb to clean it. However, given the motorized design, there is only a very small clip of plastic (one on each side) to hold the comb to the trimmer. I am quite concerned that they will break easily. Only time can tell.  Bottomline: I find this to be a high quality product. The construction is sturdy, and the rubberized surface adds to the grip. The cons I listed about are all either very minor (touch) or very common (no tapered combs). That&#x27;s why I think this is worth a solid 5/5.</li>
    <li> After a month of regular use for haircuts and beard trimming, this is officially my favorite clipper.  It is by far-and-away the most comfortable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have no issues at all with the guard digging or the blade biting into my skin.  The digital adjustment system is quick and easy, allowing for different lengths on the side and top without changing guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is thick, you will, however, have to regularly remove the guard to empty the accumulated hair.  The guard traps it in rather than letting it fall to the floor.  This seems to me to be a small price to pay for the comfort and adjustability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent, as I have come to expect from Remington products.  The clippers have a solid feel, without being too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is a little short, but I can get one full haircut and a beard trim without having to recharge.  If you do let the battery run down, it runs fine with the cord plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the manual, at least until the controls get familiar (mainly remembering how to switch the display from guide numbers to mm).  Also, the only difference between the \\&quot;B\\&quot; and \\&quot;C\\&quot; settings are the increments by which the guard is adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are well worth the cost, and - for home use - compete very well with the professional, corded clippers we own.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about this product.  It was so cool how it electronically moves the attachment and speed.  However, be sure to lock it every time or you will accidentally cut off one side of your mustache.  Very sensitive controls... That is not why only 3 star.  I still use and like my original Remington PG-400 All in one shaver (no longer available - bought over 3 years ago which is a very good lifespan).</li>
    <li> Pros-&lt;br /&gt;nice looking (cool digital display)&lt;br /&gt;easy to use (once you get the hang of it)&lt;br /&gt;cordless&lt;br /&gt;ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;cuts hair efficiently ( I didn&#x27;t cut anybodys ears off, hurray!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;digital display took some time to figure out (ok so I didnt read the directions!)&lt;br /&gt;heavier than a corded model (may cause fatigue with use with multiple rugrats)&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable battery life questionable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall seems like a good value for the occasional user</li>
    <li> The Remington HC5950 has a great shape which lends itself to an ease of shaving all body areas quickly and sharply. While we didn&#x27;t use all the heads, the ones we did added to the overall ease of a clean even shade.</li>
    <li> well so far its OK but it is a bit heavier for a portable product.&lt;br /&gt;i do like the attachments, the micro usb charger (heck i can charge it from my cell charger on the road if needed!), and it comes apart with one button for easy cleaning. the lcd read out is also clear and easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the buttons and combinations are alot so make sure to read the manuals... and of course lube! metal against metal that vibrate needs lube. so be sure to lube it up after uses..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;time will tell about the battery life as well as a few other options on there.&lt;br /&gt;stay tuned..</li>
    <li> I am a completely amateur haircutter (in other words, I&#x27;ve never done it in my life.) However, with an 8-year-old son whose hair seems to grow like a weed, I decided I would take the chance and attempt cutting it myself with this trimmer. (After all, boy&#x27;s haircuts are the easiest and hard to mess up.) This kit worked fantastic. I liked that I was able to choose the lengths that the professionals use at the haircutting place (#2, #3). I ended up giving him a very nice haircut (a modified mohawk) and it came out wonderfully. I was impressed with how easy it was to cut with the trimmer and once I got over my fear that I was going to leave bald spots all over his head, things went quickly. I cleaned and oiled the blades after use so I expect it to work as just as well in the future. I think this product will save me a lot of money in the long run, and perhaps I can even convince my husband to let me cut his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it included was a \\&quot;first time guide\\&quot; to cutting hair -- telling you where to start or what lengths to use to achieve a desired look. Once I get better at it, I plan on giving him a \\&quot;buzz and blend.\\&quot; Recommended.</li>
    <li> When I first orderd this trimmer, I had visions of trimming my dog (Lhasa Apso) with it.  However, my fiance saw the package when it came in the mail and declared it a dog free zone.  If it touched the dog, it would not touch his beard.  This is a man frequently mistaken for Santa a few weeks after a beard trim so I was more than happy to let him \\&quot;claim\\&quot; it as long as he talked to me as he used it.  Then it sat on the bathroom counter, plugged in and charged, for the next several weeks.  I read the instructions and played with the settings.  It&#x27;s very nice because it gives you the option of selecting barber values (use a number 3) or length (1/4 inch).  I set it for barber values.  A simple touch on the up and down arrows adjusts the guard.  It comes with two different guards and a switch on the side to let the trimmer know which guard is installed.  When you are ready to trim, lock the guard in place and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this review probably hasn&#x27;t told you what you REALLY want to know.  How well does it shave.  My fiance finally used it for the first time last night and I can promise you it will never get near the dog.  He has had a thick, coarse beard for more than 20 years and has gone through MANY trimmers.  He declared this trimmer to be the best he has ever used.  The cut was smooth and clean with no pulling or tugging on the beard.  His beard was pretty long so he set it on #1 and trimmed it very short.  The cut was even and looked like he had just been to the barber.  He said it had lots of power and was suprised because it&#x27;s a cordless shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final assessment:  quick charging; easy to program; sharp and powerful.  I recommend it and might have to invest in another one so I can use it on my dog.</li>
    <li> I grabbed this less as a haircut, but more for beard maintenance. My previous version, also a Remington, seemed to get easily overwhelmed if you are trimming off too much at once. This one, however, seemed more industrial and ready for what ever you bring to it. I am not a hairstylist, or want to cut my own hair, but having it for as a beard trimmer is very nice. Its clean and straight each time and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch controls are nice to the eye, but not very necessary. At times they are even confusing. The charge, once full has a very good life which is nice and can work off the plug if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as a beard trimmer, I would recommend this. There are accessories that aid towards haircutting length and not beard length, so some adjustments need to be made if that is your intentions.</li>
    <li> Awesome device, I love using it every day. Even though it&#x27;s not available in Canada, I chose this because it really is the best. Amazon rocks as always.</li>
    <li> Not really supper great, if you are looking for the stubble look on your face then with no size. but it&#x27;s not stubble stubble look like you want. It&#x27;s just ok. Nothing super. works and oohhh wow amazing how it adjusts on the fly.... NOT... who cares?</li>
    <li> Like others have said it&#x27;s overly complicated: instead of the tried-and-true plastic piece that&#x27;s clearly labeled with the length of cut, you have to choose one of three plastic pieces, toggle a lever to \\&quot;A, B, or C\\&quot;, and then push an electronic button up or down to \\&quot;dial in\\&quot; the length. If you get any one of the three wrong you&#x27;ll have no idea how short it&#x27;s going to cut. And like others have said it&#x27;s way too sensitive: \\&quot;dialing in\\&quot; the length is a frustrating game of push the button fast then slow then soft then hard and then turn it on really quick to lock in the correct length because otherwise it&#x27;s going to keep going shorter and longer on it&#x27;s own. Then once you have it running don&#x27;t grip the smooth-as-glass plastic case too tight or you&#x27;ll unknowingly flip the \\&quot;A, B, or C\\&quot; lever (that&#x27;s conveniently located exactly where a right-handed person&#x27;s fingers rest) to a shorter setting and start cutting bald spots in the back of your kid&#x27;s head. If you can deal with that frustration without throwing this thing against the wall then you find out the plastic pieces are so bulky and wide that it won&#x27;t cut hair within about 1/2\\&quot; of your ear no matter which way you point it. If you are in need of a hair clipper and this is your only option I would suggest cutting your hair with scissors; chances are the result will be just as good as what this thing produces, and you&#x27;ll save $50. This must&#x27;ve been developed by a bald guy. It is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is one fancy hair cutting tool. The instructions were a bit confusing, but once I got it figured out the thing is pretty cool. It has an LED display that shows the three speed levels, the amount of time left on the charge (You have about 40 minutes) and the length setting for each of three combs. As you press the buttons for up and down the comb rises or decends, so the length of your cut can be longer or shorter. I love the sleek look of it and the high tech features. The only problem is that it&#x27;s very easy to press the up or down button by accident which could have some pretty disastrous results if you are cutting someone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plain old fashioned hair cutter is probably easier to use and certainly easier to figure out initially, but if you like the newest highly engineered products, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy using this hair clipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the happiest with this product, it seems to be ok, but the controls are finicky, my first hair cut made me bald, the shut off switch is not there and the instructions make it impossible to understand.  Some such a inavaded creation, it isn&#x27;t user friendly and is had to use. Clippers should be as easy as 1-2-3, this is as easy as 1-2-3-.........99-100.</li>
    <li> I have been using the HC5950 once a week for the past month without any of the attachments to give myself as close a haircut as possible. It has not been necessary to charge it more than once and the battery display still shows about 20 minutes remaining. I also run it at the lowest power setting. Also purchased at the same time was the Conair HC1100. The Conair seems much more powerful. In fact, I almost feel as though I&#x27;m going to nick myself, again without using the attachments. Contrary to the negative reviews, I have had no problems with the digital display and accidentally changing one of the settings -- again, though, I don&#x27;t use the attachments. Once the clipper is running with the locked switch, you cannot change the settings accidentally, so I fail to see why users are having problems. In unlocked mode, it is easy to change the settings accidentally; however, the clipper will not run in this mode. Whether it is the less powerful motor (my impression) of the Remington vs the Conair, or the lower power setting I am using, I find that the Remington gives a more comfortable haircut than the Conair.  I like the versatility of being able to charge from either a wall outlet or my computer, as this was purchased with travel in mind. As others have mentioned, the travel bag is too small -- not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I see that in Europe Remington sells a lithium powered hair clipper HC5780 which they don&#x27;t seem to be offering in the U.S. I would have preferred this to the NiMh battery, which the Conair and the HC5780 have.Too soon to tell how long the NiMh battery will last.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t get all the complaints- this thing is *not* that hard to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have your touch control for length, and then you have a switch on the side to start cutting *and* lock the touch controls. That&#x27;s it... How complicated is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it a bunch of times, so far it works great, I only wish it was washable, but, oh well. The head comes off now (in older models it would kind of extend out so you can clean inside), which is a big plus, and is much easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch controls are amazing! We used to have to physically raise and lower the comb every time, now it is so simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that hair still gets stuck in those combs (for those of us who are thick haired). Can get annoying at times, but not unbearable, and I find it easier to handle than switching combs all the time for different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still charges off of USB, which is SO comfortable (I used to just charge it with my phone charger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a *great* machine for the amateur &amp;#34;cut your hair at home&amp;#34; kind of person, just set the length and cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far (which is just fine, I&#x27;m not running a hair salon, after all), so I&#x27;ll keep this up to date if it ever breaks down.</li>
    <li> The design of the razor is very high end looking and the touch screen panel definitely makes it feel more fancy. Sometimes the screen is a pain if it gets a drop of water on it or something, but for the most part the screen has given me no problem. Like other reviews have mentioned the only grief causing part is the razor guard and its tendency to trap the cut hair near the razor so that you have to take it off to empty it every so often.  It&#x27;s not so annoying that I hate the product, I still think it&#x27;s an amazing razor (hence the five stars) but it is still something that could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the design, I love that there are only two razor guards to chose from, making storage and cleanup much easier. The adjustable guards are really what make this product. The different speed functions are great, although to be honest I forget they are there most the time so I rarely use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the cut is great as well. After having this razor for almost a year, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with a faulty razor pulling my hair or anything like that. I&#x27;ve only recently used this to shave my own head where as before I had a friend do it but I&#x27;m even more impressed of the quality of this razor after doing so. Other razors I&#x27;ve used were awkward to use on my own head but for some reason this one didn&#x27;t seem as hard to use on my own and I was able to give myself a nice clean mid length cut (something I was never able to do before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing razor and despite its little flaw I still think it deserves a five star as I&#x27;ve never used a better one than this and definitely is a bargain for the price I got it for ($30 I think)</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s plugged in or not, it randomly shuts off!!!</li>
    <li> This POS already broken, can&#x27;t hold a charge. This is the second shaver/electric razor I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon that has battery issues. Used it twice in 3 months and on the 2nd time it&#x27;s broken. Of course, it&#x27;s outside of amazon&#x27;s return policy. Will be taking business off Amazon.</li>
    <li> Its a nice idea for sure. But I think theres a reason these things have not changed drastically in many years, and thats because there is too much to go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;When it did work, it frequently would adjust its own length while clipping even when locked. Fortunately I was cutting a 6yo&#x27;s hair who really didn&#x27;t care if I cut it too short, in fact he insisted I shave it as close to the skin as possible. It made him happy that the thing&#x27;s settings went to short, and it grew out to a decent length in a week or so, but if it were for an adult I could see someone being a very unhappy camper.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it refuses to turn off and smokes, probably not the healthiest thing to be breathing but i&#x27;m afraid to put it any where I can&#x27;t see if it catches on fire. It&#x27;s sitting in the sink just in case. I would like to just take a sledge hammer to it to make it stop...&lt;br /&gt;My final opinion? Stick with the normal standard clippers and save yourself the hassle. These things didnt even last for 5 hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Not a Pro motor, but plenty good for 1 person. Make sure to charge fully after getting!</li>
    <li> Had a Remington in the past and was hoping for the same quality. Unfortuantely the engine is rather weak and it takes twice as much time to get the job done. The tech gymics are nice, but not important after you cut your hair the first time.</li>
    <li> This razor has a huge learning curve and takes a while to get used to.  I would forget what mm setting I used the time before......it&#x27;s not as easy as just popping a few clips on and off.  But, the biggest reason why I don&#x27;t like this (and am returning it) is that after just (4) uses it stopped working.  All it would do is make a loud high-pitched buzzing sound when I attempted to turn it on. I contacted Remington and they recommended I return it.</li>
    <li> These cool looking clippers will get the job done on touch up jobs or short hair, but they are not up to snuff on really thick, coarse hair.  My husband has super coarse hair, and I had to go over some spots more than once to get a good, clean cut.  They are still a good pair of clippers, but you could probably get an even better pair for a little more money.</li>
    <li> I found the \\&quot;Remington HC5950 Touch Control\\&quot; clipper to be a very sophisticated model over the typical corded/cordless models that I&#x27;ve owned in the past ([[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]], [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]], and [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1) The trimmer is operated completely by digital touch screens (no buttons or switches) which is HUGE upgrade over anything I&#x27;ve ever seen on the market.  You can turn it on/off, adjust the trimmer height and cutting speed, and more all at the touch of a button - AND - you can lock these settings while you are trimming so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change mid-cut.&lt;br /&gt;** Of course, you pay for the technology upgrades, as this model retails up to twice the cost of standard trimmers, but in my opinion the price is definitely worth it.  It&#x27;s always better to pay a higher price ONCE for quality than bleed money on lower cost products.&lt;br /&gt;2) Being able to change the guard height at a single touch - and having it lock in at that level - is phenominally helpful!  No more stopping to adjust the height and/or bumping the adjustment lever causing the blade to lower/raise by accident.&lt;br /&gt;3) The three guards that come with the trimmer are high-quality, smoked plastic which looks sharper than you&#x27;d get from cheaper models and are more wear-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;4) I haven&#x27;t used it very much, but I didn&#x27;t notice that the unit got quite as hot as other trimmers that I&#x27;ve owned.  Some of the cheaper models get EXTREMELY warm during a simple trim job.&lt;br /&gt;5) I found the trimmer to be very lightweight (for a rechargeable) and I liked the feel of the trimmer in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;6) The fact that it is rechargeable is clearly a positive over having to fight with the stupid cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1) In my opinion, the actual usage of the trimmer was similar to any of the other less expensive trimmers that I&#x27;ve used for the past 10 years.  You are still required to trim from several different directions to ensure all the hair is cut.  This isn&#x27;t tedious or time-consuming - its simply a fact of life when using a mechanical hair trimmer and something that you will experience at any salon.  I&#x27;ve NEVER owned or seen a trimmer that cuts all hair to a constant length in one pass - NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m not sure why there are three different speed settings.  Everyone knows that the fastest setting cuts the best so why would you used a slower cutting speed?  This seems like an option that almost no one would regularly use.&lt;br /&gt;3) Although the trimmer is USB-capable, I&#x27;m not sure if this option is a positive or just a novelty.  I guess if you were on a trip, you could just bring along one USB outlet and use this to recharge multiple devices (including the trimmer) so that might be handy.  However, the plug is small and when you are at home, I don&#x27;t see you plugging it into your computer very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1) Hair continually gets stuck in the guards.  I did not see any way around this and was constantly pulling hair out of the smallest guard in order to ensure that it cut right.  The larger guards were not quite as bad.&lt;br /&gt;2) The carrying bag that is shipped with the product is not large enough to carry all the guards, the cord and plug, the instructions - AND - the clipper.  I see this as a major detraction as the clipper and its accessories cannot be stored together which will ultimately result in the mishandling/disappearance of one or the other.  Considering the cost, I shouldn&#x27;t have to use the carrying case of another (cheaper) product for my brand new clipper.&lt;br /&gt;3) It was not super easy for me to change the guards.  It is very obvious how to snap the guards into the trimmer and they stay put, which is good, but it was counter-intuitive on how they needed to be removed and the included instruction manual did not adequately describe the maneuver for removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the positives of the \\&quot;Remington HC5950 Touch Control Haircut Kit\\&quot; far outweigh the negatives and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the look, feel, and usage of this product!id not adequately describe the maneuver for removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the positives of the \\&quot;Remington HC5950 Touch Control Haircut Kit\\&quot; far outweigh the negatives and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the look, feel, and usage of this product!</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. Amazing idea to have the electronic control over the trim which allows you to just have one blade guide instead of the typical hair trimmer that comes with a dizzying array of cutter guides that your bound to lose sooner or later or never use in the first place. This trimmer seem to be made very well and is very ergonomically designed. I&#x27;ve been able to keep my own hair trimmed very nicely thus making far fewer trips to the barber. This trimmer easily pays for itself!</li>
    <li> I currently have both a beard and a short hair cut, so I was very excited when I was going to get a chance to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There where a lot of really cool features, that excited me.  Electronically adjustable cutting lengths, light up display screen to see your settings, titanium coated blades, and a charging system that can uses a simple mini usb cable as a cord.  But it just doesn&#x27;t come together for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, to use the adjustable cutting lengths you have to use one of three blade guards, depending on the length you want to be able to adjust to, a little bit of a hassle.  When you adjust the blades you can choose between setting listed in barber sizes of millimeters, kind of cool.  But the adjustments are still imprecise, you don&#x27;t just press the button and the guard moves ot the next length.  You have to press and hold it until it gets to the length you want, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem that precise.  I mean, ye sin the long run, the difference may be tiny, but I would prefer if the sizes were just set, and you adjusted form one to another.  Also the process for adjusting the length should be more intuitive, I actually had to open and read the manual, to figure out how to do it.  Yes, not a big deal, but I think the process could be simpler and easier to understand.  While the blades are titanium coated, and they seemed to cut fine I was not impressed by the blade motor.  While my hair still cut fine I just felt like the motor was straining to get it all done.  I realize this is just my personal opinion, but I think all the like electronic enhancements get lost when you don&#x27;t get a satisfying cut from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until they maybe beef up this product I would wait on ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have any questions about the product feel free to leave a comment below and I will do my best to answer.</li>
    <li> I WANTED to love these, as I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair for over a year.  He is super picky, and previously spent $20-$30 every 4-6 weeks getting his hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to clip horses when I was 10.  I owned a yorkie for almost 13 that I regularly groomed myself (because his skin was super sensitive and I was annoyed he&#x27;d come home with rashes), heck, I have even shaved down our long haired cat.  Cut my husbands hair? Pshh I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress. Anyway - I wanted to love these because they cut down on clutter, don&#x27;t need to be plugged in to work (actually its recommended they aren&#x27;t) and they seem like such a cool idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband saw the USB cord and became nervous. How fancy are these clippers!  Well, for the record, as far as I&#x27;m concerned the USB is just for looks or I guess it could be useful if you travel a lot but I&#x27;m not exactly sure why the cord wouldn&#x27;t be just as useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three \\&quot;blade guards\\&quot;, each with a length purpose with a pretty wide range (stubble, longer styles, shorter styles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used these, they were great. Then I went to adjust them...and they did their own thing.  From there on out, It was a constant fight. I&#x27;d select \\&quot;4\\&quot; and they&#x27;d move to \\&quot;5.5\\&quot;, I&#x27;d select \\&quot;6\\&quot; and they&#x27;d move to \\&quot;7\\&quot;....I was constantly trying to argue with them the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, hair kept getting trapped in the guard which was annoying. I kept having to stop to clean it, and then argue with the clippers about the length - vicious cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for this, I would love these. I saw another reviewer was having the same issue, so its good to know I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until these bugs are worked out, I can&#x27;t recommend.  I spent more time arguing with the clippers then I would have if I had used my old set that had I switch out the clips.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool contraption.  It has a nice quality feel and heft to it, yet not too heavy.  There is a smooth surface for the controls, but the rest of it is coated in that nice silicone veneer like modern cellphones.  I&#x27;ve never accidentally dropped this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The 3 included blades attach and detach very easily.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I&#x27;m not big on reading instructions, but with this little high tech hair gizmo I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  There are a a few electronic features that you just don&#x27;t find on standard hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The settings screen is very easy to read even outside in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The power adjustment of the clipper length is super easy and very precise, much more precise than I personally need it to be.  It can flip back and forth between mm and barber #.  The switch lock keeps it in place so you don&#x27;t accidentally change it while you&#x27;re cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially due to my youngest kid&#x27;s aversion to getting his hair cut, it&#x27;s takes a lot longer to cut his hair with all the pauses (and there&#x27;s a lot more of it).  Also since his hair was so long, it frequently clogged the clippers, and I had to remove his hair from between the attachment blades to keep going.  I was able to comfortably get two full haircuts on my 2 kids (spaced 2 weeks apart) off one initial charge with a little left over.  One has fine hair and the other coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS:  The charger is great, it&#x27;s rated at 1 amp (fast), but has a little plastic tab so you can only use it for the clipper.  (However, if you don&#x27;t care about warranty, it&#x27;d be pretty easy to shave off the tab and use it as a charger that works on any mini-HDMI input device.)  ALSO, it comes with an additional standard USB to mini-HDMI cable, so you could charge this clipper from your computer if you want to.  Maybe Remington should have called this an iClipper :-o</li>
    <li> I thought these clippers would be much more advanced than your standard manual control ones. In the positive side, it is lightweight, recharges and it is easy to change the settings. On the bad side, if you have thick hair, even if you start out at the highest setting and work your way down to the lower settings, hair gets clumped in the blades and in the guide. This means while cutting the hair, you have to stop frequently to clean the hair out or else the clippers are useless.</li>
    <li> I have used this haircut kit weekly and it does a good job of cutting.  It is a great advantage not to have a cord to get in the way.  The attachments are quite different from the typical corded cutter.  It took a little adjustment to get used to them.  In the past year I have used the Wahl, Conair, and Remington cutter kits.  Though the Wahl and Remington kits do a good job, they cost twice what the Conair does.  All the cutter blades dull with usage and for that reason I prefer the Conair kits.  Once the blades dull and the cutter starts pulling its time to throw it away and get another one.  The much lower cost of the Conair makes it the best choice.</li>
    <li> My grandfather was a barber and my pop always had great tools.  This reminds me of those tools but not the price. They have three speeds and are variable.  They are not big and clumsy, they fit in a lady&#x27;s hand quite nicely, and do the job. Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact they are cordless.  Be sure to charge it up as soon as you get it.  If you feel uncomfortable about cutting hair, this is a nice tool for between visits to the barber.  I used it on my nephew, around the back of the neck and the sideburn areas and it worked well and spruced up his look.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used several different Wahl plug-in hair clippers over the past 15 years as well as the cordless [[ASIN:B004QWVY8A Philips Norelco QC5530 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper]].  The Philips is designed for do-it-yourself haircuts; otherwise we prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cordless Remington does a fine job of cutting hair.  It is a nice size, and the cordless makes things easier - now instead of sitting near an outlet in the bathroom, we can cut hair outside for easier cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the blade speeds; even on high the blades are a little less powerful than our plug-ins, but still cut fine.  When turned on and cutting, the cutting length buttons on the top are disabled, which is a nice touch to prevent accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is fancier than our others; there are only 3 combs vs. about 10 for the Wahl, and the clipper can adjust the distance the comb is from the blades to adjust hair length.  This doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the Wahl combs, and hair sometimes accumulates behind the comb necessitating popping it off to dump out the hair, but overall it&#x27;s more convenient than digging around for the right comb.  You can set a switch to which comb you are using (A, B or C) and the digital readout shows the cutting length.  We do miss the behind the ear tapering combs though that are included with many other clippers, and these combs seem a little too flexible.  Hopefully they will last - if not we&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice touch is you can charge this from a wall power outlet or USB plug.  It also includes a little tube of lubricating oil to drop onto the blades occasionally - enough to last for years for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice cordless clipper that works great for typical haircuts.</li>
    <li> I know it is a haircut clipper and I use it for that.  I don&#x27;t completely shave my head, leaving just stubble, but have been using the same electric Oster for over 20 years, it still works like a charm, oiling the blades regularly.  I also use the Oster to trim my beard and goatee.  But the Oster is now my backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new king is the Remington HC5950.  It charges very quickly.  The Remington is not very intuitive, you will need to read the instructions.  Once I figured out how to use it I was impressed.  It went very quickly through the hair on my head but what really impressed me was how easily it handled my thick beard.  I have a goatee but it is not unusual for me to let my beard grow for a month or two.  I have one of the thickest beards you will ever see, it destroys single blade razors before you finish shaving, I often get beard hair splinters in my hands, literally having to pull them out with tweezers, I&#x27;m not joking.  You could make Brillo pads out of my beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Remington HC5950 to cut off my beard and trim my goatee, the included attachments came in handy for that also.  The Remington went through my beard like butter, NOT ONE SNAG, and that was using the slowest motor speed!  I honestly did not think a cordless clipper would be strong enough to handle my beard but it did and quickly.  If the Remington HC5950 can handle my beard it can handle anything you throw at it. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is a little tricky to use. My husband accidently cut his hair way to short on one side with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used many trimmers previously, but I will admit this was a bit tricky to use at first and required a bit of futzing (unless you take the time to thoroughly read the manual). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t seem to get the power level to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; even though it is supposed to unless I simply waited for it to lock on its own. Overall, it was quick and efficient when I assisted my partner in shaving the back of his neck, etc. It does everything I want it to do with no surprises, comes apart easily for cleaning, is cordless (yay!), and comfortable to use. So far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase, more that my friend expect to get, even when it was not for me i am considering get me one too</li>
    <li> Real nice but little hard to understand on setting and features.</li>
    <li> We stopped paying for haircuts for my balding husband years ago.  In the past we have bought Remington and Wahl haircutting blades.  His old Remington was getting worn so I was excited to try the NEW Remington HC5950. At first, I have to admit, we were both intimidated by the state-of-the-art control panel.  And a USB charger? But then we used it and it worked great ! It took about 90 minutes to fully charge (we used plug-in vs USB).  The two improvements we noted in the NEW Remington cutter was that 1. blade seemed sharper thus yielding a closer cut and 2. there was less vibrations which again led to a closer hair cut.  It is also noticeably quieter.  And the cordless action makes it easier to use as well.  I am not sure if ALL of the bells and whistles are actually necessary but if the electronics is what allows for a quieter, less shaky hair cut, then I am for it.  I would recommend this haircut kit.  You can save a ton of money cutting your hair at home especially if your husband&#x27;s hair is like mine! We simply used the shortest blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this haircut kit a month now and have tried it out twice and overall i am very happy and have had no issues at all with it. If your looking for a quality, easy to use cordless haircut kit this is definitely one i can recommend. Here are my observations during my time with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) 3 combs (1.5mm , 3-23mm, and 22-42mm). The combs themselves are well made and durable even though they are made from clear plastic. I wouldnt have any fears of them breaking. They were easy to attach and remove as well.&lt;br /&gt;(2) touch buttons were both positioned well and tuned perfectly. Not too responsive or unresponsive to touches; with increments of .5mm per touch. Dont worry about accidentally pressing the touch buttons, the only way the trimmer starts running is when you turn the switch on the side, which locks the touch buttons.&lt;br /&gt;(3) very high quality feeling device and despite its size , handles nicely and isnt too burdensome.&lt;br /&gt;(4) one minor thing was since there is a display showing the mm&#x27;s being used and 3 different combs, you have to adjust a switch on the left each time you change a comb so that it shows the proper mm being used on the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other tidbits:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with case, small brush and oil tube.&lt;br /&gt;it can charge via usb (though it takes quite long), or via ac adaptor (~90minutes).&lt;br /&gt;It has a barbershop numbering system as well, instead of the default mm if you prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;Display turns off automatically 10 seconds after motor is turned off.</li>
    <li> Excellent machine for his price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer a few times since I got it, but so far I like it. This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve used (although my husband has used a few), so I&#x27;m not an expert, but here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;+ This unit can be used cordless which makes it a lot easier to maneuver than a corded model.&lt;br /&gt;+ It holds a good amount of charge.&lt;br /&gt;+ The blades are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;+ The unit has three speeds to choose from. Since I&#x27;m still new to using a trimmer, I&#x27;ve only used the lowest speed for actually cutting hair, but it&#x27;s nice to have a speed option.&lt;br /&gt;+ You can charge it through a USB port, which is great if you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The touch buttons are located on the handle and are very sensitive. When I first started using the trimmer, I would constantly bump them. I&#x27;m working on finding a good, comfortable way to hold it so I don&#x27;t bump the buttons.</li>
    <li> I like using my own clippers instead of going to the barber every two weeks.  However, since I&#x27;m usually doing my hair, I find that I&#x27;m rather picky with them.  Remington impressed me with their new HC5950... at least in their product page.  However, I was less than impressed with the product once I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNBOXING:&lt;br /&gt;Simple packaging, both cardboard and plastic clamshell.  You get the clippers, three attachments, a brush, clipper oil, a bag and the instructions.  Nothing too hard to take out, or put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;You really should read the instructions before using this clipper system.  Yes, most can probably get it after monkeying with it for a few minutes, but would you really try to use something on your hair that you can&#x27;t work right?  Not me.  Anyway, once you&#x27;ve read the instructions, you&#x27;ll note the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- fully charge the clippers before use&lt;br /&gt;- the touch system works incrementally, A is the 0.1mm increments, B is th 0.5 increments and C is only for the large clipper attachment.&lt;br /&gt;- you cannot run the clippers unless it is in the locked position&lt;br /&gt;- there are three clipper speed settings to use on your hair&lt;br /&gt;- blades should not get wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve got that down, just choose the conversion from the regular plastic attachments to the mm settings--it&#x27;s in the instruction book, and you&#x27;re good to go.  The clippers can go for about 40 min cutting before needing a recharge, but usually it takes much less to cut your (well mine at least) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are a few good points on this model: 1) it&#x27;s usb rechargeable, 2) it&#x27;s cordless, 3) it only has 3 attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found more bad points: 1) Hair clippings get stuck in the attachments when anything but a 1mm setting is used, 2) You need to go over the same place multiple times at different angles to cut all the hair to the same length (big problem), 3) changing sizes of attachments take longer than switching out standard shields because you have to reprogram (push the buttons) the clipper to get it to a different size shield, 4) Unless you use the fastest speed setting, it will not cut through coarse/thick hair, 5) there are no scissors to trim bangs or around the ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;So Remington upped its game with a touch control and cordless hair clipper system.  It&#x27;s probably better technology than the corded version with the multiple attachment shields.  However, when it comes to cutting hair, this just doesn&#x27;t do it very well.  I have a $20 Wahl clipper system that has all the cut sizing shields that I can cut faster (changing two to three shields instead of reprogramming), more efficiently (I only have to cut over a section of hair once, twice at most), and cleaner (no hair gets stuck in the clipper) than the HC5950.  I think this is a \\&quot;good\\&quot; trimmer, but if you want a better trimmer, skip all the gadgets and get a standard Wahl.</li>
    <li> We have several different razors (corded and cordless) that I use to shave my husbands head and this is my favorite. Sometimes I find cordless razors just aren&#x27;t as powerful as the corded ones I have but this isn&#x27;t the case with this razor. It&#x27;s quite powerful and it has 3 different speeds. I had no problems shaving his head which he lets grow out for a few weeks. He likes it short (usually a #1 or no guard on some razors). The guards easily slide on/off this so it makes cleaning it quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has some really unique features that I haven&#x27;t seen on any other razor. One is the adjustable levels by just hitting the up/down arrows. The razor itself only comes with 3 combs/guards because that is all you need with this as you can adjust the levels to almost any level you can imagine so you can really customize the cut. You can use the typical #1, #2, #3 that you would ask the barber for or you dial in to the MM. It would really make getting a nice fade easy since you can easily select which level you want without having to change the combs (and have to worry about storing 15 combs). The other feature that was really different is the touch interface. There aren&#x27;t any buttons or switches on the front but its all a touch interface. It was very easy to use and responsive. It also will \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the display when you are cutting so you don&#x27;t accidentally move the comb up/down while cutting. It is also charges using USB so I can use any charger since I have an abundance of those around the house. it charges quite fast (about 1.5 hours) and it runs for quite a while without having to recharge and it still has full power after using it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is also nice and light and easy to grip. I would recommend this for anyone who wants trimmed or short hair as there are so many features.</li>
    <li> This trimmer gives a good cut, once you get it working.  I had to reset the device 3 times (it&#x27;s like a little computer!) to get it to work properly.  The trimmer has a function that lets you set the cutting length electronically.  Unfortunately it insisted on resetting to the shortest setting all the time, until I \\&quot;rebooted\\&quot; it.  Most of the settings are accessed via a touchscreen type of interface.  It&#x27;s very sensitive and hard to use if you&#x27;re slightly clumsy of finger.  I&#x27;d personally prefer mechanical adjustments that stay where you put them.  I think this trimmer is going for the &#x27;neat&#x27; factor and is just way more complicated than it needs to be.  Give me a sharp set of blades and some trimming guides and I&#x27;d be all set.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Strong motor which can be set to Low-Medium-High depending on the thickness of hairs being cut.&lt;br /&gt;- LCD readout of battery-time remaining.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The various hair-length guides get stuffed-up with hair when cutting and are time consuming to clean up than anything. Hence these clippers are now regulated to be used only when I want to completely shave my head clean during the summer time. The rest of the time, I&#x27;ll opt for haircuts instead.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not your old family hair clipper. This has digital controls, and adjustments of the 3 plastic extensions that come with it, to customize the length of the cut you&#x27;re making. You charge it and it&#x27;s cordless, which helps get around the head you&#x27;re working on (even your own!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND the cutter does a nice, clean job - the blades are sharp (don&#x27;t forget to lubricate them once in a while with the oil that comes with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is with the instruction book: it tells you how to use the controls (to some extent) but there&#x27;s nothing at all about how best to use the machine to give a haircut. I mean, you can set the plastic extensions for a given length, but how about some advice on the best techniques for a great haircut - and how to cut different lengths and finishes for both men and women (and kids)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The assumption is, I guess, that you know how to cut hair with clippers, and they&#x27;re just going to tell you about the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare this to the other haircutting device I have - a vacuum-cleaner attachment that sucks your hair into the tube and cuts it at a length you determine. That instruction book had detailed advice on how to do a cut - and how to get the best cut - and included picture pages and blank lines where you could write in the lengths to set for a friend or loved one&#x27;s best length and look over their entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about the Robocut (vacuum) device is that it doesn&#x27;t cut the ends cleanly. Maybe because it&#x27;s a rotary blade, it tends to break the hair off. My wife and I solved this by using the cutter to get the length right for each other, then went over the haircut by hand, with haircutting scissors, trimming the ragged ends. Works - but is time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d hoped the Remington clippers would do a cleaner, simpler, better cut, but what I have is what seems to be a well-made clipper with three plastic attachments, that I will have to figure out by trial and error - since there are no instructions on how to do a cut. Trial and error is NOT what you want in a haircut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - four stars for the digital-touch-control device - and a star off for a poor instruction booklet.since there are no instructions on how to do a cut.
