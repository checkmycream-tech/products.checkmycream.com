      <li>so pinks tend to work best.</li>
      <li>and it works perfectly with my lips.</li>
      <li>Happy to have found some!!</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>This is the best lipstick/lip balm I ever had!</li>
      <li>OMG is WONDERFUL! :)</li>
      <li>I received the Covergirl Coral Gloss on time, in good condition and was as described.  </li>
      <li>Love this color!  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it, its perfect!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lip balm!</li>
      <li>They smell fantastic (like cotton candy), have SPF, and the colors are great.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing too.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a nice smell too.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice tint on the lips when you put it on and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip product, but was discontinued.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m going to keep looking to buy more of these</li>
      <li>and i prefer more lighter shades.</li>
      <li>This red is perfect with my cute summer red-and-navy outfits.</li>
      <li>I lost all hope of getting any more until I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It gives the perfect sheer coral color without being too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>LOVE how it glides on your lips.</li>
      <li>Light weight with a pop of color.  </li>
      <li>I received a free sample from bzz agent.</li>
      <li>The colours are great, they last and really make your lips feel smooth.</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked was the smell and package.</li>
      <li>Plus, it arrived super fast!</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and soft, and the smell of it</li>
      <li>The color I got was coral and I was thinking it would be more red</li>
      <li>I would recommend this lip balm to anyone who wants moisturizer lips with a pop of color.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing for the lips.</li>
      <li>not very pigmented, more sparkles then</li>
      <li>I really, really like this lip balm.</li>
      <li>but it was more pink</li>
      <li>I just wish it added a little more color and lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Love this as I am allergic to some products, colorful and delicate at the same time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if what I got was old or if it is normally that way.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t really that moisturizing - it&#x27;s kind of gritty, applies thinly, dries up quickly, and has a faint lipstick taste and smell.</li>
      <li>Typically, the only ones that look good on me are dark, and they&#x27;re way too harsh for daytime.</li>
      <li>This sheer red is truly red, not pink, yet sheer enough for me to wear.</li>

<li> it has a little bit of color and isn&#x27;t sticky!</li>
<li> Red has always been a difficult lip color for me to pull off.</li>
<li> Also , the shade i received was , unfortunately, too dark for my taste</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like the gloss because it has a bad taste.</li>
<li> Too bad I lost it 3 days after I bought it... :(</li>
<li> I wish stupid Cover Girl hadn&#x27;t discontinued this line of lip colors.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite lip product, but was discontinued. Happy to have found some!!</li>
    <li> I wish stupid Cover Girl hadn&#x27;t discontinued this line of lip colors. They smell fantastic (like cotton candy), have SPF, and the colors are great. This sheer red is truly red, not pink, yet sheer enough for me to wear. Red has always been a difficult lip color for me to pull off. Typically, the only ones that look good on me are dark, and they&#x27;re way too harsh for daytime. So when I wear red, I&#x27;ve traditionally had to go with my standby, white lipstick. This red is perfect with my cute summer red-and-navy outfits.</li>
    <li> wish covergirl had not discontinued this brand of tinted lip balm.  The colours are great, they last and really make your lips feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from bzz agent. I did not like the taste and feel it left on my lips. The taste was just like lip sticks and i that not too pleasing. Also , the shade i received was , unfortunately, too dark for my taste and i prefer more lighter shades.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the gloss because it has a bad taste. I don&#x27;t know if what I got was old or if it is normally that way.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it, its perfect! This is the best lipstick/lip balm I ever had! The texture is smooth and soft, and the smell of it OMG is WONDERFUL! :)</li>
    <li> Light weight with a pop of color.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> You get five stars  It was what I wanted</li>
    <li> I received the Covergirl Coral Gloss on time, in good condition and was as described.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I like the product, I just wish it was a little darker going on.</li>
    <li> LOVE how it glides on your lips. It smells amazing too. I just wish it added a little more color and lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
    <li> I really, really like this lip balm. It leaves a nice tint on the lips when you put it on and goes on very smoothly. There&#x27;s a nice smell too. Too bad I lost it 3 days after I bought it... :(</li>
    <li> Love this as I am allergic to some products, colorful and delicate at the same time. Very moisturizing for the lips.</li>
    <li> I like it I bought it all the time like that it has a little bit of color and isn&#x27;t sticky!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t really that moisturizing - it&#x27;s kind of gritty, applies thinly, dries up quickly, and has a faint lipstick taste and smell. I guess my expectations might have been too high, but I&#x27;ll stick with plain Chapstick for now because my lips are constantly dry.</li>
    <li> not very pigmented, more sparkles then actual color, i was hoping it was matte. not the same color pictured but it was a coral which is what i wanted. The only thing I liked was the smell and package.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lip balm! The color I got was coral and I was thinking it would be more red but it was more pink and it works perfectly with my lips. I have tan skin so pinks tend to work best. I would recommend this lip balm to anyone who wants moisturizer lips with a pop of color.</li>
    <li> I bought this in store and I can&#x27;t get enough of it! It gives the perfect sheer coral color without being too overwhelming. Plus, it arrived super fast!</li>
    <li> I was SO upset when Covergirl discontinued this stuff! I lost all hope of getting any more until I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  I don&#x27;t wear any makeup when I have this on. And I&#x27;m going to keep looking to buy more of these</li>
