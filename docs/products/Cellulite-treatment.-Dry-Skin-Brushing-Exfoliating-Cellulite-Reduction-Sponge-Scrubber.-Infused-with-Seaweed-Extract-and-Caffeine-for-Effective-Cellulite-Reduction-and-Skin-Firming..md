<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.will buy this again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, althought I didn&#x27;t think it would when I purchased it. Smells good though!</li>
    <li> Spectacular results in less than two weeks I could already see the change in my legs. The smell and smooth touch of the sponge is absolutely delightful while using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different after shower creams before, but never with the same results.</li>
    <li> Convenient for travel if you don&#x27;t want to drag along some cellulite product. Also like to use before shaving gives a nice clean shave whether not it helps cellulite is a good question. Does anything really help cellulite topically?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me</li>
    <li> Amazed by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always in doubt about buying these type of creams. I did a research on the ingredients they used and actually the ingredients on this cream in fact help reduce cellulite. So I took a chance and placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been using this cream for 3 months now, and I notice very good results! I was very doubtful at the beginning, not thinking it will have any effect on me, but now am convince that it was worth my investment. I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been doubtful of claims made from creams but gave it a try now that I&#x27;m in my latter years and I&#x27;m not getting any younger.  I&#x27;m surprised this was able to be done with a sponge but out of the box, it smells great.  So I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 2 months now and I do see some improvements.  I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t give me back my legs when I was 19 but a little bit of slowing down or reversing the aging process will certainly make me look and feel more youthful.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working, but I love the way it feels!</li>
    <li> I just so happened to be walking by my mirror and noticed cellulite forming in my thigh ad butt area.  This was something I had to attack IMMEDIATELY!  After doing some research, I found this Anti-Cellulite Cream on Amazon.  I read all of the great reviews and decided to try it for myself.  Sooooo glad I did.  Not only does it smell great, but it has left my skin soft, smooth, supple, and scrumptious from day one!  To top it off, this stuff really works and I have forever kissed that nasty cellulite good residence!  Two thumbs up for a top notch product!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my cellulite. My $2 Walmart loofah works soooo much better!</li>
    <li> Noticeably less celulite. Hurts at first but Getz better the more you use it. No pain no gain!!</li>
    <li> Not a lotion,  but reusable. Good fragrance and good seller.  Have not used enough for results,  but a good skin softener.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am not sure about cellulite yet but it is smell good and leaves me a nice smooth soft skin.</li>
    <li> I love this companies products when i came across this one I couldn&#x27;t help myself but try it out, I have been applying daily now for about 4 weeks and I am really seeing improvements It&#x27;s just amazing how they can come up with stuff like these. Very pleased :)</li>
    <li> Love everything about it! Makes your skin feel so soft, &amp; it smells great. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> SAW ZERO IMPROVEMENTS WITH THIS PRODUCT! I used it daily for a month and saw nothing, continued and still nada! I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It smells great and is a great exfoliator. Helps keep skin nice and smooth! Lasts for  while. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in the results of this product. The price will detour me from purchasing again. Did not see results expected. The fragrance I chose is very refreshing and not overpowering. I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. Definitely helps smooth everything out and you see results quickly! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It really does help reduce cellulite. I got way more than 20 washes out of it too.</li>
    <li> I bought the vanilla one sponge and I have used it for about 2 weeks now. First of all, the smell is very pleasant. The smell is one of the main reasons why I love this sponge. For cellulite use, I definitely saw improvement and it makes your skin incredibly soft. I use it around my inner thigh and outer thigh and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I also workout three times a week including cardio. I think any product targetting weight loss or things like that requires commitment on working out. I highly recommend this item to those who love sweet scented sponges and commited weight loss people!</li>
    <li> Love it though I don&#x27;t see any difference it&#x27;s nice but found  similar products at a much less price .</li>
    <li> Product came very fast. My skin looks and feels much tighter just after days of use. I would total order the product and from company again!</li>
    <li> I loved the scent (green one). So fresh and clean smelling. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helped my cellulite , but I loved the way the sponge made my skin feel, not really after,(I mean, it was nice after too ) but it made me feel more awake or something . I guess I can&#x27;t really explain. It&#x27;s just nice! The sponge lasts for quite awhile, I was surprised how many times I used it until all the suds were gone. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> love the smell and how my skin feels after I use it</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s a proven product you get so many products that promise results but never deliver cellulite is a embarrassing feature and this product is absolutely comfortable to use and I love the progress you see.. Well to say the least this product delivered to a max I have got a firmer more defined backside! It took time time but I was determined! Everything that it said it would do it did. It was comfortable to put on. Also the price was extremely reasonable for the results that I got!</li>
    <li> This is the only anti-cellulite product I&#x27;ve been impressed with enough to buy twice. I&#x27;ve tried literally everything- other creams, shower compounds, massage kits, fitness and diet &#x27;toning&#x27; regimens, skin &#x27;rollers&#x27;, the works! I don&#x27;t even want to think about what I&#x27;ve spent on this issue, but it&#x27;s very important to me to correct it. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a sensible solution in the Anti-Cellulite Body Sponge. I chose this cream for its unique Vanilla Orchid Black Tea scent. Cellulite lotions can smell very strongly or even unpleasant, so I&#x27;m glad this one smells nice. I also liked that it contains caffeine and seaweed extract. Other creams usually contain caffeine, but not the seaweed extract. I think this combination of ingredients is very powerful, because this is the only product that&#x27;s worked for me so far. If you do the massage everyday using the cream in this sponge, I would be willing to bet that you would enjoy results too. My eight weeks of using the sponge are almost up, but I will continue to use it in order to maintain my good results. It smells good, feels great, doesn&#x27;t take extra time to use, and is effective. I would definitely encourage others to try this anti-cellulite product before considering more expensive treatments.</li>
    <li> All this feels like is sand paper and no results at all and for that price I could have went to Ross got it for $5 bucks and not be so upset that I spent 20 on crap that don&#x27;t work yup I was mad when I seen Ross had it for 5!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this anti-cellulite cream in the sponge because it provides many benefits in one product.&lt;br /&gt;One of the benefits is aromatherapy- the scent is very refreshing and calming at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Another one is cellulite reduction. I believe it&#x27;s a good solution to cellulite problems because of the massage action and caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;And also exfoliation: I noticed that my skin is less dry and flaky after I started using this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I personally found this product very convenient to use considering I don&#x27;t have time for all treatments separately and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had always suffered with cellulite, even when I was a young teenager.  It got worse as I got older and at some point I guess I just sort of accepted that there was nothing I could do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few months ago I was home visiting my parents and I noticed this funny-looking sponge in my mom&#x27;s bathroom. So I asked her about it and she told me it was an anti-cellulite sponge and that it was amazing.  She said she had been using them for a while and they worked great.  I couldn&#x27;t believe she was keeping her beauty secrets from me! So I got out my phone and ordered one almost immediately. It arrived and I was super excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how amazing it smelled!  So I started using it, not really expecting to see any results for a few weeks.  To my surprise my skin seemed firmer instantly, somehow the caffeine and seaweed extract help flush out excess water which helps your skin appear firmer.  This sponge is also a great at exfoliating, it leaves my skin so soft.  I was worried about adding yet another step to my extensive beauty regimen, but now I just use this instead of what I used to use to exfoliate.  So it doesn&#x27;t take any longer than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t believe the difference since I started using this a few months ago.  My cellulite is almost completely gone. For the first time since I was a kid I feel comfortable in shorts and even a bathing suit!  I love how reasonably priced this product is, it just shows that you don&#x27;t have to pay a lot to look great you just have to find the right product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first couple of uses of the product. I look forward to continued improvement!</li>
    <li> smells great, convenient, but saw not difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and BELIEVE ME, it actually works!! It has improved the tone and texture of my skin. One of my best friends recommended this product to me and I am really thankful to her for this because her valuable recommendation has solved all of my skin&#x27;s problems. Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Had my doubts at first but after using it for a few weeks it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub sponge. Body looks smoother.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed aesthetician and have seen pretty much EVERY &amp;#34;anti-cellulite&amp;#34; creation out there. I have never been as impressed as I am with this product! It is innovative and easy to use! It actually feels like a massage and gave me results!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty much blown away and already ordering one for all of my friends for Christmas. They are going to love me for this!</li>
    <li> Best anti-cellulite sponge out there! In love ❤❤❤</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products to get rid of cellulite, from derma rollers to tons of different kinds of creams. None of them have worked as well as this. I love that it&#x27;s already in the sponge so you can use it in the shower and it&#x27;s a lot more convenient than traditional creams. It&#x27;s really affordable and works really well. I noticed a difference after using it for about a week. It smells really nice and it&#x27;s not too rough on the skin, so I can use it daily without any ill effects. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all and I can tell the difference in my cellulite. Very promising product; I&#x27;m going to keep using it daily because so far I&#x27;ve had some amazing results!</li>
    <li> First time using an anti-cellulite cream in the sponge form like this product and I must say that it has done a great job at smoothing and softening my skin in just a couple of weeks after using it. I could totally notice the visible reduction in cellulite and stretch marks and I&#x27;ve noticed that after a month of using it, there has been a reduction in the recurrence of cellulite. This particular product in the Vanilla Orchard Black Tea scent smells so yummy and delicious (I love anything vanilla scented!) and I think I&#x27;ll be looking at trying the Grapefruit Zest Pink Pepper scent too after I finish with this one. So happy with the results and I never thought that a moisturising body wash could leave my rough and tough skin feeling so silky and smooth. Definitely a must have if you have tried other products and haven&#x27;t been happy with them - this one won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Received in 4 business days. I switched jobs and am now doing something where I&#x27;m not so active as before and watched the cellulite pop up on my thighs and butt almost overnight. I used this for the first time last night and so far I love it; it smells and feels wonderful! My goal is to banish visual cellulite by New Year&#x27;s Eve. As for results, I will update when it&#x27;s time to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a product like this... For almost a year now I had been using different anti-cellulite products. About a month ago I came to know about this amazing anti cellulite sponge. I must say that among all the other anti cellulite products that I have used so far this product has definitely proved to be one of the best ones. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to scrub your cellulite away and get rid of dead skin cells.  Increasing blood flow and circulation, I&#x27;m hoping will make improvement.  Shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> This anti-cellulate cream is just what i needed for my skin. I felt a little feminine buying such a product but as a man i can say that i&#x27;m very happy with the results. The sponge smells great and it even feels good while using it. My skin is much softer and smoother thanks to this product. I recommend this to any man or woman with a cellulite problem, you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Dissappointed once again I should have known this was to good to be true. I  have not seen any changes in my cellulite reduction, and I am not fat, 120 lbs and workout daily, Im beginning to know now the only thing that will get rid of cellulite is walking, and exercise. I will give this product a star because it smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy but I still definitely recommend this product for anyone. It works wonders for you and makes you feel and look younger again. It has a wonderful smell and although its pretty girly, I&#x27;d say you should try it out if you want to have nice flawless skin.</li>
    <li> Cellulite is a common problem for almost every women. Even though I eat right and train hard at the gym,  I still had some on my glutes. But after a month since I have started to use this marvelous scrub, my glutes are smoother and look firmer. This is very convenient because we all take showers. In comparison to lotions, which at times one can  forget to apply to the gluteal area. So this product is a most have for everyone who is trying to combat cellulite. In addition, it comes in  great aromas.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I feel exfoliation but after a few weeks of everyday use in the morning no improvement on my butt. I have some mild cellulite on the bottom of my butt and I don&#x27;t see any results from using this product so far.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was hesitant to buy it, so I looked up the ingredients.  I saw online that the research on seaweed and caffeine said that the combination of the two are shown to reduce cellulite.  There was a CBS report that it is the new anti-cellulite weapon, and even Dr Oz has talked about the combo being great for removing cellulite.  So I ordered and crossed my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day it arrived, I was so excited I immediately went and took a shower to use it.  I was amazed by the wonderful smell and how much it foamed up.  It made my skin feel so soft and silky, I figured that if it didn&#x27;t do anything for my cellulite, at least I smelled good and my skin felt amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of use, my boyfriend came in when I was getting out of the shower.  As I was drying off my legs he said &amp;#34;wow, honey you look really good...  have you been working out?&amp;#34;  I laughed right out loud....  no I hadn&#x27;t been working out, just using the Anti-cellulite cream in a body sponge.  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly see a visible difference in the look of my skin...  The cellulite is about fifty percent diminished after a week.  I look forward to how it will look in another week or two!  I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure If this really helped my cellulite. I used it for about a month and didn&#x27;t see too much of difference. Three stars for smelling good and making my skin super soft. I actually ended up ordering another product to treat my cellulite that&#x27;s helped more.</li>
    <li> This did not do anything. The only saving grace was the sponge as a sponge, but it never lived up to it&#x27;s hype.</li>
    <li> From what I have read, the caffeine and seaweed are the most important ingredients that make this product work so well. And it has worked very well for removing the cellulite! This product has a great smell and feels good on my skin. It has a nice lather and leaves my legs feeling soft and firm. I like that I can use it in the shower and not have to worry about remembering to use a lotion or cream when I get out. It also saves the hassle of going somewhere to get an expensive wrap or massage done.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a spa experience every time I shower! My skin glows and feels luxurious!! Thanks for having this on sale too, it gave me the opportunity to try thus wonderful product. I just ordered more.</li>
