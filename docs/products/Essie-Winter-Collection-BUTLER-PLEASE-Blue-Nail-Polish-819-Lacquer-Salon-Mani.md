      <li>Essie is a good brand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, but it kept chipping on me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll guess I&#x27;ll just keep paying $8-$9 for the good, legit stuff.</li>

      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>Though the color &amp;#34;Butler Please&amp;#34; is awesome, the nail polish chips off in one whole piece, almost immediately after it dries.</li>
      <li>I loved this color from the bottle, I thought it looked so fun and bright and even when I painted it on</li>
      <li>Chips off very easily.</li>

      <li>I love this color...</li>

      <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>Lovely look on my wife</li>
      <li>It chipped within a day, I had to keep touching it up</li>
      <li>I used this with Rock the boat and received so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Love, love Essie products.</li>
      <li>goes on nice and smooth and is very pretty!</li>
      <li>Was a good price on here and shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Yes, it takes about 2 coats for an even application, but it goes on quite easily.</li>
      <li>however, this seemed to chip very quickly.  </li>
      <li>good for tan people, not pale</li>
      <li>If the color I requested was no longer available, then I should have been alerted.</li>
      <li>Looks even prettier on than in the bottle and is great with blue jeans!</li>
      <li>It was tooooo much, didn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone or outfit anymore because it was so powerful.</li>
      <li>I love this color and was so excited that Essie came out with a polish in this pretty shade!</li>
      <li>I love the color and the picture is pretty accurate in color</li>
      <li>The delivery was very fast and I was able to wear the color to the event I was intending to wear it to</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this shade of blue.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color of this polish, very vibrant.</li>
      <li>Color is true to picture.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color but brush is to small in my opinion...</li>
      <li>Nonetheless it&#x27;s a nice shade of blue.</li>
      <li>They are of high quality and go on smoothly while drying quickly.</li>
      <li>and the formula is quick drying and very intense.</li>
      <li>(im not big on dark nail polishes on my nails) but its PERFECT for my toe nails</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>This color is exactly as seen on the picture-no touch ups.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I decided to finally order it!</li>
      <li>The consistency of the polish is not too thick, which is great also.</li>
      <li>It really POPS!</li>
      <li>Kind of dark for my nails</li>
      <li>Much darker then it appears in picture.</li>
      <li>Very streaky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s matte, dries too fast and too streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this color.</li>
      <li>and I just really wanted to try it out for myself.</li>
      <li>A very matte finish and does not self-level at all.</li>
      <li>I polished my feet with rock the boat (light blue) and my hands (ring finger with rock the boat) with this color.  </li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t possibly be real Essie.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The product was even delivered three days before predicted, which was very much appreciated.</li>
      <li>Add a base and top coat of Seche Vite and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised at how pretty it is.</li>
      <li>oh-my-god my nails could be spotted from a mile away and the blue was more of child looking type of blue.</li>
      <li>but in some lighting this color looks nuts and way wayyyy too obnoxiously vibrant.</li>
      <li>I only use 2 brands of mail polish, one being Essie which I usually buy from target but thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to get it here since it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
      <li>but I think Milani&#x27;s new nail polish line&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
      <li>and this one chips the fastest by far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one, essie has other way better blue shades that look the same in all lighting and don&#x27;t chip every 2 seconds.</li>
      <li>My little sister asked to use it so much that I just gave in and gave it to her haha!</li>
      <li>It is such a pretty blue color.</li>
      <li>I also ordered 3 other colors from here and like them very much.</li>
      <li>I am not very rough with my nails</li>
      <li>purchased mine from lucky stars.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was half empty as well</li>
      <li>NOT EVEN REAL AND ITS WATERED DOWN.</li>

    <li> Love love love this color!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, but it kept chipping on me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this color many times over the internet and I just really wanted to try it out for myself. I&#x27;m quite surprised at how pretty it is. This color is beautiful, especially in natural lighting. Yes, it takes about 2 coats for an even application, but it goes on quite easily. The consistency of the polish is not too thick, which is great also. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great color. Color is true to picture.</li>
    <li> WORST NAIL POLISH I&#x27;VE EVER BOUGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS NOT EVEN REAL AND ITS WATERED DOWN. THE OTHER ESSIE NAIL POLISHES I BOUGHT WORK PERFECTLY BUT THIS ONE DOESNT EVEN COME OUT ON MY NAILS. I AM FURIOUS THAT SOMEONE WHO SEND A PRODUCT THAT WAS TAMPERED WITH.</li>
    <li> This unique color is incredible! I get compliments every time I wear it! The delivery was very fast and I was able to wear the color to the event I was intending to wear it to</li>
    <li> love this color. great addition and I am an Essie addict. it is the only polish I use- great quality. lasted my 2 weeks .</li>
    <li> Love, love Essie products. They are of high quality and go on smoothly while drying quickly. So many great colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> I had bought this color before but unfortunatly dropped it and it shattered everywhere (what a mess!).  I love the color and the picture is pretty accurate in color however, this seemed to chip very quickly.  I found myself needing to reapply even the very next day!  I have mixed emotions about this polish.  I love the color so much but hate that it chips.  Also, you definitely need 2 coats of the polish, it applies pretty thinly from one coat.</li>
    <li> good for tan people, not pale</li>
    <li> This is one of the prettiest nail polish colors I&#x27;ve seen in a while.  Essie is a good brand.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Terrible purchase the formula was so thick and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine from lucky stars.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was half empty as well I don&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Though the color &amp;#34;Butler Please&amp;#34; is awesome, the nail polish chips off in one whole piece, almost immediately after it dries.</li>
    <li> As always, this Essie nail color is beautiful. the blue is truly enchanting, and I&#x27;ve been receiving compliments nonstop since applying it. The product was even delivered three days before predicted, which was very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Chips off very easily. It&#x27;s darker then the what is depicted. Shipping was very fast. I also ordered 3 other colors from here and like them very much.</li>
    <li> Luv this color!! It&#x27;s an electric blue with a hinge of purple in it! Going to be stocking up on this color</li>
    <li> I would urge everyone to try this amazing color.  Looks even prettier on than in the bottle and is great with blue jeans!</li>
    <li> Love the color on this, but the formula is horrid! It&#x27;s clumpy and reminds me of tempera paint. A very matte finish and does not self-level at all. I wish I had read the reviews on this before I bought it!</li>
    <li> I am a nail polish addict!!!! I have had my eye on this color for awhile and I am so glad I decided to finally order it! It is such a pretty blue color. My order was delivered very quickly which is always a bonus!</li>
    <li> I looooooooooove this color!!! My all time fav!</li>
    <li> i adore essie and this color is unbeatable. of course the amazon price is on point! these go for 8-9 dollars in the grocery/drug store. love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but brush is to small in my opinion...</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish. I wear it a lot on my nails.</li>
    <li> Lovely look on my wife</li>
    <li> This color is exactly as seen on the picture-no touch ups. The only thing is that you must add clear to make it shine due that it&#x27;s a bit dull. Nonetheless it&#x27;s a nice shade of blue.</li>
    <li> The item that was shipped to me was a different color to what was advertised. I do not like the color choice that was chosen. If the color I requested was no longer available, then I should have been alerted. Thanks</li>
    <li> I loved this color from the bottle, I thought it looked so fun and bright and even when I painted it on I liked it but in some lighting this color looks nuts and way wayyyy too obnoxiously vibrant. It was tooooo much, didn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone or outfit anymore because it was so powerful. I was at the grocery store looked down and was like oh-my-god my nails could be spotted from a mile away and the blue was more of child looking type of blue. It was like neon and pungent. Nothing like the blue I saw from the bottle or in calmer lighting. I guess bright lighting did NOT flatter this color!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love essie and have millions of other essie nail polishes but this color chips like crazy which is weird! It chipped within a day, I had to keep touching it up constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one, essie has other way better blue shades that look the same in all lighting and don&#x27;t chip every 2 seconds.</li>
    <li> The nail polish was an original essie, it was a fake and it turned my nails black. Will never purchase from anyone other than essie directly</li>
    <li> I just received this item in the mail today &amp; I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this color! And I got it two days before it was supposed to be delivered. It&#x27;s a must have ! :)</li>
    <li> Not the color listed. Watered down and goes on bubbly and ribbed. Unlike any essie nail polish I have ever bought. Do not buy this</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality Prodcut and Speedy service. Highly recommend to any other buyer.  The product is amazing, GF loves it, thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Saw this on someone interviewing me and had to have it! I love love love it! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on it</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color! I love it!</li>
    <li> Much darker then it appears in picture. Very streaky. Took 2 thick coats to even it out. Will not use again. Put on a glitter top coat to hide polish flaws.</li>
    <li> awesome color. goes on nice and smooth and is very pretty! My little sister asked to use it so much that I just gave in and gave it to her haha!</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t possibly be real Essie. I only use 2 brands of mail polish, one being Essie which I usually buy from target but thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to get it here since it&#x27;s cheaper. WRONG! It paints on streaky and dries streaky instead of falling into place like it&#x27;s supposed to, which makes the polish look like chunky lines after the second coat. I&#x27;ll guess I&#x27;ll just keep paying $8-$9 for the good, legit stuff.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color of this polish, very vibrant. However, I have several Essie nail polishes (25+) and this one chips the fastest by far. I am not very rough with my nails and I always see this color chip within a day of painting (or hour!). Was a good price on here and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as my summer 2014 nail polish color :) really excited about it, it looks great. Kind of dark for my nails (im not big on dark nail polishes on my nails) but its PERFECT for my toe nails i absolutely love this color.</li>
    <li> OMG I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS COLOR SINCE I AM SUCH A BLUE FREAK .I AM SOOO IN LOVE WITH THIS COLOR!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this color. It is darker then the picture but ends up being a deep cobalt dark blue. I keep staring at the color on my nails because it isn&#x27;t like a nail color I have had before. The quality is excellent and even better with a top coat placed on top.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this shade of blue. It&#x27;s perfect for all seasons-- even though it was part of the winter collection, I definitely feel like I can wear it in the summer and spring as well. My only qualm is that it seemed like this Essie color, for whatever strange reason, did not last as long as the others. I needed to retouch a few times before giving up and taking the whole color off after less than a week. I&#x27;m still happy though!</li>
    <li> I love this color...and it looks even better on my nails! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this shade! I love this color and was so excited that Essie came out with a polish in this pretty shade! Def a must buy!</li>
    <li> The color is pretty but the formula sucks! It&#x27;s matte, dries too fast and too streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hassle! Sally Hansen&#x27;s Pacific Blue is gone but I think Milani&#x27;s new nail polish line&lt;br /&gt;has a very similar blue to this one. I haven&#x27;t tried it but it looked almost identical. I&#x27;d say try that out&lt;br /&gt;instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the color but never reach for it because I dread it.... *cringe*</li>
    <li> I used this with Rock the boat and received so many compliments.  I polished my feet with rock the boat (light blue) and my hands (ring finger with rock the boat) with this color.  Priceless!</li>
    <li> I saw this blue online and decided to give it a try. So happy I did. It really POPS! and the formula is quick drying and very intense. Add a base and top coat of Seche Vite and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
