      <li>This is the first time I have ever seen a kit that combines Chamomile and Sea Salt together, but the combo is incredible!</li>
      <li>I simply LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>though, this stuff works amazing.</li>
      <li>this stuff work amazing.</li>
      <li>i had some issues with my conch piercings and this helped with them amazingly</li>
      <li>Although H2Ocean is a good product, it doesn&#x27;t have as many benefits as a soak for me.</li>
      <li>BUT this product has conveniently, measured everything for you, and it comes with a handy container to soak your piercing in</li>
      <li>You can complain that anybody can get a tspoon of sea salt, and tea, and mix it in warm water for you.</li>
      <li>It was definitely more effective to make my own sea salt + water mixture which I can do for under $5.</li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>Most of my piercings were doing well</li>
      <li>My ear feels so much better</li>
      <li>I was so excited!</li>
      <li>/&gt;OH BTW, I had to purchase two more refills of the Herbal Sea Salt Soak, which pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is VERY easy to use.</li>
      <li>product worked better for me than anything else, and it&#x27;s very much worth it!</li>
      <li>I can say that this kit had made it incredibly easy to do the sea salt soaks.</li>
      <li>This is so easy to use</li>
      <li>You can make this easily yourself for 1/4 the price.</li>
      <li>Using your own ingredients and an 8oz glass from your kitchen is more effective than this because everything is more potent and you can control how watered down it will become.</li>
      <li>Instructions are very easy to follow, simple to use, and it is an incredibly good value.</li>
      <li>it  takes i little bit of time but good stuff, thank you!!!!</li>
      <li>It felt fantastic on my sore ear and within 3 days the swelling and redness started to subside.</li>
      <li>Right when I thought it was healing and looked better, BOOM there it was again.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use too,</li>
      <li>I recommend to anybody for a quick and easy way to clean up after punching holes in themselves.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed the piercing bumps on my nose ring and on my industrial has minimized significantly.</li>
      <li>I love that I can take this with me when I&#x27;m out of town and don&#x27;t have to worry about anything except adding hot water.  </li>
      <li>The piercing is swollen  huge ,full of pressure now and draining.</li>
      <li>I like to put my ear into the cup while laying my head sideways and after 10 minutes I will clean up</li>
      <li>Purchase this product right meow!</li>
      <li>Days ago and the piercer I usually go to who is great and did most  of my piercings was off and her coworker was there).</li>
      <li>Just used this tonight after my shower and my ears feel so much better compared to having to use kosher salt for the last two days :p defiantly going to buy again when I run low on my box now :)</li>
      <li>well, it just isn&#x27;t that great for other piercings.</li>
      <li>At first I loved this, because my body generally ends up rejecting piercings or getting infected and staying that way for prolonged periods.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it honestly isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
      <li>The price is also worth it for me.</li>
      <li>Though it helped to heal my 2-year old septum piercing faster and better than Neosporin...</li>
      <li>though people say you can find the ingredients at the grocery store, I still trust this over me finding the right stuff and mixing the right amount.</li>
      <li>It is very easy with this kit, but if you want to save some money, just buy chamomile tea and sea salt, put equal measurements of both</li>
      <li>Very easy and simple to use.</li>
      <li>so I did see improvement after the first use.</li>
      <li>They both work very well for me!</li>
      <li>I love it - and it actually had a soothing effect on my nose too.</li>
      <li>Easy to use product, wish there was a little more sea salt in the bag.</li>
      <li>Wish I could find the herbal sea I put away in the closet, because I could really use it right now.</li>
      <li>and my bump has flattened about 80%, it&#x27;s no longer red and for the first time in months I actually think I might be able to enjoy my piercing soon.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>And I tried pretty much everything</li>
      <li>Now I have a large lump of scar tissue on that ear.</li>
      <li>This product is very convenient and useful with new piercings.</li>
      <li>This product is very soothing to my forward helix piercings.</li>
      <li>For pete&#x27;s sake, you can pick this stuff up for about $3. or $4.00 maximum, do we really need everything prepackaged for us?  </li>
      <li>BUT Herbal Sea piercing aftercare is so much easier to use.</li>
      <li>I tried using a dixie cup, and of course, the solution evaporated in the microwave haha.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>my tragus piercing, I cupped it over my whole ear.</li>
      <li>doing sea salt soaks but will be glad to use this to get the swelling down and get it to drain.</li>
      <li>My regular piercer was back tonight and changed the earring to a longer post which helps with the draining , swelling and mostly the pressure .Been</li>
      <li>Totally buying more so hopefully these bumps will eventually be long gone!</li>
      <li>Such an easy product to use that makes cleaning your piercings ridiculously simple.</li>
      <li>I pierced my forward helix last year and it ended up with an infection because I couldn&#x27;t seem to mix the right amount of sea salt with water</li>
      <li>a new tragus piercing in my right ear last Friday (7.</li>
      <li>My shot glasses are packed away in boxes, and I didn&#x27;t want to dig them or nor buy new ones.</li>
      <li>Instead of microwaving, like the instructions indicate, I use HOT water prior to adding the salt.</li>
      <li>I had developed a sort of bump on my piercing and within a week it disappeared!</li>
      <li>I had read that the best thing you could do for a piercing was a Sea Salt Soak, but getting the solution the correct salinity was hard, and I usually ended up drying out my piercing and my keloid was getting bigger.</li>
      <li>It significantly went down after two weeks, but I still had two bumps.</li>
      <li>In Feb, the bumps completely got reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My piercing soon developed a nose piercing bump similar to the horrors I had seen online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Did everything I needed, ended up buying a salt spray to help for during day use, but my nose went from painful with a mild infection to healed and healthy in about a week of two soaks a day.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this as a last resort before removing a piercing and will probably definitely buy at least one more kit before mine is healed.</li>

<li> This product has done in one week what I couldn&#x27;t do with any other product in two years.</li>
<li> I got my nose pierced in late August for my 16th birthday, and only used H2Ocean spray.</li>
<li> I lay down on the floor and rest my ear in the container for about 10 minutes once to twice a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it  takes i little bit of time but good stuff, thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Wish I would&#x27;ve discovered this sooner for earlier piercings.</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE this product!  I&#x27;ll admit it - I&#x27;m lazy.  This is so easy to use and it smells good while it&#x27;s sitting my nose (lol).  It&#x27;s not as drying as the H2Ocean spray (which I am a fan of too). I love that I can take this with me when I&#x27;m out of town and don&#x27;t have to worry about anything except adding hot water.  It is a little pricey, but not overly so. What I do is I only use half of the solution and put it in a shot glass which I use on my nose, and then save the remaining mixture for the next day. So I am actually getting 60 uses out of the 30. I  wish I knew this stuff existed when I had my belly ring.. Buy with confidence.  I love it - and it actually had a soothing effect on my nose too.</li>
    <li> Very easy and simple to use. I recenty had my &amp;#34;tragus&amp;#34; pierced. The shop gave me  saline wound wash and told me to spray a small amount into a shot glass, heat it up in the microwave and put it to my ear. My shot glasses are packed away in boxes, and I didn&#x27;t want to dig them or nor buy new ones. I tried using a dixie cup, and of course, the solution evaporated in the microwave haha. BUT Herbal Sea piercing aftercare is so much easier to use. It comes with a mixing cup and a 30 day supply of sea salts. Instead of microwaving, like the instructions indicate, I use HOT water prior to adding the salt. So easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is the best aftercare product I&#x27;ve ever used. I got my nose pierced and 7 months later it still wasn&#x27;t healed. I would get the dreaded nose bump every other day. I tried sea salt soaks, H2Ocean, and even tried hydrogen peroxide which is not recommended. I was totally desperate. After trying this product my nose healed perfectly and I haven&#x27;t had a bump in 4 months. This stuff is a lifesaver! I bought an extra box just incase my bump came back but I&#x27;ve never had to use it.</li>
    <li> This totally saved my industrial piercing. One side was infected, but the infection is totally cleared up now. The bump on the outside hole is gone but I still have a stubborn one on the inside, hopefully with continued use that one will go away soon. I would definitely recommend this as a last resort before removing a piercing and will probably definitely buy at least one more kit before mine is healed.</li>
    <li> I used this when I had a piercing injection and it help with the pain and clearing it up. This just makes things convenient. My infection has cleared but I still use it. I will definitely repurchase once I am done with my current packs</li>
    <li> Easy to use product, wish there was a little more sea salt in the bag. Doesn&#x27;t seem to help as much as a standard water/sea salt mixture.</li>
    <li> At first I loved this, because my body generally ends up rejecting piercings or getting infected and staying that way for prolonged periods. Though it helped to heal my 2-year old septum piercing faster and better than Neosporin...well, it just isn&#x27;t that great for other piercings. It was definitely more effective to make my own sea salt + water mixture which I can do for under $5. Chamomile teabags are also infinitely cheaper at about $3 a box. Using your own ingredients and an 8oz glass from your kitchen is more effective than this because everything is more potent and you can control how watered down it will become. The customer service was also downright horrible and failed to respond to multiple emails of mine.</li>
    <li> dude this stuff is insane! my belly ring was getting a little infected and after using this ONCE all the redness and fluid stopped about an hour after. I 100 percent recommend. FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or two and I&#x27;ve noticed the piercing bumps on my nose ring and on my industrial has minimized significantly. Totally buying more so hopefully these bumps will eventually be long gone!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever seen a kit that combines Chamomile and Sea Salt together, but the combo is incredible! Instructions are very easy to follow, simple to use, and it is an incredibly good value. When I use this kit, I don&#x27;t even need to use all 30 packets of the tea, and have plenty left over for use on my next piercing... Best aftercare value and performance I have found!</li>
    <li> I had a helix cartilage piercing done with a piercing gun (UGH!) in 2007, and cleaned it with rubbing alcohol as the piercer advised. Needless to say it NEVER healed and after two years of torture I had to take it out. Now I have a large lump of scar tissue on that ear. Well after a lot of online research, I went and got my helix on my other ear pierced in December, by a professional with a needle. I was using the salt spray she recommended but three months later I was still in pain and was developing a keloid. I had read that the best thing you could do for a piercing was a Sea Salt Soak, but getting the solution the correct salinity was hard, and I usually ended up drying out my piercing and my keloid was getting bigger. When I found this kit on Amazon I was so excited! Everything is pre-mixed for you, all you do is fill the provided container with water, heat, and add the tea bag! Voila! Perfect mixture every time! I lay down on the floor and rest my ear in the container for about 10 minutes once to twice a day. It is amazing how much better my piercing feels afterwords, and after just a week my keloid is gone!! My ear feels so much better I can even sleep on it again. This product has done in one week what I couldn&#x27;t do with any other product in two years. Don&#x27;t be suckered in by the sprays, this product is the way to go!!</li>
    <li> This product is very convenient and useful with new piercings. I used this for my nose piercing that was giving me a lot of trouble. It helped me get rid of the bump that had formed. I gave it 4 stars because it honestly isn&#x27;t worth the price. Its just a tea bag with sea salt and chamomile tea. You can make this easily yourself for 1/4 the price. It is very easy with this kit, but if you want to save some money, just buy chamomile tea and sea salt, put equal measurements of both and there you go. Same thing...</li>
    <li> Did everything I needed, ended up buying a salt spray to help for during day use, but my nose went from painful with a mild infection to healed and healthy in about a week of two soaks a day.</li>
    <li> I used this soak for my nasal piercing, after I had a bump. I was using the H2Ocean spray but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything to get rid of the bump. After a week of using this soak, I saw very little improvement, but I had read the reviews and knew it took a little time. But for the second week, I started spraying the H2Ocean into the soak and soaking my nose in it for 10 minutes, and it worked wonders! My bump is almost gone after three days of using that mixture. I would recommend doing the same or adding a little bit of extra sea salt into the soak.</li>
    <li> I am ordering a second one. Most of my piercings were doing well so I put the tea and salt bags and soaking cup away in a bag in the linen closet and I can not find them and desperately need them right now .Got a new tragus piercing in my right ear last Friday (7. Days ago and the piercer I usually go to who is great and did most  of my piercings was off and her coworker was there). The coworker pierced the tragus for me and used an earring with way too short a post and left no room for swelling . The piercing is swollen  huge ,full of pressure now and draining. Wish I could find the herbal sea I put away in the closet, because I could really use it right now. My regular piercer was back tonight and changed the earring to a longer post which helps with the draining , swelling and mostly the pressure .Been doing sea salt soaks but will be glad to use this to get the swelling down and get it to drain. This is good stuff. I can&#x27;t wait to get this to help with the healing of this tragus piercing.</li>
    <li> I recently got my nose pierced and was relieved to find this product. Before this, I was using sea salt from the grocery store which ended up burning my nose and was certainly not convenient. I can say that this kit had made it incredibly easy to do the sea salt soaks. I will not hesitate to reorder when I get low on my supply!</li>
    <li> This is JUST Non-Iodized Sea Salt and Organic Chamomile tea bags, (with a plastic cup) For pete&#x27;s sake, you can pick this stuff up for about $3. or $4.00 maximum, do we really need everything prepackaged for us?  Can we not measure 1/4 t. of non-iodized salt ourselves?  What is this world coming to?</li>
    <li> Sucks. Good customer service though.</li>
    <li> I got my nose pierced in late August for my 16th birthday, and only used H2Ocean spray. Although H2Ocean is a good product, it doesn&#x27;t have as many benefits as a soak for me. (I also recently found out it has an ingredient derived from eggs...)&lt;br /&gt;About 3 weeks in, my piercing got caught on a bed sheet and was yanked around while I was sleeping. I pushed it back in and thought &amp;#34;Phew! It looks alright.&amp;#34; Wrong. My piercing soon developed a nose piercing bump similar to the horrors I had seen online.&lt;br /&gt;I continued using H2Ocean but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. I then tried tea tree oil, aspirin, anti-bacterial soap, etc... (I cringe remembering how idiotic I was.) Suddenly, I stumbled upon Herbal Sea. I used it for a week and my bump had already shown vast improvement. It&#x27;s been around 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m happy to say my piercing is still improving. Some might say it&#x27;s a slow process, but I&#x27;m alright with being patient, seeing as I thought I&#x27;d have an ugly bump on my nose for the rest of my life. The price is also worth it for me. It&#x27;s convenient and you can rest assured that the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr&lt;br /&gt;This product worked better for me than anything else, and it&#x27;s very much worth it!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t regret buying it</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Reduced swelling and redness.</li>
    <li> this stuff work amazing. i had some issues with my conch piercings and this helped with them amazingly i would keep buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> I have a nose piercing that has been nothing but giving me hell for the past 4 or 5 months. I had a mixture of the &#x27;bump&#x27; and hypertrophic scarring and the bump was about as big as my stud-- And I tried pretty much everything and it would never 100% go away. Right when I thought it was healing and looked better, BOOM there it was again. So after searching for remedies for the 100th time, I stumbled across this. Even though I HAVE tried chamomile compresses and SS soaks I decided hey why not can&#x27;t hurt. Day 1, after about a 15 min soak the bump wasn&#x27;t red anymore and it decreased in size about 10% so I did see improvement after the first use. I am about 6 uses (About 15 minute soaks each) in now and my bump has flattened about 80%, it&#x27;s no longer red and for the first time in months I actually think I might be able to enjoy my piercing soon.&lt;br /&gt;Even though people say you can find the ingredients at the grocery store, I still trust this over me finding the right stuff and mixing the right amount. Super easy to use too, microwave for about 30-45 seconds, throw the tea bag in, let it sit, shake and done. Just spend the $12&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this stuff works amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is very soothing to my forward helix piercings. I pierced my forward helix last year and it ended up with an infection because I couldn&#x27;t seem to mix the right amount of sea salt with water and I ended up taking it out. This year, I repierced my forward helix and started to use this along with the sea salt spray. They both work very well for me! I had developed a sort of bump on my piercing and within a week it disappeared! I was very pleased with this product. I like to put my ear into the cup while laying my head sideways and after 10 minutes I will clean up whatever residue is left with that same solution. Very pleased and happy with this product. Also amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> Just used this tonight after my shower and my ears feel so much better compared to having to use kosher salt for the last two days :p defiantly going to buy again when I run low on my box now :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m forced to take my piercings out for work and Herbal Sea has helped helped things heal so well it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when thy are out. Purchase this product right meow!</li>
    <li> This company nailed it! Such an easy product to use that makes cleaning your piercings ridiculously simple. I recommend to anybody for a quick and easy way to clean up after punching holes in themselves. Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Waste of money...used it consistently no results</li>
    <li> This product saved my ear!! I had a badly infected cartiledge and started soaking my ear 4 times a day. Then I gradually cut back to twice a day. It felt fantastic on my sore ear and within 3 days the swelling and redness started to subside. This product is a must have for any piercing.</li>
    <li> The product has helped in the process with other things, but for me it took MONTHS to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I got a tragus piercing in Oct. 2014. and after a few weeks it got these irritating bumps. Prob, cause I slept on them. (I can&#x27;t help but toss and turn.)&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the Herbal sea soak, and started using everyday in the morning. It significantly went down after two weeks, but I still had two bumps. So I used the sea soak along with a crushed asprin paste technique. I used the sea soak every morning, and I used the asprin paste one every 3 days. And WHA LA~! In Feb, the bumps completely got reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH BTW, I had to purchase two more refills of the Herbal Sea Salt Soak, which pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is VERY easy to use. You can complain that anybody can get a tspoon of sea salt, and tea, and mix it in warm water for you. BUT this product has conveniently, measured everything for you, and it comes with a handy container to soak your piercing in it.&lt;br /&gt;For my tragus piercing, I cupped it over my whole ear. Kinda awkward at first, cause it drips all over the place. But I just put a rag under my shoulder, and sat watching T.V while holding the cup against my ear for about 10 minutes.</li>
