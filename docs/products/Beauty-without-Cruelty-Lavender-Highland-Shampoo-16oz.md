      <li>Love the fact that it is cruelty free, has a pleasant scent and does not harm my henna hair is another plus in my book.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Lavender and this shampoo smells awesome.</li>

      <li>I love the scent.</li>

      <li>This product however, is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It smells more like a mixture of aloe vera and citrus.</li>
      <li>Also love how the product is animal cruelty free.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because my favorite lavender scented shampoo is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>, you can easily go 2-3 days without a wash (note: being oily prone</li>
      <li>smells great and does not dry my hair out.  </li>
      <li>and it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>The lavender is also a more natural smell without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the natural product that does a great job</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair clean and does not strip the Henna color from my hair.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not overpowering, rather it&#x27;s a clean, fresh aroma.  </li>
      <li>Obviously from the reviews everyone is different, but I really am impressed with this shampoo, so I thought I would add my 2 cents and say so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Shampoo is quite nice, smells good, but it tough for my arthritic hands to get out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
      <li>Remember: it is a more natural shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Tried it and found it is much more gentle than any shower gel, so my skin is less itchy and flaky, better from head to toe.  </li>
      <li>Smells lovely and left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>In fact, aloe vera is the first ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this shampoo three stars because it&#x27;s more natural, but it smells similar to a flea bath for pets, and I often have to shampoo twice because it doesn&#x27;t suds very much and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s very high concentration.</li>
      <li>Have to squeeze a bit too hard, but I love the idea that it is cruelty free and part of the compassionate shopping guide.</li>
      <li>Creamy lather, not too much.</li>
      <li>What I was really looking for was the LAVENDER scent.  </li>
      <li>It actually lathers up and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as soft as it is when I use more conventional shampoo</li>
      <li>This is my HG shampoo - I have normal to oily hair</li>
      <li>Will definitely be purchasing more products from BWC in the near future</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural, actual lavender scent - no fake perfume knockoff.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft too.</li>
      <li>Shiny - Soft -  Silky  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several organic and natural shampoos-</li>
      <li>I use it on my 7 year old daughter (I use Wen) as it only has a 2 rating on EWG.Com.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Creamy lather, not too much. Wonderful lavender smell, not overpowering. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it on my 7 year old daughter (I use Wen) as it only has a 2 rating on EWG.Com.  Prior to using this stuff, she would break out in rashes all over her skin (after checking the brand we were using on EWG&#x27;s website and realizing it had an 8 rating I looked for something else and found BWC).  Within a few days of using this on her, the rashes were gone and her hair is so soft and silky.  It doesn&#x27;t lather like other sulfate brands, but it does lather.  Remember: it is a more natural shampoo.  Using the conditioner as well is a must.  The lavender is also a more natural smell without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this shampoo three stars because it&#x27;s more natural, but it smells similar to a flea bath for pets, and I often have to shampoo twice because it doesn&#x27;t suds very much and doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s very high concentration.</li>
    <li> Not a fan!  Very little fragrance and made my hair feel dry and brittle.  Takes a lot to get and suds too.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Shiny - Soft -  Silky  That&#x27;s my hair on this shampoo.....without using conditioner.  I have tried lots of cruelty-free organic products and tossed or gave most of them away.  Obviously from the reviews everyone is different, but I really am impressed with this shampoo, so I thought I would add my 2 cents and say so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering, rather it&#x27;s a clean, fresh aroma.  Lavender is one of my favorites, and this is especially nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had dry skin, and wondered what this shampoo would do as a body wash?  Tried it and found it is much more gentle than any shower gel, so my skin is less itchy and flaky, better from head to toe.  Nice stuff.</li>
    <li> I like to use this at night.  The smell is wonderful and lends itself to a relaxing evening.  I used this on my dogs too.  Now they are clean, shiny and smell great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Love how soft it makes my hair. Also love how the product is animal cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is quite nice, smells good, but it tough for my arthritic hands to get out of the bottle.  Have to squeeze a bit too hard, but I love the idea that it is cruelty free and part of the compassionate shopping guide.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my favorite lavender scented shampoo is no longer available.  What I was really looking for was the LAVENDER scent.  As a shampoo, it works.  It cleans my hair.  However, despite being called &amp;#34;Lavender Highland&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;aromatherapy,&amp;#34; it smells nothing like lavender.  It smells more like a mixture of aloe vera and citrus. I could not even detect a hint of lavender...  It&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, but it is not the one I wanted.  I can get aloe vera shampoo and citrus shampoo locally.  In fact, aloe vera is the first ingredient.  Lavender is the last. So, I am greatly disappointed that I bought several bottles of this misleadingly named product.  I will now have to wait several months before once again trying to find a lavender scented shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Especially like that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  It also does a good job without drying my hair out.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> This is my HG shampoo - I have normal to oily hair and it&#x27;s not so heavy that it causes greasiness, you can easily go 2-3 days without a wash (note: being oily prone I don&#x27;t condition my roots. No one actually needs to condition their roots). Leaves your hair feeling clean, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; chemically, and it smells WONDERFUL! It&#x27;s natural, actual lavender scent - no fake perfume knockoff. Now...if you&#x27;re not a big fan of the scent of lavender this isn&#x27;t for you. But, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this product and it&#x27;s reviews if you didn&#x27;t like lavender. So, with that...great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it is cruelty free, has a pleasant scent and does not harm my henna hair is another plus in my book.  Will definitely be purchasing more products from BWC in the near future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several organic and natural shampoos- most are sitting under the bathroom sink after 1 use. This product however, is fabulous! I love the scent. It actually lathers up and rinses clean. It leaves my hair soft too. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> smells great and does not dry my hair out.  Thanks for the natural product that does a great job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Lavender and this shampoo smells awesome. It keeps my hair clean and does not strip the Henna color from my hair. Just a great product! Highly recommend. I use with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair and it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> It smells awesome, very natural-lavender.  My hair isn&#x27;t as soft as it is when I use more conventional shampoo but it seems shinier.</li>
    <li> It smelled ok, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling very clean or looking very nice.  I am moving on to other natural shampoo products.</li>
