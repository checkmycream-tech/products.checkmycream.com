      <li>but they have more than one purpose.  </li>

      <li>I use them when making braids that get pinned into elaborate hairstyles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to use some twice.</li>
      <li>I am not too sure about.  </li>
      <li>but now I feel like I have to use them all before buying better quality ones.</li>

      <li>As they are plastic and elastic, they aren&#x27;t as reusable as rubber bands, but they don&#x27;t bite into my hair, either, so am pleased with them.</li>

      <li>I use them for my daughters hair as it is soooo fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product and price! I&#x27;m just starting to put pony tails in my daughters hair and these are great because they don&#x27;t pull!!</li>
    <li> Work great for my beard, like the Viking look.</li>
    <li> These work as expected, and they did not snap apart while in my hair all day. Great for buns and braiding.  I would not rely on just these alone to hold a bun all day, I use them as clear support for a bun when needed.</li>
    <li> There elastics. They work. I use them for fishing when I am using plastics.</li>
    <li> They do what you would think they would do. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for. They&#x27;re perfect for small braids and pony tails.</li>
    <li> These are much thinner than the Goody brand that was sold out at my local department store when I needed them so I got these. One wrap around my hair and they are completely stretched out and rendered useless.</li>
    <li> I use these to braid my hair and they work just fine!</li>
    <li> Strong, dependable braiding bands.  Get around 10-15 uses out of them before they start to loosen/snap.</li>
    <li> These break after a couple hours of being in my hair.  I have long fine hair to my waist so I braid it at night and wntd something other than regular hair ties that I can feel.  I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have had this pack forever, and I still have some left. I use them for my daughters hair as it is soooo fine.</li>
    <li> Minus one star because, as other reviewers have said, they stretch out after a single use. In fact, if I don&#x27;t get them in right on the first (maybe second) try, I have to throw the band away and get a new one. BUT I really like these. They don&#x27;t stand out against my hair color awkwardly like colored ones do, and since they aren&#x27;t reusable, I feel no remorse at cutting them out of my hair, which I prefer to trying to gently untangle rubber bands from my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected.  They really have no elasticity</li>
    <li> I use these in my two-year-old&#x27;s hair because her hair is very fine and traditional hair ties fall out. These stay put after a whole day of playing!</li>
    <li> Break within minutes.</li>
    <li> Easy on and off, no pulling.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had these elastics for 6 months and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with them. I only use them on my 10 year old&#x27;s hair when I braid it. Any other hair tie looks odd at the end of her braid. The elastic is very small and only good for a small chunk of hair. In fact, these are almost identical to the hair elastics I used on her when she was a toddler to age 4ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had a single one break. They are only good for one use. After taking them out they are very stretched out and can&#x27;t be put back in well. We have had an occasional time we had to cut them out, but usually the slip out very easily. These are definitely worth the few bucks if you want to have small elastics for braids or thin hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so I could do cute, small braids and have them stay in place. They do their job, but they get tangled so often! It&#x27;s really frustrating for me sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have very fine shoulder length hair and yet I cannot go a full day without these breaking, especially if I lie down. Not worth the money unless they are to be used for very small bunches of hair or children&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Works great in my toddlers fine hair, no complaints!</li>
    <li> These work great for holding braids; The positive &amp; negative is that they stretch easily -- great for one-time use, but they&#x27;re not very reliable to use twice. Although it feels wasteful, I prefer these over more rigid bands which can be difficult to stretch over fingers to get on the hair in the first place. The size of these is good for tying off a braid of all hair, or maybe pigtails... smaller braids, you would probably need to twist it too much.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Has a nice stretch and is easy to style/remove from my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great for little ones with fine hair.</li>
    <li> These are great and I don&#x27;t find that they break easily.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and don&#x27;t break.  Perfect.  I use them to put ribbons in my hair and so they get stretched alot and even though they have a point where they won&#x27;t stretch past they still don&#x27;t break.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and the price.  Came on time.</li>
    <li> These are pretty junky, and wear out/break after a day or two of being wrapped around anything.</li>
    <li> I used these to help make a diaper cake for a  baby shower - great product! They are a fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it more than once. It breaks after one use.</li>
    <li> Worst ever! They break after 2 hours in your hair! Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 2-yr old girl&#x27;s hair. They do the job, but only once. If you try to reuse them, they snap as soon as you stretch them out again. Some of them snapped the first time I tried to use them, too. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> They do what is intended. Not much to say about it except that it does the job. Will most likely purchase again to tie up my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> These are good for one-time use only. They get stretched out and break when taking them out. If you only want them for the occasional small braid, then I think they are perfect.</li>
    <li> I got these to secure little braids and try new updo hairstyles. They are super stretchy, hold hair securely and inexpensive enough that I don&#x27;t feel bad cutting one out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Work.  But much flimsier than the ones at my local super center.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I use them for my daughters hair and they work but get stretched out after one use and don&#x27;t go back to shape. These bands are good for one or two uses. They were inexpensive, do the job, and 250 come in the pack so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Bought to put in my 9 month old baby&#x27;s hair and they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t make a thicker band in a clear color, but these are thin, cellophane bands. Can really only be used once! Work best when hair is clean &amp; DRY, otherwise they will slip on wet or gelled hair! I prefer Scunci bands but so far I can only find them in black.</li>
    <li> I have hispanic/caucasian/asian hair and they grip great. I use them when making braids that get pinned into elaborate hairstyles. They are less bulky than regular elastics and don&#x27;t seem too rough on the hair. I&#x27;ve even slept in them before. They are stretchy enough to get around a pretty thick section too.</li>
    <li> Great little hairbands for thin hair. They do tangle and pull but they&#x27;re elastic so you expect that. One time use.</li>
    <li> I got these to keep my 1 year old&#x27;s hair out of her eyes (she spouts a mini top knot). Happily, this rubber band stays put most of the day and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
    <li> I HATE THESE CHEAP, FLIMSY rubber bands!!!!!!  In the pic they LOOK thicker than they are.  They are just ANOTHER bag of LOW QUALITY, CRA**Y bands!!!  ANOTHER $ 4.00 WASTED!!!!  They are NOT worth the postage to return them, and I have been too ill to take ANYTHING to the post office &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  I can&#x27;t even get to the store for milk, I am not gonna kill myself trying to return these, I will just be ADDING to the cost!!  Unfortunately, I think these sellers are counting on the fact that this JUNK costs as much to return as they do to TOSS THEM IN THE TRASH!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THESE, THEY ARE JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SURPISED AT HOW MUCH THESE WILL STRETCH WITH OUT BREAKING. IT WAS ALSO NICE TO SEE HOW WELL THEY COME OUT OF THE BRAID (I USE THE END OF A COMB AND SLIDE IT OFF THE HAIR) AND THEN UNTANGLE IT TO USE IT AGAIN. WILL DEF BUY AGAIN THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Great quality when stretched they haven&#x27;t broke so far :) they are very easy to use with wet or dry hair and they don&#x27;t pull hair either.</li>
    <li> These are very thin and snap/break easily.</li>
    <li> Not bad. I use two for extra security.</li>
    <li> When a YouTube poster mentioned how much better this product is over what we can pick up locally, I had to see if it was true.&lt;br /&gt;True and will order again as needed</li>
    <li> I got these for these to help manage my little girl&#x27;s long hair. They are elastic bands, and they work. I&#x27;m not sure what else you can say about them than that. I thought these were a really good price for the quantity, and I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I own a Salon/Spa and little bands are great for securing braids that are so popular right now.  Since they are clear they blend best with the hair so you don&#x27;t notice them as much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  They break very easy.  To tie my hair in a long braid I have to use 3 of them.</li>
    <li> I use these to  secure a napkin around  plastic cutlery for cook-outs.  Works great</li>
    <li> Break after 1 use, but so cheap I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> These break easily and are pretty thin. Grocery store bands are better and cheaper!</li>
    <li> Got these to use for a diaper cake. These worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work as hair bands. Heh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these elastics before and thought they were great. My 2 year old has very fine hair. I got my 2nd package and brought them on vacation and they are awful. So far at least 3 a day have broken while in her hair.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I use these to fix my toddler&#x27;s fine hair.  Easy to work with and does not pull the hair coming out.  Very small so great for fine toddler hair!</li>
    <li> I got these clear elastics for my 14 month old daughters hair, they are great! I was tired of matching elastics to every bow she has. These are totally clear, hold up well &amp; you can barely see them once a bow is in. Perfect! Can&#x27;t find them in stores!</li>
    <li> The goody ones are much better -- more flexible and stronger.  If I hadn&#x27;t tried the goody ones, I&#x27;d have given these a higher rating.</li>
    <li> Probably good for hair but I use them to hold my belts in place when there&#x27;s no belt buckle.  They work wonders.</li>
    <li> Awful.  These do not work. They practically melt off your hair after 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought these instead of my traditional goody brand clear elastics because they were so cheap. Big mistake. They brake while in my hair and you can only use them one time (if they hold up for more than a few hours).</li>
    <li> My daughter loves having her hair done and we watch a lot of Youtube videos on braids and updos. We needed clear bands so I got these. Best price I could find! Some are still attached to each other, but they&#x27;re easy to pull apart. They&#x27;re pretty much one time use, so expect to buy more later if you do a lot of braiding in your house :)</li>
    <li> These rubber bands are great because they don&#x27;t snag in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  They don&#x27;t break easily either.  I was very satisfied and have purchased these more than once.</li>
    <li> Package came right on time.  As they are plastic and elastic, they aren&#x27;t as reusable as rubber bands, but they don&#x27;t bite into my hair, either, so am pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar plastic bands for years, and used to make a game of how long I could make one last--often for months. These fatigue and snap after one or two uses, and occasionally upon first use. In fact, I found I had to use two at a time to keep them from breaking on first use, if I put them around a thin ponytail twice. So think of them as single use. It&#x27;s true that they don&#x27;t get tangled in your hair.</li>
    <li> My collection of sewing machine bobbins gets unruly with stray threads tangling themselves up into a frustrating mess. So I started using elastic bands off fruit clamshell boxes to wrap around the thread on the bobbins in order to keep everything organized, but, being blue and long, the bands were hard to see around at the colour thread they were binding once they&#x27;d been wound round several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw these clear, small bands and gave them a try. Perfect! Now the long, blue bands hold our electrical wires together!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with clear bands and I loved the price and the look, but these are one-time use bands.  I guess for the price, one should expect that.  They do stretch quite a bit with the first use which makes them unusable for a 2nd try.  A few broke the first time I used them when I pulled them a little too far.  I will try clear bands again, but based on suggestions from this site, I will try the Goody brand to see if they might be more durable.  I also noticed a few strands of hair would get wound around them much like using a rubber band.  Since they feel much like tiny, clear rubber bands, I&#x27;m not surprised by this either.  For one who normally wears a lot of stretchy hair bands in various colors, this will be a new experience.</li>
    <li> I know these were basically small inexpensive band for hair but come on these break so easily there almost impossible to install i your hair with breakage.  These are more frustrating then helpful to me with my thick hair at least.</li>
    <li> They break so easily. And still tangle! My husband could never put our daughters hair up because his fingers stretched the band&#x27;s out and the broke!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that these kind of bands could really be pull-proof (as in, not rip out any hair when removed.) I was pleasantly surprised that this didn&#x27;t rip out any hair or tug when removed. I was also pleased with the quality, these are much thicker than the ones I was previously using, and I have not had any break so far. They&#x27;re fairly small so really best for braids, and not ponytails (in case anyone was wondering.)</li>
    <li> I love these rather than trying to match the color of the hair or what I&#x27;m braiding to the elastic. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the elastic standing out.</li>
    <li> This little bands are great for styling and braids. They hold for as long as you have them in. The only problem is they are a little difficult to take out, ripping hair out in the process. I wet my hair and slide them right off.</li>
    <li> These are okay.  Next time I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand.  I only get one use out of them.  When I take them out of my hair they always break so I never get to reuse them.  I&#x27;ve had some break while they are still in my hair.  Other brands I&#x27;ve tried I can usually reuse at least once or twice but not these.  Other than that they&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> These bands perform as expected.  Don&#x27;t snag on my baby&#x27;s hair.  Very satisfied and great price!</li>
    <li> These break very easily. I can maybe get two uses out of them before it will snap. Maybe not meant for adult hair. However there are a ton that come in the package so it could be worse.</li>
    <li> Simply perform the way I expected. Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I liked the price, but I don&#x27;t like the product. The bands do not give as much of a stretch as some of the others I have used and break easily. It also took longer than it expected to arrive.</li>
    <li> Break easy...guess I&#x27;m glad I have so many. I use for my daughter&#x27;s hair, as it is thin.</li>
    <li> Cheap. I don&#x27;t know why it has such a high rating. I can&#x27;t reuse them like my Goodies brand because they keep breaking.</li>
    <li> Good quality stretchy bands. So far so good. Just right!</li>
    <li> These are great! I use them on my 4 month old&#x27;s very fine, thin hair, as well as to secure the end of a braid in my own hair. Very stretchy. I usually only get one or two uses out of them before they break.</li>
    <li> Great price, good quality without breaking.  But be careful because they don&#x27;t have a ton of &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; to them.</li>
    <li> They break really really, but I expected that. I don&#x27;t use them for large amounts of hair, I just use them for the end of my braids that pull out easily. They do the job I intended them to do so they get 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These work great for braids, unique hairstyles, etc. They held my hair all day and did exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for my 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  I just use them each only once.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I love that they&#x27;re clear!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for hair styles</li>
    <li> These rubber bands were just perfect for my need.  I used them to secure 150 diapers I was using for a diaper cake.  Just the right size and clear so they don&#x27;t show.  Don&#x27;t know how to use them in braiding but they have more than one purpose.  At least for me.</li>
    <li> omg 200 for how much ??</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. Don&#x27;t hold hair well.</li>
    <li> kind of hard to mess up a product like this</li>
    <li> I read great reviews for these and ordered 3 packs. Not sure if I got a bad group but these pop EVERY TIME I try to use it. Will continue to look for a better brand.</li>
    <li> These hair ties aren&#x27;t that great. I ordered them for my one and a half year old. Her hair isn&#x27;t super thick and I use the hair ties for pig tails. Sometimes they break as I&#x27;m putting them in and the rubberBand is so thin that I can never get a second use out of them. On the plus side you do get tons in one pack but now I feel like I have to use them all before buying better quality ones. Oh well, only a few dollars wasted.</li>
    <li> I have very smooth blonde hair.  The regular bands slip out of my hair.  These do not.  They stay put all day long.  In fact, some care has to be taken to remove them and it is easy to pull hair out with them.  Instead of just pulling them out, I unwrap them (so if I wrap them twice around a braid, I unwind so it is not doubled) and remove them.  Each one lasts several uses if you don&#x27;t yank on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part is they are so small and clear, if you drop one on a light-colored floor, it is hard to find it.  So, just don&#x27;t drop any.</li>
    <li> my girls go through a pile of these braiding bands. the clear color makes it easier for us so we don&#x27;t have to dig for matching (or purposely unmatching) bands. not consistent in some of its width, but they do well for the price. a couple broke on me &#x27;cause I overstretched and they were on the narrower width.</li>
    <li> When I saw the pathetic packaging I want expecting much...what a pleasant surprise! (I should mention I am mixed race and I have very long hair that is an unhappy mash-up of fine yet frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;Tried two out on braided pigtails and they survived cardio plus a workout with no slippage, and they don&#x27;t pull my crazy hair out a bit. I&#x27;ll be using these a lot!</li>
    <li> The bands are thin. I had to use 2 on each side to tie my daughter&#x27;s pigtails.</li>
    <li> My kids have really thin hair and are constantly losing their hair bands. I bought these and it stays in their hair all day long. The only thing is that they break about the 1st or 2nd use so you have to keep on buying them.</li>
    <li> I suspect these bands were exposed to UV or heat while in storage. Most broke immediately, the rest broke within 3 days of use. Plastic elastic braiding bands are meant to be hardy and long-lasting for binding the ends of braids. Instead, these broke more than four times more quickly than the ordinarily weaker black rubber bands I use as short-term \\&quot;break-away\\&quot; bands for the hair root. (And the black rubber bands I&#x27;ve been using are more than 10 years old). Extremely disappointing performance and not worth even the Amazon \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; price.</li>
    <li> Great price for a hair essential if you like braiding or doing any of the fancier &#x27;dos you can learn of YouTube.</li>
    <li> Terrible they all keep snapping</li>
    <li> We use them for our daughter and I like that they don&#x27;t seem to break her hair strands. I can get similar ones cheaper at our local dollar store, but they don&#x27;t seem to hold as well.</li>
    <li> My toddler couldn&#x27;t have finer hair and by some miracle these stay in so well. I&#x27;ve used them probably a dozen times and none have broken so far. They don&#x27;t pull her hair out. They are easy to get in. And they stay! I&#x27;m so happy with them.</li>
    <li> They work well but are a little small for my 3 year old&#x27;s fine hair. We make it work by wrapping them 3 times</li>
    <li> These are nice braiding bands but the break too easily. My daughter&#x27;s hair is soft so this was perfect for her hair....I just had to be clearful when using them</li>
    <li> These bands hold very well even in my super fine hair. They do exactly what they are supposed to do. I would recommend to anyone with thin/fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great braiding bands!  They stretch very easily and could really be used twice if you are using these as a one-day hairstyle as I am.  They were not tangled or mangled in any way.  Great product- and the package will last for years!</li>
    <li> Target stopped carrying the Goody brand kid-size clear hair ties that I use for my toddler so I tried these.  Work OK for one, maybe two uses but stretch with one use and break easily.  Won&#x27;t buy these again as I&#x27;ve now found the Goody brand on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Worst ever!  I can not imagine how anyone gives these a good review.  Most break when I try to put them on, the rest within 2 hours. I have thin fine hair, so it really shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  With Goody brand I can usually take them out &amp; put them back on several times.  And in a pinch I&#x27;ve used an old one at the bottom of my purse without issue.</li>
    <li> These hair bands have been AWESOME in my 2 year olds super fine hair. They stay put, rarely break, and pull out fairly easy with little fuss. (They do pull out better if her hair is wet though!) I occasionally use them on mine or my 6 year old&#x27;s braided hair, too.  They work great.  This is my 3rd time buying these and I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Work fine for putting small braid or twists in my hair with out being noticable, but they are hard to handle and break easily.</li>
    <li> I used these on a craft project, they were great</li>
    <li> I use these to tie up my hair extensions when I receive them from my suppliers. It works perfect because of their size, they are VERY small. Yes, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a intricate hairstyle for prom, and was a little worried that they would be brittle like some of the ones you can buy in the store, but they are actually really stretchy! The only time that one of them broke was when I had already used it once, for prom, and then (purely out of curiosity) tried to use it again. They are definitely designed for one time use, which is what I expected -- but great product, and cheap! I still probably haven&#x27;t used a third of them yet, and for only 5 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair as well for those concerned about hair type. Sometimes I even use them for all my hair when I just do one big simple braid, and they hold great, almost better than normal hair elastics.</li>
    <li> These have great stretch, and don&#x27;t break as easily as other varieties.</li>
    <li> These are cheap. These are clear. They do what they say they will do. I am a stickler for quality so I&#x27;m deducting one star because each rubber band can really only handle one use before snapping - not sure of this is an issue with manufacturing or if the elastic just dries out and becomes brittle over time. Still, with so many per package, this doesn&#x27;t really bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicious unrelated schadenfreude story: some d-bag started stealing packages in our building, and managed to get their hands one of our Amazon deliveries that had a pair of Ray-Bans inside, which was pretty upsetting. We immediately started rerouting packages to our offices, but not before the box bearing these elastics got delivered, and promptly stolen. I just delight in imagining the a**hole rip open the [absurdly large] cardboard box to find these inside. Needless  to say, at the very least they served that $2 purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, shout-out to Amazon for being so awesome about dealing with lost / stolen packages. I sort of feel like I deserve good customer service seeing as I buy e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. on Amazon, but they really do deliver.</li>
    <li> Works great with dog top knots</li>
    <li> I purchased these on account of one review that stated these were very elastic. Having bought a different kind elsewhere that did not stretch, that word was all I needed. These are great. I can easily put my 2 big fingers in them. Best of all they stay in my extremely thin hair. There&#x27;s no need for you to try any others. These are the best.</li>
    <li> The bands don&#x27;t work as good as the Goody clear bands do. These would probably work great on a child&#x27;s hair but aren&#x27;t really thick enough for adults.</li>
    <li> Breaks easily, only good for small braids or using once or twice.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hairs</li>
    <li> I purchased these for Christmas projects and they were adequate for the job.  I liked that they are clear.  The only complaint I can come up with is that they broke easily, but maybe I&#x27;m too much of a brute (ha ha).</li>
    <li> these are perfect, nice and stretchy for little braids. My daughter is growing her bangs out and we have used these to get past that awkward stage to keep them out of her eyes before she could tuck the hair behind her ears. I do recommend finding a good container for them, they will spill out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews mentioned them stretching out and breaking after one use. I figure these are disposable since they are tiny and you get some many. We don&#x27;t reuse them.</li>
    <li> I bought these online cause I was too lazy to search at the store, but I&#x27;m sure you could get a pack like this for a buck as opposed to almost $4.. They&#x27;re exactly what the picture shows and works fine, but if you have thick hair they make break easily..They did the job they&#x27;re supposed to but they&#x27;re not top quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I thought they would actually be &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34;. They&#x27;re actually plastic. They stretch and everything, but didn&#x27;t want them smooth. So I don&#x27;t know if I just didn&#x27;t read the details right or what, but they were not good for the project I had in mind. Gave them to a friend with two toddlers.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> I have very long hair. I use these to attach yarn or ribbons to my hair for braiding for special events. They of course are also great for the ends on any braid since the hair gets so narrow at the end of the braid. It comes with so many that I don&#x27;t get discouraged when I break them. I am rough with them!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sorry but i have to give it a low stars... the gold magic bands are rather weak, i do not have thick dreads (mine are rather thin) and i have to replace at least 4 or 5 bands every night... i&#x27;m tempted to buy the black bands again ...</li>
    <li> These are terrible. Very thin and super stretchy.</li>
    <li> So mad. I got these, NOT because I want to change them out after a few hours because they break. Very bad product. I am irritated because it got such good reviews, but I am submitting them for a return. If you buy this, good luck. You&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a baby cloth project that I was making.  I tend to be very rough with these and usually break a handful of them.  These were very durable, I think 1 out of the 150 that I used snapped.  They are excellent for crafting projects, hair I am not too sure about.  The price was excellent for the amount that comes.</li>
    <li> Great invisible ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> use them for rigging live bait on a hook, tough little bands</li>
    <li> They stretch out a lot</li>
    <li> My daughter has really fine hair and a tender scalp, so when we put hair elastics in, they have to be this type.  They don&#x27;t get caught or stuck--they are far gentler to her hair than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair elastics.  At the end of the day, when we&#x27;re taking her braids out, we don&#x27;t have to cut them out, and there are no tears involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these in particular, I like the quality--they are very pliable, so they don&#x27;t snap while I&#x27;m putting them in.  In the past, I&#x27;ve dealt with some brands (usually the ones I got at the store) where half of the bands snapped in my face while I was using them--I&#x27;m happy to report that I have not had a single one snap so far (I&#x27;m only through about 30 of them so far).  I&#x27;ve even been able to use some twice.</li>
    <li> So many little bands in one bag.</li>
</ol>
