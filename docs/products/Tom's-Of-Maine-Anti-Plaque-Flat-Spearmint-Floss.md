      <li>Absolutely the best floss</li>
      <li>Nice flavor though.</li>
      <li>I liked the spearmint flavor of the floss.  </li>
      <li>... for what it is worth, .. i have really good teeth!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good value considering what you pay for top brands at the drug stores, and Tom&#x27;s is better.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s very good floss, i think it cleans really well.</li>
      <li>Very good product, just as good as the leading flosses, but better because of the all naturally sourced ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST dental floss on the market.  </li>
      <li>Waxed tape is the most effective for plaque removal</li>
      <li>He told me people should go for the thicker flosses because it&#x27;s more effective</li>
      <li>Natural mint flavor is delicious</li>
      <li>The thinner flosses are more comfortable but haven&#x27;t found one with all good ingredients yet.  </li>
      <li>This is a very strong dental floss more on the thicker category.</li>
      <li>; for those who can use it, it&#x27;s a fine product; doesn&#x27;t shred, for one thing!</li>
      <li>Like this floss, and love the Tom&#x27;s ethic.  </li>
      <li>We love that this floss works well to remove plaque.</li>
      <li>Our kids love the Glide brand, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well for the adults in our house as Tom&#x27;s does.</li>
      <li>so people with a wider gap might be perfectly ok.</li>
      <li>and I use many ADA approved products</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it :)</li>
      <li>Now I am getting something better in every way.</li>
      <li>No nasty chemicals and preservatives.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This floss is a family favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I guess I can understand why they feel the more abrasive floss would work better.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve got 5 more rolls I&#x27;d love to sell you.</li>
      <li>Yes it costs more</li>
      <li>The cleaning is much more thorough, but is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s better than any petrochemical alternative</li>
      <li>I just love the feeling of using Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>and it tastes ok</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product very much.  Cleans my teeth very well, has a pleasant taste, and no Teflon!  Quick shipping, too.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately one package arrived with the floss completely stuck and not rolling out, so it will require rejiggering the container somehow. Otherwise we would have given more stars. The other rolls of Tom&#x27;s floss seem fine so far.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss, as it never snags in my teeth, yet is wide enough to work well.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the grocery store, so I&#x27;m glad to know I can purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about using this product, but I can&#x27;t floss with it at all! The tape is super large and seems like its meant for someone with wide spaces between their teeth.</li>
    <li> i would have preferred the &#x27;no flavor&#x27; to the spearmint, but Tom&#x27;s has chosen not to offer that. Still, it&#x27;s very good floss, i think it cleans really well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  Tom&#x27;s, recently, however, has changed the product.  It is no longer as flat as it used to be - in fact, it seems more round now and thinner (though just as strong).  I do not care for it as well and will be trying another product to see if I like it better.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine spearmint floss is really great stuff. Gets between teeth really well and works. Really fells like your teeth are cleaned</li>
    <li> Using this floss is like flossing with twine - it&#x27;s very thick, and very difficult to get in and out between my teeth. Something slightly short of brute force is necessary when flossing. I don&#x27;t think I have abnormally tight teeth either. Unfortunately I bought the six-pack so am stuck with it for a while, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best dental floss on the market!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s flat, naturally waxed floss is so effective.  The floss is thick enough to properly clean between teeth, and yet not so thick that you cannot get it between tightly spaced teeth.  It is also gentle on the gums and does not feel like it is cutting them.  The natural wax makes the floss easy to use and the spearmint flavoring is not over-powering.  I absolutely love this floss - which sounds rather melodramatic, but is true.  It has all the properties you want to provide a good flossing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this floss because it was the best rated product on Amazon and I have always hated the stuff I find in the store.  It always breaks and shreads.  For me this floss is simply too thick for my teeth.  And because it doesn&#x27;t fit very well, it shreads.  Sometimes getting shreaded thread out is harder than getting food out from between the teeth.  If you have lots of space between your teeth, you will probably love this floss as it is a little rougher than the standard floss helping food stick to it.</li>
    <li> The thread is so thick and coarse. It feels like it is grinding/stripping away the enamel on my teeth. A weird sensation that makes me not want to floss as a result.</li>
    <li> Fits between close teeth and it is strong.  Best floss I have used.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss and it is difficult to find at stores and very expensive to boot.  I am glad to find that it is available in a 6 pack which is much more reasonably priced than paying almost $5 for a single pack at the store.  This floss is thick and strong so I feel like it cleans really well unlike the thinner flosses out there.  Another plus is that the flavor isn&#x27;t fake and overwhelming.</li>
    <li> We got this floss to change up the clean teeth game. Most noted for the all natural, Tom&#x27;s has been a great brand to use. We expected a flat floss and got a somewhat flat floss. It is still quite effective though.</li>
    <li> I started using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste a few years ago, but their dental floss is not carried by any of stores in our area.  It&#x27;s the best floss I have ever used.  It actually feels like it is cleaning something!!</li>
    <li> This Dental floss provides the Best and Easiest cleaning (Bar None) of all the most Popular brands sold at drug stores &amp; grocery chains. However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at my local drug chains &amp; grocery stores anymore!! It Just Disappeared off the store shelves so I&#x27;m assuming because it wasn&#x27;t selling like all the other Familiar Toothpaste Corporation brands which are Not nearly as effective in their ability to provide thorough cleaning as this one. Yes, one has a mouthwash flavored product and the other one does this and so on..but I&#x27;ve tried them all and TOM&#x27;s is KING!!!! The natural fibers, waxes and all natural spearmint oil make flossing a real PLEASURE. I never thought that would come out of my mouth but so do all those bad germies &amp; tarter with this magnificent floss.    Please Amazon..Please keep selling this Fine product!!!  Give My Regards to Tom&#x27;s Of Maine!!!!!!  Tom&#x27;s of Maine Please Keep making these Great Products!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss as it is wider than most (closer to a tape), has a pleasant subtle flavor &amp; I like the texture of the wax. Doesn&#x27;t fall apart &amp; get caught in my teeth like some.</li>
    <li> This smells great, the ribbon is so much better than floss for me. The cleaning is much more thorough, but is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I get lazy about flossing like a lot of people, but this in a six pack makes it easier - can have some nearby when I am watching TV. If I have not flossed in a while and my gums bleed, I rinse my mouth with peroxide and water afterwards so as to protect my gums and also my heart. this is the first  time that I have used Tom&#x27;s flossing ribbon, and I like it very much. The price is very good for a pack of 6.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss. It would seem that almost every brand of floss I bought would break 3-4 times during one session. Very wasteful and frustrating. Tom&#x27;s floss rarely breaks. I would highly recommend this floss if wasteful breaking is a problem for you.</li>
    <li> Thick, rough floss which I believe if used properly is more effective than the regular brands. Works in tight spaces as well.</li>
    <li> This floss is great!     Very thick and a great taste.     It&#x27;s the same floss my dentist uses.  He told me people should go for the thicker flosses because it&#x27;s more effective and I agree.    Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little pricey and doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> Great floss and almost impossible to find at the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see all the positive reviews for this item. I love Tom&#x27;s in general so it pains me to write this review but the simple fact is that this floss is too thick. It&#x27;s difficult and uncomfortable to get between your teeth. I gave it a chance and used it several times thinking maybe I just have to get used to it, but each time was just as unpleasant. If you have gaps between your teeth you may like this floss. If you don&#x27;t, I would stay away. Also, the floss shredded a few times during use. I returned this and will look for another natural floss.</li>
    <li> This product is neat and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have need for this item, you will do well to acquire it from this source.</li>
    <li> I am SO hooked on this floss and grateful that Amazon sells it, as I cannot find it anywhere in my local stores.  I no longer use other brands as this feels so much more effective.</li>
    <li> Love this floss.  Wish they still made the round floss for my husband who has close contact and overlapping teeth.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Too thick to floss</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference using this the very first time.  I have over crowding problems with my bottom teeth therefore the build up is always there.  This floss is amazing with removing the hard deposits between the teeth that you can actually feel the difference after one floss.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive gums. It works well because the ribbon is flat instead of round, it has a mild spearmint flavor and it&#x27;s not to waxy.</li>
    <li> This floss is a bit thick for &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; or ribbon floss. If they could make it a bit smoother, than I think this floss would catch less and do a better job getting into tight spaces. As of right now, I have to force it in between a few teeth and sometimes that cuts my gums. The flavor and packaging are great.</li>
    <li> We love that this floss works well to remove plaque. Our kids love the Glide brand, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well for the adults in our house as Tom&#x27;s does. The price here is half of what most stores charge!</li>
    <li> Description said I was buying a six pack of floss, but I only received two packages. Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few times Amazon reviews have failed me. My only guess is that the reviews were loaded with people like Michael Strahan and Lauren Hutton - folks with huge gaps between their teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t particularly close together either. My wife, for example, has teeth much closer together. But even my moderately spaced teeth couldn&#x27;t take this insane floss. It&#x27;s like flossing with twine. Some reviewers are like, &amp;#34;Oh you just need to pull it tight.&amp;#34; Yeah, I tried that. This floss isn&#x27;t elastic like a tape. I wish they could make the same floss maybe one-quarter the thickness, because I love the concept of a natural waxed floss. This is just entirely too thick. It boggles my mind that anyone with relatively normal teeth can use it.  But for those with huge gaps between their teeth, you&#x27;ve found the right stuff. And I&#x27;ve got 5 more rolls I&#x27;d love to sell you.</li>
    <li> works quite well, tastes really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though i preferred the cinnamon version that they used to offer, ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps ... for what it is worth, .. i have really good teeth!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my gums between my teeth</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve realized the secret for me to make this work is to pull the floss a lot tighter between my fingers. That enables it to slip in much easier and allows the fibers to then \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; the teeth. I guess I was too used to Glide! I like it much better now that I figured that part out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products and the company philosophy, so I was happy to see this product. But overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this again. Here are the pros and cons, so you can make your own judgment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Natural mint flavor is delicious&lt;br /&gt;- Price is pretty fair for the 6 pack and yardage.&lt;br /&gt;- Recycled packaging.&lt;br /&gt;- If you can get the floss in, it does seem like the thick texture probably helps catch and clean out plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Texture of the floss is thick. It&#x27;s noticeably more difficult to fit between my teeth than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;- This floss shreds.&lt;br /&gt;- My kids find it tough to use. They&#x27;re young and we&#x27;re still flossing their teeth, and we have to use more force to get it in there. They don&#x27;t love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work for people who don&#x27;t have dental work and/or closely spaced teeth, but for those of us who are used to more glide in our floss, this will take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> It was good, but I had a hard time running it between some of my teeth.  I think I like Glide better.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of the floss and you get a lot of use out of each spool. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how thick the floss is. It is hard to fit between some of my teeth. Otherwise, I am quite happy with the product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> With rough and unequally spaced dental work always changing with time, I need a ribbon floss and this works better than any of the other brands.</li>
    <li> (1) Do you want to have nice gums, by flossing every day?&lt;br /&gt;(2) Do you want to be kind to animals, by using products that are cruelty-free?&lt;br /&gt;(3) Do you want to save money so that you can spend more money drinking, going on vacations, etc?&lt;br /&gt;If so, buying Tom&#x27;s of Maine floss on Amazon is the right choice for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haha. I bought the floss for the 3 above reasons--I wanted a cruelty-free floss (since most cosmetic products are painfully tested on animals), but I wanted it to be affordable. Buying Toms of Maine in bulk from Amazon was my solution. I&#x27;ve been using the huge quantity of floss I bought for about a year now, and I still have plenty more left! The floss is fresh and minty, and the right size to fit between my teeth. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I really like this floss. Some say it is like \\&quot;rope\\&quot;. I guess I can understand that after using some of the other flosses that really slip and slide and glide. Personally, I like a little texture &amp; roughness so that it feels like it&#x27;s actually doing some cleaning and scrubbing instead of just sliding over the gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t shred and break as easily as other ones I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s certainly not indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that it has \\&quot;no synthetic waxes, artificial sweeteners or preservatives, no artificial color or flavor, and no animal ingredients\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a happy user of this related product: [[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze 3&#x27; Hose Oral Irrigation]]</li>
    <li> This stuff never breaks like thinner floss,  yet it fits between my teeth, even where the spacing is very narrow.</li>
    <li> Was nervous to purchase because my teeth are very tight due to braces from childhood, but this floss works just fine.  Will repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> I was using Johnson &amp; Johnson REACH mini waxed floss right before I bought the Tom&#x27;s floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Johnson &amp; Johnson floss was cutting my fingertips.  In addition, the Johnson &amp; Johnson floss was breaking before I could finish flossing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have these problems at all with the Tom&#x27;s floss.  I haven&#x27;t broken a piece of it yet and it hasn&#x27;t caused any finger cuts yet.  Besides that, I think it does a better job of cleaning my teeth and it&#x27;s much more comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in using dental floss and I think I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is worth the extra money for dental floss; it is naturally and no extra waxy residue taste with just a spritz of natural flavored mint.&lt;br /&gt;Floss every and keep the dentist bills away!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and has a very good grip. Good scent, easy on the gum and cleans very well! Great product.</li>
    <li> Nice and grippy, thick enough to clean well but not too thick.  I like the ribbon shape.  Flavor tastes &#x27;real&#x27;, not chemical.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this brand since it&#x27;s natural, reliable and strong. He&#x27;s used these for months now, and it&#x27;s his preferred brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the dental floss out there. Friends will say I&#x27;m obsessed with oral hygiene and yes, they&#x27;re right.  This is by far the BEST dental floss on the market.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I have an implant that is sharp edged and tight.  I have tried many commercial flosses and they keep breaking.  Not this tough boy.  It&#x27;s great and strong. And it large enough to gradually work the teeth apart.</li>
    <li> We used to love this floss and bought it in cases, but they have recently changed it to a very thin, flimsy version.  It does not clean nearly as well, so we will no longer be subscribing this product.</li>
    <li> We use Tom&#x27;s floss exclusively.  It doesn&#x27;t shred like most other flosses and we like that it is flat rather than round.  It is obviously a quality floss and the spearmint flavor is mild and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I am a hygienist and I use and recommend this floss to everyone. It is wide and has wonderful friction for removing sticky plaque between teeth. It also does a wonderful job massaging the gums. I have patients dramatically reduce their bleeding and inflammation by switching to this product. I believe the anti-bacterial resins in the wax are beneficial also.</li>
    <li> I like that this dental floss is thicker than others.  It&#x27;s good for my gappy teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the first bad review I&#x27;ve written and it&#x27;s because this dental floss is awful. I bought it at Whole Foods today and tried it out for the first time. I will not be using this again. I normally use Glide floss and I&#x27;ll be sticking to it. So, if you also use and love Glide, I don&#x27;t recommend this one. Some reviewers said they liked the texture of the floss and I guess I can understand why they feel the more abrasive floss would work better. It truly feels like it&#x27;s getting right up against the tooth and scraping the bad stuff off. My complaint is with how difficult it was too move the floss in and out of between my teeth. Maybe my teeth a closer together than average so people with a wider gap might be perfectly ok. I really struggled to gently work it in so as not to shred my gums on the way down. I also had to tug on the floss with some force to bring it out again. The floss even came apart each time so that I had to try to tug each individual thread out. It was a pain and not something I&#x27;m willing to struggle with everyday. This isn&#x27;t a problem with floss that&#x27;s more of a dental tape. Like I said, maybe it will work better for teeth with more space in between.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just way too wide for normally spaced teeth. Nearly ripped out a filling using it. Wife agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a pack of 6. The other 5 are probably going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Radius brand if you&#x27;re looking for a natural floss.</li>
    <li> Some of my teeth are a little farther apart. I also have a few badly made crowns; so when I floss at their base, thinner floss will shred. So for thickness and durability, this floss is great. I also like the wax. On the other hand, I have not experienced the strong taste/flavor others have mentioned, which I would have welcomed.</li>
    <li> I started using Toms&#x27; of Maine products a few years back and they&#x27;re wonderful.  The toothpast along with the floss are the best.  You can trust this company because of what is not in their products.</li>
    <li> Very good product, just as good as the leading flosses, but better because of the all naturally sourced ingredients. I wish they would put this floss on flossers, maybe with recycled plastic, but that&#x27;s a wish. Here are the ingredients, listed on their website:    Beeswax &#x3D; Ease of use (Beehives)  Carnauba wax &#x3D; Ease of use (Brazilian wax palm tree)  Spearmint oil &#x3D; Flavor  (Leaves of the spearmint herb)  Jojoba wax &#x3D; Ease of use (Jojoba plant)  Acacia &#x3D; Flavor carrier (Tree resin)  Myrrh &#x3D; Clean, healthy-feeling mouth (Resin from the myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) bush)  Propolis  &#x3D; Natural resins for a clean, healthy-feeling mouth (Mixture of tree resin (Propolis cera) gathered by bees)</li>
    <li> This is a great product in its natural real ingredients, nothing artificial, which is a must in our family.  The only qualm I have with this product is that it is a little thick for me, when I floss it can be a bit painful, as if tugging a little too hard on my teeth, getting it unstuck from between each floss.  My teeth are in good shape, but with hard tugs, it can be a little bit uncomfortable.  The thinner flosses are more comfortable but haven&#x27;t found one with all good ingredients yet.  Would not recommend for adults with teeth that are a bit loose, may be too aggressive.</li>
    <li> Love this floss and it is hard to find for some reason now.  It is thicker than the kind you get at regular stores, so it really grabs the stuff in between your teeth that other kinds miss.</li>
    <li> If you have really bunched up teeth that are close together. . This could be a problem being that its like a couple or few regular strands of floss put together, But Mine are somewhat close and I can still get it with some effort.</li>
    <li> Not as good as it used to be, breaks easily leaving tiny fibers stuck between your teeth. Never used to be a problem but last several batches have been very inferior. I always used to buy this but will not repurchase it any more.</li>
    <li> I like this floss because of the thicker, rougher texture.  Ordinary floss feels about as effective as drying yourself with a wet towel.  You can seriously feel a difference with this floss, and my hygienist is always impressed with my gums.  No bleeding ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if your teeth are spaced very closely, this floss may be too thick for you.  Boo, sorry.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever.  Our local natural grocery store stopped selling my favorite floss by Tom&#x27;s of Maine. I was very excited to find it here. I bought one box of six it will last over 1 year.</li>
    <li> seriously tom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not everyone in the world has super wide tooth gaps to fit fat strands of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not only are the strands too thick, but the wax is not even slippery. I gave it two tries and i felt like i was going to yank a tooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually happy with tom&#x27;s products, but they totally failed on this one. I bought a 6 pack thinking they usually make good stuff so there was no risk, but i ended up really disappointed. i&#x27;m going to throw it all away. Can&#x27;t even gift it away because i don&#x27;t know anyone with teeth that wide apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no thanks.</li>
    <li> This floss is so intense!  I appreciate the company&#x27;s dedication to environmentally-friendly practices.  I share in their philosophy.  I make all my own toiletries and do everything I can to live a chemical-free life that has a low impact on our world.  But this floss is the pits.  It&#x27;s the sort of floss that snaps into place, causing your gums to bleed no matter how long you use it.  It&#x27;s just way to intense.  I have to go back to the old standard Glide floss for this reason.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for the remaining 5 1/2 packages I purchased (which was so dumb on my part).  I feel like I could use it as rope to tie up my boat...ok that&#x27;s a huge exaggeration, but I will likely use it in my gardening!  Maybe it could tie stakes to small trees or something.</li>
    <li> Durable.  The only brand I use.  And I am a flossaholic.</li>
    <li> The best floss I have found</li>
    <li> Best Floss in the World - I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is super thick. Like, using minty knitting yarn thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After your teeth get used to it, it&#x27;s great, though! I love it (and it is very tight in between my teeth) my husband (who has really wide set teeth) hates it...go figure.</li>
    <li> All of my dental care products are from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  Outstanding results.  The only product(s) that I don&#x27;t care for are the \\&quot;Wicked Fresh\\&quot; line... they all leave a funky film and after taste in your mouth &amp; on your teeth.  I&#x27;m sticking with the original products (fluoride-free) and I LOVE the natural mouthwash with baking soda &amp; peppermint... awesome!  Please don&#x27;t change a thing Tom&#x27;s of Maine!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of floss out there at this point and from my experience, nothing comes close to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t like that typical waxy floss that you&#x27;ve used before. This stuff is nice and wide ribbon which greatly increases the amount of cleaning you can get done in between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for some great floss, seriously, look no further. The best part is that it comes in a pack of 6, so I have no worries about running out any time soon :)</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best floss for me.  I don&#x27;t have much room between my teeth and this flat waxed floss works perfectly.  Half the price I found at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly. Great product</li>
    <li> This product is a lot more rough then I expected it to be. I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing again :/</li>
    <li> This Natural Waxed Flossing Ribbon is not as comfortable as I expected! I use before other brands and they where more comfortable. When I use it between my teeth, that&#x27;s very thick and you can&#x27;t even take it of from the teeth .. but I gave 3 starts because its natural, if it won&#x27;t I will gave it 2 star.</li>
    <li> Works well, but can get stuck and frayed easily between tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why stores do not carry this product anymore!!  No other floss can do the job that Tom&#x27;s can.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, including the toothpicks with floss on them--they don&#x27;t compare!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s cruelty free, that&#x27;s why I bought it. I also like the smell. However, the thread is too think and it&#x27;s very difficult to use both for me and for my husband. :(</li>
    <li> Works great, good price</li>
    <li> This is the best floss ever! The floss has textured fiber strands that do work when you pull back and forth gently between teeth while flossing. It&#x27;s flat, so that helps it get in between teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gum when it finally gets through like some thinner flosses do.</li>
    <li> Great floss! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nothing not to dislike about it and it doesn&#x27;t break! It is the best floss you can get for the price.</li>
    <li> Been using this dental floss for years.  Box looks different now, but same quality and performance as always.  This is a very strong dental floss more on the thicker category.</li>
    <li> I love that this is natural, but I found it way too thick. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with floss before. I ended up giving it all away.</li>
    <li> I like these because the packaging is paper and therefore much more environmentally conscious, but they are not the most easy to glide between teeth. A bit too thick and harsh.</li>
    <li> Thick and works great</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t break, easy to wrap around finger for flossing.  good product.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband.  He said it works well.  Great Subscribe and Save price and he isn&#x27;t likely to run out too soon.</li>
    <li> Awesome floss. Does what it is supposed to! I love that it isn&#x27;t slick, cause it seems to get out more junk! Works great.</li>
    <li> I quickly returned this product to the manufacturer, for a full postpaid refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss is too thick for me.  The first time using it, a piece became lodged between my teeth.  I had to cut cut the floss out of my mouth, before removing the remaining piece with tweezers.  Some of my teeth are tight!- I have small spaces between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This appears to very very high quality floss.  It is best for people who have larger spaces between their teeth.</li>
    <li> I like that the company does no animal testing and appears to be socially responsible. Other than that, this is just floss.</li>
    <li> For years now this has been my favourite dental floss.  It holds up to being forced between teeth with very tight spaces, and doesn&#x27;t snap in two, leaving bits of thread stuck in the spaces as I&#x27;ve found with flimsier flosses.  It also doesn&#x27;t slice my gums or slip off of my fingers.  It picks up food matter from between the teeth as it should.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this dental floss.</li>
    <li> Love this floss!  Lightly waxed so you can scrape the teeth well.  Oral B ribbon has too much wax.  Flat ribbon gives more surface area to clean with than regular floss, yet it goes in teeth just as easily because it is flat.  Also, the ribbon is much stronger than floss.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this floss since I discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could still find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Does not move as smoothly between my teeth as well as others that I have used. Feels more like unwaxed varieties.</li>
    <li> This is a great floss, and even though Tom&#x27;s of Maine sold out to Colgate a while back, it&#x27;s still a good product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals. I hope Colgate starts doing the same!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this floss is natural waxed, but it is thicker than other floss and difficult to get between some of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Love the tooth paste and mouthwash so I picked this up too...I like it and will keep using it for a while, but it is reeeeally thick resulting in me being rougher on my gums than I ever have been before</li>
    <li> I have tight spacing in my teeth, and this floss is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve found that 1) can easily slide between my teeth,  2) won&#x27;t break or shred, and 3) has enough friction to remove film.  I just wish I could find it in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Very good dental floss! The best in my opinion!</li>
    <li> This floss is a family favorite.  It&#x27;s thick enough to really floss things out, but waxy enough to get into and out of the ridges between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place I&#x27;ve consistently been able to find this is Whole Foods, which is not always convenience to get to.  We found a deal on Amazon and now have a subscription, so we&#x27;ll never be without our favorite floss again!</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands and types of floss but this is my favorite by far. It feels more substantial that most other brands. The spearmint is so subtle I hardly notice it but that is fine with me.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers have noted, this does a great job. Lots of floss just slides over your teeth, but this feels like it is actually cleaning some of the tartar off your teeth. You can&#x27;t find this in every store, so I hope it continues to be sold on Amazon. It&#x27;s a good value considering what you pay for top brands at the drug stores, and Tom&#x27;s is better. I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> The floss was made of natural fibers for flossing.  I liked the spearmint flavor of the floss.  The floss is highly recommended by me.</li>
    <li> Love Tom&#x27;s but cannot fit this between my teeth.  Nice flavor though.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best floss</li>
    <li> Grips all the crud from between the teeth!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred, it&#x27;s actually got a sort of rough surface despite the fact that it&#x27;s waxed so the edges of your teeth actually get a little scrub. PLUS, because it&#x27;s Tom&#x27;s of Maine, it&#x27;s truly natural. No nasty chemicals and preservatives.</li>
    <li> I love this flossing tape and have had difficulty finding it.  The flat surface does a great job of cleaning between teeth.  Now I have a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> This floss does not shred to pieces under my crown like that j&amp;j crap. Yes it costs more but I no longer have to worry about the floss turning into a ball of fuzz under my teeth.</li>
    <li> This floss is so good for people with &amp;#34;tartar&amp;#34; problems. Using THIS floss and my electric toothbrush has solved my need for going to the dentist every 4 months for cleanings instead of the normal 6 months.  The texture of the floss is such, that it wipes between the teeth more thoroughly. Other flosses which are known for gliding easily, don&#x27;t really pull off the invisible residue....Then you develop a build up before long.  I have used this for the last 6 months and I cannot believe how it has worked....no tartar build up!  I am so happy, because I have very sensitive teeth and going to the dentist for cleanings is not a pleasant experience.  But now, there is less to clean so it is much more tolerable!  The other nice thing, is that is lasts longer than other brands.  Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Using this floss is very satisfying. It&#x27;s the best floss ever. My teeth feel so clean after using this. I floss after I brush, and then I follow up with a fluoride rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go back to any other floss after using this.</li>
    <li> I just love the feeling of using Tom&#x27;s products. The floss doesn&#x27;t shred if it gets stuck between my teeth so that&#x27;s just an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Like this floss, and love the Tom&#x27;s ethic.  If you want a more natural choice, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Not a fan at all. Product is abrasive, rough and altogether turned me off to flossing. I was hoping to write a glowing review since I love the Tom&#x27;s brand and mission but sadly , this is the worst floss I&#x27;ve ever purchased and they charge a premium for it which add insult to injury.</li>
    <li> This may be my favorite floss.  I also like Dr. Tung&#x27;s and use one at night and one in the morning.</li>
    <li> I use to just get the crap they sell at Costco...Glide.  I flossed every day but still had build-up.  I have no build-up now with Tom&#x27;s floss.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is all natural however, my teeth are quite tight and it hurts to use it.  Have not found a comparable product yet that is a little thinner.  I love Toms of Maine products but am sad that this does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Tastes just fine and does the job.  Thickness between regular floss and dental tape.  On the expensive side though, so...</li>
    <li> I like this floss the best. It gets everything out. After a night of drinking and whatever else--maybe you forgot to brush your teeth--you will definitely notice that this floss cleans well and thoroughly. It is not just a piece of flat tape. But it&#x27;s not some rope like others are describing either. This works well for people that floss once a day or possibly once every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for twice a day flossers as it is a deep cleaning floss that has some thickness. For me I love it. I floss once every other day and do a thorough cleaning as that is how I feel the best with my gums. The floss can break apart a little if you do not keep your metal slicer on the package clean of excess floss, but otherwise I have no problems with this stuff. It feels great on my teeth. If you are bleeding from a thicker floss you might want to try a little less thick version. If it&#x27;s only a slight amount of blood that really isn&#x27;t a huge deal compared to how deeply you will be cleaning your teeth with this product. A tape floss does nothing for my teeth and I still feel gunky after using those products. This is the best for me and I buy 6 at a time with S&amp;Save.</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite dental floss.  He likes it because it is thick and durable.  He tends to break other flosses or floss picks.  He feels that it does a better job getting his teeth clean.  He noted that some people might not like it if they don&#x27;t have much space between their teeth. It is different from other flosses that are 1 thin thread or the types that are a flat ribbon.  It is more like several threads wound together, in a fatter round thread.  If you purchase this, keep these differences in mind.  It has a totally different feel than other flosses, so you may or may not like it depending on your mouth and preferences.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Tom&#x27;s floss for years, and he won&#x27;t use any other brand.  He goes through a lot of it, so I was elated to find it at a great price on Amazon.  I finally tried it myself, and it is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Nothing else like it!! AWESOME -- be sure to get the flat!!  not the round!</li>
    <li> This floss gets stuck between my teeth.  I bought it because it was waxed and I thought the floss would glide between my teeth, but it does not.</li>
    <li> Waxed tape is the most effective for plaque removal and it&#x27;s better than any petrochemical alternative and it tastes ok</li>
    <li> Need lots of space between teeth to use this one. We can&#x27;t use it.  Will have to give it away and/or use in guest bathroom in case others can use it.  The 3 stars are for the waxing which seems well made.</li>
    <li> This is some seriously thick stuff.  I kinda&#x27; wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so much; it&#x27;s very dense.  Granted it will buck up your gums and get them healthy lickety split if you floss nightly as recommended!  But it&#x27;s definitely on the thicker side.  So if you aren&#x27;t an avid flosser, I wouldn&#x27;t start here.  If you are, you&#x27;re probably golden, and this will keep you so, the healthy way.</li>
    <li> Its more than floss, its kinda like rope, and gets between my teeth for a deeper cleaning than other products. The thicker strand is actually easier to grip than other products as well. It was initially recommended by my dental hygienist, and I have never looked back. Its been a part of my daily routine for years.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at my local co-op grocery store to try as a more natural alternative to the Glide that I&#x27;ve been using for years. At first I found it difficult to fit in between some of my teeth, but I really liked how much gunk I was getting out it compared to the Glide. When I ran out, I just bought some more glide at wmart and immediately couldn&#x27;t hold it anymore; it was difficult to keep around my fingers (compared to the Tom&#x27;s brand), so much so that my fingers started cramping. Also I realized that it was just &#x27;gliding&#x27; in between my teeth and not really getting too much of the gunk out (compared to the Tom&#x27;s brand). So I quickly ordered the Tom&#x27;s brand in bulk here on Amazon and gave the practically new spool of glide away. It is true what some of the other have said about it shredding sometimes, but I don&#x27;t find it to be that big of a problem. I&#x27;d recommend at least giving a spool a try.</li>
    <li> I like this floss, it&#x27;s kind of thick, but works really well getting between the teeth. It&#x27;s kind of like floss tape, but a little bit thicker.</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with normal floss. Usually its either too slippery and hard to grip and/or it tears when I get in between teeth with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some places I have larger gaps than others, so a very thin floss also feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect for me - doesn&#x27;t slip due to being waxed, very strong and I&#x27;ve yet to tear it while using it and it&#x27;s thick enough that the larger gaps in my teeth get cleaned easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also means that if you have very tiny gaps between your teeth this might be too much floss for you. My brothers tried it and asked me when I started flossing with shoelaces. Bit of an exaggeration, but it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind.</li>
    <li> It is better than most flossing ribbon I have used - not slippery and would not&lt;br /&gt;shred easily going between teeth.</li>
    <li> just feel right when flossing with Toms of Maine floss…. been using for years and always disappointed if I ever try other types of floss...</li>
    <li> No other floss compares to this... Love it!</li>
    <li> It really works out well to order in bulk. I like the fresh minty flavor on the floss. Work great for me!</li>
    <li> My favorite floss!  This is wide, thick floss which is great for really cleaning the teeth.  Not thin and slippery like silicone ribbon.</li>
    <li> Very good grip and the stringy, coarse surface grabs anything and everything in between your teeth. My husband finds it a little too thick to get in between a couple of his teeth, but it works great for me. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me first say this is going to be more difficult to floss than the standard floss string because it is thicker, but worth the effort.  I have very tight teeth and even the dental hygienist struggles.  The standard regular floss seems like you are not doing much other than maybe cutting you gums at the bottom.  This floss it feels like its is cleaning the sides up and down.  Its a workout, but you know you are doing good cleaning for your mouth and teeth.  Spearmint taste is OK, very natural because it is inconsistent, not a sugary man made paste that regular floss has.</li>
    <li> This floss is the queen of all flosses, it&#x27;s the right texture, thickness and handles. well when wet.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  Comparable performance to oral-b glide I was using, doesn&#x27;t shred like the cheaper kinds.  I actually owe oral-b and local stores for jacking up prices so much, that I discovered this floss!  I would never look for floss on Amazon if they weren&#x27;t gouging.  By gouging I mean a pack of 2 for about $6.50 at target and $8something at Walgreens.  Now I am getting something better in every way.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fibers in the floss means that it shreds constantly (even when I try to cut a piece off for use).  I am going back to less eco-friendly brands that don&#x27;t fall apart!</li>
    <li> great floss, but may be difficult for some to use due to thickness; for those who can use it, it&#x27;s a fine product; doesn&#x27;t shred, for one thing!</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this,  It is wider and does a better job and is nearly impossible to break (my other floss always broke because my teeth are so tight)</li>
    <li> I felt that this floss was too thick and did not glide well in between my teeth.  I really like Tom&#x27;s and I use many ADA approved products but this was simply disappointing.  I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> The only floss we&#x27;ll buy. Love it, it works, doesn&#x27;t slice your gums up. I order from Amazon because it is hard to find unless you&#x27;re near a natural food or health food store.</li>
    <li> The floss is thicker than normal floss so it feels uncomfortable. Not sure how to describe it but I thought it was OK at first but as the months went by, I don&#x27;t like using it. It discourages me from flossing so I&#x27;ve switched to something more traditional.</li>
