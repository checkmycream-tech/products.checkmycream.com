      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong with out having strong fumes.</li>
      <li>The bonding glue is too strong.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go for too a harsh glue when applying individuals on myself, so this was perfect.</li>
      <li>Super strong smell and doesn&#x27;t even stick.</li>
      <li>shipping was very very fast like 2 days my customers love it.</li>
      <li>I know for sure this is a good product, because in the past I used it, just not from this seller.</li>
      <li>I always tell my clients to avoid water contact with lashes minimal water contact is good as it tends to loosen</li>

      <li>Ardell LashTite Adhesive Dark as got me hooked :)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well as far as your lashes staying on.</li>
      <li>The adhesive doesn&#x27;t last long, but I applied on a Thursday and my lashes were great through the weekend and a few events.</li>
      <li>Thought it would be strong but it was a waste</li>
      <li>This glue really makes your individual lashes STICK AND STAY!</li>
      <li>This glue was very strong my lashes last at least two weeks now!</li>

<li> This glue really makes your individual lashes STICK AND STAY!</li>
<li> This glue was very strong my lashes last at least two weeks now!</li>
<li> But it usually stays on really well.</li>
<li> last really long almost 3 weeks</li>
<li> I like this product it makes the lashes last long.</li>
<li> Be careful not to use too much of the glue though, a small amount will go a long way.</li>
<li> The other positive is the glue does not have a harsh odor like other glues tried.  </li>
<li> and it is extremely thick and dry, similar to an old dry nail polish.</li>
<li> its long lasting and dries hard like crazy glue which i liked.</li>
<li> i didnt like it.it doesnt work for single lashes like it</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not even that careful when washing my face because if it falls off, then I can replace the one that fell off.</li>
<li> The dark glue blends in with each individual eyelash and its not as messy as other glues.  </li>
<li> It dries way too fast...but other than that...</li>
<li> My lashes last at least 3-4 weeks.  </li>
<li> d lashes a little....</li>
<li> but it kinda makes little hard balls of glue and is not cute!</li>
<li> all the other sorry ass adhesive just came unbonded within a few hours, just wish they had this in strip lash applicator tube to apply it easier.</li>
<li> I accidentally rubbed one of my eyes because it was itching and took off a section of the fake lash with my on lash.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews about this product</li>
<li> This is terrible adhesive.  </li>
<li> Worst eyelash glue to buy.</li>

<ol>

    <li> it works but ive used better glue.</li>
    <li> I like this product it makes the lashes last long.</li>
    <li> This glue was very strong my lashes last at least two weeks now! It&#x27;s strong with out having strong fumes.</li>
    <li> Actually better than I thought. I didn&#x27;t want to go for too a harsh glue when applying individuals on myself, so this was perfect. The adhesive doesn&#x27;t last long, but I applied on a Thursday and my lashes were great through the weekend and a few events.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Lashes would be falling off the next day, and also moving around on your eyelid. Thought it would be strong but it was a waste</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good glue I just wish it had some kind of applicator.</li>
    <li> I use this adhesive with individual lashes and it seems last about 3 weeks. Also, this is a good size.</li>
    <li> This is the first individual eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever used and it will be the only one I&#x27;ll ever use as its amazing it works relly well...it works like a pro......I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews about this product but I really don&#x27;t have any problems with it.....my clients had there lashes for like 3-4 weeks straight before the lashes would need refill...I always tell my clients to avoid water contact with lashes minimal water contact is good as it tends to loosen d lashes a little....but this product is the bomb!!....Ardell LashTite Adhesive Dark as got me hooked :)</li>
    <li> like it.  but wish it would hold longer.</li>
    <li> After trying several individual eyelash glues, I decided to give this glue a try.  The first time I used, the individual eyelashes stayed on for about 2 1/2 weeks (pretty good).  The dark glue blends in with each individual eyelash and its not as messy as other glues.  The other positive is the glue does not have a harsh odor like other glues tried.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this glue for individual eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Received product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I ♡ this stuff. My lashes last at least 3-4 weeks.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Glue was bad.&lt;br /&gt;Time of coupling with eyelashes was long.&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes fell off in some hours.&lt;br /&gt;I want to know why you sold  such not qualitative goods?</li>
    <li> its long lasting and dries hard like crazy glue which i liked. this is the only glue that i had to use a solvent to remove it. all the other sorry ass adhesive just came unbonded within a few hours, just wish they had this in strip lash applicator tube to apply it easier.</li>
    <li> Yes it burns a little...just blink...but IT WORK GREAT...</li>
    <li> i didnt like it.it doesnt work for single lashes like it should be.lashes stayed only couple hours.i dont recomend it!</li>
    <li> The bonding glue is too strong.  I accidentally rubbed one of my eyes because it was itching and took off a section of the fake lash with my on lash.  I personally like using hair bonding glue for weaves to put on my lashes now.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it with the duralash naturals and it stays on through multiple showers and face washes.  I&#x27;m not even that careful when washing my face because if it falls off, then I can replace the one that fell off. But it usually stays on really well.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of Great Reviews about this Product, But I couldn&#x27;t get this glue to hold, My lashes wouldn&#x27;t stick to the adhesive.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this and it is extremely thick and dry, similar to an old dry nail polish. I know for sure this is a good product, because in the past I used it, just not from this seller. Purchase from someone else.</li>
    <li> This is terrible adhesive.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well as far as your lashes staying on.</li>
    <li> my regular lash glue works better than this, it claims to keep them on longer for individuals but it kinda makes little hard balls of glue and is not cute!</li>
    <li> This glue really makes your individual lashes STICK AND STAY! Which is what you need for individual lashes. Be careful not to use too much of the glue though, a small amount will go a long way.</li>
    <li> Worst eyelash glue to buy. Super strong smell and doesn&#x27;t even stick.</li>
    <li> It dries way too fast...but other than that...it&#x27;s good.</li>
