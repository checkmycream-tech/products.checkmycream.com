### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with the cord  </li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>Fit perfectly to charge my razor!</li>
      <li>I ordered , the price was good</li>
      <li>After many years of good service, I thought I was going to have to buy another Norelco electric razor.</li>
      <li>Great, an inch longer than the original</li>
      <li>This is undoubtedly the best power cord for a Norelco shaver of this age that has ever been remanufactured.&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting the joy I experienced upon pressing that hard rubber end into the shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the cord provides power perfectly, but just understand that not every model listed is a match apparently.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and works perfectly, saved my husband&#x27;s favorite shaver from certain death.</li>
      <li>This power cord has been all that for me and more, transforming my morning and my face, returning both to what they once were.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you get the correct one.</li>
      <li>It went in easily and began to charge without any fuss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price was fine, and delivery prompt.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for every model but it fit my unit.</li>
      <li>Now perhaps I will find the original cord, but that would be fine.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what ! needed!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the irreplaceable link that is the difference between a scruffy face and a clean one.  </li>
      <li>This power cord worked out very nicely, it sure beats buying a new razor.</li>
      <li>right?  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Yes, the 74-C Power Cord is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I oreded</li>
      <li>Also I really don&#x27;t like using razors.</li>
      <li>I lost my cord to my razor and rather than throw it away or buy a new one I spent less than $5 including shippiong and got a new cord delivered to my front door, and now I am happily shaving once again.</li>
      <li>We appreciated you carrying a replacement for an item 40 years old.</li>
      <li>Purchased a new cord and the razor works like new.</li>
      <li>only wish I had misplaced the original years before.</li>
      <li>It turns out that the molded cord had just had too many years of twisting and turning and had broken a lead inside.</li>

    <li> Was exactly what I oreded</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the cord  I ordered , the price was good and so was the delivery time, I have been using it for a while and it works great.</li>
    <li> What can one say about a power cord?  It&#x27;s just a power cord, right?  Wrong!  It&#x27;s the irreplaceable link that is the difference between a scruffy face and a clean one.  A nobody and a go-getter.  A failure and a success.  This power cord has been all that for me and more, transforming my morning and my face, returning both to what they once were.  Literally turning back time, and I wouldn&#x27;t start my day any other way.  Also I really don&#x27;t like using razors.</li>
