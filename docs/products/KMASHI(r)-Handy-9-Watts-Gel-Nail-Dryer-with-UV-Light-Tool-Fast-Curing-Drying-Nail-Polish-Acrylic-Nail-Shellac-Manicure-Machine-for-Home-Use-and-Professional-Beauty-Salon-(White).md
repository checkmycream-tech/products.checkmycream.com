      <li>Fast shipping very satisfied with seller &amp; product!</li>
      <li>instead of 1min... Just to be sure.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I have seen many UV/LED lights for nail drying in all kinds of price ranges.</li>
      <li>You are better off purchasing a station with the 36 watt bulb.</li>
      <li>, :) THANK YOU</li>
      <li>First set of gels I did with this lamp lasted 2 full weeks and cured beautifully.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t really say how I liked it</li>
      <li>Light does not work.  </li>
      <li>I checked that lamp was securely fastened, that switch was in on position, and electrical power was correct.  </li>
      <li>This light didn&#x27;t set my gel polish well at all or quickly.</li>
      <li>These really do take care of setting my  nail polish ,love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap but works very efficiently and easy to store.</li>
      <li>Everything was very much to my expectations!  </li>
      <li>I left it on for a while to see if needed to warm up</li>
      <li>, IT WORTH</li>
      <li>and fast as lightning!</li>
      <li>Bring on lots more gel polish and french manicures done by me...</li>
      <li>I broke the first time I move it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only okay.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Spend the money and get yourself a more expensive (better quality) light that actually works</li>
      <li>great little machine for me, for now I just do base coat or top coat so its fine.</li>
      <li>Amazing my nails dry so fast and last a long time!!</li>
      <li>and I am certain it was a VERY short time.</li>
      <li>and I have never had any trouble with this light.</li>
      <li>My nails have never looked better and it only took a few minutes to get salon nails!</li>
      <li>The bulb was laying loose in the box and although not broken when I put it in it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Great price but bulb falls out at times and very difficult to put bulb back in--these may happen when your nails are wet</li>
      <li>, it seemed like just a few seconds later as I stood up and walked out and sat down, that she followed right after!</li>

<li> , it seemed like just a few seconds later as I stood up and walked out and sat down, that she followed right after!</li>
<li> It was hard to put the bulb on at first but overall</li>
<li> the light bulb broke after a few days, not sure why</li>
<li> Before buying this product, it takes a long time to dry nail polish, but now save me a lot of time with this machine, and this way I avoid errors doing my nails,The only CON I have with it is you can only place 4 fingers in at a time or both your thumbs,</li>
<li> Takes about 5 minutes to dry regular polish, If there are multiple layers of polish from am ombre or something it takes about 7 minutes to dry all layers of polish</li>
<li> The single bulb is not enough to cure.</li>
<li> It took a really long time to dry my nails and not enough room to dry the five fingers all at once</li>
<li> ; She showed me her perfectly DRY nails</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t like it, leaves nails sticky doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
<li> I chose this item for myself to get my nails dry faster in my &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; world of no time for me.</li>
<li> but A LOT faster then waiting for nails to dry.</li>
<li> It took about 45 minutes just to dry one coat.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my nails at all, just sets the gel.</li>
<li> I hardly ever give reviews, but I&#x27;m giving 1 star because the light is is very hard to plug in the machine, and also because it did not work properly.</li>
<li> Not strong enough to UV dry nails.</li>
<li> It came as expected.</li>
<li> I gave it 4 stars because of the short cord, it could stand to be a little longer!</li>
<li> The other hand is not done.</li>
<li> Small and simple but does the job.</li>
<li> Takes a little longer to dry then</li>
<li> Was disappointed that it has no fan, just the light.</li>
<li> may be our fingers a little fat.</li>
<li> The bulb turn on for a few seconds and went off 2 times...</li>
<li> Sometimes the cheaper deals are not cheap at all.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> The light is awful.</li>
<li> Was broken or just plain</li>
<li> Does NOT work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
<li> Unfortunately this was broken when it arrived so I didn&#x27;t get to try it.  </li>
<li> Was broken when I got it !</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work sorry</li>
<li> it flickers a lot and makes an annoying beeping noise</li>

    <li> Not howw I though it would be</li>
    <li> I should understood the importance of the watts. It took a really long time to dry my nails and not enough room to dry the five fingers all at once</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different but it works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I set my timer for 3 minutes for each coat of polish and its works! I gave it 4 stars because of the short cord, it could stand to be a little longer!</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Spend the money and get yourself a more expensive (better quality) light that actually works</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MINES JUST THAT , EVEN THO YOU HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT 3 WEEKS., IT WORTH WAITING., I HAVE NOT USED IT , BUT HOPEFULLY SOON I WILL., :) THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Works great!  First set of gels I did with this lamp lasted 2 full weeks and cured beautifully.  I cured them for 2 min. instead of 1min... Just to be sure.</li>
    <li> Was broken or just plain didn&#x27;t work when it arrived. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Everything was very much to my expectations!  Was very pleased with all aspects!!!</li>
    <li> came with busted lightbulb</li>
    <li> I have seen many UV/LED lights for nail drying in all kinds of price ranges. Well, this one was not expensive and has done the job perfectly!! My nails have never looked better and it only took a few minutes to get salon nails! I am thrilled with this purchase!!

    <li> never used it didnt know it works for gel only.</li>
    <li> This works great for gel or regular polish, i am very happy with the product! Takes a little longer to dry then the salon but A LOT faster then waiting for nails to dry.

    <li> DOES NOT ACTUALLY WORK! Not strong enough to UV dry nails. Never again. Went and just bought a salon quality one and that works much better!</li>
    <li> the light bulb broke after a few days, not sure why but it was a great product. need to get a replacement bulb</li>
    <li> The lamp didn&#x27;t work when I took it out of the box. I did return it, and got a refund including the shipping charges. But I can&#x27;t really say how I liked it becuase I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it. I probably will not re-order. But they were prompt.</li>
    <li> I received the led lamp yesterday 5/23/2014.  I broke the first time I move it so I could put my hand in it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it did work. One hand looks good.  The other hand is not done.</li>
    <li> Light does not work.  I checked that lamp was securely fastened, that switch was in on position, and electrical power was correct.  Lamp still does not work.  I need to know how to return the item.</li>
    <li> Small and simple but does the job. Already saved money by doing my own nails and toes. And they last about two weeks. Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I hardly ever give reviews, but I&#x27;m giving 1 star because the light is is very hard to plug in the machine, and also because it did not work properly. The bulb turn on for a few seconds and went off 2 times... The third time did not even turn one. I left it on for a while to see if needed to warm up but nothing happened.</li>
    <li> Sending back..bulb didnt even work..wanted to send a personal message but didnt see the option for it so ya</li>
    <li> For as cheap as this thing is, it is wonderful! It works just like the expense ones.. without the cost! I would tell anyone to buy it if you&#x27;re just starting off with nails!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome light. I definitely recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it with OPI colors and I have never had any trouble with this light.</li>
    <li> Does not work. The single bulb is not enough to cure. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This item is UV only, which takes 2 minutes per coat to cure unlike the LED which takes 30-45 seconds. It was hard to put the bulb on at first but overall it&#x27;s ok. Works well enough just don&#x27;t like the wait time to cure my nails.</li>
    <li> Love! It&#x27;s cheap but works very efficiently and easy to store.</li>
    <li> These really do take care of setting my  nail polish ,love it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping very satisfied with seller &amp; product! thank you lots!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was broken when it arrived so I didn&#x27;t get to try it.  The bulb was laying loose in the box and although not broken when I put it in it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This lamp was waist if money</li>
    <li> This item was a good buy. It came as expected. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The UV lamp work very good.  I am really happy with it.  Delivery time was excellent.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This light didn&#x27;t set my gel polish well at all or quickly. It took about 45 minutes just to dry one coat. The light is awful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work sorry I bought it</li>
    <li> This device doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  The low wattage used doesn&#x27;t comply with what is needed to properly cure gel nail polish.  When attempting to cure the polish for the recommended amount of time, nothing happens.  You are better off purchasing a station with the 36 watt bulb.</li>
    <li> I should have returned this immediately.  I put it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> great little machine for me, for now I just do base coat or top coat so its fine. Please watch for your voltage that you require and UV or Led I got what I wanted. Sometimes the cheaper deals are not cheap at all.</li>
    <li> it flickers a lot and makes an annoying beeping noise</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only okay.  It doesn&#x27;t have great drying power.</li>
    <li> This product can only be used with UV polish or gel products. Otherwise if you use regular polish with a UV topcoat the bottom coat will be sticky and tacky.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
    <li> My wife she is happy with this machine.</li>
    <li> Amazing my nails dry so fast and last a long time!! Great product</li>
    <li> Wish I would have bought one that can hold two hands instead of one.</li>
    <li> This product is labeled as LED/UV. I bought it believing it had LED capability. It does not. It is only UV which takes forever to cure gel polish.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, best price and best buy!</li>
    <li> This did not even turn on for me, I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Was broken when I got it !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, leaves nails sticky doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
    <li> Good deal, works great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she sat at the table after painting her nails and she asked me to plug it in for her, it seemed like just a few seconds later as I stood up and walked out and sat down, that she followed right after! I asked her if she changed her mind and she said, &amp;#34;What are you talking about?&amp;#34; She showed me her perfectly DRY nails and I am certain it was a VERY short time. That thing worked great!! and fast as lightning!</li>
