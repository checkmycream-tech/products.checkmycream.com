<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It covers well but there&#x27;s not a lot in the can.  I glad I only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and very useful when I don&#x27;t have time to color my hair on time ;)</li>
    <li> I love this product I use the dark brown &amp; it works very well even when I sweat, it also works on bald spots.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best root concealer I have ever tried. Covers gray roots perfectly. Make sure you shake well before using to make sure product is distributed onto roots accurately. A go-to product in between dye jobs, I can now get 5-6 weeks out of my hair before I have to color it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Like spray paint for your hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for a fast touchup of coloring if you don&#x27;t have time. The only con I have is that it washes out. I would have like it to stay for a few days, be waterproof.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been a mist spray not as a squirt, so I was not particularly happy with it, Do not think I would ever use it. Thanks all the same</li>
    <li> Spray your roots and go!  Easy as that!  Stays in your hair until your next shampoo!  Does not rub off on clothes or bedding.</li>
    <li> I use this every week. Instead of coloring my hair every 4 weeks, I can go 12 weeks between colorings!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use although tricky to aim and VERY cold on the scalp when it first sprays. More wastage and way more pricy than the the long-lasting &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34; style but combs through more easily. Also good for filling in &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; patches.</li>
    <li> It is awesome! There has never been anything like this, so easy to use, looks so natural!  Will aways use this!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> What would I do without this product!? If there&#x27;s a party or something and no time to get my hair done, this is a lifesaver</li>
    <li> Love this product. It goes on easily and stays on for days. Doesn&#x27;t smear like other spray on products. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the can runs out of aerosol while there is still product in it.  This has happened on every can I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Best in between colorings concealer I have found.  I&#x27;ve tried several b/c I have very dark hair so the gray shows immediately; this is no mess, dries fast &amp; look natural.</li>
    <li> Both for my mother, she love it very handy to not dye the hair as often but keep the gray away when needed !!</li>
    <li> spray is like a blast so it gets all over. Makes hair stiff. Dries too quickly to spray onto a comp to put into hair. a permanent marker or eyebrow pencil would do a better job</li>
    <li> the hair becomes patchy as if i have applied mascara on my hair.  i dont like this product one bit</li>
    <li> The product is verycolor stable, doesn&#x27;t  rub or brush out during the day.  Very easy to apply or sprat onto hair.</li>
    <li> Great product but watch out for your clothing.  This product is great for between colorings.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and it feels so natural and looks great; HOWEVER, I have ruined two items of clothing so far when drops of spray have fallen on my clothing.  Probably best to use this product without your clothes on!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works exactly as advertised, it covers very well gray roots and lasts until next shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My roots usually starts to show after only 2 weeks of coloring. Now I have the perfect solution for&lt;br /&gt;between touch-ups. Thanks Gray Away!!  I am so pleased!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked!  I have been using it for about a year and am still pleased with the results.  I use the product sparingly - 2-3 short sprays - and it has lasted for months.  I can easily stretch out my hair colorings for weeks...It&#x27;s so easy to use and it covers so well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> the product doesn&#x27;t always come out so sometimes I am spraying just clear and have to frequently shake it to get the color to come out</li>
    <li> I did not like the way it made my hair look.  It also makes your hair sticky!  It comes off on every and anything! Used it once and never again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to fill this need.  Only wish it came in larger quantity.  I use it about every 3 and 4th week in between my salon visits and it helps me make it through feeling confident.  I do spray it on when my hair is damp and use my fingers to smooth around a little in case it gets on my scalp.</li>
    <li> The content should be more full. However, it does not stick or stain hands and everything as others i have tried. Arrives fast</li>
    <li> This Gray Away product is very good, but for the price it certainly doesn&#x27;t last as one reviewer mentioned. I also use Topix and Fanciful foam and they definitely lasts much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised how little spray was in this product although it did well, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> ordered this for my mom, she seems to like it, she only uses it occasionally to touch up her roots if they are going somewhere.</li>
    <li> i have always used it but cannot find it in stores anymore. it has always worked for me in between colors.</li>
    <li> It works but it made my hair fall out so had to stop using.</li>
    <li> I have always thought infomercials are a joke. They sell you into buying cheesy things that don&#x27;t work or last. This is the exception! This works, its not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy and it buys me some time between dying my hair. Great product, maybe I am turning over a new leaf :) I will for sure buy this again. I am 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Sprayed scalp,  had to immediately wash hair due to the stinging feel that I received and the horrible fumes that came from product.  Went  to Amazon and clicked on the return of product, never heard from anyone.</li>
    <li> TO EVERY ONE WHO IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM, DON&#x27;T.&lt;br /&gt;IT MESS MY PILLOW CASE UP, TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO. I HONESTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> There was no product in the container so I wasn&#x27;t able to try it.</li>
    <li> it paints more of a light brown shade than black/brown, I bought this for my mother who has black hair and she found the product to be too off her hair color</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE ON MY SCALP, COVERS GRAY VERY GOOD, THIS IS MY 2ND CAN.  PROBABLY WILL COMTINUE TO USE</li>
    <li> This product works like a miracle for me! I use it constantly between colorings and helps me out for the next 2/3 weeeks! Love it!!</li>
    <li> PROS: This product is the best I&#x27;ve used for covering my gray. And I&#x27;ve been using other types of products for years.&lt;br /&gt;Gray Away provides the best coverage, compared to the crayon-like product I&#x27;ve used, the mascara type product, and marker type product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fast and easy, though you have to practice to keep it off your skin when spraying close to hairline. CONS: Did you ever wonder why manufacturers say one thing about a product, yet deliver something else? I just don&#x27;t get it! The light brown is closer to dark brown/black. The can has a beautiful light brown color, but the product itself is obviously not that color. (What&#x27;s with that?) Also, this product will come off on anything that rubs against it, like your hands, pillow case, etc. But I came up with a trick: spraying hair spray over it really, really helps! I&#x27;m curious to see what the Auburn color is--I hope it&#x27;s not hot pink, but you never know! I&#x27;m also going to try to find another brand that provides a spray. The spray is the best method I think in terms of providing the best coverage and quickly.  LATEST UPDATE: I FOUND ANOTHER PRODUCT I&#x27;M USING INSTEAD. IT&#x27;S CALLED Good Looking Hair Color Spray. THE CAN LASTS A LONG TIME--IT HAS MORE PRODUCT IN IT--IT&#x27;S MORE AFFORDABLE PER OUNCE, AND THE DARK BROWN IS REALLY DARK BROWN. HOWEVER, SPRAYING WITH HAIR SPRAY DOESN&#x27;T KEEP PRODUCT FROM COMING OFF ON HANDS, PILLOW CASES, ETC. THIS REMEDY HELPS A LITTLE, BUT THERE&#x27;S STILL RESIDUE THAT COMES OFF.</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;m soooooo glad I found this.  It has changed my life- not exaggerating. I&#x27;m going 5/6 weeks before I do roots now. I&#x27;m 36 n 80 percent grey- very premature grey- dying roots since 25. N I&#x27;m dark haired so it looks awful when they pop out n makes me look older than I am. The light brown is pretty dark. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on blonde. And use dark brown only if u basically have black hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to apply and last several washes.</li>
    <li> Work fairly well- don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Best gray root cover up. So easy in a spray. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product does what it says. The only downside is that residue is left on my pillow cases. would for product to have a more permanate stay on the hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I thought I was buying but when i got it I trashed it. After I sprayed a tiny spot on my scalp I had to take a shower. No way am I spaying chemicals like this harsh smelling burning spay on my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will have to return this Gray Away product due to the sad fact that the developer made a catastrophic error in its dispensing method!&lt;br /&gt;Instead of it using a mister or sprayer to evenly distribute the wonderful color, they put a foam-type dispenser, which gives too heavily&lt;br /&gt;concentrated a jet streamlike dose of spray, which deposits clumps of dense dye which ended up on my scalp! I had to rewash my hair to be&lt;br /&gt;able to go outside! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Please fix this huge problem and I will hurry to order it once again.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised it works to cover the gray just point and spray.  I would deffently keep it as a stock item.</li>
    <li> it is spray, so it is not easy to use.  You can try if you want, but for me I am good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when my hair dresser told me to buy this in between colorings, I bought dark brown, even though my hair is medium brown it does a great job, the problem is that it spits the color out sometimes and puts dots on my forehead but it is easy to wipe off</li>
    <li> A surprisingly effective product--and it really lasts until it&#x27;s washed out.  Easy to use, convenient for travel and it DOES cover the gray as promised.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works for me. Aiming may be a little challenging but other than that, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not only does it cover the gray, it gives my hair volume. My hair is thin and flat. But when spraying this product, my hair plumps up. It does take a little practice, at first, to control the amount of spray onto the roots of my hair. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the LIGHT brown and it covers my auburn hair (Nice and Easy 4R) perfectly.  Yep, you do need to be careful at the hairline--use a comb or something to give you a more natural edge--but this stuff is fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I liked it because when I used it; it did not make a mess.  It comes on like hair spray.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I use it when my roots are starting to show.  I can get away with not dyeing my hair for a couple extra weeks.  It covers my roots and blends in with my color.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that said there wasn&#x27;t enough in the can. I&#x27;m still on my first can several months after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gray Away isn&#x27;t meant to be used every day for months at a time. I use it only for those times when I can&#x27;t make my monthly salon visit and need a touch-up when I go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well, blends with my regular color enough so it doesn&#x27;t look abnormal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To spray it on, you need to use it like you&#x27;re spray painting a small piece of furniture. Press the button in short, quick bursts instead of one long one. You&#x27;ll get a better look, and it lasts longer that way. I hold strands of my hair straight up, focus only on the hair that will be seen, not my whole head.</li>
    <li> I wanted light brown or medium brown, but it wasn&#x27;t offered.  Dark brown is too dark for me.  Please offer me the lighter shades of brown next time.  Other than that, I liked the product a lot.  Wish I could find it in the stores.  No one seems to carry it anymore like they used to.</li>
    <li> When you gray early, it can be very hard to keep up with that in between color treatments.  This product works wonders for that!  The only advice I have is to be careful when spraying the front so that it doesn&#x27;t get on your forehead.  However, if it does, just wipe it.  It comes right off.  The ONLY bad thing is that when you run out, the can feels like there is still some product remaining when you shake it but it&#x27;s actually empty.</li>
    <li> I just tried this spray product today.  I liked it as soon as I used it.  It sprayed on really easily and concealed very well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an average person and I tend to doubt products like this, but I have to give this one a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little sticky when it first went on, but the instructions said to give it 2-3 minutes to dry before touching it.&lt;br /&gt;After it dried it was no longer sticky.  I think it&#x27;s going to work for me.  Also, at first I thought $9.99 a bottle was a lot,&lt;br /&gt;but you get a lot of applications in the bottle, so to me it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This is an easy way of covering your gray, without all the dye and perm coordination. This is especially useful if your gray hair is in certain spots (around the edges).  It&#x27;s really a spray and go type of deal.&lt;br /&gt;If I &amp;#34;rub  down really hard on my scalp, the color will come off on my fingers, but because this is a cosmetic fix, I have no real reason to do that.  I do sweat a lot and have had no problems with the color &amp;#34;running&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I choose this product hands down over other dyes and chemicals.</li>
    <li> I use this product not only to cover my gray roots (which it does flawlessly) but it makes my hair look fuller as it works like a camouflage for my thinning hair and also adds fullness. I even use it when my roots don&#x27;t show. Absolutely love it and couldn&#x27;t live without it. There are other products on the market like powders,etc. This is not only cleaner but less expensive and more efficient. I LOVE IT AND  WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Gray Away root concealer is a great alternative to use in between coloring.  I used this product and it is definitely as described. I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick alternative to conceal the gray roots and edges.</li>
    <li> This is the best temporary hair/root color I have tried. It works great and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Helps hide those pesky roots when you can&#x27;t make it to the salon on time!</li>
    <li> This Stuff is really  great, and  it  really works. I just wish they sold it in a larger size since I use it so often</li>
    <li> I tried several more expensive products to cover gray roots inbetween colorings, and this is the one that worked the best!  My dyed (and once natural) color is medium golden brown; the lighter color is actually darker than I expected, so worked well.  Spray-on is also direct; no wide, wild spraying.</li>
    <li> Will make your hair fall out.</li>
    <li> It works because it is quick. Want fast results, but don&#x27;t have time for an appointment with you hair stylist? Buy this and get the job done, quickly and easily. It won&#x27;t be perfect; because non-professionals are not as adept as pros. Buy it for those quick fixes!</li>
    <li> It was perfect &amp; ideal in case of having few hair ... Thanks for your site &amp; for ur honisty</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good package to buy.&lt;br /&gt;\&lt;br /&gt;it is reliable and does cover all the gray hair where it is noticeable...</li>
    <li> The easiest root concealer I have ever used and covers completely.  I spray it wherever the roots are showing after I have styled my hair and it looks like I have suddenly grown more hair. The spray on feature is so much easier to use than power or mascara type concealers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care too much for this product, when I worked out it dripped on to my face and that I didn&#x27;t  care for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very convenient!  Can go more time between coloring without all the hassle!  Please sell in more stores.  Hard to find sometimes!</li>
    <li> It works!  It covered the gray and lasted until the next shampoo. It has a forceful spray.  I tried to cover a small area at the temple, but the spray was too strong; it covered the gray and it also covered some skin.  So I tried a little less pressure and that worked, but it also dripped. I was over the bathroom sink so that wasn&#x27;t a problem; it cleaned up well.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for men.  I buy it for my hubby.  He doesn&#x27;t want to color his whole hair because it often looks so noticeable on men, but wants to cover his grays.  This looks natural and doesn&#x27;t rub off until he washes his hair again.  Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> It is great for the &amp;#34;on-the-run&amp;#34; moments when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full dye job. Very handy!</li>
    <li> I love Gray Away.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like some of the mascara type products do, it just covers the gray between dyeings.</li>
    <li> It does what it says just wish it would hold up longer &amp; for the price the size bigger&lt;br /&gt;other wise it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
    <li> I used a similar product from a company I no longer do business with.  One application of that product lasted a full week.  While Gray Away is similar in price and quantity, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply every other day.  Oh well....I plan on re-ordering the Gray Away unless I find something better.</li>
    <li> Especially good to color roots between trips to the hairdresser.  Good service too.</li>
    <li> this product is totally not for me, it did not cover my gray and looked very dull. I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> worked sooo good on roots would but it again!</li>
    <li> This product provides a very good coverage of gray hair is excellent in case of trouble the only thing wrong is its size by the photos that we thought was bigger</li>
    <li> I like this product because it keeps me from having to color my hair every 4 weeks. My hair grows fairly quickly and by the end of the 4th week of my dye job, I have a visible &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34; line at the part. This product is a good &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; until my next root dye job. It stays in until I wash it out. It took me a few tries to get the hang of spraying, but once I mastered that it was super easy. Worth the price, but I wish it were on Amazon Prime. Hate to pay the shipping cost!</li>
    <li> Talk about a money saver! This is exactly what I was looking for and I am so glad that I found it! I can extend root touch-ups to once a month or longer given that this product covers so well and blends with my hair color so well! A bottle lasts me quite a while as I only apply it once a week. I wash my hair, and then style it with tight flat iron curls that I finger comb until they are a loose beach wave by the end of the week. No need to reapply as I don&#x27;t wash it until Friday and then do it all over on Monday.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish it was a little more dark brown.  And not so black.</li>
    <li> Work well covering the gray.</li>
    <li> Great product for hiding gray or thinning hair. The downsides are (1) the spray is difficult to operate just a tiny bit or short  blast. Instead, when it starts,  you get quite a spray, and (2) the can gets empty rather fast, Just a few sprays and the can is done.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for several years. It&#x27;s great for covering gray roots in between color. It is simple to use, doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and it stays in until you wash it out. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is great.  Wish the can were bigger for more applications</li>
    <li> I bought this product in order to use it in between coloring. I get lots of grey roots and I usually color my hair every 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a nice product and does a good job concealing the roots. The only thing is that I had to protect my face because it&#x27;s a bit messy. It&#x27;s a spray so you have to be careful where you spray.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  When you pull your hair back (or have a part showing when you wear it down), just spray it on and away you go!  Using it along the hairline is quite another story.  It&#x27;s tricky to avoid getting it on your facial skin due to having to spray it on.  For that, I recommend a mascara-style touch-up tool.  Otherwise well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The texture is not natural, so will not buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product!  It is cheaper than Rita Haazan ( ?)  It does its job and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel greasy or caked on!  It also doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillow cases.  I just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> I use it to hide bad haircuts where they have feathered my hair too thin.  Or, those little &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; spots that show too much scalp when you&#x27;ve slept in such a way that your hair parts when you comb it.  Also, since I have been using it, I don&#x27;t color my hair as often so my hair is healthier.  Now I color my hair once every 3 months, of course all depenedant on how much gray you have and how fast it grows in.  It&#x27;s a good product and I&#x27;ve been ordering 2 at a time.  One to use and one for a spare. Also, my sister has been taking lots of medications which caused her to lose much of her hair.  I suggested she try it because her thinning hair bothers her a lot.</li>
    <li> This product actually does what it says. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the smell. Still,it is perfect for extending time between color, saving money and time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried only once and found that the product was too concentrated and dark for my hair.  However, next time I will have more distance between the spray and my scalp and hopefully achieve a more favorable result.  The product dries quickly so make sure you did not use this over light-colored areas (such as white Carrara marble) since removing it takes some work.</li>
    <li> Works great and adds volume too.</li>
    <li> Works great to cover gray. It took a few tries to learn how not to spray too much, as it can spray quickly and heavily, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great. One thing to note though, it doesn&#x27;t always wash out in one shampoo. Sometimes I need to shampoo twice with particular care to the covered areas to get all the concealer out. This is not a big deal overall, but if you are washing before coloring at home or the salon you&#x27;ll need to get all the spray concealer out or the color may not cover as usual.</li>
    <li> good product but can get it cheeper on ebay</li>
    <li> This is perfect for between coloring touchups - it&#x27;s fast &amp; effective - I always like to have one handy.</li>
    <li> I found this product messy and it left my scalp smeared and looking too not real .it did not last as long as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Great product but dull where it is applied.  Needs 2 shampoos to remove but works super. I&#x27;ll continue to use this until something better comes along.  Good seller</li>
    <li> I got it for my dad and don&#x27;t really know if he has tried it yet..</li>
    <li> Works well and is a great time saver!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff and applied it to my roots at the part line of my hair.  That same day I experienced a horrible migraine.  That same night I had a second horrible migraine and ended up in the emergency room.  I have never had a migraine in my life. The pain was unbearable.  I underwent numerous tests and to a neurologist.  I continued to have 2 to 3 daily migraines for 7 consecutive days, several different pain meds and I am now on a steroid dose pack to minimize the migraine. I don&#x27;t know if this product was the cause of the migraines but it seems suspicious to me that my migraines started the day I applied it. I also read online where others had experienced headache and pain after using this product.</li>
    <li> Ran out to buy something that for immediate need to cover gray at temples and down parted hair.  (Read my review on L&#x27;oreal mousse absolue to see the reason for root emergency).  It couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use this product.  Sprayed on and was a bit dark but used a small brush that I saved from a root touch up kit (a bit larger than toothbrush) to blend in.  Used a clear plastic sheet protector (office supply) to cover my forehead when spraying at temples.  Also used a hair band to hold hair back and expose temple area. This product worked very well and blended in great.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver when you need to go out in public and have no time to dye your hair.  I imagine that it might get on your pillow case and it isn&#x27;t a permanent solution but it does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> This only lasted for about 5 uses and I only use it on about an inch and half area on both sides.  Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
    <li> covers the gray, but stick and comes off easy</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product!  The light spray covers only the areas you want color.  So you can color roots or bald spots, whatever.  Stays put til you wash it out.  I like it!  Great product for my thin hair.  After shampooing and blow drying my hair, I spray this in my part, and other thin areas, so I don&#x27;t look bald in places.  With this I look like I have a thick healthy head of hair.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillowcases either !!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Spray is good- doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place. I use it mostly on the top of my head and brush it through to cover the part area. I advise buying a shade darker than your hair.  When you brush it through it blends well</li>
    <li> Does what It&#x60;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE, only you need seconds, see you black hair again now, for rest me life i use gray away root. super fast ship. two.</li>
    <li> I ordered 10 cans of this item in the Dark Brown/Black and it came fast.  It covers gray very well and is easy to use.  Just be careful not to breathe in this spray when you use it as it can be very dangerous.  Use in well ventilated area.  It conceals gray roots very well and makes your hair look natural without powder or making a mess.</li>
    <li> Recently discovered it at a drug store and decided to give it a try after spending $24 a bottle for a similar spray from Rita Hazan.  It has exact same effect but smells better and costs $10 or sometimes even less. Very happy to have discovered it.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this spray.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00846N65S Root Touch Up Spray - Dark Brown]]The worst product that I have ever purchase,it is over pressure and does not deliver what they claim, I am very disappointed.It is a waist of money. I will never deal with this Co. again.</li>
    <li> I think it covers pretty well but it is much messier than the powder cover ups I have used. I think I will go back to what I was using before.</li>
    <li> Color rubs off.  Care needs to be taken when spraying.  Shield face, clothing and surrounding area when spraying.  Color is long lasting, but can runs out quickly</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m 22, so grays aren&#x27;t something I have to worry about too much (yet). My hair is naturally a light brown and I dye it black. I have a job interview tomorrow and my roots are getting out of control, so I decided to take a chance and try out this product. I&#x27;m very impressed with it! Takes a few sprays to cover completely, but that&#x27;s my only \\&quot;complaint.\\&quot; Definitely a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I found this at my local Rite Aid actually, and figured I could use it between colorings for the few gray roots that peek through between colorings.  (It works! *well, for me it did at least.  I have very dark brown hair and used the brown/black).  My problem was, after sraying it on my roots, my hair felt like it needed to be washed.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, my hair just didn&#x27;t feel soft/clean like it usually does.  I will use it in case of emergency, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> 10/24/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and 75-80% grey in my roots. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was a teenager and though my brands have changed, the color has always stayed the same. Typically I use Revlon Buttercreme or Colorsilk (love them both, Buttercreme is the best) in Dark Brown or Brown/Black (30N or 20N -  depending on what&#x27;s avalaible). Unflortuantly, my hair is fried and it seems like I have to re-color every two to three weeks. The hassel is getting to me so I decided I might try to let go of the coloring. But, that leaves it&#x27;s own problems. Now I have a 1/2 inch of silver/white roots and then a stark line of dark hair. I already cut it above my shoulders, but the past has shown me anything shorter doesn&#x27;t suit my face. And, because my roots are peppered a bleaching and blonde dye job gives me a very similiar effect in the reverse...my roots appear to grow in much darker in two weeks and bleaching is far more destructive than dying! I went the salon route but it wasn&#x27;t much more helpful and trips like that aren&#x27;t in my regular budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started to look for alternatives and the infomercial for this grabbed me. I bought mine in Rite-Aid and taking the advice of other posters who noted the color was darker than expected I bought the light/med brown. While I will say this made me feel much better about the upcoming Halloween party, it is not a regular everyday solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The grey is gone and even the next day I still couldn&#x27;t see it after my shower. I did NOT wash my hair that day but I did rinse and comb it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;*I was feeling unloved by the kitten and the hair color brought us together...she was fascinated with the smell and couldn&#x27;t seem to get enough of me....she kept climbing on me, sniffing my hair and nudging my face, and then trying to grab my hair with her claws....that has never happened before -.-&lt;br /&gt;*It wiped right of my skin and the smell was minimal&lt;br /&gt;*The spray nozle helps keepthe color concentraed rather than all over. I&#x27;ve used others in the past from the beauty supply store that seem to get as much color in the air, cupboards, and my shoulders as they did in my hair, so this was a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;*There was no transfer to my pillow or the furniture, even after I slept with it in my hair all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*The light/med brown was a shade or two too light for my hair. So, the grey was gone which was good, but if you were looking directly at me you would see a color difference, like when semi-permanant color fades out of your roots.&lt;br /&gt;*Went back and bough the dark brown/black and that was too dark...damned if you do and damned if you don&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;*The dark brown/black had a much wetter consistensy and did not come out as evenly as the light/med brown...why, I can not tell you but other reviewers mention it too.&lt;br /&gt;*There will be transfer if you touch your hair...I sprayed a light coating of the light/med and let it dry for a half hour. When I lightly felt the area, nothing. When I scratched my scalp, there was color on my fingers...the same thing happened hours after my shower, scratched my head and ended up with colored fingers. It washes right off, but I&#x27;ll have to remeber not to put my sunglasses up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest Con:&lt;br /&gt;*I was hoping to return one of them, but it turns out that the two colors work best together. The dark brown/black blends the top of my head the best, but the light brown/med brown works best when I spray the underneath layers. This makes the cost really expensive...I also bought a mascara wand for my temples (where the spray would be too close to my skin) so the cost for all three was $28...I could color my hair almost 6 times (3 months of color) for that. I doubt the cans will last three months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would have felt like it was a good deal for special occasions if one can would have been good. However, at this point it really is cost prohibitive if you have a large amount of grey, or a large area of grey roots, or a color that is inbetween the cans. Perhaps if you are one of those people that just has a grey streak or patch, then this would be for you. Or, in the case of a special occasion or emergency...THIS IS NOT AN ANSWER to hiding roots while growing out your hair however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to use the level 2 washable color until my hair is less brown and more grey. I was trying to avoid it because of the damage, but since henna doesn&#x27;t work for me and the spray color is too expensive I have no choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/26/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I broke down, returned the Grey Away and bought a level 2 (washes out in 28 shampoos) hair color a shade a two lighter than what I usually use. In order to color my hair I needed to get the Grey Away out, so I washed my hair, twice, using anti-dandruff shampoo and a heavy conditioner. I couldn&#x27;t believe that the color was still there when my hair dried. I know some washed out because when I rinsed my hair the shampoo was a dark brown, but you couldn&#x27;t see any difference when I got out of the shower...no grey, just color, except for in a few places where I sprayed just a small amount of the light brown.  I ended up coloring over it and my hair turned out darker than the box color indicated...go figure.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> to expensive more then at stores.. And it only has a enough for 5 uses..</li>
    <li> Personally i Didint like the product Because it wasent as described on commercial. Didint do what it was suppose to do and didint last as it was suppose to last .</li>
    <li> If you order the brown your hair had best be near-black - it is very, very dark. I am dark blonde streaks with brown (and grey of course) roots. I will end up giving this to one of my Latina friends with much darker hair.</li>
    <li> It does the job well&lt;br /&gt;There is not much else&lt;br /&gt;to say because I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;using this stuff! That&lt;br /&gt;is all.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a regular type spray nozzle.  It gets all over your skin.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray so don&#x27;t want to mess with permanent dyes. A Fine mist spray in and wash out when you shampoo.  A little goes along way. The more you spray the darker it gets and doesn&#x27;t get all over the place when you spray. I have tried other brands and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Then why not 5 stars instead of 4?  I have this cowlick that is right in the front of my hairline and it is the first thing that turns back to gray when my hair coloring begins to fade.  This gray away is tough to use on the front hair line without trying to get it all over where you don&#x27;t want it to be.  It does cover the gray everywhere else like it should and stays until you wash it out (because it is dry shampoo that is colored).  Other than that, great stuff.</li>
    <li> Makes hair a little greasy but does cover the grey nicely</li>
    <li> No spray is a good choice, all too toxic and cause breakage of hair. Go to salin and buy recommended &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;. BC</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for covering thin spots, you spray it and it  blends right in with your hair, you&#x27;ll love it, spraying is sooo much better than the shakers, that go all over the place</li>
    <li> My scalp is itchy after spraying this on.</li>
    <li> Good product to use in between coloring. The only think I dont like it gets under your nails and your nails appears dirty</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I would recommend it to any one who wants to cover or enhance their hair color.</li>
    <li> I am taking chemo and fortunate that I have not lost my hair, but I can&#x27;t use the permanent hair color I used before treatments, so I decided to try Gray Away after disappointing results with liquid and crayon-type temp color. I think is works very well and have not had the experience of the color coming off on my furniture and clothing. I think this may be caused by applying the product too heavily and/or not allowing it to dry well. I find it works best if I style my hair first, apply my regular hair spray, and then a light spray of the Gray Away on the roots. Some of the color even remains after one shampoo. Second to permanent hair color, its the best I&#x27;ve tried! Note that it is a \\&quot;root concealer\\&quot; and not suitable for covering an entire head of gray.</li>
    <li> very bad, they should not accept the order, if they have no the product in stock.&lt;br /&gt;they say they have, but I get an email saying we can not send yet,&lt;br /&gt;why then?</li>
    <li> I use it between colorings to cover my roots. It goes fast.  I suggest you order at least 2.  Use a light touch and spray from about 4-6 inches away.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of hiding the gray roots between dying. Just spray where ever needed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t put it on my head after I read what was in it.  I should have looked at this before I bought.</li>
    <li> I have several large bald spots from a chronic skin disease and this product works great to conceal them.  It says not to use on scalp but I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and I am THRILLED with this product.  Finally I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed when the wind blows my comb-overs backwards.</li>
    <li> I was surprised I liked it and it did cover grey roots well. However, it does leave your nails dark if you scratch or mess with your hair - so be prepared to wash fingernails a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional. Who can afford the time or money to cover your roots every 2 weeks?  Easy to use and far superior to the mascara-style wands, crayon or powder products. This is the one!</li>
    <li> Great cover up however it can get messy!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of covering gray roots without  a waxy feel.  My hair is a bit darker than a medium brown but not nearly as dark as a black. The dark brown of this product works well for my haircolor. I have also tried the light brown, and that also seems to blend. As other reviewers have noted, you will get better results if you press very lightly on the dispenser button, rather then pressing hard and all the way down. The latter manner releases too much product.l</li>
    <li> The nozzle spray could be more softer.  The product sprays too much at once and is too concentrated -- thereby leaving too much in  some spots.</li>
    <li> Blends great wish it came in a larger can</li>
    <li> This concealer is perfect for the in between times where you just can&#x27;t color your hair and you need to cover the white stripe down the middle of your head!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Funny as this stuff is. It really works at hiding the gray.</li>
    <li> I really like this product between color updates.  Works good and only needs a quick spray down part line.</li>
    <li> This item made my hair feel rubbery and that was the way it continued to feel even after washing it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> If I use Gray Away today my hair will be back at it&#x27;s gray roots tomorrow.  It does not last for a long time.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It covers my gray roots in between colorings. I&#x27;ve tried the color touch-ups that are like crayons and they just make your hair feel heavy and greasy.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff, not to color in grays, but to fill in voids in my hair. I am in my 40&#x27;s, I have a great head of hair (10% is missing), in the form of two random bald spots, one about the size of half dollar in the front right, and the other around the crown. So I just style my hair the way I want, making pretend those bald spots don&#x27;t exist. Then when I am done styling, I giving it a quick burst or two, too those two spots, and you could never tell I have those two bald spots. I make my friends spray it on me... They are amazed. Only cons: first, do not touch the areas sprayed cause your hand will have color on it; and second, I wish it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Love this better then the powder they sell love it</li>
    <li> Great for a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the spray nozzle...I don&#x27;t like it as it seems to release a heavy spray as opposed to a light mistype spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dark brown, it does exactly what I want it to, which is to cover grey and roots in between dye jobs. This allows me to save money as I do not have to go to the hair dressers as often which also means less chemicals on my hair by saving one to two dye jobs each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use everyday. I only use this when I am going someplace a little upscale from the grocery store or flea market. Those who complain about it burning may be allergic to something in the spray...I have never had this problem. I have never had it come off on clothes or bed linens. I have had overspray on my skin around the hairline (one of the reasons I do not like the nozzle) but it comes right off with just a damp tissue. Yes it will be sticky or stiff if you use to much-no diffrent than what hairsprays act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the product. I do not buy on line much cheaper to buy local, I get mine at Walgreens. One can will last me about 2 months.</li>
    <li> This product works so well. If you are having problems you are probably trying to put on too much at once. It works best if you layer it on and move the can back and forth as you spray. I usually get my roots done every 3 weeks and this allows me to go another 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased an item similar to this one at nearly 3 times the price. I liked the product but was disappointed that I only used it 3 times and the spray can was empty. I work with people half my age and it is really depressing to look in the mirror and see those white roots and my pink scalp. Saw Gray Away at the drugstore and decided to buy it because it was a reasonable price. To my amazement, it covers much better than the more expensive product and lasts 40 applications or more. The only caution I would give is do not use it before getting your hair colored professionally. My stylist is gradually bleaching my white hair blonde after I have been using dark brown permanent color for years. She stated that the 30 volume bleach did not clear the Gray Away effectively and asked me to shampoo after using before I came in next time. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent cover up for gray hair!</li>
    <li> This product applies easy enough but one can doesn&#x27;t go very far, so the price is quite costly to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it but be aware that it ends up lasting through about 5 small to medium applications for the roots.&lt;br /&gt;To use for the whole head, I&#x27;ll guess it lasts for a couple of applications.</li>
    <li> I was very lucky that I used this product when I had no place to go and no people to see! I sprayed it on, thought it looked OK but not great since it was pretty flat color, and covered the gray pretty well (until i realized i had used almost the whole can to get that effect). I went to watch TV and at some point, leaned my head on my arm. I ended up with color on my arm, on my couch... and while it came off of my hair SO easily, it didn&#x27;t come off my arm or my furniture as easily. I scrubbed until my arm was red, and it still had dye on it! It wore of over a few days. Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t encourage buying this product unless you are about to have a photo taken or some other emergency. Keep your hands off of it and don&#x27;t lean on anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so wanted this to work, i started going gray when i was 19. And people always think i am younger than i really am and then they see the silver, and instantly think \\&quot;Oh she is old\\&quot;. Judge me if you must for being vain, but we&#x27;re all here talking about covering gray, &amp; i know i appreciate an honest review. This was not the \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It just does not last long. I should have checked for the quantity of content before ordering it.</li>
    <li> Afer trying tons of root concealers like the mascara wand and crayon types, Gray Away is the finest product that actually does what it advertises....Easy to use, it covers All of my gray roots and lasts until I shampoo it out ......A life saver for in-between touch-ups, one of the best products out there......</li>
    <li> The color comes out unevenly, so you have to wet your fingers and move it around.  And then clean up the mess.  And it makes your hair stiff.  Then it gets all over your sheets.  Not the dream solution.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It is very gluey and it also gets all over the skin.  It is very obvious that you have tried to spray your gray .  I wear wigs and I only wanted GRAY AWAY for my hair line  near my ears. When the wind blows,  my wig is blown away from my ears and my gray side burns are exposed - I hate that. So this product is a quick fix for that. But it is still messy and I have to be careful that it does not blow into my eyes.  I think it is airborne.  I would never use this product as a way to cover a whole head of gray (or the roots).  It is extremely messy and it made my particular hair very stiff.  (I&#x27;m a black woman with coarse hair)  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would be please with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful.&lt;br /&gt;dlp</li>
    <li> Looks good on hair, but has iky feel to it and rubs off on your fingers.</li>
    <li> I feel in love with this product for I have extreme long hair &amp; my roots grow extremely fast &amp; I found this so I tried &amp; feel in love with it. After using it for a year and a half I started loosing &amp; shedding tons of Hair - I use great products on my hair such as Pureology everything besides this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I was mad at my hair stylist she said she did see any thinning etc. Will the hair between shampoo was handful. I decided to read ingredients &amp; found this product is made out of Butane Lighter Fluid &amp; its also says (on back of bottle) watch the heated temperature to this product - I flat iron my hair with Argan Oil &amp; Coconut Oils.&lt;br /&gt;Being said I Stopped using this product January 2013 &amp; no more gobs hair come out after shampooing - NONE - at all. I continued to not use it.&lt;br /&gt;Will I had an accident &amp; could not get out of this house &amp; mothers day approached quickly - So I tried this Gray Away - Only ONE TIME &amp; I again Experienced Hair Loss with my Shampoos - enough hair where I could roll up. To bad because it does work &amp; it will keep you from running over to do your roots all the time so now I am looking for another SAFE INGREDIENT Product.</li>
    <li> A bit too dark for me, my fault I picked the wrong color.</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer and very fast.  Just spray it on wherever needed and you can go!  Great color!</li>
    <li> Great for inbetween coloring-fast and easy-conceals roots and places missed by all over coloring&lt;br /&gt;Good for all ages-will purchase again</li>
    <li> the product does what it is intended to do, I highly recommend it. I won&#x27;t be able to do without it now.</li>
    <li> This is just the product I need between coloring appointments.  It goes on easily and stays on until I shampoo. The only thing that would be better is color that sprays on easily and stays on through multiple shampoos - to make it to the next appointment.</li>
    <li> GRAY AWAY IS REALLY GREAT AND IT HELPS ME OUT A LOT</li>
    <li> My scalp broke out in an itchy redness as well as my forehead. Look at the ingredients, people, absorbing into your scalp! Do you know what they even are? &amp;#34;Butane, Hydrofluorocarbon 152a, Ethyl Trisiloxane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Methyl Trimethicone, Triethoxycaprylylsilane Fragrance, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI77499).&amp;#34; Scary. At what price beauty?</li>
    <li> The best ever for touching up roots when you&#x27;re in a hurry or anytime.  Love it and always have to have extras just in case, never know when you won&#x27;t be able to have the full color treatment.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.  It didn&#x27;t do a good job covering my gray. A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Pro: It works amazingly well and takes less than 5 seconds to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Con: The can it comes in is tiny. Can they spare it?</li>
    <li> I use this product to conceal the gray, which once in a while it is not too expensive,  but I mostly use it to hide spots of thinning hair.  It works great.  Only problem is that it can become an expensive everyday item to use.  On its original site, they are giving a deal of buy one for $19.99 and get one free, however, you need to pay for shipping on both which $6.99/each it comes out more expensive than buying the 2 here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have spots of thinning hair, so far, this was the best product I found to hide them.</li>
    <li> This spray is the worst gray cover up I have tried thus far. It has a very sloppy application, sprays all over your face.  You have to cover/block your face before spraying. It rubs off on your hands, clothes, furniture, etc. after several hours of putting it on. Even the next day it was still making my fingers black when I touched my hair. Also if you sweat it will drip down onto your forehead and face.  Just a horrible product and I had to pay a shipping fee to return it!</li>
    <li> Typical seen on TV quality.  Okay but would not reorder.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says.  It&#x27;s a little thick to the feel on the scalp, but for a quick fix, it does the job.  The biggest drawback is that the amount of spray is equivalent to a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; size, with a steep price.  Hopefully, competition will bring the costs down eventually.</li>
    <li> Other products made my scalp itch. This one is perfect. The product is not messy. The color is right on.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product did not work well for me.  Didn&#x27;t blend very well and look more like powder.  I&#x27;m glad others have had a great experience but for me my experience was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> i love this product when i am in between coloring my hair...especially to save money...covers my grays instantly and last until you wash your hair...</li>
    <li> Works good, spray it on wet hair and then you don&#x27;t get the stiff icky feeling of spraying it on dry hair</li>
    <li> Love works great, I have a semi full of it..</li>
    <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt; in walmart much cheaper than here</li>
    <li> Have tried just about everything on the market and by far this works the best.  It matches and blends to perfection.  Being a perfectionist I&#x27;m very critical.  My hair grows extremely fast.  Have to get it touched every 2chance to 3 the weeks.  Now I can stretch that to once every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine but not enough in the can for the money. And, be careful not to get it on your scalp. Won&#x27;t look realistic.</li>
    <li> have to touch up every day and spray a lot in order to see results. It also runs leaving your bed stained</li>
    <li> i love this product, now I can wait much longer in between colors. so easy to use, no mess.  Really a great little product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to get grey patches, a streak above the right side of my forehead and one on my hair parting.  I usually color my whole head, but it is just too inconvenient to do it again when the roots start to show after a couple of weeks.  Grey Away is perfect.  It covers the grey roots in no time flat and isn&#x27;t stiff at all on me when it dries, and I don&#x27;t use much.  I use it right after I style my hair and before I use hair spray.  I was afraid that it would blacken my scalp but it didn&#x27;t do anything like that.  It smells so good, I don&#x27;t understand what people are saying that it smelled like paint thinner or something to that effect.  I think it&#x27;s those hired troll users that put in negative reviews in order to discourage the success in sales of this stuff.  I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars but I think it&#x27;s still a tad pricey.  I&#x27;ll check out my local CVS and Walgreens to see if they carry it, and hopefully for less.  An excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  It works better than any other cover up that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used the brush on ones and they are horrible to apply.  This goes on very easy and doesn&#x27;t look like you have anything sprayed on. It holds all day too.  iTS PERFECT FOR THE TIME BETWEEN COLOR APPLICATIONS.</li>
    <li> Item was everything I expected. Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
