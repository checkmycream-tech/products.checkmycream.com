    <li> The boar bristle brush is really nice for brushing hair even  if you have a lot snarls&lt;br /&gt;in your hair they come out with  really easy  with out pulling out your hair !&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are really soft to the touch the wood handle makes it&lt;br /&gt;easy to grip on to the brush !&lt;br /&gt;Would even say this a great brush to on every ones  hair from the little girls&lt;br /&gt;to adult women or even on those boys and men  !&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush on my hair my looks more shinny and healthier  which&lt;br /&gt;unlike most brushes they only brush through  the hair leaving flat and duel&lt;br /&gt;!  This brush even helps to stimulate your scalp  which also  helps to&lt;br /&gt;remove  those ugly flakes from dry scalp !&lt;br /&gt;Yes i&#x27;m very pleased with owning this amazing brush !&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product as a promotion&lt;br /&gt;in return for review</li>
    <li> I have always used a brush from Walmart, usually by Con-Air and not only do they always break but they make my hair so frizzy. I have hair down to my waist and I love to wear it down but when I would I would look like cousin IT, and I didn&#x27;t want that. Then I found this amazing Boar Bristle Hair Brush by Truly Genuine Beauty and knew it would be different since it had added nylon. This brush is beyond amazing, not only is it the sturdiest brush I have ever come across, but it leaves my hair so soft and frizz-free!! I was so amazed that this actually worked, now i can wear my hair down and look amazing! I know that this brush is going to last because of how sturdy it is, I love that it&#x27;s solid wood, but it&#x27;s not heavy. Truly a brush for a beauty queen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush!  Simple design is what drew me to choose this product.  Feels like a massage when brushing.</li>
    <li> UPDATE  --  I BOUGHT THIS BRUSH IN JULY 2015.  MANY OF THE NYLON BRISTLES HAVE COME OUT.  SOON THE BRUSH WILL BE USELESS.  THIS BRUSH IS VERY HARD TO CLEAN.  I LIKED THE BRUSH A LOT AND WISH IT HELD UP BETTER THAN IT DOES.  I AM LOOKING FOR A BETTER BRUSH.  -  Aging has made my hair drier, frizzier, harder to manage and due to medications, it has started coming out.  I washed my hair and used this brush while blow drying my hair.  The brush is well balanced and feels good in my hand.  It feels good on my scalp.  The bristles are firm enough to do some good, yet gentle so as to not break off my hair.  It detangled well without breaking my hair.  When I finished blow drying my hair, here weren’t many hairs in the brush at all.  Not nearly as many as other brushes I had been using.  I wanted to take care of my new Boar Bristle Hair Brush.  So, I also purchased the Denman Hair Brush Cleaner.  It worked great to get the hair out of the brush without damaging the brush.  There were only two Boar bristles that came out during the course of using the brush and cleaning it.  I expect a few to come out of any new brush.  Only two coming out is remarkable.  I like this brush so well I am going to purchase a second one.  I wish they made a smaller version of this brush for travel.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very impressed with this hair brush.  It is a well made brush that is gentle on my fine, thin hair.  I try to be gentle with brushing my hair and this brush helps me keep my hair looking great without pulling out a lot of hair or hurting my sensitive scalp.  I would highly recommend this hair brush.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints so far. It&#x27;s what I expect in a brush. At this time I would recommend this to my friends with no problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair brush fanatic but I don&#x27;t just like any old hair brush. It has to be quality.&lt;br /&gt; I have long hair and I want to keep it looking the best I can. Let hair tangles, it&#x27;s thin and oily , but with the right brush none of those are issues. I am in love with Trulys boar bristle brush. It is quality made and the dark wooden handle is very pretty! It has a nice weight to it and brushes fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair even when fresh out of the shower.  truly Genuine Beauty&#x27;s Boar Brush came within two days . Natural bristles are known for helping with shine and cutting down elasticity in fine hair. This brush definitely does that! I&#x27;m very satisfied !&lt;br /&gt;I ordered during a promotion for a discount but if I happen to misplace it I will order a replacement right away .</li>
    <li> Lightweight but sturdy , very convenient to pack on trips. It gives extra volume to my hair and keeps them smooth and shiny. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this product to distribute oil throughout my hair and got this combination brush with nylon bristles for thick hair. It feels good on my scalp, doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy like I thought it would be, love it, I use it twice a day now!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before giving my review about this brush. I have to say this is the BEST brush I have used in my life. The quality of the brush is A+. I have thick long full hair so this is the best brush to use for it. When brushing through the hair, I can notice a difference with how soft it makes my hair feel. Not only that, the price I paid for is unbeatable for how high quality this hair brush is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush for all hair types. Try it out and I am confident you will be a fan as well :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few days now and I am liking it. The quality of the brush is very good, especially for the price, and it&#x27;s made my hair seem a lot less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, coarse, curly hair so it takes anywhere from 30 min to an hour to brush my hair. This brush does pull my hair oils down (which is impressive given how much hair I have) and the added nylon helps sort through all of my hair on my lazier days when I don&#x27;t have an hour to brush. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> A FOOT NOTE:  THE SELLER IS REPLACING THIS BRUSH FOR ME ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EDITING THIS REVIEW-The bristles are already falling out only a few months later!!!!  It is nothing compared to the quality of the Jean Pierre! I spent all this money for NOTHING!!!!! ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  I have had a Jean Pierre brush for the last 35 years.  It finally began to loose the bristles so I had to find another.  The company had been sold and sadly the quality suffered so I passed on another of those. I found this brush.  I have very thick hair and this brush works great!  It also feels very nice on my scalp.  The wooden handle fits nicely into my hand-I have small hands and I am very pleased with my purchase. Cyndy</li>
    <li> Very happy so far!  I&#x27;ve only used the brush for two days, but can already tell it glides thru my hair much nicer than other brushes.  It doesn&#x27;t pull as much out, and I hadn&#x27;t noticed any fly-always or frizz.  My hair is quite long, and it runs nicely thru the entire length without getting caught or tangled.  Also, the one piece wooden handle has a nice, comfortable weight in my hand. And due to being seamless, my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in any crevices.  Very nice brush for quite an inexpensive cost.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I have thick hair an have recently decided to go &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and needed a good boars hair bristle brush. This brush fit my needs perfectly! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Its a nice brush, I do think the boar bristles are a little short. It barely, if at all, touches my hair. I have thick hair and if I keep the brush flush against my head then the bristles don&#x27;t really touch my hair. Brushing my hair forward and backwards seems to yield the best result. It is a good brush though and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This brush has been great so far.  I really think that a boar bristle brush is what I was missing the first time I tried to go shampoo-free.  I love that it also has the plastic bristles that get through my long, thick hair, and the boar bristles do a good job of distributing the oils from my scalp.  The boar bristles do seem a little short, but I am excited to see how long-term use of this brush will effect my hair.  Immediately, after my first use, my hair was full and shiny, so I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I admit that I have “problem hair” and am always searching for products that can heal the damage of daily lap swimming. On top of that, I recently had major surgery that causes a lot of people to lose their hair, so what was already a thin, fine, fragile patch was getting scary looking. I started wearing hair pieces. My hair dresser had recommended that I buy a boar’s hair brush because apparently they stimulate the scalp and distribute the natural oils throughout the hair, making it shinier and healthier. She said to even use the brush when the hair is wet (instead of the comb) because combs tend to tear wet hair (which I didn’t know). So I went out and bought my first pure boar bristle brush—it was expensive and good quality but unfortunately did not glide easily through the hair when wet, and it sort of mashed my hair down when dry. I then purchased four more brushes of all different kinds, and none of them were working for me. I was about to give up on finding a good brush when, by coincidence, I received an email from Peter at Truly Genuine Beauty, asking me if I wanted to review their boar-bristle brush that they said had unique features. I was skeptical because I thought, well, even if this is a good brush, I was not sure I would be able to see any results soon enough to do a timely review. (And as you can see, I don&#x27;t always give positive reviews.) But I knew I was a good candidate for the product—and after about a week I was really glad I found this brush (or it found me), because it has made a big difference. Here’s my honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The double action (boar bristle plus nylon)&lt;br /&gt;The nylon bristles that are slightly longer than the boar’s hair, so the brush glides over the scalp while the boar bristles do the deep brushing. So, it seems to be the best of both worlds--detangles hair when wet, and when the hair is dry, the brush does not mash it down (it becomes full of body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair looks a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I kept thinking it’s weird that my hair could be this improved in just one week, but it’s kind of like I inherited a different head of hair—a shinier, more finished look that feels softer and fuller. The only thing I’m doing differently is using the brush, so I figure there has to be something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It feels like a scalp massage.&lt;br /&gt;I used to really dislike brushing or combing my hair, and now I’m constantly reaching for this brush because it feels so good on my scalp, whether it’s right after a shower or when it’s dry and styled. And it makes my hair feel soft and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The wood handle makes it substantial.&lt;br /&gt;The added weight of the wood makes a difference as it glides through the hair. It’s not a flimsy fly-weight cheapo thing. It’s also a nice-looking piece on the bathroom counter (this product pic on Amazon doesn’t quite do it justice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The price ($10)&lt;br /&gt;I paid more for brushes that weren’t nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Only one that I can see—I had to clean a bit of hair out of the brush by the end of the week, but a lot less hair than other brushes collect, and it was pretty easy to take a comb and run it across. Of course, wide-toothed nylon brushes never have to be cleaned out, but then, they don’t have any of the benefits of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I don’t think any brush is going to help problem hair without using outstanding hair care products to wash, condition, and add protein as well (and if you swim, saturating it coconut oil or olive oil before it gets wet can be a hairsaver). The brush just seems to take the hair well beyond what those products can do. If you have seriously problem hair (swimmers, for example), I would be glad to share info on other products that have made a difference after years of trial and error. And if you have tips, please share them, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to you!&lt;br /&gt;Julietbetter.&lt;br /&gt;I kept thinking it’s weird that my hair could be this improved in just one week, but it’s kind of like I inherited a different head of hair—a shinier, more finished look that feels softer and fuller. The only thing I’m doing differently is using the brush, so I figure there has to be something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It feels like a scalp massage.&lt;br /&gt;I used to really dislike brushing or combing my hair, and now I’m constantly reaching for this brush because it feels so good on my scalp, whether it’s right after a shower or when it’s dry and styled. And it makes my hair feel soft and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The wood handle makes it substantial.&lt;br /&gt;The added weight of the wood makes a difference as it glides through the hair.

    <li> We have tried every detangle brush on the market and this by far is the best for my sensitive headed 10 year old! We love it and highly recommend it! Leaves hair detangle, soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this brush.  What I do not like is the strong chemical smell from the wooden handle.  I&#x27;m trying to air it out to get rid of the smell.  i/m not sure where the boar&#x27;s hair is.  It appears to be nylon with little balls so that the bristles glide through your hair. I&#x27;ll return to this recommendation in about one month to see if the strong chemical smell is gone.</li>
    <li> We love the brush. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very shiny from using it. She actually received compliments on her hair the first day she used it. Instead of the usual 40-plus strokes to comb her thick hair, it takes about a dozen instead. It does not pull on her scalp and is very comfortable. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush along with a Denman brush to compare the two.  I needed a brush with both nylon and boar bristles because my hair is thick.  I prefer this one out of the two, but it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations either.  The nylon bristles go through my hair well, better than the Denman.  And I like the wooden handle over the plastic one.  I didn&#x27;t like the weird chemical factory odor that is still present a week later.  The boar bristles seem really short compared to the nylon bristles in the brush, and compared to other bristle brushes too, so while the nylon bristles go through my hair nicely, I&#x27;m not sure that the boar bristles are.  Lastly, it would be nice if the handle was a little thinner and longer, but that is my personal preference.</li>
    <li> I really loved this brush until today.  I purchased this on May 20, 2015 and the bristles are already falling out of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;• Feels great on sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;• Makes hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;• Good size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• The boar bristles are very short compared to the nylon.&lt;br /&gt;• The handle has a strong chemical smell that never seems to go away completely, but does lessen over time.&lt;br /&gt;• Nylon bristles fall out of the brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is really nice. I have fine, straight hair that tangles easily. This goes through my hair, even wet, without any problems. The brush is nicely crafted, I just wish the handle was a little bigger because it feels somewhat awkward in my hand. One thing I really liked was that the manufacturer of this brush contacted me directly for input on how I liked the brush. I did state my concern about the short handle and also about the noxious odor it had when it arrived. The representative explained to me that the odor was from the wood finish on the brush and that it would eventually go away. That it did after about a week.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and it knots up easily. I&#x27;ve been using a plastic bristle brush from CVS and hated it because it created a lot of static.  I was looking for a better brush, and bought this one based on the description and the price.  I loved this brush the minute I took it out of the box and tried it. It glides through my hair wet or dry, and makes hair brushing enjoyable! If anyone is thinking of buying a Mason Pearson brush, try this one first and save yourself some serious money!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It seems to add body to my hair and makes it more manageable.  It is gentle and what a great price!!  I am extremely happy with this brush.  More than met my expectations!</li>
    <li> Best detangler so far! Gentle &amp; antistatic - the perfect combo!</li>
    <li> Quality in general, but very good use</li>
    <li> Feels sooo good on my scalp, lifts my shorter hair!  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stickler when it comes to needing a decent hairbrush. I used to have hair half-way down my back. I had to cut it shorter last year and now that it&#x27;s growing out again, I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that can handle the job. In the past I&#x27;ve had hair brushes that actually fall apart. The ones for example that you buy at Target, Walmart, etc those don&#x27;t work for me. I had an Aveda brush that I loved, but water damaged the wood and eventually I tossed it, not realizing the store I bought it from went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise when I was asked to review the Boar Bristle Hair Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used Boar Bristle&#x27;s before. At first I didn&#x27;t know what they were until the product came. My first thought was the boar bristles are something my dad or grandpa used to use in his hairbrush. However, the fact that it&#x27;s got nylon pins, makes it work through longer hair. My hair is shoulder length and this brush works fantastic. I had no issues with knots, tangling, or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was comfortable to use, felt good, kind of like a massaging hairbrush, and does make your hair softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is definitely durable and the handle is made of solid wood (cherry according to the description). I would definitely recommend the Boar Bristle Hair Brush for anyone with medium to long hair that is looking for a decent styling tool at a reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> First off, I am very happy with this brush. I was surprised to hear of a boar hair brush that also had nylon bristles mixed in. I have fine hair that frizzes pretty easily and was a bit skeptical to begin with. This brush literally glides down my hair which as you can see in the photo is VERY long! No tangles at all. Shockingly, I have not had any frizzy or static hairs with each use. The mixture of bristles really creates smooth hair! I have brushed my dry hair over and over again with this brush and have not had a single problem with frizz (which is a bit surprising to me). The wooden handle is not only sturdy but is comfortable to hold. My only worry is that the wood may warp over time since it is kept in a humid room. I would absolutely recommend this brush to anyone. My one and only issue with it is that it is hard to get the hairs out of it (as seen in 2nd photo). You can&#x27;t just take your fingers and pull the hair out or you will end up pulling out a nylon bristle or two *which happened to me. I&#x27;m thinking the best way to get the hair out is to maybe use a comb to pull up and out. While I did receive this great brush at a discounted rate for my review, I would definitely purchase again and may even buy a few as Christmas gifts in a few months.</li>
    <li> Shopping for a genuine boar bristle brush was quite the chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for 100% boar bristle, this is not your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit though, the brush feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde uncooperative hair. With two cowlicks. That go opposite directions. This brush has done a rather nice job as an every day brush when my hair is dry to pull some of the scalp oil down the hair shaft. But I bought two other boar bristle brushes (one soft and one medium hardness) to use on layers of my hair to gain more of those boar bristle brush benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brush, just not alone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. It feels very good on my scalp, but a lot of hair is still pulling out. I&#x27;m not really noticing a difference in hair health either.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this for my 6-year-old, who has been wanting a brush that &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t hurt.&amp;#34; Looked into Mason Pearson (which I have), but those have gone from being expensive to prohibitively so (in my view). Thought this would be a good alternative. And it is!!! My daughter loves it. It works amazingly well on her fine, thin, prone-to-tangles hair without all of the pulling. I will likely purchase two more for my other daughters.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush! I have long, straight hair &amp; this brush is amazing. The combination of vinyl &amp; boar bristles detangles my hair easily while also smoothing it out. My husband has short, naturally wavy hair &amp; he loves it too.</li>
    <li> brush came pretty fast. very nice brush, feels really good when I brush, I like it !</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of this brisk on my scalp and hair, I didn&#x27;t used to brisk much before but now I enjoy it.  The finish on the wood is not well done on the back of my brush, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t completely love this brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Everyone in my family wants to use it so I had to hide it.  Must purchase a few more.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the brushes to replace some nylon brushes.  I have wavy hair that needs taming sometimes and these brushes work excellently whether my hair is dry or wet.  When they first arrived there was a slight odor to the brushes but I contacted the company and they told me it was from the finishing of the handle and goes away - it did so after a week or two.  I appreciated the quick response.</li>
    <li> This is such a great brush ! I&#x27;m happy that I bought it. I love that this brush has wide spaces and has a boar hair. It works great for my hair . It helps detangle it and get rid of any loose hair that I have.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent brush !</li>
    <li> I received my brush a week ago and I am already in love with it!!!!!! I&#x27;ve gone through so many brushes and finally a brush that does its job for fine thin hair. It&#x27;s so gentle doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair even when it&#x27;s wet. I ordered one for my mom too she loves it as well!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fanatic brush! Having gone low &amp;#34;poo&amp;#34; I needed a good boar bristle brush to keep my hair looking presentable. This brush does a great job distributing natural oils and the longer bristles are great at removing tangles. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Brush is okay but the long metal bristles have started to fall out and push back into the brush after a month of use. Wouldn&#x27;t get this brush again</li>
    <li> lovely product, a deal for the money!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Lasted maybe a month and the bristles started to come off. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just love my new brush! It feels incredible on my scalp and no static on my hair. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I have never used this kind of brush before. It takes out the snarls in my hair and makes my hair feel soft and smooth. I like the two different kinds of bristles both boar bristles and nylon pins, I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen a brush like this before. I like that many types of hair can use this. I like that my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy after using this brush. It is also light weight. I like that the handle is great quality made out of cherry tree wood. It has a 1 year warranty. I think this is a great brush, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush when I first purchased it. I have horribly knotty hair and it brushed my hair with ease. I bought it less than 2 months ago but I noticed this past week that a bunch of bristles are missing toward the bottom of the brush. They are slowly disappearing. It still works but I feel like it should&#x27;ve last longer then 2 months! My pictures are hard to see but the dark dots toward the bottom are the missing bristles.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Bought this for my daughter who has very thick hair and it works great. The quality is excellent too.</li>
    <li> Best of both worlds! I&#x27;ve always heard about the benefits of using a boat bristle&lt;br /&gt;brush but with my thick, dense, wavy hair coupled with the fact that I&lt;br /&gt;like the brush to reach my scalp, normal boar bristle brushes couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;do that. The boat bristles coupled with the nylon bristles seemed to&lt;br /&gt;be able to give me what I needed in a hair brush. The nylon bristles&lt;br /&gt;kinda reach the scalp and the boar bristles are making my hair&lt;br /&gt;smoother so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Boar bristle brushes can be hideously expensive, but unlike other brushes, they distribute the natural hair oils all the way to the ends as you brush, helping to keep your hair in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush combines the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;There are ball ended man made bristles that penetrate to the scalp, and shorter boar bristles that distribute hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in the hand as well as on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
    <li> I like the way this brush feels but I haven&#x27;t figured out an easy way to clean it yet.</li>
    <li> The best brush! I bought one....then 2 days later ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> I loved my brush until today. It really helped carry the oils throughout my hair and made it shiny. I was even ok with the chemical smell the wooden handle put out. I&#x27;ve had it for almost three weeks now. Today I went to brush my hair and noticed a lot of the plastic and boar bristles missing! The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t staying on the pad, they&#x27;re getting pushed into the brush. I don&#x27;t know what happened to the boar bristles. Really disappointing. Especially when the brush is labeled Top Quality. Hopefully I can get a replacement without this issue. If not, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received great customer service from this seller! After reading my comment they contacted me and sent me a new brush. I waited a while to give the update because I wanted to make sure the same situation didn&#x27;t happen again. It hasn&#x27;t :). This is my favorite brush. It really helps carry the oils through my hair to make it super soft and shiny. The bristles are still all there. I&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing another in the future ;-)</li>
    <li> This is my first boar bristle brush and it is just amazing. I have thin/wavy hair and I brush it night with this brush. I always hated using other brushes as I felt it did not stimulate my hair for growth but rather felt as if the brush were breaking my hair. This brush add a gloss and feels smooth!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of brushes. This one is far and away my favorite for my thick wavy hair. I can brush through tangles on freshly washed/well-conditioned hair without any pulling or breaking. It leaves dry hair smooth and shiny. I think it would also work with straight hair and loose curls, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my daughter&#x27;s tight curls (unless I was hot combing). Basically, I think you need to choose brushes based on hair type and this one is perfect for mine.</li>
    <li> The center of this brush fell in on iit&#x27;s self within one month of use.  It was purchased as a gift and by the time it was in use it was not eligible to be returned. Beware of this item.</li>
