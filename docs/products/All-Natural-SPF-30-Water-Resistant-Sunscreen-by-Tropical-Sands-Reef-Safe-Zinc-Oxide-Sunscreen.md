      <li>It seems to have amazing staying power too.  </li>
      <li>THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I received a discount for an honest review and</li>
      <li>I love a good non toxic sun block.</li>
      <li>On one hand, I like the lack of hazardous chemicals.</li>
      <li>and I was relieved to have the correct kind,</li>
      <li>I am getting more and more into using all natural products and the ingredient list in this made me very happy.</li>
      <li>This smells great, light and fresh.</li>
      <li>Worked okay, but is more like the sunscreen lifeguards wear.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock is deemed acceptable for use at many parks and resorts where they care about reef protection, so I like that about it.</li>
      <li>It does the job, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>After reading an article at the EWG website, I realized I needed more than what I had been using.  </li>
      <li>I am confident he is being protected from harmful exposure even on our home turf where we are in the sun and ocean almost every day of the year.</li>
      <li>It spreads well and stays on great (you really have to work at getting it off with a wash cloth).  </li>
      <li>Finding these attributes in one lotion is unique and the scent is really fresh and pleasant.</li>
      <li>The SPF 8 was my favorite and still surprisingly strong.  </li>
      <li>It received high marks from Environmental Working Group, rubs in pretty good ( some white residue is to be expected as this is mineral-based product), very light pleasant smell, and provides excellent protection for my fair skin when used as directed.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild, unoffensive scent.  </li>
      <li>the 30 SPF was fine though.  </li>
      <li>I think this works just fine if you need a biodegradable sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Once it soaked into the skin, it was fine.</li>
      <li>Several of us used it and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly important to me.</li>
      <li>It is approved there for use in the areas that are protecting Nature  ecologically.  </li>
      <li>I bought it to use during long rides,so I&#x27;m happy with its thickness and zinc coloration because I can see if I missed spots and whether it&#x27;s evenly applied.  </li>
      <li>Honestly I&#x27;d rather use normal spray sunscreen and risk getting cancer from the toxic chemicals it contains.</li>
      <li>At each excursion the attendant examined the bottle to make sure it had the correct type of biodegradable ingredients, and it did, thankfully.  </li>
      <li>and also I did not have to buy it right then and there, at a much higher price as many others had to.  </li>
      <li>The first day, we were out on a catamaran for 3 hours, and we were totally fine after using the 50 SPF.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and I used it immediately.</li>
      <li>are not getting absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>Just used this stuff for the first time.</li>
      <li>cant say that i LOVE it because it is so DARN time consuming to rub it in and NOT be white and pasty</li>
      <li>Once I try the product and see exactly how (and if) it works I will update the review.</li>
      <li>I never worry about what my body is absorbing with this brand!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty durable too, we reapply every 1.5 hours and often spend 4-6 hours out in the sun.</li>
      <li>It does give you a little bit of that pasty white tint, but It&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
      <li>A tube that can be flattened would be much easier.  </li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and decided to give it a shot as we were going to an eco-friendly resort, and I just have to say it really was a pain in the butt.</li>
      <li>They are very strict about this</li>
      <li>really too much!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell of this</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this, I really did.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this lotion for it&#x27;s spreadability and waterproof qualities.</li>
      <li>Above all I am grateful to Tropical Sands for producing a reef friendly product.</li>
      <li>Most OTC sunblocks I&#x27;ve purchsed have caused a reaction due to the ingredients in them.</li>
      <li>The texture is very greasy and pasty, and it did&#x27;t really rub in the way normal sunblock does.</li>
      <li>I live in South Florida and spend a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
      <li>We live in Florida and spend a lot of time in our pool, so we use a LOT of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I would not wear it other than at the reefs because it does not smell as good as I was hoping and does go on pretty thick.</li>
      <li>Although it goes on white, I am willing to forgo my vanity in order to be safer from the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have to wash your hands after applying it, because it feels pretty gross until you do.</li>
      <li>It works but never soaks into my skin, leaving a white coat the whole time.</li>
      <li>I was hopeful since it is all natural, but the product is lacking.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this product for at least 5 years now, and this is my favorite version.</li>
      <li>Arms and legs were easier to blend than large flat body areas (like backs and bellies).</li>
      <li>Nice, very very subtle, natural creamy coconut smell by the way.</li>
      <li>Still, the drawbacks are worth it if you&#x27;re going to be swimming in a body of water where other creatures are affected by your choice of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I will be searching for a different all natural product to use!!</li>
      <li>Harsh but true.</li>
      <li>The formula is thick and does not spread easily; the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; scent smells like cherry cough syrup.</li>
      <li>Personally, a little white sheen is worth</li>
      <li>This is very very thick and does not spread easily.</li>

<li> Personally, a little white sheen is worth</li>
<li> This is very very thick and does not spread easily.</li>
<li> The 50 SPF was a little too gritty and thick, like not enough liquid to spread it around easily.  </li>
<li> I would not wear it other than at the reefs/caves because goes on pretty thick and does not always soak in leaving a white film on your skin.</li>
<li> It blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen like other sunscreens.</li>
<li> Its too bad people have been leaving bad reviews for this great product - I think everyone should be aware of the differences between chemical sunscreen vs. mineral sunblock.</li>
<li> scent is very similar to Juicy Fruit gum, and it got annoying pretty fast.</li>
<li> after the second day, we started cutting it with the same brand aloe gel for more spreadability which helped but still was not great application.</li>
<li> It is thick so, put a small amount in your hand first and then apply to the area.  </li>
<li> Well...maybe it may be all natural, but the cream is so thick..</li>
<li> also didn&#x27;t like the packaging, as the sunblock is quite thick, and once the bottle is around half full, it gets hard to get it out.</li>
<li> obviously did not survive the oiling experience but was not easy or convenient to reapply either.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Stayed a bit chalky, but we knew about that from other reviews.</li>
<li> Never absorbed</li>
<li> It is zinc based and it does work, but it&#x27;s so not worth the effort.</li>
<li> Since I commute by bike, I was really looking for a sunscreen, which would not be visible upon arrival to the office, and this one is not it, unfortunately...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really thick and turns your skin white.  </li>
<li> We had to wash the palms of our hands after applying to not have a thick white coating on them.</li>
<li> so goes on thick and white.!</li>
<li> IF you can get it rubbed in, the white cast really isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
<li> I am still adjusting to using barrier type sunscreen, so wish it looked less like kabuki make-up.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for a snorkeling trip where biodegradable sunblock is needed.  I&#x27;m giving it a four only because it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad and the sample I put on my skin seems to cover well.  Once I try the product and see exactly how (and if) it works I will update the review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this sunscreen. I never worry about what my body is absorbing with this brand! And it works great too!</li>
    <li> Definitely blocked the sun.  Is liquid zinc oxide so goes on thick and white.!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome we&#x27;re excited to use it in Mexico and since it is eco friendly we won&#x27;t have to worry about being in &amp; around ocean life!</li>
    <li> I think this works just fine if you need a biodegradable sunscreen.  I would not wear it other than at the reefs because it does not smell as good as I was hoping and does go on pretty thick.</li>
    <li> Worked okay, but is more like the sunscreen lifeguards wear.  Does not rub in.</li>
    <li> Well...maybe it may be all natural, but the cream is so thick..really too much!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin white, and even after I took shower and everything, is still on my skin.. I can still see the white!! That&#x27;s very annoying!! wish I could be refunded...</li>
    <li> The formula is thick and does not spread easily; the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; scent smells like cherry cough syrup. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a trip to Mexico, we did three snorkeling/swimming excursions that all required the use of a biodegradable sunscreen.  At each excursion the attendant examined the bottle to make sure it had the correct type of biodegradable ingredients, and it did, thankfully.  They are very strict about this and I was relieved to have the correct kind, and also I did not have to buy it right then and there, at a much higher price as many others had to.  Several of us used it and it worked great.  I would not wear it other than at the reefs/caves because goes on pretty thick and does not always soak in leaving a white film on your skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very effective stuff.  We used it during a two week Panama Canal cruise, and we are marshmallow white folks.  It is thick so, put a small amount in your hand first and then apply to the area.  A little goes a long way.  We had actually purchased their SPF 8, 30, and 50.  I used the 50 the first day and it was awesome.  No sunburns!  Then we switched to the 30 and the 8.  The SPF 8 was my favorite and still surprisingly strong.  The first day, we were out on a catamaran for 3 hours, and we were totally fine after using the 50 SPF.  It does give you a little bit of that pasty white tint, but It&#x27;s great stuff.  The 50 SPF was a little too gritty and thick, like not enough liquid to spread it around easily.  the 30 SPF was fine though.  A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  No sun protection at all.  Put it in to swim with dolphins re applied every 30 minutes and my kids fried like tomatoes.  They burned worse than I did without anything.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for at least 5 years now, and this is my favorite version. It received high marks from Environmental Working Group, rubs in pretty good ( some white residue is to be expected as this is mineral-based product), very light pleasant smell, and provides excellent protection for my fair skin when used as directed. I use it exclusively for myself and my two boys. Its too bad people have been leaving bad reviews for this great product - I think everyone should be aware of the differences between chemical sunscreen vs. mineral sunblock. Personally, a little white sheen is worth it knowing nasty chemicals ( many of which are banned in other countries)  are not getting absorbed into the skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on or rub in. When it seems to be rubbed in if you start sweating your face turns white from the product. I was hopeful since it is all natural, but the product is lacking.</li>
    <li> GROSS. Just used this stuff for the first time. It does not rub in at all. I look and feel like I&#x27;m covered in arts and crafts paste, and it&#x27;s rubbing off on my swimsuit. Honestly I&#x27;d rather use normal spray sunscreen and risk getting cancer from the toxic chemicals it contains. Harsh but true.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our whale shark encounter!!</li>
    <li> I love a good non toxic sun block. It&#x27;s truly important to me. I received a discount for an honest review and I honestly and thankful for this sunblock! Nice, very very subtle, natural creamy coconut smell by the way.</li>
    <li> On one hand, I like the lack of hazardous chemicals. This sunblock is deemed acceptable for use at many parks and resorts where they care about reef protection, so I like that about it. However, that&#x27;s basically the only thing I like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very similar to Juicy Fruit gum, and it got annoying pretty fast. The texture is very greasy and pasty, and it did&#x27;t really rub in the way normal sunblock does. You&#x27;d have to wash your hands after applying it, because it feels pretty gross until you do. It&#x27;s very thick and white, and we had a hard time keeping it from getting all over our swimsuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t like the packaging, as the sunblock is quite thick, and once the bottle is around half full, it gets hard to get it out. A tube that can be flattened would be much easier.  Still, the drawbacks are worth it if you&#x27;re going to be swimming in a body of water where other creatures are affected by your choice of sunscreen. I definitely won&#x27;t use it in pools, though.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I wish it were a little easier to rub in but I think the zinc makes that tough.  I&#x27;ll take that over all the cancer causing chemicals!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick and turns your skin white.  I bought it to use during long rides,so I&#x27;m happy with its thickness and zinc coloration because I can see if I missed spots and whether it&#x27;s evenly applied.  It seems to have amazing staying power too.  I&#x27;ll come home after 2.5 hours on the bike and I can still see it.  If you&#x27;re athletic, this is a great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It works but never soaks into my skin, leaving a white coat the whole time. Since I commute by bike, I was really looking for a sunscreen, which would not be visible upon arrival to the office, and this one is not it, unfortunately...</li>
    <li> Worked great. Stayed a bit chalky, but we knew about that from other reviews. Once it soaked into the skin, it was fine. Smelled good too. We snorkeled in the Cancun mid-day sun with no sunburns. Great product!</li>
    <li> It arrived in great shape.  It has a very mild, unoffensive scent.  It spreads well and stays on great (you really have to work at getting it off with a wash cloth).  I am still adjusting to using barrier type sunscreen, so wish it looked less like kabuki make-up.  My strongest suggestion is that you put it in a tube...it is nearly impossible for someone with my limited hand strength to get it out of the container (just can&#x27;t squeeze hard enough).</li>
    <li> I hated it! It leaves you looking like casper the ghost and when you get in the water you look purple! The product is difficult to rub on your skin and then It was difficult to wash off. I then also got sun after applying! I will be searching for a different all natural product to use!!</li>
    <li> Order arrived promptly. My husband really likes this lotion for it&#x27;s spreadability and waterproof qualities. Finding these attributes in one lotion is unique and the scent is really fresh and pleasant. I am confident he is being protected from harmful exposure even on our home turf where we are in the sun and ocean almost every day of the year. Above all I am grateful to Tropical Sands for producing a reef friendly product. Mahalo!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, I really did. I read all the reviews and decided to give it a shot as we were going to an eco-friendly resort, and I just have to say it really was a pain in the butt. It is zinc based and it does work, but it&#x27;s so not worth the effort. This is very very thick and does not spread easily. IF you can get it rubbed in, the white cast really isn&#x27;t too bad but it&#x27;s very difficult to rub in. We did it about a nickel sized blob at a time, working it between our hands before applying to extremities and it took forever. Arms and legs were easier to blend than large flat body areas (like backs and bellies). We had to wash the palms of our hands after applying to not have a thick white coating on them. I got beach massages and this obviously did not survive the oiling experience but was not easy or convenient to reapply either. after the second day, we started cutting it with the same brand aloe gel for more spreadability which helped but still was not great application. Also, it smells nothing like coconut.</li>
    <li> Everything went well. I&amp;#34;m happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but it goes on like a coat of paint!  Goes on white and stays that way; but it definitely blocks the sun.</li>
    <li> cant say that i LOVE it because it is so DARN time consuming to rub it in and NOT be white and pasty</li>
    <li> Used this while on vacation in the Cancun area.  It is approved there for use in the areas that are protecting Nature  ecologically.  Worked as well as regular sun tan lotion for our snorkling trips.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell of this and I didn&#x27;t like its consistency or the way it felt on my skin. I keep it as a back up sunscreen. It does the job, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know it was going to stay white when I put it on. Never absorbed</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, works well and no allergic reaction to the ingredients. Most OTC sunblocks I&#x27;ve purchsed have caused a reaction due to the ingredients in them. But tropical sands worked great with no breakouts or reactions. Love it!</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and spend a lot of time in the sun.  After reading an article at the EWG website, I realized I needed more than what I had been using.  This was a recommended product.  Although it goes on white, I am willing to forgo my vanity in order to be safer from the sun&#x27;s rays.  I just wish I could buy it in a store and not have to order from the website.</li>
    <li> I am getting more and more into using all natural products and the ingredient list in this made me very happy. It arrived quickly and I used it immediately. We live in Florida and spend a lot of time in our pool, so we use a LOT of sunscreen. This smells great, light and fresh. It&#x27;s a little thick but I don&#x27;t consider that a bad thing. It blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen like other sunscreens. It&#x27;s pretty durable too, we reapply every 1.5 hours and often spend 4-6 hours out in the sun. We have yet to be burnt!! 5 stars all around in my book. Smells good, works great, and lasts awhile. THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount for an honest review.</li>
