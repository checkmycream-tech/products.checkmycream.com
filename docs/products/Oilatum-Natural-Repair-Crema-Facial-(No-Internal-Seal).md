      <li>Like other Oilatum products, this is an excellent cream that heals the skin without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>I put it on right before my makeup (and (Boots Radiance Balm), and it gives me that healthy, dewy, radiant glow that I love.</li>
      <li>NWheatlhcare did a fantastic job in sending this product within 2 days, from UK to US.</li>
      <li>It helps keep dry patches away my skin feels great.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Love this cream very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face super soft and it looks amazing under make-up as well.</li>
      <li>It is truly great for Colorado due to the dryness and lack of hydration.</li>
      <li>This cream goes on light, smooth and really works.  </li>
      <li>Took a couple of weeks, but well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>makes skin look fresh and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I tried this for facial eczema and it goes on nicely however,</li>
      <li>But I found this on Amazon, decided to give it a try because no irritating ingredients such as alcohols or lanolin or rose.  </li>
      <li>The delivery time was posted was much, much longer than it actually took to receive it, so I was thrilled about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall nice product, but could be more hydrating for my extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>I liked how little I can use to get full moisture.</li>
      <li>This product is not oily or greasy at all, and leaves my skin silky smooth and velvety soft.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, I will definitely be ordering it again</li>
      <li>And I say almost perfect not because there is anything wrong with the product.  </li>
      <li>I wish this came in a large tub; I would use it as a body butter in place of body lotion.</li>
      <li>Hydrating, The tube is smaller than I&#x27;d like and I used it quickly!</li>
      <li>I just wish it absorbed a little better</li>
      <li>thanks a bunch</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this moisturizer because I&#x27;d heard so much about it on Youtube, but I just don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
      <li>So thank you NWhealthcare for keeping your promise with fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Will I buy it again, most likely not as there are so many other creams in stores that are similar.</li>
      <li>This product is for people that need true deep moisture.</li>
      <li>Delivered very quickly and and it creates a glow under minimal makeup.</li>
      <li>The formula of this moisturizer is pretty thick, if I don&#x27;t let it sit and absorb in my skin for a good ten minutes or so, it&#x27;ll leave my face still tacky and dewy under my makeup.</li>
      <li>and it helps clear my breakouts!!</li>
      <li>Finally a product that is strong enough to moisturize the eczema on my face.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more and I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin!</li>
      <li>I live in Wyoming where it is super dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had super dry acne-prone skin, and when I moved to a new climate things just got</li>
      <li>My skin is now so, so, beyond baby soft!</li>
      <li>Wow learned about this from pixie woo and this moisturizer is the bomb baby..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never before had breakouts or dry skin but something about the hormonal changes the weight loss brought on has caused exactly that.</li>
      <li>mild eczema due to stress that caused my face skin to dry + really itchy.</li>
      <li>somehow I was getting super oily and yet at the same time dry and flaky!</li>
      <li>I got this particular Oilatum product as soon as I need it, as I couldn&#x27;t find similar product since I moved to the US.</li>
      <li>I much prefer Embryolisse for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This summer, I only used it when I had over-exfoliated, because as many have mentioned, it is somewhat thick to wear under makeup in the humid weather of the South.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing this item on a regular basis, i.e. as long as Amazon is capable of getting this item in.  </li>
      <li>Works really well for dry skin, especially under makeup.</li>
      <li>To start off, my skin is normal but dry on my cheeks and in between my eyes (which gets quite flaky).</li>
      <li>Works wonders ..in a short amount of time..discoloration of skin is barely noticeably.</li>
      <li>I tried other face cream, but I highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Hard to find, often out of stock online, but worth the wait.</li>

<li> Only this product could fix my dry skin within days!</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t keen on experimenting much since I get rashes from just about every common lotion ingredient, so I did my research.</li>
<li> /&gt;We don&#x27;t have near as bad winters in TX as most other states but they are very DRY</li>
<li> and my face takes a heck of beating from the dry weather.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s fairly thick, so I use it at night and then put on my old sunscreen lotion in the morning.</li>
<li> Other than that?</li>
<li> Ive then only used it on my dry spots and only on days when those areas feel especially dry, and I haven&#x27;t broken out since!</li>
<li> Provides lots of moisture but is a bit heavy.</li>
<li> Once I received it, I used it a couple of times and unfortunately it broke me out in tiny little pimples across my cheeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve lost quite a bit of weight in the past 8 months, and it has taken a toll on my skin.</li>
<li> This has now replaced all my expensive creams and is the only product I use.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the other products in this line appear to have ingredients I cannot tolerate on my skin.</li>
<li> Almost every moisturizer breaks me out; I usually just use a little oil over damp skin at night, use a few drops added to my base makeup in the day.  </li>
<li> worse-</li>
<li> Works well as a base for makeup if you have dry skin.</li>
<li> And any face cream (affordable or expensive) just couldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I saw this on pixiwoo by recommendation from Nic. When I first got it I felt it was a little thick. But once I used it for about a week it became amazing. It is truly great for Colorado due to the dryness and lack of hydration. It also makes your makeup look fantastic!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that is strong enough to moisturize the eczema on my face. This product is for people that need true deep moisture.</li>
    <li> Provides lots of moisture but is a bit heavy. Does not break me out at all, which is a miracle.  I just wish it absorbed a little better, I can still feel the moisturizer on my skin after a while.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I will definitely be ordering it again makes skin look fresh and hydrated. Especially under a mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but I think it&#x27;s too Oily For ME</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had super dry acne-prone skin, and when I moved to a new climate things just got worse- somehow I was getting super oily and yet at the same time dry and flaky! Horrible. I wasn&#x27;t keen on experimenting much since I get rashes from just about every common lotion ingredient, so I did my research. This cream has almost no potential irritants (based on checking it out on the cosdna website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results! This face cream is amazing- no reactions, and it&#x27;s solved the oily/dry problem beautifully. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I&#x27;m really pleased. It&#x27;s fairly thick, so I use it at night and then put on my old sunscreen lotion in the morning.</li>
    <li> It is part of my daily routine. I started to use this face cream since September 2013. I tried other face cream, but I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Delivered very quickly and and it creates a glow under minimal makeup. Hydrating and great for sensitive skin. I just ordered another.</li>
    <li> Works really well for dry skin, especially under makeup. This has now replaced all my expensive creams and is the only product I use. I wish I could get this in Australia</li>
    <li> I tried this for facial eczema and it goes on nicely however, it&#x27;s does not do anything to combat eczema. Will I buy it again, most likely not as there are so many other creams in stores that are similar.</li>
    <li> Wow learned about this from pixie woo and this moisturizer is the bomb baby..keeps me hydrated....i use retin a and this does the trick</li>
    <li> I live in Wyoming where it is super dry. I always have dry patches on my skin and I could never seem to get rid of them. I bought this stuff on a whim, and I am so glad I did! It makes my face super soft and it looks amazing under make-up as well. I will definitely be buying more and I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin!</li>
    <li> What a great product, I have never had such great results.  It helps keep dry patches away my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> To start off, my skin is normal but dry on my cheeks and in between my eyes (which gets quite flaky). Once I received it, I used it a couple of times and unfortunately it broke me out in tiny little pimples across my cheeks. Ive then only used it on my dry spots and only on days when those areas feel especially dry, and I haven&#x27;t broken out since! The formula of this moisturizer is pretty thick, if I don&#x27;t let it sit and absorb in my skin for a good ten minutes or so, it&#x27;ll leave my face still tacky and dewy under my makeup.</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderful....</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this moisturizer because I&#x27;d heard so much about it on Youtube, but I just don&#x27;t understand the hype. For me, it was just okay. Nothing special. I much prefer Embryolisse for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best moisturizer I have ever used! I&#x27;ve lost quite a bit of weight in the past 8 months, and it has taken a toll on my skin. I&#x27;ve never before had breakouts or dry skin but something about the hormonal changes the weight loss brought on has caused exactly that. All of that has changed since introducing Oilatum into my life. My skin is now so, so, beyond baby soft! This product is not oily or greasy at all, and leaves my skin silky smooth and velvety soft. I put it on right before my makeup (and (Boots Radiance Balm), and it gives me that healthy, dewy, radiant glow that I love. It is great even if you&#x27;re just planning on wearing nothing but BB cream for the day. I also prefer this face cream over my more expensive nighttime one. Oilatum has greatly improved the feel and appearance of my skin. I often get compliments on it. Even my husband has noticed the difference. The only con (if there is one) is that it isn&#x27;t sold in the USA so the shipping takes a bit longer with coming through the Royal Mail and customs. Other than that? No complaints. I am in love with this product! :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect for my very dry face</li>
    <li> This cream goes on light, smooth and really works.  I even want to use it on my dry hands, but for me it&#x27;s a bit spendy for that. I will be purchasing this item on a regular basis, i.e. as long as Amazon is capable of getting this item in.  It ships from the UK, even though the packaging stated Malm&amp;ouml;, Sweden. Took a couple of weeks, but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Like other Oilatum products, this is an excellent cream that heals the skin without being greasy.  The product is unscented and a naturally very low odor.  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face cream!! It&#x27;s so light, non greasy!! Great for any skin type and it helps clear my breakouts!! I love this stuff! It also smells great!!</li>
    <li> pretty good cream. Hydrating, The tube is smaller than I&#x27;d like and I used it quickly! Overall nice product, but could be more hydrating for my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream very moisturizing.  I have very dry skin and this cream has worked miracles I use it as a primer under my makeup and it helps my foundation go on smother.  I love it.  Seller was great very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> NWheatlhcare did a fantastic job in sending this product within 2 days, from UK to US. I have to pay alot for faster delivery, but I&#x27;m just really glad I got this particular Oilatum product as soon as I need it, as I couldn&#x27;t find similar product since I moved to the US. Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream is AMAZING!!! I have alergic reaction/mild eczema due to stress that caused my face skin to dry + really itchy. And any face cream (affordable or expensive) just couldn&#x27;t fix it. Only this product could fix my dry skin within days! And the price is excellent. So thank you NWhealthcare for keeping your promise with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works wonders ..in a short amount of time..discoloration of skin is barely noticeably. .no need to cake makeup on my face anymore..thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> If you like the feeling of having your face covered in wax, this product may be for you.  It does not absorb into the skin and feels terrible &amp; suffocating.  I figured I&#x27;d use it as hand cream, but even that was unpleasant.  Best thing I can say about it is that it has no scent and does not smell terrible like the Oilatum soap.  Horrible!</li>
    <li> And I say almost perfect not because there is anything wrong with the product.  This moisturizer has worked wonders for my dry, dehydrated, winter thirsty skin.  It would be the perfect moisturizer if I could find it locally in the states.  The delivery time was posted was much, much longer than it actually took to receive it, so I was thrilled about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t have near as bad winters in TX as most other states but they are very DRY and my face takes a heck of beating from the dry weather.  Oilatum will be the product I reach for during these months...even if it has to come from the UK.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with rosacea, acne, and eczema.  Almost every moisturizer breaks me out; I usually just use a little oil over damp skin at night, use a few drops added to my base makeup in the day.  But I found this on Amazon, decided to give it a try because no irritating ingredients such as alcohols or lanolin or rose.  I used it almost every night in the winter.It&#x27;s a great eye cream both day or night because no stinging or clogged pores.  This summer, I only used it when I had over-exfoliated, because as many have mentioned, it is somewhat thick to wear under makeup in the humid weather of the South. It always calms my skin, takes out the red.  Hard to find, often out of stock online, but worth the wait. I am disappointed we no longer can find it in the states. Unfortunately, the other products in this line appear to have ingredients I cannot tolerate on my skin. I wish this came in a large tub; I would use it as a body butter in place of body lotion. This is a truly neutral cream which does what it supposed to do; protect skin and soften it.</li>
    <li> I liked how little I can use to get full moisture. Works well as a base for makeup if you have dry skin.</li>
