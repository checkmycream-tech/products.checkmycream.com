      <li>It is a nice spray, not sticky, not smelly.</li>
      <li>However, she does not even know how to straighten her own hair</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>This is a good hairspray, better than most, but does not put body into my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Good spray, but stops spraying with about 1/6 full.</li>
      <li>Love this body building hair spray</li>
      <li>Glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray...</li>
      <li>Love the smell, gives my hair body and helps with styling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>At $20 a can, I was expecting so much more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>Well, she says the spray is okay.  </li>
      <li>I dont like that feeling because that means more washing.  </li>
      <li>about the product... I LOVE IT!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I know she is going to order some more.</li>
      <li>I love this body builder.  </li>
      <li>Totally satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>For long hair however, this may not be the best.</li>
      <li>~ I didn&#x27;t care for that, but  had it been worth waiting for, I might have been more charitable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also true that the more you use, the more volume you get, which I need and love.  </li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re after a strong hold , keep looking.  </li>
      <li>All Nick&#x27;s hair products are great and work really good and don&#x27;t leave your hair stiff</li>
      <li>third daughter has abundant long and wavy hair (beautiful) and when she used it, she was amazed, soft yet hold your hair perfectly in place.</li>
      <li>So quick!</li>
      <li>so I have to really work with it by using a mousse or spray of some kind.  </li>
      <li>But for short hair meant to be spiked, i&#x27;d imagine it would be great.</li>
      <li>Holds without stiff, sticky residue-- LOVE it!!!!</li>
      <li>Truthfully, my hair looks nice and is pretty much impervious to humidity except when it is raining</li>
      <li>After a long career trying countless hair sprays, I now honestly say that this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>my hair is super fine, baby like, silky and blonde, can break easily and this stuff is so good to my hair..</li>
      <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>My hair feels light, clean, and natural except that I look like I have a lot more of it.</li>
      <li>the very best product for fine, limp hair...can be used on both wet or dry hair...be sure to work it in before styling !!!  </li>
      <li>I was lucky to get this product from my niece.</li>
      <li>I hope this stuff never goes off the market, it is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>Great as a hair spray, but can get that for less.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>The website named in my title here put this hairspray up near the top.  </li>
      <li>I was surprisingly thrilled with this spray because mostly I get not much from highly touted products.  </li>
      <li>THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND MORE HIGHLY THAN THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR FINE HAIR.  </li>
      <li>However, I found that it was gone much quicker than I would have liked, that&#x27;s the only reason for four stars instead of five.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, it is a great product, HOWEVER $ 45.00 dollars and change it a little high don&#x27;t you think?</li>
      <li>Not heavy or dulling or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Gives just the right body to my straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Great product, I have been using it as part of my daily hair routine for a long time.</li>
      <li>but when she goes to work, she has to pretty up.  </li>
      <li>I am about 3/4 through my first can, and the nozzle has never clogged once.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have to say I was a bit skeptical, as so many products CLAIM to give you great volume, but this one really delivers.  </li>
      <li>There should be a new way of getting out product to get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Perfect for daily use, easy to manage hair without any mess such as stiff/hard hair and white residue.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so finally ordered it from Amazon for my thinning, fine</li>
      <li>My hair is blond, short and rather fine.</li>
      <li>IF YOUR HAIR IS FINE AND STICK STRAIGHT, NEEDING BODY, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.</li>
      <li>Hairspray is great, especially for fine and thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have bone straight hair and it gives me lots of volume.  </li>
      <li>do you know how much this spray cost on qvc?</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can brush your hair after using it and it still keeps the volume and holds really well.</li>
      <li>But this spray provides great body (on wet or dry hair) and still leaves hair soft and comb-able.  </li>
      <li>It will hold with the top down.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry, I was sure I would love this product based on the reviews</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the aerosol spray can be pretty intense to breathe in</li>
      <li>This is the most Heavy Duty ...</li>
      <li>Most sprays that provide body and hold leave hair so stiff</li>
      <li>Even use it again on slept on hair and it perks it right back up!!!!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product....</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Wow, no more stringy, fine, flyaway hair!</li>
      <li>hair is extremely thine, fine, and very little,like baby hair, yet when I use this spray it creates volume and feels soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, it does not hold the hair as strong as other brand i have bought over the counter, but it holds strong enough that you can still style your hair without mess.  </li>
      <li>Not stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or as hard as a board.</li>
      <li>WOW I do and</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
      <li>Its hold is whisper soft and keeps all your hair in place.</li>
      <li>My hair is blonde and straight</li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I have unbelievably fine hair and everything else I&#x27;ve used gives me serious helmet hair with way too much</li>
      <li>However, I have never been disappointed and love this latest product.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE BABY FINE HAIR &amp; THIS WORKS TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT I HAVE VOLUME IN MY HAIR ( WHICH IS NO EASY THING TO DO!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this spray after reading some reviews.  It does not leave white residue on hair after you spray and comb your hair.  However, it does not hold the hair as strong as other brand i have bought over the counter, but it holds strong enough that you can still style your hair without mess.  I like to use it when i make a bun with my hair, and my hair will not get messy for the whole day after the spray.  Perfect for daily use, easy to manage hair without any mess such as stiff/hard hair and white residue.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to style hair with natural look and who always have trouble with hair sprays that leave hair too hard/strong and with white residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair spray expert.  After a long career trying countless hair sprays, I now honestly say that this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  It creates body and hold without gunking up your hair with build-up; it&#x27;s not sticky and it leaves your hair shiny!</li>
    <li> My hair is blonde and straight so I have to use a mousse or spray of some type. A mousse tends to make my hair look a few shades darker and sprays were useless. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw this product on a TV shopping channel that I decided to give it a try. Voila! I finally found a product that worked without making my hair look dark or feel as stiff as a board. The only downside is that the aerosol spray can be pretty intense to breathe in so I spray it on my hair in one part of the bathroom and then run to the other side to start drying my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it on dry hair so this review is only for my experience with using it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair spray! I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or as hard as a board. It is flexible, and adds shine to your hair. Its hold is whisper soft and keeps all your hair in place. If you have fine thin hair like mine that goes flat becuase other sprays weigh it down, you won&#x27;t be sad you purchased this.</li>
    <li> This is good if you need some help with volume in your hair.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it does help.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nick Chavez products for years.  I had cancer and lost all of my hair.  It has grown in now.  However, it came in with a different texture.  I am afraid to get a perm for fear that something will make it brittle or it might fall out again.  So I depend on the Chavez products to give my hair body and texture without damage.  His products run in cycles so I have to change every so often.  However, I have never been disappointed and love this latest product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> That says it all.  I use it often and happily it doensn&#x27;t hold in the wind but that isn&#x27;t its long suit.  It does add volunme and body and I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product &amp; only in 4 days did I receive it.  That included the processing as well. So quick! I bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas.  She&#x27;s in her 40s &amp; has very thin, short hair.  She is always complaining about it so I thought, heck why not get this product.  I think I saw it off of QVC, I was very impressed &amp; thought about getting it for myself but I&#x27;m in my early 20s &amp; I have very thick hair &amp; knew my mother needed it more. The price was a little high so I looked it up on Amazon &amp; found it for $8 less.&lt;br /&gt;My mother is a total tomboy but when she goes to work, she has to pretty up.  Well, she says the spray is okay.  I have not used it or tried it myself so I am unsure of how the product is that is why I am only giving it a 3.  However, she does not even know how to straighten her own hair so I will do my mothers hair using this product &amp; see for myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago after seeing it on a shopping network. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I have unbelievably fine hair and everything else I&#x27;ve used gives me serious helmet hair with way too much buildup.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. I air dry my hair, shake the aerosol can, tip my head down and spray it near the roots. I use the hair dryer on an air only setting to plump up the volume, and then style it with my  hands, a comb or a qbrush. Wow, no more stringy, fine, flyaway hair! My hair feels light, clean, and natural except that I look like I have a lot more of it. Truthfully, my hair looks nice and is pretty much impervious to humidity except when it is raining and I have no umbrella.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine so I have to really work with it by using a mousse or spray of some kind.  I have tried everything in all different stores and nothing seems to do what this product does.  It is wonderful!!!!! I have finally found a product that works for me....I use it on wet or dry hair!!! Even use it again on slept on hair and it perks it right back up!!!! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Hairspray is great, especially for fine and thin hair. Not stiff or sticky. Packaging was poor. Came in a bubble type envelope and can was dented in several places.</li>
    <li> do you know how much this spray cost on qvc? ok...19 $ not 45$.</li>
    <li> All Nick&#x27;s hair products are great and work really good and don&#x27;t leave your hair stiff plus it smells good unlike store hair sprays !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have bone straight hair and it gives me lots of volume.  I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> This is the most Heavy Duty ... once in the morning and forget about it hairspray you will ever find...  It will hold with the top down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I was sure I would love this product based on the reviews however it just seem to make my fine hair look very dirty, and didn&#x27;t add any volume whatsoever. It seemed to weigh it down. At $20 a can, I was expecting so much more. Since I won&#x27;t be using it, it was a wasted purchase for me, perhaps the other people who rated it so highly have a different type of hair. My hair is blond, short and rather fine. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to get this product from my niece. It&#x27;s now a daily &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; of styling my hair. Holds without stiff, sticky residue-- LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Good spray, but stops spraying with about 1/6 full. Shame to waste so much money. There should be a new way of getting out product to get your money&#x27;s worth.I will not buy again due to the waste.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use too much. Not heavy or dulling or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Gives just the right body to my straight, fine hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay it really didn&#x27;t give me the volume I wanted it felt like I had dry hairspray on my hair:-(</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray...I have shoulder length thick wavy hair and this gives me added body and control like no other product and it doesn&#x27;t damage my color treated hair. But after I bought this last cannister I&#x27;m done. The cannister is pressurized so highly(or something) that the product doesn&#x27;t last. For the cost and the size this should last a lot longer. (My alternate drugstore Dove hairspray lasts three times as long.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge buyer of $$$ beauty products but I decided to give this a try. Glad I did. It works to hold hair generally in place immediately without feeling heavy or hard. Its effects last too. Very happy.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT SPRAY FOR YOUR HAIR!! IT IS TRULY BODY BUILDING YET IT DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN &amp; KEEPS IT FROM BEING FLAT ON YOUR HEAD.. I HAVE BABY FINE HAIR &amp; THIS WORKS TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT I HAVE VOLUME IN MY HAIR ( WHICH IS NO EASY THING TO DO!) IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE THE SHINE OUT OF MY HAIR &amp; YOU CAN RUN YOUR FINGERS THROUGH YOUR HAIR AFTER SPRAYING.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it because I&#x27;m bald, but the wife loves the stuff !!! and I know she is going to order some more.</li>
    <li> My hair did not feel/look any fuller.  Great as a hair spray, but can get that for less.  My hair just stuck out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it is a great product, HOWEVER $ 45.00 dollars and change it a little high don&#x27;t you think? WOW I do and it is a shame because I use all of his products for my hair and I like them all. I&#x27;ll be looking around now</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy from sellers at amazon, mine came broken and they would not refund or exchange it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product... I LOVE IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely thine, fine, and very little,like baby hair, yet when I use this spray it creates volume and feels soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;My third daughter has abundant long and wavy hair (beautiful) and when she used it, she was amazed, soft yet hold your hair perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> I use a couple of sprays almost every day.  I have fine, limp hair and this works to give a little lift.  No residue when I brush it out.  One can lasts a long time.  I also have a smaller travel size so I won&#x27;t be without it when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hair spray!  Most sprays that provide body and hold leave hair so stiff you can’t get a comb through it.  But this spray provides great body (on wet or dry hair) and still leaves hair soft and comb-able.  I am about 3/4 through my first can, and the nozzle has never clogged once.  I saved money by buying a pack of 3 sprays.</li>
    <li> I had not used the Nick Chavez products before.  I gave this one a shot since I am a hair product junkie.  Wow!  It does just what it promises.  Love the smell, gives my hair body and helps with styling.  I hope this stuff never goes off the market, it is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> This made my hair very very stiff and looked like I was wearing a helmet... But for short hair meant to be spiked, i&#x27;d imagine it would be great. For long hair however, this may not be the best.</li>
    <li> Love this body building hair spray</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a bit skeptical, as so many products CLAIM to give you great volume, but this one really delivers.  It&#x27;s also true that the more you use, the more volume you get, which I need and love.  However, I found that it was gone much quicker than I would have liked, that&#x27;s the only reason for four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can brush your hair after using it and it still keeps the volume and holds really well. I would recommend this product to any women who like volume (hello) without the feeling of a heavy sticky hairspray.</li>
    <li> The website named in my title here put this hairspray up near the top.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so finally ordered it from Amazon for my thinning, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly it took quite a long time to arrive ~ I didn&#x27;t care for that, but  had it been worth waiting for, I might have been more charitable.  In fact, this hairspray is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  It simply doesn&#x27;t last longer than the trip from my dressing table to my car........DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.</li>
    <li> Seems to work like hair spray and helps curls stay in.</li>
    <li> I was surprisingly thrilled with this spray because mostly I get not much from highly touted products.  But it gives hair texture and a bit of endurance throughout the day.  However, if you&#x27;re after a strong hold , keep looking.  This is not for that.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using it as part of my daily hair routine for a long time. Wouldnt want to be without it. A great way to style hair even on a bad hair day!</li>
    <li> This is a good hairspray, better than most, but does not put body into my fine hair. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a body builder, just a spray to keep my style in place. It is a nice spray, not sticky, not smelly.</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago, mistakenly thought it was more of a post-blow dry air volumizer, and hated it.  Turns out I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly, or at least not for my needs.  Now, after towel drying, I spray a little around the crown while my hair is still damp, then blow dry.  It adds a little lift and volume.  Not tremendous, but also not sticky or dirty looking.  It&#x27;s a good base for later styling.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product....the very best product for fine, limp hair...can be used on both wet or dry hair...be sure to work it in before styling !!!  The more times you use, the thicker your hair becomes !!!!</li>
    <li> If you hate all those girls with thick amazing hair, here is your revenge.  My only disappointment is how long I waited to order this.</li>
    <li> Really great for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> My favorite! Love Nick Chavez products!</li>
    <li> THERE IS NOT ANOTHER PRODUCT ON THIS PLANET THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND MORE HIGHLY THAN THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR FINE HAIR.  IF YOUR HAIR IS FINE AND STICK STRAIGHT, NEEDING BODY, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> Bottom line....the ONLY hairspray that will give you body AND hold but still get a brush thru, if you live in a humid environment. I am fully addicted to this stuff...my hair is super fine, baby like, silky and blonde, can break easily and this stuff is so good to my hair..I have been using it for over 10 yrs...I never let myself run out...if I do I have VERY flat hair...and it&#x27;s NOT a pretty sight. This stuff is in my arsenal....can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> good price and product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now.  I have thin hair and by using it it actually makes the hair feel thicker.  I would recommend it to everyone!  Totally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> You will not go wrong with this purchase.  A little goes a long way. Worth every penny.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six or seven years, ever since I say it on QVC.  I love this body builder.  Its better than any other product that I have ever used, and the reason why...is because I can use it for two to three days without my hair getting hard, stiff or unmanageable.  I have tried other sprays that claim to give you volume, hold and body, but my hair is too stiff...and when I go to use the comb in my hair the next day it feels like someone has slightly glued my hair together.  I dont like that feeling because that means more washing.  I will never use another product for volume because they just dont work for me.  I am very very pleased and will not be with out it.  The alcohol levels in this product is perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hairspray.  It does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair spray for several years, and find it works for me.  I try not to run out of it.</li>
