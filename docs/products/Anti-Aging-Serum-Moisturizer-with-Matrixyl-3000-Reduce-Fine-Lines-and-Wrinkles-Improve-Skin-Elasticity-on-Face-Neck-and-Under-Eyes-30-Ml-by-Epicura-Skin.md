<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a nice product and I am very happy with the results.  I normally am VERY cautious about any type of lotion I put on my skin, but decided to try this.  It is great!! My skin is smooth and the wrinkles are definitely much less than they were. Thank you for providing a great product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing using this cream!. I have sensitive skin &amp; I love how light &amp; refreshing this is feels on my skin, It reduces wrinkles while boosting the collagen in my skin. I swear my husband says I look 10 years younger &amp; all my friends have complimented on my flawless skin. I highly recommend the complete line of Epicura Skin care products, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My face looks brighter and I can tell a difference in fine lines!  Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product seems good nothing special. Got it for promotional price bUT don&#x27;t think I would repurchase even with discount.</li>
    <li> Good product and will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Great anti-aging moisturizer! Being in my 30s, I figured it&#x27;s time to start finding anti-aging products and take better care of my skin. This moisturizer is hyrating and makes my skin feel smooth and soft afterwards. I love that it helps stimulates collagen and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin have more of a glow to it. Very thin light weight cream. I&#x27;ve applied it every morning prior to putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> STRANGE AS IT SEEMS, IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
    <li> I have bought Epicura eye serum three times and love how it works.  I found Epicura Rejuve and thought I would give it a try.  I love this product too.  These products work.</li>
    <li> i love this serum , omg i want to order some more , but the price is go up ,so sad ...</li>
    <li> I already am a huge fan of Epicura products and find that they really work and do what they&#x27;re suppose to do. I decided to give the Rejuve Anti Aging Serum Moisturizer a chance because I really needed something to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles that just make me look so much older than I already am! It only took a few days of continuous use for me to see such a noticeable difference! The fine lines on my forehead, around my mouth, and around my eyes were starting to diminish and I could tell that I was finally looking not only my age, but much younger as well! I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe that this works as well as it does! No plastic surgery for me when I have this!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Can even put makeup over it after a few minutes. First product like this I have tried, so can&#x27;t rate against others. The amount in a bottle is disappointing. Wish there were more, but a it was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very amazing product presented and packaged in a beautiful and easy to use bottle. I give this product 5-Stars because in my opinion it deserves it. Epicura&#x27;s Rejuve is not too greasy and also absorbs very easily and completely in a short period of time. I have seen results already using this product and would recommend it to anybody. If other products are letting you down I highly recommend you give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh. I was a complete skeptic after trying dozens of anti-wrinkle creams, and after a week, I thought I saw a change in my wrinkles, but I chalked it up to wishful thinking. I got an email from a nice customer service gal who asked how it was going so far. I told her the above. After another week, and another email from customer service checking in on me, I thought it truly was working, but it still wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to make me KNOW it was working. I&#x27;m on week 3 1/2 and I just finished a bottle, using it religiously, and more than 2x/day some days, and I finally used my magnification mirror to put on makeup. I hadn&#x27;t used it in weeks. Wow!! I was blown away! I could really tell how much my wrinkles have diminished, most notably, my neck and upper lip. But, forehead, sides and under eyes are definitely diminished, as well. Amazing. I&#x27;m a true believer, and have just bought 2 more bottles. When I received some nice emails from customer service, I have to say that I was impressed and convinced that, if the company actually is opening themselves up to responses and comments, it MUST work. If it didn&#x27;t,  they would want to avoid the public. We&#x27;ll done, Epicura!</li>
    <li> I only gave fournstars because the bottle is pretty small. But the product itself is beyond wonderful! I started to see results right away!</li>
    <li> I got this very quickly as I have a Prime membership but it arrived safely and honestly it says its a serum on amazon yet the packaging says its a cream. The texture is more like a thin non runny cream. It applied evenly and DID leave a bit of residue on my face however after only using this 3x the fine lines on my upper lip that were starting to form and around the creases of my eyes (i am 35 almost 36) are no longer there so yes this actually does work and fast! I plan on using this for a long time but so far it has been the only cream ive used that has completely plumped up my skin and gotten rid of my lines so there has to be something to that. Definitely worth the cash!</li>
    <li> Using every or every other day. My forehead and smile lines have faded. I&#x27;ve used other products but this has been the best to date.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to the results in another 30 days!</li>
    <li> After three days of using it 2 people complimented me on how I looked.  It goes on smooth and feels great.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and I love it. I&#x27; have some jawless creeping up on me. In only a few days I could see the difference they are not as noticeable anymore.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it yesterday morning when I woke up, after using the product for 4 days the lines around my mouth, and neck were totally gone.  I have to use a face oil derma E, A and E before I use it because it goes on dry but wow does it work.  The lines around my eyes and between brows are fading, can&#x27;t wait another week to see if they go away, I look 43 again and I am 53.  I thought it was imagination but I broke out the magnifying mirror and didn&#x27;t see the usual lines.  I am more than pleased.</li>
    <li> I can tell you that I have spent thousands of dollars on various products &amp; procedures and never, ever had the results I am seeing from Epicura Rejuve face cream.  I just ordered a bunch more so i never run out plus ordered the eye cream and am very excited to try that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and I am seeing changes in the areas under my eyes and cheeks where I apply it.  The fine lines are decreasing and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I am very happ with my purchase and the wonderful service by Epicura.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face serum! It&#x27;s great with fine lines and even seems to have changed the texture of my skin making it smoother, super soft. I can&#x27;t go a day without it. I even use it around my eyes. It comes out of the bottle like a lotion but absorbs right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a number of anti aging creams and serum recently.  Gotta stay looking good, right?  I decided to try Epicura Rejuve based on the reviews.  I gotta agree with them all.  This stuff works.  Just know that it takes awhile.  I was hoping for a magic bullet.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t exist huh?  It fully took about 15 to 20 days of everyday use.  Then I begin noticing the lines around my lips getting fainter.  Also my crow&#x27;s feet, I hate those, getting softer.  My husband even said something nice.  I recommend this product but only if you have patience to wait for the results.</li>
    <li> My fourth bottle.  No miracles,  but it works.  It really minimizes fine wrinkles to give my face a fresher look.  I helps to tighten up my neck too.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth texture.. smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;Skin is soft, looking forward for wrinkles to disappear, will be back for more to get the results I want.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for only a week and I already see an improvement in the deep horizontal wrinkles on my forehead.  Also my laugh lines are less noticeable.  The directions say to use twice daily, but I&#x27;ve only been using it at night, and so far I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of the anti-aging skincare products from Epicura Skin for my mom.  I figured I could not go wrong with them since the company guarantees their products and results in so many ways!  My mom gets so busy that skincare is just not high on her priority list, so I wanted to do something nice for her.  And I really hit a jackpot with these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom loves them because they are very easy to use.  A little goes a long way, she told me, so even if she forgets to use them every morning and evening, her skin stays soft and well moisturized.  I can definitely tell a difference.  Her face does not look as dry as it used to from just a week ago.  I&#x27;d expect her wrinkles (there aren&#x27;t that many, mom) to start fading away too.  In fact, she thought I should start using it too for my frown lines.  :)</li>
    <li> To be honest the only difference I see with my skin is that there are no newer wrinkles. I do like the feel of this creme on my face. Most likely I will continue to use for an extended period of time just to see if it will definitely prevent new wrinkles from appearing. Sometimes people want to believe that they look younger using cremes but there really is no miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion.  It improves the overall condition of my skin, and I saw fine lines diminish.  The scent is subtle and pleasant to me.  I plan to continue using it  for the &#x27;long run&#x27;, despite discovering that the &#x27;full 60 day supply&#x27; printed on the bottle was for me a bit shorter than six weeks, and I do not ;slather&#x27; it on  But no matter....I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I noticed results right away, but didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I had used it for a while. Let me tell you...this stuff works! I will not be without it...ever! It really does firm up the skin and is great all over the face, even the delicate eye and neck area. Fine lines are disappearing! My skin looks better than it has in a really long time. The customer service is fabulous, too.</li>
    <li> I have only used this moisturizer for 4 days and already my face looks and feels fresher and brighter!  I can&#x27;t wait to see after a month of using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few Epicura Skin products before for my mother and she&#x27;s really enjoying them. I&#x27;d definitely recommend you buy their products as a present for your girlfriend or mom. Even if you don&#x27;t find their products useful, they have a 100% Money Back Guarantee.</li>
    <li> This product is great for all skin types. It reduces fine lines and wrinkles while replenishing your skin&#x27;s collagen leaving skin soft and beautiful. Epicura is designed for both men and women and contains natural ingredients. It&#x27;s also paraben free and non-toxic.  A wonderful product to reduce under eye puffiness for more rejuvenated skin. If you&#x27;re tired of spending money on similar products like Eucerin or OLAY with poor results, try Epicura today!</li>
    <li> The Epicura Skin Rejuve Anti Aging Serum was purchased on a whim.  However you can feel it moisturizing and tightening your skin.  It does not have any kind of perfume smell which is wonderful.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Matrixyl 3000 for a long time and have really liked it.  But in this formulation not at all.  It broke my skin out at the end of the first day and it was very sticky.  Just wouldn&#x27;t absorb or dry so I couldn&#x27;t use either a foundation (slipped off) or mineral powder (looked like chalk).  It might work for some, just not me.</li>
    <li> I actually got all of the facial creams in this line and decided to wait at least 6 weeks before reviewing&lt;br /&gt;All of these work well, I have increased skin clarity and noticed less fine wrinkles. My skin appears brighter and as a result any makeup I use looks better and I use less.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have some breakouts with skin products but not with this line, will continue to use as my skin gets better over time</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for redness and Rosacea and I have been using it for about a week. I can already seem a little bit of difference in the redness! Nothing else has worked so far so fingers crossed! It feels amazing on my skin as well.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Rejuve for a couple of weeks, but I am very happy with the results so far.  I have used several different moisturizers in the past, but have not found any that work as promised and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes (even the ones that claim to be fragrance free).  This product does not bother my eyes at all.  The cream glides on silky smooth (not sticky at all) and is absorbed instantly.  Already my lines and wrinkles are fading (even the stubborn ones between my brows and around my mouth) and my skin looks and feels tighter, softer and healthier. I just ordered another bottle and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Good product ! the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I think it is doing a pretty good job.  It&#x27;s easily absorbable.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hello everyone this is the best product you will ever find out there I guaranty it! It does exactly what it says. I have an unbelievably sensitive skin (like crazy sensitive to the point that I can&#x27;t bring any king of lotion next to my face not even &#x27;&#x27;dermatologist recommended&#x27;&#x27; stuff)  and every other product I used made me break out within the first days of use. I have been using this anti aging cream for more than a month now and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! NO BREAK OUTS WHAT SO EVER!!!! And the fine lines under my eyes, gone. I use to get wrinkles on the side of my eyes when I smile and that&#x27;s also gone. The puffiness under my eyes gone even the the dark circles under my eyes are gone! My face is much much brighter and I smile more now because bye bye wrinkles! My face looks healthy and hydrated :))) If you want a faster result use it twice dayly once at night before going to bed and once in the morning before make up. You will love your face after using this product! I&#x27;m definitely buying more I will never go without it ever. Thank you so so much for making this product I love you all for that! I wish I had taken a picture of my face before and after. But I didn&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t think it would work. In fact I was skeptical to the point that I bought it and let it seat in my bathroom for more than a month because I was 100% sure it make break out.  I want to write more but my baby girl is crying I have to attend to her. Please don&#x27;t stop making this product. :))))</li>
    <li> My skin feels so much softer since I have been using this. I am so happy that I was able to try this product for my honest review because it is amazing! I like that it contains natural ingredients and does not contain parabens. I will not use products that contain parabens even if they are the best products in the world, so this is very important to me. I am in my late 40s and I notice more and more fine lines and damage from the sun on my face. I like that this moisturizer restores my natural collagen and makes my face feel firmer. I only have to use one pump and it&#x27;s enough to cover my entire face. It has a wonderful light peppermint smell which I really enjoy! It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated which I definitely need during these winter months. My skin really does look younger after using this and I am looking forward to seeing even more results the longer that I use it.</li>
    <li> Hi! I apologize that it has taken me so long to reply. However, I just want to say that the product is absolutely wonderful. Therefore, I use it sparely ever single day. Consequently, I no longer have to spend unnecessary money trying to find the right product, thank you for being honest and making a product that really does works.</li>
    <li> I use 2 x day...really can see the difference in fine lines</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I needed a serum that that would work, but wasn&#x27;t going to break my bank. I have really dry skin and have spent a ton of money on department store serums just trying to find the right product for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light-weight anti-aging serum sinks right into the skin and makes it feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It is odorless and not at all oily after you apply it.You can put your makeup over it and I even noticed when you do, your makeup lasts longer.  After using this serum for a few weeks, I am really happy with the overall results! The lines around my eyes have softened a lot and my skin has smoothed out noticeably. I recommend this product highly for the quality and the price.</li>
    <li> You can really see the skin improvement, eve if you put it on you hands, it has a menthol feeling on your skin it looks younger</li>
    <li> I really think this is a fantastic product! I haven&#x27;t been using it all that long, maybe about a week. I look in the mirror and I&#x27;m loving what I see in this 58 yr. old face. I feel that my skin looks younger and smoother and I just feel more beautiful. This is the best product Iv&#x27;e used and believe me I&#x27;ve used a lot! the only problem I have is with the pump, which malfunctions at times. Sometimes I have to take off the top completely to get to the cream. But I really love it. It even seems to be helping with crepiness in my neck, which is super hard to get rid of. I&#x27;m wondering if I should order the eye cream. Would it work better on the lines under my eyes? Anyway I would recommend this cream to anyone and everyone. It is so well worth the price. I will have to order more. I wish it came in big, big, bigger bottles. Whatever you do, DO NOT stop making this product.</li>
    <li> After using this wonderful anti-aging skin care product the very first time I was impressed! It smells great and you can feel it tightening as it dries. My skin was firmer in just five minutes, and it only gets better with repeated use! I know that I am gushing here, but you really have to try it for yourself and see the results. Unlike other products that claim to reduce wrinkles, this product does not leave any white flakes on your skin and can be used under makeup.</li>
    <li> This cream makes your skin feel very velvety and so smooth. Goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.  No noticeable odor at all. Used it in the morning and at bedtime and seems to be doing something already with fine lines.  In fact, I could feel a little tingling (not unpleasant at all, just slightly) after applying it which to me is telling me its doing something!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for about 3 week now and even though I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference in wrinkle improvement, I do love how it feels. I will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I Love has this Serum makes my skin feel very suppl and Firm and the lines are smoothing out, Non greasy nor is it sticky, has a Light fresh scent,does not Irritate skin, If my Hubby noticed a Change in my skin then this is the product for me Im in Love</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is really nice! It had a great lightweight texture and made my skin feel so soft! I felt like my skin was rejuvenated after using this for a week! So happy to have been sent it for review!</li>
    <li> This made my skin look and feel amazing.  I am always looking for the latest skin care/moisturizer on the market because I&#x27;m always trying to make my skin look younger (just being honest).  I could see a difference in the overall smoothness of my skin after using this.  I like the way my skin feels.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Dear Mia; As promised, here is my assessment  of Rejuve. After using it for more than a week, I can say that it has improved my many blemishes around my face, neck, and ears. I am an 81 year old male with many skin blemishes to deal with. It remains to be seen if Rejuve is worth what it costs. Living on social security doesn&#x27;t allow much room for luxuries. Come on spring!!!! George Murdaugh.</li>
    <li> The product seems fine, perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell, but the delivery system is useless.  Within 3 pumps the pump no longer works on the bottle. I had read this in other reviews but was hoping that it was just a fluke.  There is no tube going to the bottom of the bottle so how could the pump possibly work? Frustrating.  I figured out how to get the product out of the bottle by storing it upside down and holding it upside down in my hand, then pushing down on bottle (kind of a reverse pump) and will use as much as I can of it that way, but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference</li>
    <li> Great product that makes your skin look and feel younger, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product feels very rejuvenating on the skin and it smells wonderful. I recommended the product to a friend and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few days. Goes on easily.</li>
    <li> This serum moisturizer has a nice light, creamy texture, it&#x27;s not a clear liquid serum but a cream. It goes on smoothly and does not have a noticeable scent. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and a little goes a long way.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-aging affects but it does moisturize, is light and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. When I remember to take this supplement, along with my new diet based on my food sensitivities, I find I&#x27;ve a lot less bloating and gas. I wish I could say more, but promise to update as time goes on. These dietary changes take more than a week or two to fully realize and comprehend! Be Well.</li>
    <li> Made my sking look very moist and soft, like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Rejuve on September 23 and received it within two or three days.  It is October 8, and I have definitely noticed a difference in the quality and texture of my skin.  It looks much more vibrant and awake, as opposed to the often tired look I see.  Also, the lines on my forehead are not as deep and apparent as they once were.    I really love the way this product absorbs into my skin - while leaving a nice glow to my complexion.  What I am really impressed with, above all, is the continued improvement of my skin&#x27;s condition as I use the product twice a day (in the morning and at night, before bed).  The fact that it is producing long-term benefits to my skin is a major plus.  Definitely a product I will continue to use for the long-run.    S.B.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! The biggest thing I notice after only a few days is a reduction in pore size and the appearance of fine lines. I have had some stubborn lines across the bridge of my nose between my eyes, and they&#x27;re already greatly reduced. Skin tone looks more even and the texture of my skin is butter-soft. Not heavy or sticky -- I like that!</li>
    <li> I read about different things that can help rejuvenate skin and reduce wrinkles and found this product online. I used it 5 days and amazingly could see that some of the deepness of the wrinkles by my eyes and mouth were already reduced.  We were traveling and I didn&#x27;t use it for a month but started using it when we got home. It seems like I started over with the results but after a month or 2 was back to noticing less lines by my mouth and eyes!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot--it does all it says and at way less the cost than similar products. Not only will I continue ordering and using this product but am going to try the eye cream as well. My face feels smooth and looks great.</li>
    <li> I was very happy and extremely satisfied with this product! After a few days, I could tell that the fine lines on my neck and eyes were almost gone! Completed vanished! I continued to use this product for quite a while afterwards and I am still so happy with the outcome and with the results. I can definitely vouch for this and I am living proof that it definitely works and you definitely see the results very quickly!</li>
    <li> Love this amazing serum!!!!!!!! I could not wait to get it,I read about it in a magazine.so far,so good!!light smell,feels soft and smooth on skin,soaks in right away.I would love to try the entire line!!! My skin tends to be sensitive to wrinkle creams,however,I have had NO side effects.i will DEFINATELY recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really started noticing a difference in the appearance and texture of my skin within a week .Feels and looks wonderful. Pores are smaller . Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother in-law and she loves it! she said she can already see a difference and she has only been using it for couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money in the past on facial skin care products because they rarely do everything that I want. In fact, I have a whole drawer full of products I have discarded and need to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend told me about Rejuve by Epicura Skin and I actually bought this product and their Quench product based on my friends recommendation. She loved it&#x27;s performance and was raving about the new Matrixl ingredient. Wow! I think the product is great and you don&#x27;t have to use very much daily to see results. My skin is glowing. And it has been less than a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the nice surprises is the great tips they are sending me and the follow up to be sure I am happy with the product. Top notch customer service. They offer a 90 day money back guarantee, which is nice, but I won&#x27;t be needing it. This product is a keeper and works just like they said.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum because I saw it voted as one of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; anti aging serums on paulaschoice.com.  I didn&#x27;t have an Amazon account so I used my husbands.  I was sick of spend upwards of $75 to $100 at department stores for serums that didn&#x27;t do what they claim.  I almost gave up but I figured I would give Rejuve a chance since it was highly rated and relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Rejuve twice a day for three weeks and I have begun to notice a change in my skin.  It&#x27;s more refined and feels smoother and plumper. It took about three weeks of use to start seeing a difference.  It&#x27;s not magic and there are no miracles.  However, my skin does looks healthier.  My sister noticed it over lunch which was nice.  I like how it is fragrance-free.  I don&#x27;t need any more chemicals on me.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and leaves no film.  Once it&#x27;s on, you can&#x27;t tell there&#x27;s anything on it.  I like that a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m happy with Rejuve.  This bottle should last about 2 months.  A nice bargain really compare to Macy&#x27;s or other mall stores.  I will try to remember to come back and update this in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B00EDNIA0M.&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle thru a friend and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing when I saw the free bottle for my honest review I was happy to give it  try it u will love the results</li>
    <li> It was a nice moisturizer,.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuve for a few days and so far so good! It smells lovely and feels&lt;br /&gt;very nice on my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy, which is important to me because my skin is on the oily side. This really is a bargain when you compare it to department store brands.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuve nightly for 5 nights so far, including once after peel and once after microdermabrasion all over my face, including around eyes - works really well. gets absorbed easily, moisturizing, fading fine lines. looking forward to using it longer. I have sensitive skin - no problems so far.</li>
    <li> I received it on Thursday and have been using every night. I am 53 and was getting creases above my nose and on my forehead also on each side of my mouth, laugh lines as they say. I could feel them with my fingers. Now I can barely feel them. I feel a little tingling when I first apply it so I know its doing something. I had a hysterectomy  when I was in my 30ies so I have no ovaries so I know my collegen is probably nil and I take care of my skin and have tried many things. I am very excited and amazed on how fast and well this product is working. I will be telling my sisters about this for sure. I am happy I decided to take the chance and order 2. I just hope its always available and it this price because I plan on using it forever.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make you break out!! And its small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> after two weeks I could notice on my pictures smoother skin, doesn&#x27;t help me with the brown spots but helps with large pores</li>
    <li> I loved this serum because of the smooth texture. It has a nice minty, refreshing scent. I use it under my foundation and it makes a nice base. The product is the best on the market considering the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to write until I gave it a fair try.  It&#x27;s just ok.  Customer service is fabulous; I will give them that.  My first shipment came in damaged (product packaging is flimsy) so they sent me another right away and let me keep the first one.  That being said, there is no way this is a full 60 day supply.  The product goes on very dry and I have to use 2 full pumps to feel hydrated (face &amp; neck).  I&#x27;m already more that half way through the bottle and I&#x27;ve only had it for 22 days.  I have normal skin.  There are better products out there for the same price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  It arrived within a couple days of ordering.  I like the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on.  Too soon to know how it works but I am very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels light and I&#x27;m very pleased with the effect on my skin. I use Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C underneath.</li>
    <li> So I have only been using the product for about a week but I can honestly say that so far I really love it. It seems to be reducing redness and making my face very smooth. I went to get my eyebrows waxed and my aesthetician asked what I was using. That&#x27;s after only a few days. If it continues to work as it is so far I will definitely repurchase and tell my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using Epicura for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I have been receiving compliments that I wasn’t receiving before.&lt;br /&gt;People has asked me if I have lost weight - I haven’t&lt;br /&gt;People tell me I look well rested - I am not&lt;br /&gt;People say that it looks like I am dealing with less stress - HAHAHAHAAHAHAH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this period, I have only done one thing new - EPICURA</li>
    <li> Have used and feel that this product actually works well with continued use.</li>
    <li> This is really amazing! It works and its noticeable the diference after few days using it. A bit expensive, but its worth!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on skin but so far I can&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t bother my skin and it felt nice not sticky. products from the drugstore are just as good in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of so called moisturizers that have grand claims but this one delivers!</li>
    <li> Great for sun block. And it lasted a long time</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best!! I use it After putting the&amp;#34;Quench&amp;#34;on my face. It is the most wonderful product I have ever used. It erases the wrinkles, gives my skin a nice glow. Before and after pictures prove it!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the product. My skin feels great and looks dewy and supple.</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time as promised.  I really like the consistency of it so far, but too soon to notice any difference.  I will try to remark in a couple of weeks re any noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product works! I use it under my eyes and on my neck. It does not cause skin irritation. It is much less expensive than MANY other similar products I have tried.</li>
</ol>
