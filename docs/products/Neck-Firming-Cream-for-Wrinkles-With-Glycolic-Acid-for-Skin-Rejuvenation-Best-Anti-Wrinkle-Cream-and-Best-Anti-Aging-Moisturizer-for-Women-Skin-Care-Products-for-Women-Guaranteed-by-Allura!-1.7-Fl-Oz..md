      <li>Price is also cheap, the product is also more than expected seller willing to very kindly answering&lt;br /&gt;Please buy good things comfortably</li>
      <li>and so this cream is geared towards mnimizing the fine lines and wrinkles and delivering visible results within 30 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Neck Cream also contains malic acid which also helps to smooth fine lines and tightens skins, as well as Aloe, Coconut Oil and Argan Oil which all help to moisturize the skin.  </li>
      <li>I got this product for free as part of a promotion.</li>
      <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
      <li>Over time, I have noticed that my skin on my neck is so smooth and tighter than it was before.</li>
      <li>so I can see results, but so far so good</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product for about 10 days and noticed immediately that my skin felt light silky smooth, this cream has a wonderful smell, its nice and light without being overly perfumed andthe scent isn’t long lasting at all.  </li>
      <li>As well as those lovely little lines we all get around lips and mouth as well as those great lines in your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was not expecting much but after the first week my skin feels better, very smooth</li>
      <li>The product is super creamy and silky smooth when going on.</li>
      <li>cream itself is feels light on your skin and absorbs quickly leaving no greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I only use it at night because the scent, although pleasant, doesn&#x27;t always mix well when wearing perfume.</li>
      <li>Love the way this makes my neck feel- very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great way to fight the sagging and double-chin look by keeping the skin tight and smooth.</li>
      <li>Love the texture and working so far!!</li>
      <li>I have tried the most expensive growth factor serums, obagi lotions ect ect and am happy to say I love this cream and how it feels on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Smells pretty good, only need a dime size to spread around.</li>
      <li>This neck firming, anti wrinkle cream is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t use much to cover area.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fast into your skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>BUT my neck does feel tighter &amp;the cream is light and moisturizing which is a Definite Most on the neck...</li>
      <li>As far as the wrinkles I need more time to indicate its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m really happy with my results so far.</li>
      <li>I received this complimentary from the seller for my unbiased opinion</li>
      <li>and she said she loves it, and only uses this kind for now on.</li>
      <li>Also if you look at the ingredient list, you will find that most of the ingredients are organic and easily identifiable.</li>
      <li>The Allura cream has a non-greasy, light texture,smells great, and seems to be working better than Dr. Perricone&#x27;s cream to make lines on my neck look less visible, although it will take more time to see dramatic results.</li>
      <li>And this one is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Is more like a younger skin.</li>
      <li>And with the guarantee that Allura offers and the price, if your concerned with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on your neck, then I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dries up really quickly and leaves my neck really soft.  </li>
      <li>My neck is super soft after applying it.</li>
      <li>I think for the price this is a very decent neck cream to help combat an aging neck.</li>

    <li> good item  , my wrinkles is disappear</li>
    <li> Price is also cheap, the product is also more than expected seller willing to very kindly answering&lt;br /&gt;Please buy good things comfortably</li>
    <li> Smell is good. But i don&#x27;t know how is it work.</li>
    <li> The Allura Anti-Aging Neck Cream helps to reduces the appearance of wrinkles, lines, and those icky neck skin lines.  It will also reverse the sign of premature wrinkles and helps to hydrate the thin skin of the neck while removing dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it in other areas on your face where the skin is thin such as around your eyes. As well as those lovely little lines we all get around lips and mouth as well as those great lines in your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who constantly has what my kids call “butt crack forehead” where when I am stressed the skin between my eyebrows  wrinkles up, I have noticed that I am developing some lines.  I have one of two choices, stop stressing as much HA HA HA or start using a wrinkle reducing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Allura Neck Cream, the glycolic acid which absorbs into the skin to exfoliate the upper layers of skin and removes the dead skin that is trapped just under the surface, which helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neck Cream also contains malic acid which also helps to smooth fine lines and tightens skins, as well as Aloe, Coconut Oil and Argan Oil which all help to moisturize the skin.  Vitamin E and Shea Butter help to soothe the skin from irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly like the fact that there is no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. As well as the fact that their products are never tested on animals.  Also if you look at the ingredient list, you will find that most of the ingredients are organic and easily identifiable. I always worry when I am putting things on my skin that I am not familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is feels light on your skin and absorbs quickly leaving no greasy feeling.  Without the parabens there is never a waxy feel either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product for about 10 days and noticed immediately that my skin felt light silky smooth, this cream has a wonderful smell, its nice and light without being overly perfumed andthe scent isn’t long lasting at all.  I look forward to using it longer and seeing just how well it works. And with the guarantee that Allura offers and the price, if your concerned with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on your neck, then I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review with no promise of a favorable review on my behalf**</li>
    <li> Wife is trying this product and she loves how it smells and feels on her..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make any difference</li>
    <li> nothing to write home about it. Maybe I got a defective one? My cream has the texture of spoiled milk. It&#x27;s not smooth so not sure. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> it did not help me at all.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my co-worker, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything me for me</li>
    <li> I definitely saw a difference after using this for just a couple weeks. I didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; but that spot that&#x27;s most disturbing where the loose skin started to form at the top of my neck is practically gone. I only use it at night because the scent, although pleasant, doesn&#x27;t always mix well when wearing perfume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s case looks very luxury. Moreover, cream is not too dry nor oily. The best thing I really satisfied with it is its good scent.</li>
    <li> I am always in the market to try new anti anging creams and serums.  I have tried the most expensive growth factor serums, obagi lotions ect ect and am happy to say I love this cream and how it feels on my skin.  I have been using for about a week now and will make this one a staple.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice neck cream thick and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Applies well and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;No strong scent either.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and silky .</li>
    <li> Allura Anti-Aging Neck Cream contains organic ingredients including Argan Oil, an oil I&#x27;ve come to rely on for both my face and my hair. I like that this cream isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks in quickly and leaves my neck feeling nice and hydrated. While I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any signs of aging on my neck, I don&#x27;t want to start either.  I&#x27;m rather thankful to have found this cream as I hadn&#x27;t thought about an aging neck before.&lt;br /&gt;I received product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and working so far!!</li>
    <li> Greasy.Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of money on face creams and this a great one for the price</li>
    <li> This is one of the smoothest creams i have ever used.Great product, great price, no reason to look any further!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days now.  I love the scent and texture.  It dries up really quickly and leaves my neck really soft.  It&#x27;s not sticky or thick.  As far as the wrinkles I need more time to indicate its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Awesome product at first I thought it was a regular old moisturizer but after 2 uses I see a difference my neck is firmer and smoother</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my neck feel- very moisturizing. Plus the light scent is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who recently mentioned she didn&#x27;t like have &amp;#34;saggy&amp;#34; her neck is looking now that she&#x27;s in her mid 50s  She seems to be enjoying it so far- it&#x27;s a very generous sized container, the texture of the cream is nice &amp; silky (not greasy) &amp; feels like a more experience moisturizing product.I chose this cream especially because it only uses all natural ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil and has no parabens and fillers. Mom&#x27;s very happy &amp; that means I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> quite an improvement in my skin, I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Did you know your neck is the first area that usually shows signs of aging along with your hands? And the neck is actually overlooked a lot when it comes to anti-aging creams or moisturizers. The neck doesn&#x27;t have fatty tissues this makes the skin less elastic. Because the skin on the neck is so delicate it can become far more wrinkled, saggy, and pigmented than that on our face looks. And overlooking our neck and neglect we can have a flawless face because we give it attention but all of a sudden when gravity takes over we have a very aged neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So it&#x27;s best to take preventive measures as well for our neck. Giving it the same amount of attention we do to our face. One of the main reasons I love this neck cream is because it has neck cream because it has glycolic acid, which happens to be an excellent exfoliater. It also has some other amazing organic natural ingredients such as argan oil, coconut oil and has no parabens and other chemical fillers that we just don&#x27;t need on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The product is super creamy and silky smooth when going on. And a little bit goes a long way as well. You always want to apply your moisturizer in and upward motion. Remember how I said that our neck lacks those fatty tissues making it less elastic. Pulling downwards on your skin will just make it sag more. Any time you work on your neck. Always use upward motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have for sure seen a huge difference when using this product. I do feel that my skin is staying tighter. I am only 37, but I started noticing deep wrinkles in my neck as well as it started to look a little bit droopy as well. I think for the price this is a very decent neck cream to help combat an aging neck. I have seen some pretty expensive creams out there. And this one is very reasonable. I received this product complimentary​ in exchange for inspection and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It is just okay. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t do any damage; I just didn&#x27;t see any benefit.</li>
    <li> I received the cream but it was all melted and poured out as soon as I opened.  Lost almost all of it.  There should have been another top on it to prevent this.  Paid too much money for it to melt and pour out like that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer and not sticky at all. So far I love it. My neck is super soft after applying it. Too early to tell yet if my wrinkles will disappear.</li>
    <li> good quality!! exceeds my expectations!!</li>
    <li> This cream works better than those 3 times more expensive that I have used over the years.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful consistency. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This neck firming, anti wrinkle cream is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t use much to cover area. Smells pretty good, only need a dime size to spread around. This is something you need to use daily to see any results. My neighbor took this off my hands and she said she loves it, and only uses this kind for now on. The results were better than the past ones were. She noticed results after 2 weeks after using it morning and night. The container that sits in the jar is deep and pretty round so you will have months of use out of it!</li>
    <li> Not sure its getting better this early in the game BUT my neck does feel tighter &amp;the cream is light and moisturizing which is a Definite Most on the neck...</li>
    <li> the scent and the quality is amazing, so happy to have tried this product, improves my skin and leaves it SO soft!</li>
    <li> my mother want to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Firms up my skin super quick!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Haven&#x27;t really seen much difference in firmness.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell. I&#x27;ll have to update my review once I try it a bit longer so I can see results, but so far so good</li>
    <li> I love the satisfied products</li>
    <li> I am a physician, and i&#x27;m very picky about the products I use. I purchased this neck cream because it has glycolic acid, which is an excellent exfoliator and ton of organic ingredients, including organic argan oil which is something I use every day on my skin and hair with terrific results. I like this firming cream much better than Perricone MD firming Neck Therapy product I had been using that cost around  $100 The Allura cream has a non-greasy, light texture,smells great, and seems to be working better than Dr. Perricone&#x27;s cream to make lines on my neck look less visible, although it will take more time to see dramatic results. I am happy with my results so far, and I plan to continue using it because it works and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging of this product.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is designed to help moisturize as well as minimize lines&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to fight the sagging and double-chin look by keeping the skin tight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Pretty good neck firming cream. I have three mildly deep lines on my neck that are slowly starting to go away when I started using this product. It may take longer if you have deep lines. You don&#x27;t need that much of the product at all so it will last you awhile. It absorbs fast into your skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It is not a thick cream. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with my results so far. I got this product for free as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> Is more like a younger skin.</li>
    <li> It has a nice ,light texture and is absorbed vey well but unfortunately after using the product for several weeks I have not seen any difference in the condition of my neck.</li>
    <li> So luxurious! This cream smells and feel like a high quality expensive neck cream with out the price tag! I received this complimentary from the seller for my unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Very thin cream, notice no difference after several weeks.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference immediately.  It feels good, my neck is firmer.  It works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok at best. Leaves skin soft but does not appear to tighten at all. Used Shiseido before it it did a much&lt;br /&gt;better job at making the skin appear tighter.</li>
    <li> very usally in my life thx</li>
    <li> being that I have only used this cream a few nights, I have not seen any changes as of today. it is very creamy, smooth with a pleasant scent. i don&#x27;t believe it will do the same as the previous cream i was using. i plan to use on my face rather than my neck.  i will not order again.</li>
    <li> Works good and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell  I like this because it has great ingredients</li>
    <li> Good quality. Recommended. And I would love to buy again.</li>
    <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great item, just like description, what i want.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks. I am not noticing a big difference but my skin feels smoother</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we get older the skin begins to wrinkle and sag and what do we do? We spend countless dollars on trying to preserve our youth with the help of bottles and potions and the extreme of surgery. This Allura neck cream for anti-aging is a 1.7 fl oz and sells on Amazon for $24. The size is not very large but with a little cream going a long way this should last you for awhile. The neck is usually the first spot that begins to age and so this cream is geared towards mnimizing the fine lines and wrinkles and delivering visible results within 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product made in the USA is FDA registered and is backed with a 90 day guarantee. The Glycolic acid inside this jar provides an exfoliate to go under the damaged skin and destroy the dead skin cells while tightening and infusing the neck with Organic Aloe, Coconut Oil, and Argan Oil all organic to hydrate and smooth for a youthful appearance. The product is NOT tested on animals which is very important and I loved the smell. The product was not greasy with a slight texture and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it feels great on my skin. Too early for results but will buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my mom. She&#x27;s in her 60s n she said after few uses she can see the difference. Will buy this again for her once she&#x27;s done w this bottle.</li>
    <li> works good except in a lot of sun</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much but after the first week my skin feels better, very smooth and I believe I see improved texture in my neck and chest. Nice and light. I will bu this again because it is a good price and is making a difference, more than any of the $100 products. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I notice a small change on the fine lines of my neck.  I will continue to use this to see for the results.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Very smooth and seems to be working. Wish you had brown spots cream that really works and wrinkle cream for around the mouth &amp; eyes. Will keep using this neck cream.</li>
    <li> I truly never thought about the fact that I may need something for my neck as well as my face. As we age, our necks tend to start to sag and get what my mother likes to refer to as &amp;#34;Turkey Neck&amp;#34;. I have noticed the skin on my neck is getting more lose than it ever has been. So, when I saw this I had to grab it and test this out to see what it would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the packaging of this product. It fits perfectly on my vanity. It smells AMAZING as well. I absolutely love the smell of this cream. It goes on very smoothly and feels so good on your skin. I rub it in using circular motions moving from the base of my next to my chin. Whenever you use neck creams you NEVER want to pull down your neck when your applying the cream. The scent lingers and I really like that. The cream sinks right into your skin but you feel hydrated for a long time after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over time, I have noticed that my skin on my neck is so smooth and tighter than it was before. I really like this product and will continue to use it. I am on a mission to prevent aging as much as possible while I can and this is a vital step in doing that. I would highly recommend getting and trying out this product! I got this product free to review in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion!</li>
