### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They came today and they are great!  </li>
      <li>Great price and quality</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t like to wash your foundation sponges and prefer to toss them, these are a great affordable option.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for good quality and repeat use puff, this is not something you will like.</li>
      <li>The ones from Wal Mart were superior.</li>
      <li>These sponges are very soft and good what I was using them for am happy</li>
      <li>I cannot see using these more than once.</li>
      <li>These cosmetic sponges are thinner than the ones I buy at the drugstore, but these are also much more affordable too.  </li>
      <li>Just the same size as the original CG sponge, and now I have a good supply for a good price.  </li>
      <li>Which is fine by me.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely order more when these are gone!</li>
      <li>Next time I will pay more attention to the thickness.</li>
      <li>Although it applies foundation as any other, using my fingers would have done just as well -- since most of the foundation quick seeped through onto my fingers anyway.</li>
      <li>and you can readily discard</li>
      <li>I really want to return</li>
      <li>IT makes your whole face to smell like latex for hours.</li>
      <li>I really like their texture</li>
      <li>Much thinner than I had anticipated.</li>
      <li>so I could keep my face as clean as possible.  </li>
      <li>Will have to hope that the drugstore gets a new supply (had been waiting two weeks, they were backordered they said).</li>
      <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering again soon and in the near</li>
      <li>They do a decent enough job of my makeup application.  </li>
      <li>these were more flat  and hard and dried out very quickly out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
      <li>I had been looking for new sponges to apply my liquid foundation with that were absorbent enough.  </li>
      <li>They are smaller than a standard compact, but they still work very well.</li>
      <li>These break down right away</li>
      <li>the other ones were much more moist and fluffy and bouncy to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I use these both for foundation and for applying powder, and for applying powder they&#x27;ll last far longer than they do for foundation.  </li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re pretty soft and they don&#x27;t drag roughly across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The others were easily twice as thick, and could be washed and reused a dozen times before they finally started to break down and tear apart.</li>
<li> Totally regret it, because these are super thin and flimsy beyond belief.</li>
<li> Item is very porous, absorbs liquid products that will seep to the ther side, not good enough for compact powder use, only up side is that it s a lot</li>
<li> cheap, thin, and flimsy!  </li>
<li> The size and quality is very poor and cheap.</li>
<li> These sponges are porous, however they are thin and the makeup quickly bleeds to the other side.  </li>
<li> but it is too trouble for such low cost item.</li>
<li> we previously used the pharmacy brands which come in smaller packages and are enriched with additives etc.</li>
<li> Too rough for my face.</li>
<li> They are very thin and my fingernails poke right through them when I try to apply powder foundation with them.</li>
<li> too thin and the material sucks up liquid foundation quickly</li>
<li> I have been using this type of product for the past 15 years, but my local drugstore was out of stock, so</li>
<li> It can make for a little mess.  </li>
<li> I usually use the sponge once or twice and then toss it.  </li>
<li> It comes with a small sponge in the compact to apply it.  </li>
<li> The sponges I had were not porous enough and streaked the makeup and applied it weirdly.  </li>
<li> Because they&#x27;re thin, my foundation soaks right through which is a little annoying.  </li>
<li> In summary if you&#x27;re looking for a porous round sponge this item is that however beware they are on the thin side.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been searching for some replacement sponges that were inexpensive and was not successful till I found these.  </li>
<li> Being so thin, they also are not good for spreading the makeup (I use them to spread and soften the blush).</li>
<li> Very thin.</li>
<li> Since there are 50 in a pack I don&#x27;t feel so bad about using and tossing them.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed at these sponges.</li>
<li> It gets the job done , i personally hate the latex scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> These sponges are very soft and good what I was using them for am happy I bought them a lot</li>
    <li> IT makes your whole face to smell like latex for hours. It gets the job done , i personally hate the latex scent but if you don&#x27;t mind go for it.</li>
    <li> The size and quality is very poor and cheap. This product is only made for one time use . If you are looking for good quality and repeat use puff, this is not something you will like. I really want to return but it is too trouble for such low cost item.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I had been looking for new sponges to apply my liquid foundation with that were absorbent enough.  The sponges I had were not porous enough and streaked the makeup and applied it weirdly.  These sponges are porous, however they are thin and the makeup quickly bleeds to the other side.  It can make for a little mess.  I usually use the sponge once or twice and then toss it.  They do a decent enough job of my makeup application.  Since there are 50 in a pack I don&#x27;t feel so bad about using and tossing them.

    <li> Very thin. Much thinner than I had anticipated. Although it applies foundation as any other, using my fingers would have done just as well -- since most of the foundation quick seeped through onto my fingers anyway. Next time I will pay more attention to the thickness.</li>
    <li> I recently started using Cover Girl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless foundation.  It comes with a small sponge in the compact to apply it.  I&#x27;ve been searching for some replacement sponges that were inexpensive and was not successful till I found these.  They came today and they are great!  Just the same size as the original CG sponge, and now I have a good supply for a good price.  I will definitely order more when these are gone!</li>
    <li> too thin and the material sucks up liquid foundation quickly</li>
    <li> Fabulous...the only ones I like and I&#x27;ve used them for years!</li>
    <li> Item is very porous, absorbs liquid products that will seep to the ther side, not good enough for compact powder use, only up side is that it s a lot and you can readily discard</li>
    <li> I use this product to apply my makeup.  Please keep these in stock.  I will be ordering again soon and in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking all over for these at different beauty supply stores and they did not carry this brand.  Thank goodness I found them thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> my daughter needed thouse for art project - she was making macaroons by connecting two rounds together and painting them.  we previously used the pharmacy brands which come in smaller packages and are enriched with additives etc. the other ones were much more moist and fluffy and bouncy to the touch.  these were more flat  and hard and dried out very quickly out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;i guess if you use them for the intended purpose you might have a different review, but i would think that the quality would reflect either way.  Overall, they are cheaper and lesser quality.  i wouldn&#x27;t buy them for either purpose again.</li>
    <li> These cosmetic sponges are thinner than the ones I buy at the drugstore, but these are also much more affordable too.  Because they&#x27;re thin, my foundation soaks right through which is a little annoying.  And after using them for about 5 days, they start to tear or crumble so these aren&#x27;t made to be washed and reused.... they&#x27;re made to be tossed.  Which is fine by me.  I use these both for foundation and for applying powder, and for applying powder they&#x27;ll last far longer than they do for foundation.  I really like their texture, they&#x27;re pretty soft and they don&#x27;t drag roughly across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like to wash your foundation sponges and prefer to toss them, these are a great affordable option.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with a makeup compact so I could keep my face as clean as possible.  These are just like the ones I was replacing. I deducted a star for size.  They are smaller than a standard compact, but they still work very well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of product for the past 15 years, but my local drugstore was out of stock, so I got these online instead. Totally regret it, because these are super thin and flimsy beyond belief. The others were easily twice as thick, and could be washed and reused a dozen times before they finally started to break down and tear apart. I cannot see using these more than once. Being so thin, they also are not good for spreading the makeup (I use them to spread and soften the blush). Your fingers are creating streaks - it is like using a piece of tissue, not a sponge. Huge waste of money. Will have to hope that the drugstore gets a new supply (had been waiting two weeks, they were backordered they said).</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at these sponges. They are very thin and my fingernails poke right through them when I try to apply powder foundation with them. They will do in a pinch, but should probably be considered &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I can describe this product using three words...........cheap, thin, and flimsy!  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give it one star.</li>
    <li> Would not get these again. The ones from Wal Mart were superior. These break down right away and now I have so may of them.</li>
    <li> Too rough for my face.</li>
