      <li>I loved both products.  </li>
      <li>Works good.</li>
      <li>If this occurs its actually a good sign that the skin supplement is working.</li>
      <li>As a bonus, your name appears under the word Beautiful on the label. :)</li>
      <li>reminds me that I should expect the best because I am worthy.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful PM is great to use after you have removed your make-up right before bed.  </li>
      <li>I was sent free AM Amazingly Beautiful and PM</li>
      <li>I have been using both AM and PM with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use the product is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product smell amazing.</li>
      <li>It always seems to have a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is nice, sort of like the rinds to lemons and oranges.</li>
      <li>all opinions are my own*</li>
      <li>It has a nice, citrus-y scent.  </li>
      <li>Revitalizer smelled wonderful and very innate.</li>
      <li>I worried about using a nighttime oil because I thought it might get on my pillow, hair, etc., but it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>Thanks Beautiful for making me feel...beautiful!</li>
      <li>Amazingly Beautiful takes about a full 30 days for your skin to thrive on its own and be rid of all the chemicals that are beneath the skin.</li>
      <li>am loving this PM</li>
      <li>This goes beautifully with the AM moisturizer and has easily become my favorite skincare products ever.</li>
      <li>Not the kind of thought that I am better but that I do need to be reminded that I am not the bottom of the totem pole either.  </li>
      <li>Some might not think it&#x27;s a big deal but just reading the label &amp;#34;Amazingly Beautiful April&amp;#34; is a great self esteem booster and erases doubt.  </li>
      <li>The Beautiful PM moisturizer is the heavier of the two, and it works to really moisturize and restore skin while you sleep.</li>
      <li>I love the orange scent and easy to apply oil!</li>
      <li>Instead I experience my skin looking healthy and</li>
      <li>but I do think it has helped my skin look healthy and glowing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to try the AM Moisturizer and THIS PM Revitalizer.  </li>
      <li>I want to keep that junk of my precious face</li>
      <li>personalization is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that didn&#x27;t happen to me</li>
      <li>When used with the AM moisturizer my face is in a lot better shape.</li>
      <li>is I&#x27;m all out! :)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use most of those, so</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also I just love the fact that each bottle lasts about 2 months</li>
      <li>It seemed more like oil for cooking than a moisturizer for my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s designed to replace many skin care products all in one - moisturizer, cleanser, toner, firming gel, protectant, repair cream, blemish controller, and age-defying serum.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, orange is the scent that is most prominent.</li>
      <li>Now what can be better than that.  </li>

      <li>I love the Beautiful skin care because it&#x27;s natural and replaces a 3-step system in just one product (or two with the A.M.).</li>
      <li>and I was surprised and happy that the label was personalized.</li>
      <li>This product I am going to review really helped my skin, and its clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trusted Health Products Inc has manufactured the first “skin supplement” called Amazingly Beautiful.</li>
      <li>I love using this right after my nightly shower!</li>
      <li>The only I don&#x27;t like about Beautiful PM</li>
      <li>Decreases the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and crow’s</li>
      <li>Decreases the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and crow’s</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t because my very sensitive skin was having an adverse reaction to this product, but because this is all a part of the detoxification process, which is a good sign because it meant my skin was ridding itself of toxins that have built up over time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using Beautiful for a month, my skin does look more clear, young and healthy.</li>
      <li>The product smells like citrus and that was  a huge plus.</li>
      <li>Available to both Men and Women</li>
      <li>Again it leaves the skin smooth and non-oily.</li>
      <li>I received the product for free to review.  </li>
      <li>:  I received a free bottle in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
      <li>Available to both Men and Women</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>The light scent is fantastic and relaxing right before bed!</li>
      <li>Your skin will want this, so you may require more then 2-3 drops per cheek for the first couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>It really is an encouragement and fun to see your own name on a product.  </li>
      <li>It is completely absorbed within minutes which is great because I do not like to feel anything on my skin, especially my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That positive reinforcement is something I think many women need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After a few days of using Amazingly Beautiful, I experienced a brief blemish breakout.</li>
      <li>A great product for reducing fine lines, dark spots and acne.</li>
      <li>It really feeds your skin what it needs in order to be luminous, and have such beautiful clarity.</li>
      <li>Beautiful is an all natural combination of essential</li>
      <li>and I now want to start taking care of my face more and from the few skin care products I have tried so far Amazingly Beautiful A. M. Moisturizer and P. M. Revitalizer</li>
      <li>Luckily it did rub right in and disappeared into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it is worth it?</li>
      <li>I have been using the Amazingly Beautiful A.M Moisturizer every morning and the P.M Revitalizer before bed every day for the past 2 weeks .</li>
      <li>I have been trying to find more natural beauty and health care products and this product fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>Within a few short weeks of using this fantastic oil, my complexion was clearer and had a Beautiful Glow!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a remedy or miracle product, its a natural product which is going to help keep your skin healthy.  </li>
      <li>I received complimentary products to facilitate this post.</li>
      <li>I have not really noticed any changed wrinkle wise</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Amazingly Beautiful P.M. Revitalizer smelled wonderful and very innate. In my opinion, orange is the scent that is most prominent. It feels very natural on my skin and it absorbs quickly without causing my skin to feel sticky or greasy. After a few days of using Amazingly Beautiful, I experienced a brief blemish breakout. This wasn&#x27;t because my very sensitive skin was having an adverse reaction to this product, but because this is all a part of the detoxification process, which is a good sign because it meant my skin was ridding itself of toxins that have built up over time. This breakout only lasted approximately 4-5 days and really wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Amazingly Beautiful keeps my skin feeling moisturized and looking invigorated, healthy, and beautiful. It always seems to have a nice glow. I don&#x27;t need to use any other moisturizers, serums, etc. on my face. I&#x27;ve also noticed that in the approximate 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using Amazingly Beautiful, it is subtly helping to decrease those fine lines around my eyes. Another great thing about Amazingly Beautiful is that each bottle is personalized with your name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure:  I received a free bottle in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received one product for review just a few days before Christmas that I was really excited about. The holidays usually mean lots of photos taken and I’ve noticed a lot recently that my face has been really red and patchy from the all the dryness. This product I am going to review really helped my skin, and its clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trusted Health Products Inc has manufactured the first “skin supplement” called Amazingly Beautiful. It really feeds your skin what it needs in order to be luminous, and have such beautiful clarity. It arrives to you in a .5oz glass bottle that is customized with your name. There is both an AM, and PM bottle. I have been using both AM and PM with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use the product is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Apply 2-3 drops per cheek 1-2 times daily. Gently spread it around your entire face in a circular motion including your neck and forehead. Your skin will want this, so you may require more then 2-3 drops per cheek for the first couple of weeks. (Be sure to put the cap back on the bottle immediately after use as it preserves potency. If it’s exposed to air too long it can weaken the botanical oils effectiveness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re use to putting a lot of make up, and creams on your face your face may need to detox and rid itself of all the chemicals used in those products. This product shocks your skin into releasing all of the dirt, and filth underneath your skin, and in your pores. Amazingly Beautiful takes about a full 30 days for your skin to thrive on its own and be rid of all the chemicals that are beneath the skin. You can experience breakouts that may last for 1-2 days to a week. If this occurs its actually a good sign that the skin supplement is working. Don’t get discouraged if this happens because once my breakout happened my skin looked really hydrated and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had remembered to take a before photo, but as you can see in the photo above there isn’t many of those dry, red patches I described earlier. My t-zone is the worst spot for me, and I am happy with how it looks in just a week. Let me explain to you just how bad it was. I would get out of the shower, and try my hair with the towel and after getting dressed i could literally scrub the white flaky skin off my forehead because it was so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the benefits aside from the flawless looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Decreases the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and crow’s feet.&lt;br /&gt;  Reduces appearance of aging.&lt;br /&gt;  Firms and Tones skins appearance.&lt;br /&gt;  Pores appear to shrink, giving a smoother look to skins complexion.&lt;br /&gt;  No preservatives, parabens, GMO’s, synthetic chemicals, artificial colors or additives of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;  Available to both Men and Women&lt;br /&gt;  Say goodbye to dry and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure botanical oils of almond, orange, lemon, avocado, olive, evening primrose and apricot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase your set of AM/PM Amazingly Beautiful here on their website.

    <li> This product was a great pm revitalizer. You put 2 to 3 drops on each cheek and gently spread over the entire face including neck and forehead. Use a circular motion and do not rub in. The product smells like citrus and that was  a huge plus. When used with the AM moisturizer my face is in a lot better shape.</li>
    <li> I was sent free AM Amazingly Beautiful and PM Amazingly Beautiful products in exchange for an honest review.  I was not paid for this review and all opinions are 100% mine.  Thank you Trusted Health Products for the products and providing three winners for the AM Amazingly Beautiful Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both products now for roughly two weeks.  I love the moisture feel as my skin has been very dry the last few weeks as we move from winter to spring.  I am 31 and I am just starting to notice some wrinkles.  In two weeks I can&#x27;t say I look younger but I do think it has helped my skin look healthy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan that these moisturizers do not use and harmful chemicals, parabens, GMO&#x27;s, chemicals, and artificial colors!  I want to keep that junk of my precious face so this product meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The personalization is fantastic!  It really is an encouragement and fun to see your own name on a product.  Some might not think it&#x27;s a big deal but just reading the label &amp;#34;Amazingly Beautiful April&amp;#34; is a great self esteem booster and erases doubt.  I truly believe in the power of your words even if it is only read silently.</li>
    <li> You may be wondering why you would put oil on your face, since oils are known to cause break outs and pimples. But your skin naturally produces oil to keep your skin looking healthy and moisturized and most of the time we strip these oils away with harsh chemicals found in our cleansers. Our skin needs these oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this PM Revitalizer and it has become a part of my daily routine. This one bottle lasts 2 months...a drop or two goes a long way. I apply this at night after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> This product smell amazing. The citrus blend of lemon and orange are just wonderful.  No chemicals or foul odors here.  My skin soaked the product right up too.  Now I&#x27;ve been using oils on my skin for a long time, so I didn&#x27;t experience the detox that some might (which is a normal process as your skin adjusts.)  Instead I experience my skin looking healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received a copy of this product for review.  all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> I have been using the Amazingly Beautiful A.M Moisturizer every morning and the P.M Revitalizer before bed every day for the past 2 weeks . I have not really noticed any changed wrinkle wise and I don&#x27;t think I look any younger but I noticed my face looks healthier and my keeps my skin hydrated all day . My skin feels smoother and I did notice that a bunch of my blemishes disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have to say  that  I have not often used anything to reduce appearance of aging because and I do have a few wrinkles and such but I am 38 and I now want to start taking care of my face more and from the few skin care products I have tried so far Amazingly Beautiful A. M. Moisturizer and P. M. Revitalizer are my favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I think it is worth it? Personally yes I do because I love the way it makes my skin feel and the fact that it look healthier. Also I just love the fact that each bottle lasts about 2 months and I was surprised and happy that the label was personalized. It is a nice touch. I will be purchasing these from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff was so awesome!! I do product reviews and I was hesitant at first about putting oil on my face, but I love how it dries on my skin and leaves it so soft. I have only been using it for a few weeks, but people are already noticing how much different my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this, it is Amazing!</li>
    <li> A perfect companion to the refreshing A.M. moisturizer. I love the orange scent and easy to apply oil! A perfect make up remover, too!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin radiant in a short time. Does not have an oily appearance. Goes on smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful counter part to the AM treatment. This evening application works to restore your skin from the exposures of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly Beautiful is an all natural combination of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil to moisturize, soothe and soften skin, relieve itching from dry skin and to give complexion appearance of improvement and glow.&lt;br /&gt;Orange oil which cleanses the skin through natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties to help fight acne and restore smooth appearance to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lemon oil that is a natural cleanser and is known for the reduction of wrinkling and aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of oils replace several steps my skincare routine. I like only having to apply one easy treatment in the morning and one in the evening. I have even applied this oil on other areas of stressed skin and enjoyed the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally this product is applied right after I wash my face before bed. It is completely absorbed within minutes which is great because I do not like to feel anything on my skin, especially my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, sort of like the rinds to lemons and oranges. It is light when applying and doesn&#x27;t linger long or conflict with any other product scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you are looking for a simple way to take care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> The Beautiful PM moisturizer is the heavier of the two, and it works to really moisturize and restore skin while you sleep. Both the AM and the PM oils have a very pleasant fragrance, they are easy to use, and the results are remarkable. I only recommend truly natural products that work, and this definitely fits that criteria! As a bonus, your name appears under the word Beautiful on the label. :)</li>
    <li> A great companion to the Beautiful A.M. Moisturizer! Again it leaves the skin smooth and non-oily. It only takes a few drops each night. And the bottle should last you at least a month. This is a case of less is more.</li>
    <li> I think yes this is a bit pricey but what essential oil isn&#x27;t.  This isn&#x27;t a remedy or miracle product, its a natural product which is going to help keep your skin healthy.  I have to say I recommend it to anyone, man or women, regardless of price as its actually pretty reasonable when you look at the cost of other solutions which are not as natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://www.aluckyladybug.com/2013/11/trusted-health-products-beautiful-ampm.html#dZFGSm0xoTxchOXW.99</li>
    <li> Talk about smart marketing! Having a bottle arrive on it that says &amp;#34;Beautiful..&amp;#34; with your name on it makes you really want to try it AND you have been called beautiful before you even begin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little bit skeptical because I have never used a moisturizer like this before. It seemed more like oil for cooking than a moisturizer for my face. But I was willing to give it a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to take a few drops on your fingertip at a time and rub it in a circular motion on your face. It did feel a bit oily to me so I fully expected my face to be oily after. Luckily it did rub right in and disappeared into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about the fact that it&#x27;s like a detox for your face and warns that you might break out first as everything is being cleaned out of your skin. I&#x27;m glad that didn&#x27;t happen to me but I do understand how it is just a part of the process. Like anything else you clean out, it looks a whole lot worse before it gets better and skincare is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Beautiful for a month, my skin does look more clear, young and healthy. It feels soft and smooth and I feel like it took years off my face. Thanks Beautiful for making me feel...beautiful!</li>
    <li> Do you ever think about what is really in your skin care products? I know I do!! I like to know what I put on my face and on my skin. Unfortunately, the skin care industry is one of the least regulated in our society and sadly this means that they can put almost anything they want in our every day skin care products, even if those ingredients are harmful to our health and well being!  Many ingredients found in cleansers and moisturizers such as parabens, petrochemicals and others have been associated with or linked to allergic reactions, skin conditions, hormonal disruptions, neurotoxicity, and even cancer! How scary is that!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, there are companies like Trusted Health Products that make great Beautiful PM! Within a few short weeks of using this fantastic oil, my complexion was clearer and had a Beautiful Glow! The light scent is fantastic and relaxing right before bed! I love using this right after my nightly shower! The only I don&#x27;t like about Beautiful PM is I&#x27;m all out! :)</li>
    <li> I love the Beautiful skin care because it&#x27;s natural and replaces a 3-step system in just one product (or two with the A.M.). It&#x27;s a slightly thicker oil that glides on easily, and I only need 4-6 drops, so it lasts a while, too. I worried about using a nighttime oil because I thought it might get on my pillow, hair, etc., but it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received complimentary products to facilitate this post. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a chance to try out Beautiful AM Moisturizer/PM Revitalizer. It was fun - the products came with my name on the bottle, which was a little bit of an emotional post. They were easy to use, and in spite of the tiny bottle size, seem like they&#x27;ll go a long way. There is a warning on the bottle that people may have a brief blemish breakout at first, but I didn&#x27;t experience that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the product is pure and natural botanical oils. It has no preservatives, parabens, GMOs, or artificial chemicals or additives. It&#x27;s designed to replace many skin care products all in one - moisturizer, cleanser, toner, firming gel, protectant, repair cream, blemish controller, and age-defying serum. I don&#x27;t use most of those, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works as a replacement for all of them, but I can say that my skin felt smooth and soft, but not greasy, after a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful PM is great to use after you have removed your make-up right before bed.  Works good.</li>
    <li> This goes beautifully with the AM moisturizer and has easily become my favorite skincare products ever.</li>
    <li> A great product for reducing fine lines, dark spots and acne. It has no harsh smell or chemicals, and does not affect the skin in a negative way. If you have acne, you will get some breakouts, but it will clear up as you keep using.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the AM Moisturizer and THIS PM Revitalizer.  I loved both products.  It has a nice, citrus-y scent.  I love that it only has botanical oils and no chemicals at all.  I have been trying to find more natural beauty and health care products and this product fits the bill.  I did have a small issue with the oil coming out of the dropper top on one occasion, but most nights the oil came out fine.  It makes my skin feel soft.  I did have a couple small blemishes, which the company warns you may happen.  They went away after the first week.  I think the oil is good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received the product for free to review.  All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> Your BEAUTIFUL Too&lt;br /&gt;I love the lil fortunes in the cookies from our local Chinese eatery.  They are very up lifting.&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me that I should expect the best because I am worthy.  Not the kind of thought that I am better but that I do need to be reminded that I am not the bottom of the totem pole either.  That positive reinforcement is something I think many women need.&lt;br /&gt;I get this every morning and every night when I put my A.M. Moisturizer and P.M. Revitalizer from Trusted Health Products.  Not only does this facial oil smell amazing it reminds me that I am BEAUTIFUL.  Now what can be better than that.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> I have dry patches on my cheeks, and an oily T-zone and this product (as well as the AM Moisturizer) takes care of all of that.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> A great nighttime moisturize to compliment the Beautiful AM moisturizer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the natural ingredients.</li>
