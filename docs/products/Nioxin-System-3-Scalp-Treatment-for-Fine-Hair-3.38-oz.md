    <li> Does not do anything for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size and happy with the product which was cost effective</li>
    <li> Not happy my hair fell out from nioxin</li>
    <li> Love the product, the size shrunk.Ordered before but they came in 6 oz which is what would make it worth the price. Read size carefully.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin hair products for the past three years with great results.  New hair growth is quite evident, but the overall health of my hair has improved dramatically! I also use a Nioxin Hair Booster each time I wash my hair.  I am convinced that using all of these Nioxin products together has been the reason for my hair growth.</li>
    <li> I use this at my temple area and hair really grows in.  The only problem is it needs to be used daily to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Nioxin products for 3 years. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m growing more hair but I&#x27;m not losing any either, so that&#x27;s a good thing. I use the scalp treatment after the Nioxin shampoo about every other day. It may not grow hair but I do believe it will make your head and hair healthier.</li>
    <li> Great product,  really works. Since using it my hair has improved and have new hair growth. Use the whole product line.</li>
    <li> I have just begun to use this product so i can&#x27;t really evaluate its effectiveness for my hair.  It arrived is very good condition.</li>
    <li> This product has stopped my hair loss. Thank God because I was afraid I was going to end up bald.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a professional hair stylist and nutritionist years ago I started using Nioxin products. They work for me. Everyone&#x27;s physiology is different so you will need to try and see for yourself it if works for your body. I know other guys that have used it and personally seen their hair grow back.</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t order this - what gives?</li>
    <li> Ok. I have fine hair and have to make the best of it. I don&#x27;t have hair that&#x27;s thinning noticeably. So the whole line has made a difference on how my hair looks and feels and after every shampoo I use it because it&#x27;s like a fertilizer for the hair. It regrowths and healthier.</li>

    <li> Nioxin System 3 is a good product and I have used it for many years. They sent the wrong one which was for chemically treated hair and should have been for regular hair. Other that that it is a good product.</li>

    <li> The Nioxin system (3 part) really makes a difference, and it seems that this part 3 Scalp Treatment is key to the System&#x27;s effectiveness.  A hair stylist told me to use it twice daily - something I didn&#x27;t know before.  Nioxin is careful not to make exaggerated claims, but it slowly but surely makes hair look a bit fuller and thicker, especially in thinning areas.</li>
    <li> Nioxin products are excellent and this one is no exception.  My wife uses this in conjunction with two others and she is very pleased.</li>

    <li> Love It! Love it...Will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt; Product came on time  and was packaged well.  I&#x27;ve been using product since 1/21/2013 &amp; already notice an improvement with my hair.</li>
