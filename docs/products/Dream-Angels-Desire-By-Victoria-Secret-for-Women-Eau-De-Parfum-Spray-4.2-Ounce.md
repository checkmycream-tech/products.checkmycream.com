    <li> I have always loved this fragance from VS. When I knew it was discontinued,  I was really disappointed.  Fortunately, IFound it here for an excellent price. Although there was a little problem with the shipment bc I didnt received it on time, however, they solved it quickly by sending me again the same product. Finally, when I received the second shipment,  I ended up keeping those two perfumes too. The products were in excellent conditions,  as described . I recommend buying here. They are really good at solving any inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if some of their batches are worse than others or what, but it smelled so cheap.  I&#x27;ve had decent Victoria Secret scents before, &amp;#34;Heavenly&amp;#34; I think, but this one &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; is yuk.  To be fair I will say I did not buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Elegant, soft, sexy &amp; long lasting!! This is hands down my favorite Victoria Secret perfume. I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> She loved it.  It&#x27;s one of them items that if we get it in Alaska, it&#x27;s a treat for us</li>
    <li> I felt compelled to write a review because I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this due to the last review on this perfume by this seller. Well I&#x27;m glad I went against my better judgement and bought it because I received my order today and it is a genuine Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels perfume. Mine came sealed in the original cellophane wrapping with an original price sticker on the bottom. The box was different than the other bottle I already have but I believe it is just the updated packaging that they had before it was discontinued. I have a tiny bit left of the perfume so I wanted to make sure  they smelled the same and, sure enough, they do!!! I am very pleased with my purchase and worried about where I&#x27;m going to find this again when I run out. I love this perfume! The smell is so light and pretty that I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Saw this and got happy so I purchased it right away, unfortunately what I received was not the Victoria Secret Dream Angels Desire that I love.

I know this because I have half a bottle left from the original bottle I bought from a Victoria Secret store. Very disappointed. I can&#x27;t recommend this purchase it&#x27;s not the original.</li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the scent. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It smell too powdery. not my cup of tea.  I think Heavenly has a better smell than this.</li>
    <li> LOVE! My ABSOLUTE FAV</li>
