      <li>cost effective item</li>
      <li>These work just as good as Rembrandt or Crest Strips and are fairly easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I am actually placing another order because they worked  perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Love them, these were a gift to my daughter and  she uses them every day, has noticed whiter teeth already</li>
      <li>I would never sleep in these and wearing them during the day is okay for about 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I purchased these.  </li>
      <li>I still like to use the strips better than the trays.</li>
      <li>They work fabulously for me!</li>
      <li>I use the top one with a mouth guard and that helps to keep it and the bottom one in place.</li>
      <li>These remind me of when these kind of strips first became popular.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and surprisingly, not horrible to wear.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t end up with a really brilliant (unnatural) white after using one pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
      <li>I like them, easy to use and some visible improvement.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy.</li>
      <li>Its giving me light spotting</li>
      <li>They were easily as effective as Crest strips at a much (70%) lower price.  </li>
      <li>Am not crazy about the gel residues after but it is easily wiped off and rinsed off.</li>
      <li>I normally use the Simply White strips and thought nothing could touch them, but now I have tried these and they are very good to.</li>
      <li>Applying them to my teeth took a good 5 - 10 minutes as they would slip off instantly when in contact with saliva.</li>
      <li>less costly than brand name versions but works just as great</li>
      <li>I found them very easy to use and only need to be kept on for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>When I took the strips off my bottom teeth had white spots at the top of them.</li>
      <li>Not messy, easy to apply and really makes a difference on my teeth,</li>
      <li>I have tried many different types of whitening products including professional whitening</li>
      <li>and I think some parts absorb the whitening process better than other parts.</li>
      <li>Normally, a set of whitening strips is more expensive but these are a steal and very easy to add on to an order.</li>
      <li>Plenty of gel coating that sticks to teeth quite well, requires a little more rinsing to remove.  </li>
      <li>What i Love about these is when I don&#x27;t use them in a long time and need extreme whiting fast</li>
      <li>These were nothing but a complete hassle.</li>
      <li>My teeth are over 70 years old</li>
      <li>It will probably cost a fortune to get professional fixed.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and all, but these DO leave white marks on your teeth!!</li>
      <li>, I can do two in one day and not worry about my teeth being sensitive.</li>
      <li>I had random bright white spots on my teeth.</li>
      <li>BUT I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE TEETH, GUMS, AND AN OVERALL MOUTH.</li>
      <li>These are not as effective as the expensive strips.</li>
      <li>( I used them twice a day for an upcoming social event).</li>
      <li>over night they became less noticeable but in certain lighting i can still see the marks on our teeth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very pleased with this product and seller</li>
    <li> These remind me of when these kind of strips first became popular. They&#x27;re flimsy and require patience to handle. I wasted 4-5 of the set because they were either stuck to the wrong side or I accidentally ruined the strip removing it from the package. I found storing them in the refrigerator seemed to make them easier to handle. These are not as effective as the expensive strips. They do work, but the results are not as dramatic. You won&#x27;t end up with a really brilliant (unnatural) white after using one pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are contradicting instructions with the package (6 hours vs. 30 minute application). I usually left them on for 30 minutes. They are weak enough that you can do two treatments a day. I paid $13. I see now that they are $8. If you have the patience, invest in a few packs. It will probably take a month&#x27;s worth of twice daily treatments to duplicate the results you would get from the expensive packs.</li>
    <li> I still like to use the strips better than the trays. These work well. I do have to brush off the excess whitening gel, but otherwise these were a good buy.</li>
    <li> These were nothing but a complete hassle. Applying them to my teeth took a good 5 - 10 minutes as they would slip off instantly when in contact with saliva. The gel is all gooey, making it slip and slide all over the place and even seep out of the strip during the whitening process. Even after the stress of attempting to use these things, my teeth remain their usual dull creamy, yellow-white shade. No bueno...</li>
    <li> It gave me ulcers on my tongue. BUT I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE TEETH, GUMS, AND AN OVERALL MOUTH. So it&#x27;s not really fair for me to judge but I love it. It&#x27;s really easy. Put them on, hop in the shower or take your dog for a walk, and take them off after 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and all, but these DO leave white marks on your teeth!! it happened to both me AND my boyfriend!! he was really mad. over night they became less noticeable but in certain lighting i can still see the marks on our teeth. what the heck!</li>
    <li> Messy, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stick to teeth, no noticeable whitening</li>
    <li> I like them, easy to use and some visible improvement. Am not crazy about the gel residues after but it is easily wiped off and rinsed off. For the price it is a good product.</li>
    <li> less costly than brand name versions but works just as great</li>
    <li> Love them, these were a gift to my daughter and  she uses them every day, has noticed whiter teeth already</li>
    <li> SEEM TO WORK AS WELL AS THE EXPENSIVE ONES</li>
    <li> I am actually placing another order because they worked  perfect for me. People are complaining about random white and yellow spots on their teeth, after using these, but I am assuming thats because these people already have some sort of inconsistency when it comes to the colour of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, it worked perfect for me. Evenly white teeth. No ulcers. No irritations.</li>
    <li> They work fabulously for me! They&#x27;re easy to use and surprisingly, not horrible to wear. Normally, a set of whitening strips is more expensive but these are a steal and very easy to add on to an order. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Its giving me light spotting and it made my mouth bleed a bit but it does whiten? I dunno I would just spend the extra 20 bucks and get crest white strips next time.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased these.  Not messy, easy to apply and really makes a difference on my teeth,</li>
    <li> good deal&lt;br /&gt;they work&lt;br /&gt;some were unusable due to being crinkled up&lt;br /&gt;but cost effective item</li>
    <li> Perfect, I got it fast and works great.</li>
    <li> Impressive results for the money.  They were easily as effective as Crest strips at a much (70%) lower price.  I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> These were the worst strips - after i took them off for -  I had random bright white spots on my teeth. It looks horrible. It will probably cost a fortune to get professional fixed. Dont buy....i tried cheaping out but you get what you pay for.....and worse :(</li>
    <li> Instructions say to wear for six hours!  There is no way these flimsy little gels will stay in place for six hours.  I would never sleep in these and wearing them during the day is okay for about 30 minutes.  After that they wad up and slide around and fail.&lt;br /&gt;The price should have been the indicator that there is something undesirable here.  So let me save you the trouble and tell you to pass on these, spend more.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am looking for similar items that say Five minutes.</li>
    <li> These work just as good as Rembrandt or Crest Strips and are fairly easy to apply. I use the top one with a mouth guard and that helps to keep it and the bottom one in place. I do not find the taste annoying. Some areas do get whiter than others but that does not bother me over the course of the treatment. My teeth are over 70 years old and I think some parts absorb the whitening process better than other parts. That is not the fault of the product.</li>
    <li> I normally use the Simply White strips and thought nothing could touch them, but now I have tried these and they are very good to. The price difference is a plus also.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips seem to work fast after only a few applications. Plenty of gel coating that sticks to teeth quite well, requires a little more rinsing to remove.  Does not appear to irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> I found them very easy to use and only need to be kept on for 30 minutes. ( I used them twice a day for an upcoming social event). I have tried many different types of whitening products including professional whitening and I have to say at this price nothing can beat it. I am ordering a second set now for future touch ups. After using them a few times people already noticed the difference in my teeth.</li>
    <li> When I took the strips off my bottom teeth had white spots at the top of them.</li>
    <li> Whitens for sure! What i Love about these is when I don&#x27;t use them in a long time and need extreme whiting fast, I can do two in one day and not worry about my teeth being sensitive.</li>
