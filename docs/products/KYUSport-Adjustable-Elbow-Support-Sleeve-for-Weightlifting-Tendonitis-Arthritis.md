      <li>I am so happy!</li>
      <li>I think the blade sharpness as well as the lubricating strip are both superior!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied!  </li>

      <li>Nice source of &amp;#34;legacy&amp;#34; blades.</li>
      <li>These are okay.  </li>
      <li>Just glad I found some....</li>
      <li>It seems almost like the more</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>I prefer my 2 blade Tracer FX over razors with 3 blades or more.</li>
      <li>Before I tossed it to buy a more &amp;#34;trendy, modern&amp;#34; razor, I decided to look online.</li>
      <li>I use them the better they cut.  </li>
      <li>They can be cleaned more easily and reused.</li>
      <li>When I found these I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were going to be comparable to and fit my Schick FX razor.</li>
      <li>If you loved your Tracer and can&#x27;t find new blades, you will not be displeased by the Wilkinson Sword FxPerformer.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to finally find them.</li>
      <li>It did not give as smooth a shave as the Schick.</li>
      <li>I did know when I first ordered them if I would like them, but I love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can get blades that fit my old razor, which I use in my gym bag.</li>

      <li>Great blades, and very sharp.</li>
      <li>I love 2 blades verses the new 3 and 4 blade razors.  </li>
      <li>Most important, they use a different, and far better, method to attaching them to the razor holder.</li>
      <li>Great buy on blades which are getting hard to find.</li>
      <li>they are exactly what I needed an cheeper</li>
      <li>Thankfully they are exactly like the Schick FX blades.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Came across these blades by Wilkinson made for the FX razor and they are as good as the originals by Shick if not better.  </li>
      <li>It may only have two blades but works fine for me for decades.</li>
      <li>Yes, my Wilkenson Sword razor blades did work very well as a replacement for thhe Shick Blades</li>
      <li>THANKS.</li>
      <li>They fit, they remove facial hair.</li>
      <li>I tried them, but the shave was not that much closer for me.  </li>
      <li>He said they are not as sharp for the first cut but they work just fine.</li>

<ol>
    <li> These refill blades give an excellent, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Cant find in stores anymore and it is the blade my father loves!</li>
    <li> Yes, my Wilkenson Sword razor blades did work very well as a replacement for thhe Shick Blades I had been using for over 60 years. Hard to change razor blades after a life time of using blades you trust. I recomend Wilkenson! NDJohn</li>
    <li> I am so happy! This fits my Schick Tracer perfectly, Perfectly! If you loved your Tracer and can&#x27;t find new blades, you will not be displeased by the Wilkinson Sword FxPerformer.</li>
    <li> In the name of Progress, Schick discontinued the FX razor blades.  Over the years, I have found left over Schick blades to match the FX razor.  With two packs left, I discovered the Wilkinson product, made in Poland.  The blade is strikingly similar to the orig mfg product and shaves well, too.  Let&#x27;s hope each blade holds its edge.  If so, then I&#x27;m going to buy a case or two.</li>
    <li> So I hate to throw away stuff, especially plastics that will last pretty much forever. I have a Tracer FX handle. Can&#x27;t find blades for it locally anymore. Before I tossed it to buy a more &amp;#34;trendy, modern&amp;#34; razor, I decided to look online. This is the best price I could find on compatible blades. They fit, they remove facial hair. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> My husband said the blades work well enough. He doesn&#x27;t want to give up the razor he has been using so we decided to try these since his have been discontinued. He said they are not as sharp for the first cut but they work just fine.</li>
    <li> It seems almost like the more I use them the better they cut.  I did know when I first ordered them if I would like them, but I love them. THANKS.</li>
    <li> beat the rest for price</li>
    <li> Just glad I found some....still one of the best razors and blades I have used, but it&#x27;s always been about the blades.  They&#x27;ll give you the razor.</li>
    <li> I will be so sad when the day comes that I can&#x27;t buy these anymore.</li>

    <li> Nice source of &amp;#34;legacy&amp;#34; blades.</li>
    <li> These remain the best blades on the market. They avoid the unnecessary and expensive 4 or 5 blade versions that people like Gillette swamp the market with. They can be cleaned more easily and reused. Their diamond-inclusive blade edges are sharper and last longer. Most important, they use a different, and far better, method to attaching them to the razor holder.</li>
    <li> It may only have two blades but works fine for me for decades.</li>
    <li> Look like they should, won&#x27;t be using them for a while.</li>
    <li> I prefer my 2 blade Tracer FX over razors with 3 blades or more. I didn&#x27;t realize till it was too late that Wal-Mart and everywhere else stopped carrying the Schick blades.

    <li> Fits and works.  Impossible to find on retail scene</li>
    <li> This blade works for me.</li>
    <li> I love these blades! I think the blade sharpness as well as the lubricating strip are both superior!</li>
