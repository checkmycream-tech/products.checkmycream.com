      <li>It&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a cap for the spoolie end of the pencil too.  </li>

      <li>The shape of the pen is very comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
      <li>The unusual angle of the pencil is perfect for quickly filling and shaping brows.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  </li>
      <li>in spoolie brush for the eyebrows is a nice feature to smooth out after application.</li>
      <li>While I love Smashbox&#x27;s eyebrow kit, I wanted to find something easier to use.</li>
      <li>The package is cute.  </li>
      <li>but I wish it was constructed better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one.  </li>

      <li>However, the color is the perfect shade for my Asian brows.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands from the drugstore, but the shade was always off.</li>
      <li>This is even a better pencil than the Lacome I used to use</li>
      <li>It is FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows have always been the one part of my makeup routine that I&#x27;ve been the most &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; of.</li>
      <li>already stock up for more.</li>
      <li>Totally satisfied and more.</li>
      <li>Found a better version &amp;#34;Design</li>
      <li>I love this eyebrow</li>
      <li>I (along with many Asians) have black-gray eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d never find a eyebrow pencil to cover up my one goofy eyebrow and decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>design it better please.</li>
      <li>It is now my favorite.  </li>
      <li>but you do have more control.  </li>
      <li>Really love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>I love this one.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything from the famous Anastasia brow pencil, MAC slim brow pencils, and a mixture of two brown MAC eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so the line is nice and precise.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to say, it did.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The color match is great, but precision isn&#x27;t always going to be great once the narrow end (which I use more) becomes rounded.</li>
      <li>grey is the perfect</li>
      <li>Also didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or anything, pretty good.</li>
      <li>so much easier than a pencil point and trusting your own hand!</li>
      <li>I love the unique shape of the pencil.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and lasts all day on my oil prone skin.</li>
      <li>Product stays on all day but easily washes off with face wash and water.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it is easy to damage.</li>
      <li>It applies easily and blends easily too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect eyebrow pencil! Very smooth and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Perfect pen for eyebrow! Really works well, will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Good for people with black hair, no red tones at all, good ashy, gray/black tone.&lt;br /&gt;Built in spoolie brush for the eyebrows is a nice feature to smooth out after application.</li>
    <li> Wish the tip was a little more precise.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite for eyebrows. I have that in between black and grey strand of hair, therefore, this does the job extremely well and it does it so naturally too! I had issue with the shipping, however, that has nothing to do with the product!</li>
    <li> The brush part kept coming loose and eventually completely broken off from the body in just a few weeks of use. It&#x27;s a very distinctive black and even on my black eyebrows it looks a bit odd, too.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> good, but the tip kept falling off, and there was only like an inch of product. after one week, the tip fell of and went down the drain. design it better please. poor quality. color was good.</li>
    <li> the best tool for asians.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil works well for me. It applies easily and blends easily too. The gray-black color looks nice and natural on me as long as I don&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I used it for the first time, the pencil part fell out and I had to put it back in. This isn&#x27;t really a problem for me but I wish it was constructed better.</li>
    <li> The color match is great, but precision isn&#x27;t always going to be great once the narrow end (which I use more) becomes rounded. I like the concept, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be that great. I&#x27;ve tried countless types of eyebrow pencils, different shades to try to match my eyebrows. I&#x27;m a very tanned asian so black was way too black even though my hair is black and browns you could tell were on me. I thought I&#x27;d never find a eyebrow pencil to cover up my one goofy eyebrow and decided to give this a try. Its perfect! Its creamy and goes on smooth, just need a light hand and then you&#x27;re done, doesn&#x27;t even look like I drew in my eyebrows. Its been about 8 hours wearing this so far and its still on me. Definitely purchasing this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a right color brow pencil for east Asian women.&lt;br /&gt;Pure black looks too heavy. Brown looks unfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark grey is the perfect answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brow pencil looks very natural and last all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I have a super oily face. No smudge at all is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Amazon keeps it forever!!</li>
    <li> Unibella has amazing customer service with follow up and follow through.  Each email was responded right away and with a direct phone call.  This definitely had made a great experience and it&#x27;s genuine representation is sold to me by the integrity and the passion from the representative of Unibella.  I highly recommend Unibella.  Such great character is hard to find let alone the care from the standard of a company.&lt;br /&gt;-very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Other than the cap on the brush not wanting to stay on, it is a great product; easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Product is good for asians, but it is a little too gray, so for those who have slightly dark brown hair it might not match.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FROM A-POLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON HAS A POOR WAY OF SHOWING YOU WHERE YOUR ITEM IS COMING FROM.  A-POLY IS BASED IN SOUTH KOREA...  I ORDERED THIS A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT.</li>
    <li> The pencil and color is awesome.  I&#x27;m a Hispanic woman and I have black eyebrows and the pencil made my eyebrows look fabulous.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it wears off after a few hours.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy the Hourglass arch brow sculpting pencil which would&#x27;ve set me back $30+, but I luckily remembered that my favorite youtube guru (frmheadtotoe) uses a brow pencil that was very similar. I looked online, and was able to buy this amazing brow pencil for only $10.60, s&amp;h included. The gray black color is PERFECT for asian coloring. I don&#x27;t like shaping my brows so that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; because I feel that look is too unnatural for my face. Instead, I use this to fill in my brows and it works so well. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I heard so many good reviews about this product i had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;When i saw this on amazon i had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect color for my asian brows.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other ones but i really in love with the one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for over a year for a gray eyebrow pencil as I&#x27;ve let my hair grow into it&#x27;s natural gray color.  The best I could come up with were pencils that were always too brown.  I loved the Lacome pencil I used to use and did not believe anything could top it but it did not come in gray.  When I found this pencil, and others like it, here on Amazon it was difficult to make a choice as to which one to buy.  I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one.  It has a unique shape to the waxy lead that makes drawing in my eyebrows much, much easier than ever before.  The color is perfect for me.  I like that I can put it on a bit darker than I want and then use a fine eyebrow brush and gently coax the color until I get the exact shade needed.  This is even a better pencil than the Lacome I used to use and I never thought that possible.  The shipping time was not long at all.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone needing a gray pencil.  I&#x27;m going to buy several more at this time in case they are not available at some point.  This is my greatest makeup breakthrough product since I found my go to eyeliner several years back.  Totally satisfied and more.</li>
    <li> The color was lighter than what I expected, but it builds up real fast.</li>
    <li> as advertised, appllies easily, stays on through most days as long as it is not hot and you are sweaty</li>
    <li> Great Brow Pen&lt;br /&gt;  Very easy to apply an  like the brow brush an the shape of the brow color pen. The shape of the pen is very comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
    <li> Love it! Color definitely matches my eyebrow. My brows and hair are black, like dark Asian black. I can see how it might be too dark on some people though. Search frmheadtotoe on YouTube and she had some reviews on it. My brows match her color.  I will say that the packaging sucks. The body of the pencil is thin plastic so it is easy to damage. I&#x27;m not too rough with my stuff but I already got some cracks in the body that popped out the spooly brush. Superglue fixed it but still,  a hassle.</li>
    <li> For years, many cosmetics companies have been pushing girls with natural black eyebrows to use powders, gels and pencils in a very dark brown. Sorry, but it does not match! Also, the pure black eyeshdaows and pencils that I&#x27;ve been using to fill in sparse areas was too dark and harsh. I ordered this in gray black as it was recommended to me. It fills in my black brows naturally. The gray black is like a very soft black, so again, it is natural and not harsh at all. The angled tip is wonderful and the brow comb on the other end is great. I will buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil makes applying makeup easier because of the angled shape.  The gray-black was very dark, though. Overall, a good quality pencil.</li>
    <li> No smear all day. A little hard to apply but it&#x27;s not an issue to me at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Simple. Nothing fancy. Everyday wear.</li>
    <li> the color is way too cool for me&lt;br /&gt; i&#x27;m chinese with black black hair, but im quite tan for an asian since i live in southern california, so it makes my eyebrows look very cool just not right</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great product that could replace one of my eyebrow pencils that I&#x27;ve been using religiously and now I only have an inch left (and the name of the brand faded off).  I am a tanned asian with really dark brown hair. Despite what I have heard that is, using a eyebrow pencil that is two shades lighter than my hair color, the brown eyebrows do not look natural whatsoever. This has a medium shaded gray color that&#x27;s a bit smokey. I also like that you have to apply some pressure to get some color out of it. If it comes off so easily on your brows you would have less control of it and the color may be too harsh. Then you would have to keep going over it with a spooly. So I really think the fact that you have to apply some pressure and the color pigment isn&#x27;t so dark gives you better control of shaping your eyebrows and to applying different color depths to different places of the brow. I also LOVE the spooly on the other end of it. The only knock-off is--it&#x27;s a bit expensive for me.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love this eyebrow pencil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m biracial (black and white) with yellow undertones. I have dark brown hair and have naturally thick, black brows, but with fine hairs (if that makes sense). So, there is a lot of filling in that needs to happen. My eyebrows have always been the one part of my makeup routine that I&#x27;ve been the most &amp;#34;scared&amp;#34; of. The most I ventured into eyebrow territory is purchasing a tinted gel from Anastasia (color: granite) and using it occasionally. Finding colors has been difficult and I needed something that was easy to apply and could help me avoid the evil stepmother look considering I&#x27;m a newbie to eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews, I was intrigued and ordered this product. It is FANTASTIC! I love the unique shape of the pencil. Allows me to fill in my brows just slightly, but still looks natural. Easy to apply and lasts all day on my oil prone skin. I also love the little spoolie on the other end, although it&#x27;s impossible to keep the cap on it.</li>
    <li> Love how natural this brow pencil looks! It&#x27;s definitely worth the price, and it has saved me alot of time in the mornings:)</li>
    <li> I am very low maintenance with my makeup and I buy everything from the drugstore. My eyebrow hair is black (even though the hair on my head is brown) and thin and my eyebrows are very sparse. This is why a black/grey pencil is necessary for a natural look, and drugstore brands just don&#x27;t have this type of pencil available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this pencil because the color is not super dark. It is buildable, too. This pencil is great for sparse brows because the color goes on so lightly until you build it. I just use really short, light strokes (really more like pokes) on my eyebrows, and then I use the brush end to smooth it all out. Eyebrows completely change the look of your entire face, so I am so happy to have found an eyebrow pencil that works for my brows.</li>
    <li> Gray is very hard to find in an eyebrow pencil.  I like this one very much for the color it is and the way it keeps a sharp tip.  Would recommend it.  Got it quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Pencil broke in the middle so you only got half to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color of this eyebrow pencil!  I don&#x27;t have brown eyebrows, and I don&#x27;t have black eyebrows...they&#x27;re sort of somewhere in between, and so is this color.  It&#x27;s a soft pencil, so it doesn&#x27;t pull at your existing eyebrows.  I&#x27;m addicted, for sure.</li>
    <li> I would really prefer a regular pencil type stick</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a black eyebrow pencil that didn&#x27;t make me look like a tranny. I love this one. No more sharpie eyebrows! It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I want an eyebrow which is very natural and doesn&#x27;t come out too dark. This is what I want. I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to spend forever on my brows. The unusual angle of the pencil is perfect for quickly filling and shaping brows. I purchased #3 Gray-black which I was scared may be too dark, but it&#x27;s actually perfect. It pretty much blends seamlessly into my brows. For reference, I have black hair. A pure black pencil would have made me look severe and a lighter brown tends to look too reddish on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this eyebrow pencil. When I bought it I had my doubts of quality and how well the color would match. I have medium ash brown eye brows, and this matches PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on amazingly well, and blends so good! It comes with a spoolie on the other end so you can easily blend it. The color is very rich, and applies very smoothly. The really nice thing is that you only need a little bit because when you blend it, it goes a very long way! Product stays on all day but easily washes off with face wash and water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really amazed as well that this product does not smudge or transfer if you accidentally touch your brows. I had an itch and wiped my finger over my brow and then thought &amp;#34;Oh no!&amp;#34; but I looked at my finger, and there was no color there. I checked my brows in the mirror and they were still there!&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest this eyebrow pencil to anyone who is looking for a cheaper alternative from the name brands, but also wants something that works very well.</li>
    <li> The first color I got was the dark brown and I really liked the ease of use, sometimes it looked a little too red on my brows so I decided to order the gray black too.  I just opened it and took the cap off and the whole stick within the housing fell on the floor &#x3D;(  I stuck it back in, but it wasn&#x27;t attached and falls out each time I take off the cap.</li>
    <li> While the spoolie is great and the pencil itself seems to work perfectly, I prefer products that are very light (ex: Skinfood chocolate eyebrow powder or Face Shop eyebrow powder) so I can build on it to create the perfect eyebrows. This pencil gives me too much product with each swipe. I have to be extra extra extra gentle when using it. I prefer my powders.</li>
    <li> Its really good for asians because of the color selection it has. A little goes a long ways and I feel like its not too soft so it doesn&#x27;t apply too much. Its gives very natural brows</li>
    <li> I love this! Definitely what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have bought all the Anastasia Brow stuff and everything that goes with it.  I saw a review on this particular brow pencil and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  It is now my favorite.  It just works for me.  It&#x27;s cheaper, too.  The cap on the spooly part doesn&#x27;t stay on though, and the pencil occasionally falls out.  It&#x27;s weird.  They need to work on that.  However, the color is the perfect shade for my Asian brows.  I went to a local shop to have my brows done and the lady used brown on me.  I looked like a completely ridiculous clown.  You can clearly see I have jet black hair and light black brows.  Nowhere on my body do I have brown hair!</li>
    <li> Great for dark/brown black hair! Deposits just the right amount of color so brows look natural.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner lead kept falling out! Annoying to use because I could not hold the pencil upside down - had to be careful picking this up</li>
    <li> mine almost gone. already stock up for more. very natural, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used many kinds of eyebrow pencils from high end to drugstore and this one is the best. I love the brush that comes on one end of it also.</li>
    <li> color is too heavy, looks unnatural. also the other end to brush it out is hard to uncap and use. lancome&#x27;s brow liner is by far better</li>
    <li> It looks very natural, and it&#x27;s easy to use! However, the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; keeps on falling, it won&#x27;t stay inside the pencil holder... but overall it&#x27;s great because the spoolie is so cute and fun to play with</li>
    <li> While I love Smashbox&#x27;s eyebrow kit, I wanted to find something easier to use. I&#x27;ve seen so many great reviews about Lioele and was definitely not disappointed. This was VERY easy to use, and I love that it wasn&#x27;t pitch black.</li>
    <li> This is perfect if you have black hair. Every other eyebrow pencil for black hair shows reddish undertones on my skin or comes out really dark black, but this is perfect. It&#x27;s very subtle and light gray (though you can build up more and make it darker if you want).&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the free shipping for a product all the way from South Korea (a very high quality product mind you).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and owned this product before, tried some different brands and am now back to this one.  If you have soft black or black hair this color will be very natural, flattering on your brows.  Lioele Auto Eyebrow pencil is affordable and is good quality.  The package is cute.  It&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a cap for the spoolie end of the pencil too.  The product applies well, but before first use, it needs to be warmed (swatched on back of hand or on arm) a bit for better pigmentation. There&#x27;s a slight slant/triangular shape to the actual product which helps with easier and natural application, you can definitely get a bolder brow look if desired too.  It&#x27;s a personal preference but if you want you can use a brow mascara to set your brows if you like, I don&#x27;t find that I need to though.  Definitely will be re-buying after I finish the one I just received.  Lioele has great products and each product I have some across from this brand has never failed me.  Bottem line: this brow pencil is the best one I&#x27;ve come across by far.</li>
    <li> I (along with many Asians) have black-gray eyebrows. I don&#x27;t naturally have black hair. I naturally have light brown hair and colour matching my eyebrows with my hair was always a nightmare. I have tried everything from the famous Anastasia brow pencil, MAC slim brow pencils, and a mixture of two brown MAC eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masking my black-gray eyebrows made me look way beyond my years and looked very drawn on and fake. I heard about the Lioele Auto Eyebrow Pencil from a Youtube makeup artist, FrmHeadtoToe. She has the same eyebrow colour as I do, and although I was skeptical about using a light black pencil, I figured I could just add this to my failed attempts. What&#x27;s one more, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pencil deposits a light amount of colour (but is also very buildable). It gives you that natural and effortless full brow look without looking like Joan Crawford. The spoolie brush end is soft enough to blur out any edges and doesn&#x27;t erase any colour from your brows. The lasting power is fantastic. I don&#x27;t even use eyebrow gel anymore. Anyway, if you have had the same issues as me with eyebrow products just buy the Lioele Auto Pencil. You will never be more proud of a pruchase.</li>
    <li> I love this auto eyebrow pencil.  It looks very natural, the packaging is very nice as well, it comes with a spooley on one end which comes in handy to blend out.  Make sure you do small strokes to get the most natural look. I ordered the Grey/Black color.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil is so easy to use and it&#x27;s super convenient with it&#x27;s brush end. Looks very natural and lasts!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it ): I only give it two stars because the brush side has come in handy but that&#x27;s about it.I have the one in gray and it applied on really weird like a faded color that made my eyebrows look sooo weird.Anyway..it broke off like three days later so now I just use to brush side</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered now. Love this product especially now that it has dropped price since I first tried it. Color isn&#x27;t harsh at all. It looks totally natural unless you like it darker then just keep applying.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite eyebrow pencil - I have naturally black hair, and even though the entirety of the internet convinced me to use brown liners/shadows to fill in my brows...it just looked weird. The grey pencil is AMAZING, and it&#x27;s tapered at one end so the line is nice and precise.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery with sweet little gifts. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve procrastinated buy this pencil for a year and what a waste of time.  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and the perfect shade.  It really makes the brows look natural and defined.  This is a must-have.  The pencil has a chiseled and tapered tip, which makes application much easier.  The brush at the other end works very well to feather/soften any lines.  Using this pencil is fool-proof.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shade! It&#x27;s very natural looking on me. I have black hair with brown highlights. I&#x27;ve tried many brands from the drugstore, but the shade was always off. I will definitely be stocking up on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking to buy this product from a while now from sites like Pretty and Cute but it was about $20 for the eyebrow pencil and shipping. This is a fraction of the price! The product goes on much more smoothly than I anticipated and has just the right amount of pigment. However, the color is a bit more grey-ish in tone than I expected, but it is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> the eyebrow pencil makes it easy to do your eyebrows quickly. on one end is the angled pencil that goes on somewhat light-handed and you won&#x27;t end up with super dark eyebrows unless you keep on drawing it on. the other end is a brush to clean up unruly eyebrows. my only complaint was that the silver cap doesn&#x27;t stay on - perhaps a defective?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with picking the right brow product for my Asian hair because dark browns tend to pull too warm on me no matter which I choose.  My previous brow product was Anastasia Brow Wiz in Brunette which I thought would be right since the hair around my face is lighter than the back.  I loved the thin nib but it was just too warm and looked unnatural.  This product has a thicker triangular shaped nib which is more effective for shading in and filling sparseness but I will say that the Brow Wiz is better for faking thin hairs.  Another difference is this one is a lot harder than the other product so you have to press down harder but you do have more control.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for natural looking brows for black/dark brown haired people. Love the brush want at the other end which helps to blend the product.</li>
    <li> very disappointed, I received a broken product. the pencil part had broken so every time i open the cap the product falls out</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I&#x27;m Asian so I bought the gray black color and it blends into my eyebrows pretty nicely. I just use a little bit and make sure to draw in short strokes to make it look more natural.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with this pencil. Its awesome but at times frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+Gives your eyebrows a natural looking fill&lt;br /&gt;+Easy to use since its mechanical&lt;br /&gt;+Has a great spoolie on the other end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Cap falls off everytime, lost it eventually&lt;br /&gt;-When using it you have to do a few strokes on your hand to warm up the product or you wont get any color at all on your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;-Not as long lasting as others (maybe about 4 hours or so)</li>
    <li> It looks really natural as long as you use light strokes. The spoolie works great too (: I love it.</li>
    <li> One of the best eyebrow pencils I found. The applicator tip is well designed for drawing thick eyebrows (not good for drawing thin) and the color appears very natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using brown on my brows forever, even after my hair color turned into a mix of silver gray and brown. Using brown always made me look harsh and it never occurred to me that brown was wrong for my brows. Shopping at Ulta, looking for a new brow pencil, a makeup artist recommended I use grays. I bought a soft, mushy textured pencil that served to color the hair in my eyebrows but was useless for shaping or filling in as it left way too much color. I came to Amazon and ordered this product hoping it would work and I&#x27;m pleased to say, it did. The Lioele Auto Eyebrow #3 Gray Black is a firm, dry pencil allowing me to fill in and enhance the shape of my brows and the color is perfect for my hair coloring. I&#x27;m ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Not soft enough and make eyebrows too harsh.  But I do like the brush, it is very soft comparing to the Anastasia Eyebrows pen that I own.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I&#x27;m no brow expert, but with a little patience and small strokes, you can easily achieve fuller brows. This product easily fills in the sparse areas that need a little help. The spooley part of the pencil makes blending a breeze. It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out--I am acne prone and have combination skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The only eyebrow pencil I will buy from now on. Perfect color for an Asian like me. The pencil will always be sharpened and comes with a spoolie, so you don&#x27;t need anything else. This is HG for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m chinese with dark features and this brow pencil is insanely great. It can produce a natural to dramatic brow with ease. The brush at the end is super soft. The shipper also added 2 samples of Lioele Waterdrop Sleeping Pack.</li>
    <li> This is by far the easiest eyebrow product that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to overdo, and it only takes a couple of strokes thanks to the wide but skinny angled nib, which allows for fast and/or specific coverage. Color stays on all day and even through a moderate amount of sweat. The spoolie is good, my one nitpick is that the cap comes off a bit easily. Will definitely repurchase this when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice pencil with good holding power. Perfect color match for anyone with really dark brown or black head and eyebrow hair that doesn&#x27;t want to have that drawn on look you can sometimes get with warm tone browns that are usually recommended for brunettes. My only complaint is that the pencil broke easily with the first couple weeks of use and caused me to lose some of the product.</li>
    <li> Actually one of the tool that I loved using for my brows. Got in gray or black. Easy to use n good for beginners.</li>
    <li> First brand I see that offers a grey-tone vs a brown tone. I have Asian black hair, so it only makes sense to fill in my brows with a black pencil. This works as stated.. The caps were a bit flimsy and broke off after one or two uses. The pencil itself lasted a long time, so I will definitely keep buying until I find something better</li>
    <li> This is not bad, except the powder pencil fell out after one use.  I pushed it back in with a lot of pressure and it worked fine since.  It&#x27;s more towards the grey than black, it works well with my big black glasses.  I also have black hair, if you want to know...  I don&#x27;t notice it coming off any more than my other (Sally&#x27;s) brow powder pencil.  Also didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or anything, pretty good.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Perfect eyebrow pencil. I love the grey black for my black eyebrows on my fair skin. Really difficult to find grey pencils in the drugstore. The shape of the tip (kind of like a teardrop on its side) is perfect for eyebrow shading.. so much easier than a pencil point and trusting your own hand! I think I&#x27;m on my third one, and Amazon always has good prices for it.</li>
    <li> When applied it is fairly natural looking. It applies very smoothly and not clumpy at all. The brush feature is nice to really blend in w/ the hair follicles. Will try the dark brown next.</li>
    <li> I must admit I&#x27;m not a big makeup addict, but I love this pencil. The shape of the pencil lead (?) helps you draw in your eyebrows so much and the spoolie at the end helps soften the marks you made for a realistic drawn in brow.</li>
    <li> Perfect for black hair. Perfeccctt!</li>
    <li> Received the item 7 weeks after ordering from &amp;#34;Cosmetic Love&amp;#34; with standard shipping. The lead stick falls out of the housing tube onto the floor every time I open the cap or hold the pencil tip side down. When leaving it in a purse, the cap comes off... Never purchase this again!  Update: Found a better version &amp;#34;Design My Eyebrow&amp;#34; at a loca store &amp;#34;The Face Shop&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> After trying Lioele&#x27;s eyebrow crayon, I will never be using another eyebrow product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I had been searching for a natural-looking way to fill in my sparse eyebrows. This was always difficult since they are jet black, and many other brow pencils make me look cartoonish. Then I started researching asian products and I stumbled across the Lioele brand. I thought I might as well try it since it was cheaper than many other brands, even drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the end of the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; is thick and tapered, which means more precise, controlled strokes. Also, there is a spoolie brush at one end which helps spread out the product and make it appear more natural. My favorite thing about this product is the creamy texture and the ability to layer on as little or as much as I desire that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am obviously very glad I purchased this product, and I have recommended it to many of my asian friends. I just wish I could find it in stores near me instead of having to wait 2 weeks for delivery.</li>
    <li> It is a good eyebrow pencil, very good service,quick delivery also welldone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a previous over-plucker. Eyebrows take forever to grow back...I know this from experience. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t look too painted on and this pencil combo does the trick. (I hope!) When I see pictures of myself now, I don&#x27;t see these oddly shaped brows staring back at me anymore. The color is good :)</li>
    <li> Really love this eyebrow pencil. LIke how it doesn&#x27;t come out too dark. Ordered the grayish one. It took a little long getting here bc it shipped all the way from Korea!</li>
    <li> Not really what I wanted .. wanted gray.</li>
