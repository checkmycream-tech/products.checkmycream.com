<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Huge bottle, great price.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product as I&#x27;m a student and trying to save money. I have used other Tresemme styling products (i.e. the mouse and hairspray) for my fine, curly hair and they have worked fine before but nothing I was in \\&quot;Ah\\&quot; over. I honestly anticipated this product to way down my hair and make it limp and straight (due to the weight as again...my hair is fine); however this didn&#x27;t happen! I was honestly surprised that this shampoo made my hair silky soft and my curls stayed and my hair has more volume. I am really surprised and it helps that I can buy this at my local Wal-mart :-)</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s not a thick type of shampoo. Works very well will Tresemme Vitamin E Moisture Rich Conditioner, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am a guy with medium-length, regular hair. I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance when it comes to my hair, I don&#x27;t condition and I use a small amount of hair gel daily. This shampoo is great value for money, and good quality too. Doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell, lathers up easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry, in fact it gives my hair a healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked one star off because I think the bottle should come with a pump nozzle. It is a large bottle and can be cumbersome to wield. Aside from that I would definitely buy it again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> we use both the conditioner and the shampoo.  and it works.  my daughter doesnt even have to straighten her hair after blowdrying.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE - WORKS FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> Not much to say except, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it with the matching conditioner, and my hair is so soft, it is crazy.</li>
    <li> My hair is kinda frizzy and dry, especially in Southern California.... this stuff really helps it stay smooth.  Noticeable difference from other &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shampoos</li>
    <li> Great Price  Awesome Shampoo</li>
    <li> Si tiendes a padecer de caspa no lo use por lo menos a mi me agrava y me reseca el pelo</li>
    <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or matted I even had to check to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using the conditioner because my hair was so soft and supple during the shampoo process I&#x27;m so used to my hair being stripped down but not anymore. This is sooooooo good.</li>
    <li> Smells good, cleans my hair well, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. Works like a charm on my hair :)</li>
    <li> Good smell but better price at Costco</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo. What else is there to say? I&#x27;m a guy and I love it. Amazon is a great place to buy it. Convenient and cheap.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing great things about TRESemme products and I was very curious to try them. My hair is really long and thick, very wavy and sometimes can be a little bit coarse so I couldn&#x27;t decide between the &#x27;FLAWLESS CURLS HYDRATING&#x27; Shampoo and Conditioner or the &#x27;SMOOTH &amp; SILKY&#x27; line, so I bought both.&lt;br /&gt;I parted my hair into two sections, washing one side with the Flawless Curls and the other side with the Smooth and Silky and then followed with the conditioners. When my hair was wet there was no noticeable difference, both sides felt really good but after air drying there was a HUGE difference. The Flawless Curl side felt rough, dry and slightly &#x27;trashy&#x27; while the Smooth &amp; Silky side was incredibly soft, sleek, bouncy and very shiny. And though the &#x27;Flawless&#x27; side was clearly much wavier I was not very impressed with that result but since all of the products are so reasonably priced it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I definitely will be using the TRESemme SMOOTH &amp; SILKY line as my regular shampoo and conditioner. They are VERY impressive and totally rate a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really great and when used with the accompanying conditioner makes my hair feels really good. I recommend it...</li>
    <li> First try, I love it already. I didn&#x27;t order it from Amazon. I actually bought this from local government supermarket price chopper, this item is on sale, only 2.99. Today is my first try and I love it already. I can feel my hair much lighter and smoother. I feel so good and so happy just buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a light smell, not really floral, not fruity.  It&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy the conditioner to go with it, so that may make a significant difference in the feel of your hair.  I wasn&#x27;t really wowed at all.  I used RedKen prior to this, and THAT stuff left my hair like silk.  But it&#x27;s not a big deal to me... it is an average shampoo overall.  I don&#x27;t feel like it dries out my hair, weighs it down, or anything.  It leaves it feeling clean.  Not an overwhelming lather, but not none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have three girls living at home and they all have long hair.  All three of my girls love this shampoo.  They tell me they like the way it makes their hair feel and smell.  Another thing they like (as do I)  It does not take much soap to clean your hair.  We will buy again.</li>
    <li> This was a great product though sadly I used it once. It fell in the tub during the day and the entire bottle dripped down the drain. Let&#x27;s just say u could hear my screams for miles.</li>
    <li> The product is okey, but the packaging was a disaster! When i received it, the lid was broken and shampoo was all over in the box!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really cheap, under $4 a bottle, and it seems to really make my hair smoother than the swave products that i have been using before switching to this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one my friend had used for a while, and I ended up trying. It&#x27;s got a very nice smell (unisex. not strong scented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s apparently good for hair as well, though I can&#x27;t attest to that; but it is definitely very well priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am really surprised. I came from Macadamia Hair shampoo and conditioner (real stuff, not like on amazon) which is like much more expensive for a lot less - but had amazing results - no way anyone could complain with that stuff. While the Tresemme isnt nearly as good, with this price point, its an amazing value. The argan oil is really the main benefit - and it works well. Knowing from what I came from, I can definitely live with this shampoo for the money I save - its a good shampoo that will get the job done - with an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Great product, does exactly what I was looking for.  My only complaint is that this product wasn&#x27;t in its own plastic bag like the conditioner I bought also at this time.  It leaked over some of my other items, but didn&#x27;t ruin anything.  Still a great product</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this shampoo and the fact that it was a great value.  The subtle Moroccan oil scent is pleasant and the product does a good job at cleaning my thick mop.  Rinses completely and feels refreshing to my scalp.</li>
    <li> This works very well in the very hard water we have here. The scent is subtle and the shampoo suds up smoothly, and rinses clean. Both mine and my kids&#x27; hair are shiny and soft. I plan to order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and the coordinating conditioner - it is the only thing that will keep my daughters long hair tangle free - even after a night sleeping with her hair down!</li>
    <li> I like Tresemme products.  This shampoo works well, without it being tested on animals.  I use it with the Tresemme conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have dry brittle and thick hair that looks beautiful when it has the right products. I stumbled across this and it is amazing for my hair. I had no clue it helps with regrowth which is a bonus with thyroid condition (noticed slight thinning). I cant wait to try it with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Wife has thinning hair so she wanted to try it. Says she dose feel it has helped.  But don&#x27;t expect it to work like Rogaine.</li>
    <li> just love the way my woman&#x27;s hair feels after she used this shampoo. I would recommend it highly to anyone..</li>
    <li> I got  4 of these and i was happy with my purchase. the only reason im giving 3 stars is because the packaging was not the greatest. When i got my package the bottle had leaked some shampoo and got on the other stuff i ordered. I really hope amazon starts  shipping these in a better package to prevent spillage.</li>
    <li> And stripped of oils. It has a plasticky feel afterwards. I think they skimped on the Argan oil. The writing on the bottle is like a 12th grader from East Los Angeles is head of their marketing dept.</li>
    <li> NIce, but buily-up-y. Not sure if anything at this price point will not be. Again great line, no animal testing and decent ingredients.</li>
    <li> I WAS EXPERIMENTING AND IT DIDN&#x27;T DO A VERY GOOD JOB ON &amp;#34;MY&amp;#34; HAIR.  SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO WHAT I ALWAYS USE.</li>
    <li> It works really well I really like it will last a long time and definitely one of my favorite shampoos thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> From the first use of the shampoo I felt the difference from the rest of the other products have Ausita my girlfriend to use it, I recommend its use shampoo wonderful</li>
    <li> ....said &amp;#34;with Moroccan oil&amp;#34;, but not listed. Did nothing spectacular for my hair. Garnier Fructis with Moroccan oil in ingredients is much better....very soft, frizz free and shiny hair...which is saying a lot for my 46year old always dry super curly hair. This Tresemme did nothing. AND it was poorly packaged ad came with contents leaked out to boot. Sticking with Garnier....just switched for bigger bottle, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that years ago I used several tresseme products and I hated them all.. Couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and felt like they did nothing for my dry curly hair...well I was still always curious about the &#x27;smooth and silky&#x27; line so the other day I decided to pick the conditioner up at target (I have yet to try the shampoo)...well I was truly in shock when I used it in the shower, let my hair air dry (I don&#x27;t like to use heat) and noticed a HUGE difference in the frizz and dryness..WOW! I just can&#x27;t believe that I hate all of their other products but this one is just amazing! It works like a professional frizz fighting conditioner! I just can&#x27;t believe it haha.. I will definitely be buying this again and I advise that anyone out there that has frizzy/dry hair give this is a try!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this product mainly made my hair smooth not that soft so if u want softness then go for another conditioner such as Redken All Soft or something..</li>
    <li> A friend recommended I switch to Tresemme as I was complaining about my current shampoo/condition routine leaving my hair feeling more brittle than usual. Within one use, my hair already started feeling more hydrated and softer. I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme for about a week or two now and my hair is unbelievable soft and the frizz I had previously is much tamer. I love the product and can&#x27;t rate it high enough.</li>
    <li> I finally found a shampoo that contained ammonium laurel sulfate (vs sodium laurel sulfate which makes my hair greasy and ALL shampoos are changing over to now) b/c my local stores do not carry shampoos with this anymore. I was ecstatic and I even asked the question to make sure previous owners had actually received bottles that stated so. I ordered 2 bottles and was extremely dissapointed when what I was sent was exactly what I could go to the store and buy--the sodium version--what I did not want.  On top of that I went to return the items and it isn&#x27;t eligible for return! The only positive is that I chatted with a rep and I didn&#x27;t even have to tell him what was wrong with purchase/item before refunded full price onto card.  Needless to say I continue to be a happy amazon customer. The problem was resolved extremely quickly. I do hope the seller/reps see this so the item can be corrected to represent the correct item being sold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice shampoo, my hair feels really smooth afterwards. The price is too high though. At any grocery store: Albertson&#x27;s, Target and etc. you can get a bottle with 5 dollar or less.</li>
    <li> The shampoo, leaves my frizzy hair very smooth and silky, but I feel like I have to shampoo more often. Other shampoos keep my hair clean for days.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an  OK  &#x27;all-purpose&#x27;  shampoo,  but nothing special!  (I&#x27;d heard a lot about &#x27;Tressame&#x27;  on different Style shows,  etc. &amp; was expecting something a bit better i guess,  I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Fekkai&#x27;  for years &amp; love it,  but just can&#x27;t afford it anymore)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for something inexpensive, it works fine,  but i doubt i will buy it again -</li>
    <li> Like that you get as much as you do for the price that you pay.  It lasts a long time and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tresemme for many years and have always had great results. This is an inexpensive way too having great looking hair. (Oh La Lah)</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 3 different tresemme shampoos including this one and they&#x27;ve all dried my scalp out bad the ingredients in it are very drying/damaging do not use this shampoo unless you want a dry scalp the only good thing I can say about tresemme is that you get 3 times as much shampoo in the bottle than other shampoos other than that all tresemme shampoos are garbage don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> low price, good smell and as far as a guy with short hair knows... it makes my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> i really like argan oil as it has helped me moisturize my face and know, I can put it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after seeing all the good reviews. It is good product, but I don&#x27;t like the bottle design. I hope I just press it and then get the shampoo. while you are taking shower, the bottle become really slippery and dropped couple of times during the shower and I hated that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some leak during delivery, I think it is also because of bad bottle design.</li>
    <li> I like how this shampoo leaves my hari looking glossy and good.</li>
    <li> its great foundation for my hair. I use this product three times a week.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think one shampoo would be that much better than the many others I tried, but this is. I&#x27;m glad I trusted the other reviews here.</li>
    <li> Came leaking in the carton, didn&#x27;t seem to be able to thoroughly rinse this product or of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had to try it as soon as I got it and am so happy I did.  The product leaves your hair so silky and smooth.  Clean and fresh smelling too.  It is a great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> My hair is medium lenght,thick and very dry and for the longest it seemed that my shampoo worsened it&#x27;s state,i washed and condition my hair with tresemme&#x27;s product and the result was soft and manageable shiny hair! Im hooked.</li>
    <li> This is the most outstanding product for those ladies who have uncontrollable frizz hair. The hair that gets frizzy once it receives the humidity of the air. This is the one product that can control all of your frizzy tips. It will as well leave your hair looking very long and smooth. Your hair will bounce as you walk down the street. The shampoo and the conditioner together will make you hair look full of volume and thick as well. The Vitamin H and Protein silk are the main two ingredients that help the hair look at the best than it can. Having the most wonderful hair if most of what a girl as wished for. Most of the women are tired of having nappy, knotty, and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt; I always tried looking for that one product that was able to control my frizzy hair, was able to make it look like those television female hair models. Nothing worked! I tried everything that I could. I just wanted my hair to be smooth and soft. The very first time I used the Tresemme shampoo and the Tresemme conditioner my hair had never felt so soft before.  Not only did it last the day but it as well lasted until the second day, perhaps even longer. My hair looked long, shiny, and smooth. I was able to run my fingers through my hair as if it were a waterfall. Not only that but my hair seemed as if I straighten it but it was the natural look that this product gave me. I have never been happier with a product result, with this one being an exception. Sometimes when I go back home for the weekend I can&#x27;t shower unless it&#x27;s this exact same product that I&#x27;m using because other shampoos just make my hair frizzy and stay in knots. Also can I mention how much we females dislike dandruff that other shampoos leave us? Well not this one, this is also another advantage of using this product. I honestly have no negative feedback to give about this product.&lt;br /&gt; There have been many people that have complimented my hair in fact. I always receive the compliments whether I straighten my hair or if it&#x27;s naturally like that and I&#x27;m very glad to respond by saying that it&#x27;s my natural hair, that I just showered. Recently I went to the beach to surf on the weekend; once I got out of the water and my hair was dry I got asked another question that made me glad. I was asked by a lady what product I use on my hair because it looked as if I didn&#x27;t even go to the beach. Once again I was really astonished that I could say that I don&#x27;t use anything. Not to mention that I have dyed my hair three times in the last year! This product is what makes my hair look undamaged! I can&#x27;t believe that I have dyed my hair three different colors and I was able to find a product that is color protected. Again, this shampoo of course isn&#x27;t labeled color protected its labeled smooth and silky! This is why I got it! This is how I use the shampoo, I shower with warm water at first, shampoo, and then when I condition I use the conditioner mainly on my tips, a little touch of it before touching my roots and then I rinse in cold fresh water. I would have to give this product a full 5 star rating, if there was more I would. This product is ridiculously magical.&lt;br /&gt;  Ladies if you want a magical miracle that finally makes your hair look like the hair from the television models this is it! Don&#x27;t look back on other pages for other products this one really does work and I&#x27;m just an ordinary, eighteen years old, college student. Also remember that this product doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot like other salon products. It is very economically for anyone that wants soft, smooth, and silky hair. I was finally able to find a product that gives the best results ever. Come one ladies, click the button \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; along by purchasing the conditioner. You won&#x27;t regret it. Once you do that, next time your online to look other shampoo products don&#x27;t forget to rebuy this special one.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for the price and works amazing on my hair. I love having the options on amazon that beat the prices of in store all in the comfort of my home. Nothing like doing all your shopping after work curled up under the blankets on the couch.</li>
    <li> love it. cheap and it works. I used to use expensive shampoo and conditional but after reading reviews of Tresemme, decided to give it a try and so glan I got this.</li>
    <li> Never thought my favorite shampoo would be a drugstore shampoo but this stuff is amazing...we ran out and my husband kept asking for it...it makes my long hair SMOOTH and so soft. We use the conditioner as well.  It also is NOT greasy.  Definitely cannot live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and lathers great</li>
    <li> my hair used to be dried out,frizzy between haircuts.Not anymore since i started using Tresemme Smooth&amp;Silky.I guess it&#x27;s secret could be it contains Moroccan Oil. But the results have actually been quite good! Of course I&#x27;m being more careful with the hair dryer,(I use the cool setting) but you can&#x27;t beat the results! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who may have dry split ends,too much frizz  to try it.You got nothing to lose,smells pretty decent too.I gave it 4stars because,there&#x27;s always room for improvement.</li>
    <li> I tried several other brands of shampoo with Argan oil. I found this is the best. Not only the price is the lowest but also is the quality second to none. It cleans my hair nicely and add volume. It does not flat my hair like other brands I have tried. The smell is also about just right for me. strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually like all the Tresemme products but this one tops the list as it really controls hair fall and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and a nice product, good value for New York shopping, would recommend to other potential buyers. Does what it says on the bottle.</li>
    <li> the texture is too thick. this is not for someone who likes to feel fresh after shampooing hairs. I should have paid more attention to the fact that it has &#x27;oil&#x27; in it.</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo for my fine, straight hair. the main thing I want my shampoo to do is to clean my hair without weighing it down. this shampoo does just that for me and the reviews were all very good.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t so great. First of all I ordered from a seller and got a &#x27;Silk Protein &amp; Vitamin H&#x27; version, tried it and it would lather minimally and smelled strange. I checked the lot number and it was manufactured in 2010; it was effectively expired. So, if you get this older version of the shampoo then return it at once because it is discontinued and probably expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I got this new version that contains Argan Oil. So I put it in, massaged, rinsed it out. I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with the results. The smell is good, it isn&#x27;t too feminine, so guys can use it. However, the shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t work any &#x27;7x&#x27; wonders it proclaims. Instead, my hair &amp; scalp were left a tad dry. Though not too dry but it doesn&#x27;t smooth out the hair as advertised so don&#x27;t get your hopes up. OK for cleaning hair, not so much for smoothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with some other personal items. This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
    <li> the best shamppo I&#x27;ve ever had! I just bought it with Tresemme conditioner last week,and today is the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have black, naturally staight, kind of oily hair. Never dyed or use flat or curl iron. The problem is just that my hair is sort of wavy I guess, in a bad way, that&#x27;s probably cause by my last haircut. and it&#x27;s also frizzy, which is weird cause I have oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo and the conditioner, my hair is straighter and softer,I can see the  difference after just One use! That is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo will purchase again!!!! Feels great smell great lots of compliments from friends easy order and shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> My uncle runs a high-end hair salon and has always recommended Tresemme&#x27;s shampoo. For the price you really cant beat the value. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is the best shampoo available on Amazon! I can&#x27;t believe such a huge bottle is only $4. It&#x27;s hard to tell how well the shampoo works because I use it with the Tresemme Smooth and Silky conditioner, but both products together make my hair look amazing. A lot of times the hair products I buy from Amazon will leave my hair either too greasy or a tangled mess, but this shampoo plus the conditioner is the perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy it!!</li>
    <li> I love Tresemme Products and was so happy to find the great prices Amazon offers.  Smells great and works well on all the different hair types we have in our house.</li>
    <li> It smells good. It doesnt regrow hair. Are you people high? Its shampoo, not some magic hair treatment.</li>
    <li> kinda helps relative to the previous one I used, but makes hair dry and doesn&#x27;t prevent losing hair.</li>
    <li> Good product! Arrived VERY early (in a day) - however, the description should be updated to mention it&#x27;s for dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I feel very neutral about this shampoo. I have incredibly oily hair--as in, I have to wash my hair everyday and it feels like oil begins to develop within a few hours of washing my hair. I love its size, and I could be harsher about the quality of the shampoo but it&#x27;s important to consider that it&#x27;s quite inexpensive for the amount it provides. I don&#x27;t like any shampoos that claim &amp;#34;2 in 1&amp;#34;, shampoo and condition in one. It almost feels like this is a 2 in 1 shampoo. It&#x27;s moisturizing and conditions your hair, but I was looking for just a shampoo. It does indicate that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;silky shampoo&amp;#34;, so I would assume that it&#x27;s suppose to have moisturizing qualities. I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate. For that, I would have to give it 4 stars. I have to consider I would super oily hair (super oily scalp) and this would probably work wonders for someone who has drier hair.</li>
    <li> Came busted and leaking all over the box and other items I ordered. This item was not eligible for return.</li>
    <li> All of there products are great. They can be interchangeable but diffently work best when they are all the same.</li>
    <li> Use this regularly and does a great job,  I have dry hair and my with oily and this works great on both of them, So glad I found it here as a great price also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Tresemme shampoo and so i was a little hesitant to purchase this item, but since it was an add-on deal on Amazon and the price was great, I thought I give it a try.  I am going to have a hard time finding such a great deal again, but the shampoo is great and do wish to purchase again, but won&#x27;t if the price does not come down again.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but it did make my hair soft and I am african american. So yeah</li>
    <li> does what it says just not the best if you want really nice curls can get this for half the price at Walmart</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo and it smells nice plus it get your hair clean. This one type of shampoo works better for women of color.... I&#x27;m just saying! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Moroccan Argan Oil is, but I enjoy the creamy shampoo. It does a good job on my hair, no sting in the eyes, and the 32 oz. bottle is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give hair that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feel that I&#x27;m used to prior to applying conditioner.  Hair feels like it&#x27;s got some sort of glop in it still.  Not sure it&#x27;s the best shampoo for normal hair.</li>
    <li> Was what I expected. Tresemme has great products. I bought the large size to last for&lt;br /&gt;a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Best value. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I purchased smooth and silky at my neighborhood store for the same price as Amazon. The bottle at the store said it has vitamin H in it and has less chemicals in it. They both smell the same and feel the same, my hair smells good and it feels really smooth. I like them both, but I think I will just buy mine at my local store from now on, since it has less chemicals and vitamin H.</li>
    <li> I Love this shampoo, it smells so wonderful and leaves your hair feeling so good!!</li>
    <li> I love silky smooth hair, and real silk protein plus vitamin H is a real bonus here! This helps protect your hair against damage from flat irons and other heat devices.</li>
    <li> its smooth. smells nice . and great... i dont know much about shampoo but it feels nice and its cheap</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it but my mom and sisters did. They said its a better product than the other shampoo we&#x27;ve ever bought. Besides that I cant tell you anything else.</li>
    <li> Takes less shampoo than other brands I&#x27;ve tried to get the same effect, really only a small dollop is enough for my fairly long and voluminous hair. Paired with the conditioner of the same brand and make, my hair is fluffy as ever. Towel-dries to the same fluffiness I would get blowdrying it.</li>
    <li> A huge bottle for cost effect hair cleaning. It is not overly scented, cleans and rinses out easily, and lasts a long time. For the price you cant get any better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and honestly it got the job done. My head felt completely clean so i&#x27;m satisfied in that aspect. However as of leaving my hair silky and amazing ...i&#x27;ve had better. So I started adding aloe vera gel from the actual plant and mixing it with this shampoo and it&#x27;s AMAZING! Hope that helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a shampoo snob, so I tend to get the pricier &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; stuff. I won&#x27;t make any specific references. They usually make my hair feel nicer and healthier. I have average hair, a little on the dry side, probably because I wash my hair daily. So i tend to stick to shampoo and conditioner that are for dry hair. I purchased this shampoo along with the conditioner, and I am overall pleased with its performance. This shampoo gets my hair clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out afterwards. The conditioner however is not very impressive. I suggest using another conditioner with this shampoo, because I think the conditioner actually dried my hair out more. I tried washing my hair with just the shampoo, and my hair was sleeker and softer than it was when I used it with the conditioner! If you have a favorite conditioner, stick with that one. Or you could probably get away with just using this shampoo without conditioner.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argain Oil, 32 Ounce, because my previous experience with it was excellent. But when my order was delivered, I found that, instead of this product, what package contained was the Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Vitamin H and Silk proteins, there is not Moroccan Argain Oil among its ingredients. This shampoo is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t let my hair as soft, shiny and flyaway as the product I ordered an paid for. That&#x27;s the reason for my low rate.</li>
    <li> LARGER AMOUNT THAN EXPECTED MAKING PRODUCT REASONABLY PRICED. PACKING EXCELENT TRANSACTION WAS FLAWLESS WITH FAST SHIPPING! PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever! Smells great and washes well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all watery and smells horrible. I saw it at Walmart after I bought it for $2 ! I was so upset!</li>
    <li> Oh my hair... how much torture it&#x27;s been through.  I wash my hair on a daily basis (have to, I go to the gym) and use my hair dryer and hair straightener each day.  It&#x27;s quite long, frizzy, curly... basically unruly.  Needless to say it&#x27;s super damaged from all the heat.  (Natural color though).  I&#x27;ve tried some other expensive brands and never found anything to make a difference.  Last week I purchased this with the conditioner and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days, but it&#x27;s already made a world of a difference.  My hair FEELS SOFT.  I don&#x27;t remember the last time I could ever say that.  The shampoo smells divine, gives a good lather, and the conditioner is great-- thick and makes my hair feel manageable.  When I brush my hair after the shower, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ripping it out of my head anymore.  I bought it at the local drugstore-- each bottle in 32oz was less than $5, can&#x27;t go wrong for that-- give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been pairing it with the Tresemme Keratin heat spray-- also like this as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, I shower daily and I bought this shampoo 8 months ago and it&#x27;s still not empty. Great value and smells great.</li>
    <li> I LIKE TRESEMME SHAMPOO IT MAKES LOTS OF SUDS AND LEAVES MY HAIR FEELING VERY SILKY.  IT SMELLS GOOD ALSO.</li>
    <li> I use to have long hair than I decided to get a bob , it started growing for a while but because I always straighten my hair , it dryed my hair out and started growing slowly . It&#x27;s now pass my shoulder by an inch or 2 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my mom started buying this shampoo and conditioner since her hair is getting dry due to dying it. I have to admit , it does make your hair smooth but for me , it didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. Same with my mothers , and we have Caucasian hair. Tresemme didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out, and I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of split ends in my hair. I knew if I went to get my hair trimmed and asked my hairdresser to get rid of my split ends, I&#x27;d be losing 3-4 inches of my hair since I have some old layers. I picked this out, hoping it would cure my split ends. Within the first few days, it almost seemed like my split ends were getting worse and my hair was fraying. I was kind of mad, but I was out of my old shampoo, so I just used it. After the first week, my hair looked and felt amazing! I haven&#x27;t noticed any split ends in a day or two [bought it a week and a few days ago], and my hair is softer and looks like I got a fresh trim. I recommend that if you get this product and are unhappy with it to give it a few days.</li>
    <li> makes my freezy hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product if you want to have hair that is silky smooth.  I have thick, long hair and Tresemme keeps it healthy, shiny and smooth.  I love the way that it smells.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It was ok. It didn&#x27;t seem muuuch different from any other drugstore product that i&#x27;d used, although if I had to go with a drugstore shampoo&amp;conditioner, it would be this one. It just didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like the others (like suave, that stuff is awful, strips your hair). other than that, wasn&#x27;t much of a difference. Maybe its just my hair type, who knows. Price is good.</li>
    <li> The cap is broken - when you press on it to open it does not stay opened but closes back by itself. Poor quality. Since it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item there is no way to return or replace it. Be careful when you buy add-on items from Amazon. If it is damaged you are stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Repaired my damaged hair and made it shine. Have continued to use this same product since the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Just used within the last hour. Pleasant scent. Hair very manageabe</li>
    <li> This is an excellent bargain product! Cheaper through Amazon and I don&#x27;t get sucked down into the whirling maelstrom that is Walmart! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for shiny beautiful hair and a large size bottle!</li>
    <li> The shampoo works, but it&#x27;s not our favorite.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good.  The price is outstanding and as such is a great value. I recommend this shampoo to all.</li>
    <li> Like the conditioner rate, I bought this shampoo because my hair needs vitamins.  I began to use conditioner and shampoo a few days and I will rate when I&#x27;ve used more.</li>
</ol>
