      <li>Great quality, the size of regular tongue rings except the bar is a tiny bit longer, hard plastic, neon colors, none of them are the same color.</li>
      <li>and they barely glow</li>
      <li>Kinda sad they didn&#x27;t send any green or orange but still very nice, especially if you have a metal allergy like me!</li>

    <li> Uncomfortable for me...don&#x27;t know about others but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast, thankfully cause I needed the change out from the metal bar I had. Sadly it was filled with doubles. 2 blue 2 white 2 pink 2 yellow 1 red 1 purple. They glow really well but you must remember to charge them. It seems like some of the bars are longer than others making it odd when you get a longer one after having a short one in for a while. Kinda sad they didn&#x27;t send any green or orange but still very nice, especially if you have a metal allergy like me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad I only got 8 and not 10. But I guess that&#x27;s okay. They&#x27;re very pretty colors. Some glow but I still love the colors</li>
    <li> Comfortable, i thought they would br flexible but its ok still and they barely glow</li>
    <li> I was so happy to order these but when I went to go unscrew it to put one in it just broke into pieces!!! I am so upset about this bc i really wanted them. SO two of them broke the same way. I am not happy that they broke and emailed the seller to let them know. I am happy with the price though.</li>
    <li> When I seen glow in the dark I was excited but when I got them in the mail I only got nine instead of ten. Also only a couple of them actually glow in the dark. But it was worth it&#x27;s price I still like the neon colors though.</li>
    <li> Love it even though it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
    <li> I got them on time , &amp; I&#x27;m currently wearing one . They&#x27;re really comfortable to have in your mouth .</li>
    <li> The red &amp;&amp; blue tongue rings balls cracked. I had doubles of red and blue...&amp;&amp; the bars are too short but over all I like them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t glow and bars were tooooo small...</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown in picture in proper packaging. I&#x27;m not too confident about the threading but we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> It said the bars would be acrylic, but they are steel. Which i am highly allergic to.</li>
    <li> These came very quickly and I am surprisingly very happy with my purchase! I&#x27;d say the only downer was is that I didn&#x27;t get a red one.. But I got everything else I saw in the picture which is great. The longer you expose them to bright light, the brighter they glow. I have a problem with accidently biting my tongue jewelry and breaking it but the barbells are bendable so I never have that problem anymore :) again, very happy!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t even glow, and they&#x27;re a lot less vibrant in color.</li>
    <li> A good buy! Love them!</li>
    <li> I got mine fast actialli but they do not glow in the dark 😥</li>
    <li> Great quality, the size of regular tongue rings except the bar is a tiny bit longer, hard plastic, neon colors, none of them are the same color.</li>
    <li> i got three of orange .</li>
    <li> great for the price but didn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
    <li> The tounge rings r so cute there not stell there fake plastic they dont glow in the dark the tounge rings come from China it takes up to a mouth n half to get the rings I got 10 rings four of them were the same colors I like em got em for a really good deal but takes along time to get em</li>
    <li> doesnt glow in the dark like i thought it would its rather glows with a black light</li>
    <li> I got two pairs, which is good for me since I&#x27;ve got my nipples done. They&#x27;re probably 15mm. They do glow well. You have to keep in mind that they need to absorb direct light in order to work!  Some colors don&#x27;t glow quite as well as others. This is to be expected in all glow in the dark products. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Cool colors, all glow bright in the dark</li>
