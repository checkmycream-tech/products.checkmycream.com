      <li>Envyderm is awesome!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so happy that I found Envyderm!</li>
      <li>AND IT&#x27;S VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS</li>
      <li>I was also very happy with the fact that it did hurt my eyelids or eyes in any way.</li>
      <li>Good luck guys! :D</li>
      <li>Works great, does not irritate the eyes and lashes grow beautifully!  </li>
      <li>In a good way!  </li>
      <li>Loved it!  </li>
      <li>which I feel this product delivers beautifully.</li>
      <li>have experienced no irritation or burning with it at all.</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product that didn&#x27;t give me any side effects; just the longer, thicker lashes I wanted.</li>
      <li>Was hoping this would be a great at home alternative</li>
      <li>I used it before my wedding and my lashes looked great.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>It grows lashes and is a great price.</li>
      <li>Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum works GREAT.</li>
      <li>Bought latisse works great</li>
      <li>After reading all the great reviews, I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Im gonna be very honest..</li>
      <li>Very effective.  </li>
      <li>As a Vine reviewer I could choose one from a list of interesting looking books, a kitchen scale for measuring perfect portions, or this serum.</li>
      <li>nice mascara!</li>
      <li>I have gotten good results with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle for a friend as well because i think it&#x27;s so good.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that this conditioner is great.</li>
      <li>It was a good buy for me.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend Envyderm as a good value from that perspective.</li>
      <li>The price was good</li>
      <li>I loved them</li>
      <li>She seems quite happy with the results, since I haven&#x27;t heard any more complaints from her.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find something safe.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the best time to consistently apply this is after washing my face and just before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the results since I started using this product about 6 weeks ago!</li>
      <li>The first good news was, I had no allergic symptoms with EnvyDerm!!!  </li>
      <li>I have also been using it on my bottom lashes and they are growing faster than my top lashes!    </li>
      <li>My eyelashes are thicker and longer giving a wonderful full top lash with a thinner bottom lash.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even work to maintain all the amazing growth that I had achieved with the Lilash serum that I was using before this.</li>
      <li>This was just as effective as Latisse</li>
      <li>And I honestly was prepared to complain about it if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have $50 to gamble, just go get some real nice mascara that you can test and have the option of returning at Sephora or fun falsies.</li>
      <li>(guess that&#x27;s a nice way of say</li>
      <li>/&gt;About the regain of lashes in the bottom part of my eyes, the experience has not been as effective.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I am the kind who will give anything a try just to satisfy my curiosity.</li>
      <li>I may research this kind of product again as the market seems to be filling up with options.  </li>
      <li>reason I&#x27;m happy is that I love the idea that my eyelashes are getting better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that my lashes will continue to grow and that in a couple more months I&#x27;ll be able to add a pleasant note to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So for those who are willing to use it every night, unlike me please purchase and share your experience with others and spread around how good it is!</li>
      <li>If anyone purchased this for the price here, I doubt they&#x27;d be very thrilled with the result, if the result was like the one I&#x27;ve experienced so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad that there are people who&#x27;ve had amazing results from this product.  </li>
      <li>but I liked it much better.  </li>
      <li>Then I got cheap and tried Envyderm based on the rather good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Envyderm Eyelash Enhancement and Conditioning Nighttime Serum works okay, but I did not get amazing results.</li>
      <li>If you have had success with this product, that&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>Have fun with it, I think it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
      <li>Consistency is very important.  </li>
      <li>These ingredients are very important constituents of Ayurvedic herbal medicines for prevention of hair loss and for hair nourishment.</li>
      <li>I would say the best thing you can do with this product is be consistent, use it every night after removing all of your makeup and right before you go to bed.</li>
      <li>I now DO take it off so I can use this product, so that may have some help in keeping my lashes healthy.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the Revitalash lash product.</li>
      <li>Both top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>but my lashes sure are.</li>
      <li>Surely a product designed for your eyes should not sting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>More of a gel that comes in a tube</li>
      <li>&quot; - for lack of better terms.</li>
      <li>Compared to Latisse that had many warnings and side effects, Envyderm sounded \\&quot;eye friendly\\</li>
      <li>This is the one and only eye lash growth treatment I have used, and I am very happy with my results.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping it would make it thicker and fuller too, but mostly a difference in length.</li>
      <li>Your reaction will probably something like &#x27;That sure is pesky&#x27; before you resume your night.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I listend to her.</li>
      <li>Are they better for having used Envyderm?</li>
      <li>I have indeed noticed more fullness with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments my lashes get.</li>
      <li>She feels they are more healthy and getting thicker.</li>
      <li>And when I do put on mascara they look substantial, much better than before using Envyderm.  </li>
      <li>sure* that my lashes are better,</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the results and and will order more when I run out.</li>
      <li>YOU&#x27;LL BE SATISFIED.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As with the mascara of same brand, this product is either old or no good.  It is supposed to be applied once at night for eyelash, eyebrow conditioning; however, it applies like old Vaseline.  I do not want replacement or refund; I will purchase a product that I know will be better, perhaps not via internet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my lashes for a while and have had nothing but bad luck. I tried a prescription medication to get them to grow more but had a bad reaction to it. This serum really made my lashes grow out quicker and fuller than they ever have before. Before my lashes were grown out, it seemed as if there was something missing from my face and I was very uncomfortable with the way I looked. Thanks to this serum, I don&#x27;t have to feel insecure about the way my face looks anymore. I have long, beautiful lashes that are full of volume. I highly recommend this product. A+</li>
    <li> My eyelids swelled and my eyelashes fell out.  It is not for everyone. Sent it back to Amazon for refund.</li>
    <li> Envyderm is awesome! I was really skeptical when I ordered this but my own lashes were in a bad way after continued use of false eyelashes had caused my natural lashes some damage. I was becoming conscious of this and really wanted to do something about it. I ordered Envyderm and have been using it for a month. I can&#x27;t believe the difference, I don&#x27;t just have my own lashes back, but they are fuller and longer looking than ever before, so I no longer feel the need to wear falsies anymore. I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle for a friend as well because i think it&#x27;s so good. By the way, this is by far the cheapest place to get it from. I saw it on sale for $99.99 at my local dermatologist!</li>
    <li> This product is very reasonably priced and yet it works so well much better than the $150 ones. Highly recommended to anybody who is seeking to have bigger eye-lashes with no side effects or the high cost</li>
    <li> The only thing this product did for my eyelashes was to make almost all of them fall out. Didn&#x27;t even make them grow longer. I do not recommend this product to anyone especially with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s week three and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s placebo, but I think this is really working! I can tell because my eyelids feel a little more heavy than usual, but the volume added is definitely there. While the first application was a little scary (reviews say it stings?), it&#x27;s not really a big deal at all, and it&#x27;s very easy on the skin as far as possible irritation goes. Looking forward to the final results, but so far it&#x27;s working as advertised!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a straight-up, ungirly-girl tomboy and have never a day in my life spent money on makeup - I prefer the more durable appearance (Not going to leak in the rain, not going to look unnatural, etc.) which I feel this product delivers beautifully. I had actually gotten eyelash extensions once because my friend asked me to accompany her for her first time and felt they were way too fake (Though I did get compliments, it didn&#x27;t stop me from feeling like some granny that cakes herself with makeup - worst part is you have to wait for them to fall out on their own!). If eyelash syrum is just &#x27;some beauty fad&#x27;, I&#x27;ll be rocking it far into my senior days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried Rapidlash before this, switching to a different product simply because I heard that if you use repeat products (Like shampoo and deodorant) that your body will become immune, so you should always switch up your brands. I figured eyelash serum works the same way but I&#x27;m certainly no expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Longer lashes. They feel longer and more durable then even Rapidlash, my 2 cents. Unknown time to get longer, I was using rapidlash before so they were already pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;They fall out less - no more digging into my eye for that one rebel lash.&lt;br /&gt;No makeup running in the rain, and you&#x27;re still going to have killer lashes if you forget to put this on for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Skin darkens where you apply it. Not really a con - its not the WHOLE eyelid or anything noticeable, just at the edge where you apply it, just under the eyelashes. Most people wouldn&#x27;t mind it since usually you would put eyeliner there anyways and your lashes cover it. Its not very dark at all, and you might prefer it since it outlines the eye with a natural-looking darkness at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Itchy/hot eyeballs if it gets in your eye. I&#x27;ve never dumped it all into my eye (Had the brush touch my whites, but didn&#x27;t get any bad effects) but a few times I forget that I have it on and rub my eyes which got more in there. It burns for a second or two, not anything I&#x27;m rushing to the sink to clean out either. Your reaction will probably something like &#x27;That sure is pesky&#x27; before you resume your night.two, not anything I&#x27;m rushing to the sink to clean out either. Your reaction will probably something like &#x27;That sure is pesky&#x27; before you resume your night.</li>
    <li> I have always had very few lashes to begin with. With my wedding just a couple of months away, I was down to literally 15 lashes on each eye. I was worried about the wedding coming up and decided to give this a shot. Compared to Latisse that had many warnings and side effects, Envyderm sounded \\&quot;eye friendly\\&quot; - for lack of better terms. Just a couple of weeks and I noticed a decent amount of change in my lashes. I never had much complaint about the length, but they all seem much longer - and stay nice and curved up the whole day. And my lash population is no longer an issue either. They didn&#x27;t drastically multiply, but there are noticeably more lashes now.     TRY THIS PRODUCT. IF IT WORKS ON ME, IT WILL PROBABLY WORK ON YOU. AND I USE THIS EVERY DAY NOW DESPITE THAT MY LASHES DON&#x27;T NEED IT ANYMORE.</li>
    <li> I ordeded one of these months ago, it seemed to work ok, then i ordered three and got completely ripped off. My eyelashes actually started to fall out and are now back to normal. I have returned the other two and will never use Envyderm again. I purchased revitalash from another website and hope that does the trick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since August and so far, NO GROWTH.  And to think, I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Ardell Brow and Lash growth serum too.  I think it&#x27;s main purpose is to condition, which is good.  And perhaps there WILL be growth LATER.  So we&#x27;ll see if I stick to it even longer...</li>
    <li> I have used latise for several months but wanted something less expensive and with less side affects. I switched to this and I saw the results I had achieved with my original product diminish some but not all the way. I still had far more lashes than I had without any help. For people who already have decent lashes but want more umphh then I think this will do the trick. If you&#x27;re almost bald-lashed like me you may be OK with what you get or you may need to seek out an Rx product for more dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this serum because I had quite a few unsuccessful attempts at eyelash growth in the past. However, I am SO GLAD I tried this product! My eyelashes have always been a source of insecurity for me and not only did I find the miracle remedy for that but there are NO side effects. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I recommend this because who doesn&#x27;t want to put on false lashes all the time. I had no irritation, or side effects when using this either. This will make your lashes stronger than they were and they don&#x27;t fall out as much anymore as a result of using this. You don&#x27;t have to hesitate to buy this. Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum works GREAT.</li>
    <li> I had lost almost all of my eye lashes two years ago when I suffered from conjunctivitis. Although this loss of eye hair had caused me some pain, I did not bother much afterwards, because most of my affected area remained hidden behind the frame of my spectacles. Only when I took off my specs did I mark the bald eyes, which was incongruent with my full mop of hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my nephew brought this product and I greeted it with my characteristic hesitancy. But a look at the names of some of the ingredients, such as Alfalfa, Arnica and Wheat Germ oil, instilled some confidence in me. These ingredients are very important constituents of Ayurvedic herbal medicines for prevention of hair loss and for hair nourishment. I also became sure that the product in hand will not have any side effects as these constituents are in use in India medical system for thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the experience after using the product as advised continuously for three months. My top eyelashes are back with a vengeance. Here, the loss due to conjunctivitis was 80 percent with just a few strands remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the regain of lashes in the bottom part of my eyes, the experience has not been as effective. Here the loss was complete and the recovery is in the region of 25%. But I am only three months into using it. I hope after three more months I may have a more promising result.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and started using it, still waited for results after 2 weeks and when I traveled with it on the plane the package exploded in my carry-on. And I don&#x27;t feel like spending another $50+ to continue.  Word of advice, don&#x27;t take it with you on the plane.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t know what to expect when bought this product... with so many fake reviews out there that sell you products that don&#x27;t work and so many other reviews of impatient people who do not follow the treatment and complains after only one week of use... but turns out that this thing works. it is not a scam. i started to see results only after two weeks, it was not obvious but my eyelashes looked different, fuller not longer. the next noticeable change occurred after 6 weeks, longer lashes than usual, now they were long enough to have a curl (mine were rare, short and straight). i am in week 8 and my lashes are fuller (i have two rows of lashes now)and longer. They are not as long and pretty as the ones people born that way have, but they are long compare to what i started with. Give it a try and be constant, it works.</li>
    <li> I have been religiously using Envyderm for the past 5 weeks and the effects are unreal. My eyelashes are at least 50% longer! I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments at work about them.     I&#x27;ve used Ardell Growth Accelerator a few years ago with no apparent results. Because of this I was very skeptical starting to use Envyderm but my sister really insisted I need to try it. I am so glad I listend to her. I first started noticing my lashes were longer and fuller after only 2 weeks. I even thought it was all in my head but when people started commenting on it, I knew it must be true. I will definitely be re-ordering the product in the future. I can recommend this to anyone looking to enhance their lashes.</li>
    <li> Almost a month using this product and I dont see any big difference, I regret for having bougth two of them, since I am from Mexico I wanted to reduce the import fees by getting two of them, I rely on the reviews from other customers but nothing good so far....</li>
    <li> I try continuously to use it every night for 2 months , but i don&#x27;t see any different.So, it&#x27;s not work to me. waste money</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over 3 months and all I can say is WOW! My eyebrows have grown back after years of over plucking and waxing, and my eyelashes are back to their original length and volume. I am so excited!</li>
    <li> Almost 4 weeks now and my lashes are - different!  In a good way!  Longer, a little fuller and hardly ever falling out.  I would normally see 3 to 6 lashes fall out every time I washed my face.  No more.  These almost 59-year old eyes are looking pretty good. I had an eye exam today and the optometrist commented my lashes looked good - and that they were growing in the right direction. I&#x27;m very happy with this product - not ready to go without mascara - but there&#x27;s not as much mascara going on my lashes - just don&#x27;t need as much!</li>
    <li> Have been using Lilash, but pricey at around $100. Decided to try a less expensive brand. This one really does work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a couple weeks now, I have seen that my eyelashes have became thicker, I am exciting to see the more change that happens!</li>
    <li> nice mascara! not sure about the conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I was on Latisse for over a year. While it gave my Asian eyelashes growth and length, it also transformed me into a panda. I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the potential iris color change because I had black eyes anyway. However, it darkened my eyelids so much that I looked like a giant panda bear! To make the matter worse, it grew hair all over my cheeks, which I had to pluck on a regular basic or I&#x27;d have to risk being mistaken for a werewolf. But the final straw for me was that after a certain period, my lashes stopped growing. The price I paid with panda eyes and hairy cheeks could no longer justify mere lash maintenance. I had to look for a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found Envyderm! But I was extremely skeptical at first - it simply sounded too good to be true. Natural ingredients and no side effects? Nevertheless, I am the kind who will give anything a try just to satisfy my curiosity. One tube of Envyderm later, I am delighted to find out that not only do I still have the growth from Latisse, my lashes seem to have lengthened even further! It is especially evident when I put on a coat of mascara on special occasions. Thank you Envyderm! You are my new BFF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had short lashes my whole life. For over year,I&#x27;ve been trying out all the different eyelash growth products out there.  Envyderm is the 4th product I&#x27;ve used. After a month, I was pleasantly surprised when my lashes got longer. My lashes stopped breaking and falling out and filled in. I would recommend this product. It grows lashes and is a great price.</li>
    <li> I have waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a chance to work (or not work.) I was VERY skeptical about any claims to thicken eyelashes. I mean...really...growing hair? Haven&#x27;t people been trying to do that forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I was a little hopeful. I always had long lashes, but as I have gotten older, I have noticed they aren&#x27;t as nice as they used to be. I have been using this consistently for about 3 weeks now. I HAVE noticed some new lashes and my older ones seem longer. I am a little lax about taking off my mascara when I go to bed (I know I know) and I suppose that was bad for them. I now DO take it off so I can use this product, so that may have some help in keeping my lashes healthy. HOWEVER! I did realize that I was doing two things differently, so I also used this serum on my eyebrows. I have dark but thin eyebrows that look like they have been tweezed too much (that is just the way they ARE!)and was hoping for a little more bulk especially on the outer ends. I have indeed noticed more fullness with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not sure if this stuff promotes NEW lashes and brows or if it just conditions what you do have so it is at its healthiest. Ether way, it has resulted in an improvement for me. Not a \\&quot;holy COW\\&quot; difference, but enough that I have noticed. And I honestly was prepared to complain about it if it didn&#x27;t work. I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I am just not sure if it is worth the price. The better care-taking of my eyes AND this have shown some improvement for me, but I have never used another lash product with which to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no irritation or burning with it at all. None. It IS expensive, but honestly, it isn&#x27;t I have spend at least this much on different mascaras, removers, etc. (one of my favorites is [[ASIN:B0027858JQ Dior Iconic waterproof]] and it is thirty bucks.) So in the range of better-type cosmetics, this price is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are disappointed in your lashes, I would give this a shot. If you have always had short lashes, I don&#x27;t think you should expect miracles, but if want some improvement or you notice yours aren&#x27;t as nice as they have been, this is a worth trying at least.ave always had short lashes, I don&#x27;t think you should expect miracles, but if want some improvement or you notice yours aren&#x27;t as nice as they have been, this is a worth trying at least.</li>
    <li> I have long lashes, although they&#x27;re thin, so I was looking for something that would thicken them. This helps but not as much as I want it to, but I may be asking for too much here. I&#x27;m very sensitive to products and was glad I had no adverse reaction to this serum. It&#x27;s easy to use - you put it on at nighttime - without a heaviness or odor I could detect. Will I keep using it? Yep!</li>
    <li> I wanted to really make sure I tested this product out for a good while before I reviewed it.  It&#x27;s been more than 2 months, I have applied it faithfully every evening, but I am afraid my  lashes have not responded to this.  I wished for greater results as I have had to resort to extensions in the past and it looks like that will be my next step.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had great natural lashes, and I&#x27;ve tried other products with little effect. Envyderm has possibly better reviews than other such products, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Well...I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a Latisse substitute. I didn&#x27;t have the bad reaction some people have, which is somewhat surprising; my eyes are a bit sensitive. So that&#x27;s the upside.  My lashes look fine. Are they better for having used Envyderm? Maybe. It&#x27;s very marginal. If anyone purchased this for the price here, I doubt they&#x27;d be very thrilled with the result, if the result was like the one I&#x27;ve experienced so far.  But then, it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. I&#x27;ll finish this tube out and report back in case I get a lash growth spurt in the meantime.  Otherwise...Latisse remains the gold standard.</li>
    <li> I will rate this product just average. After 4 weeks my lashes did grow slightly, very slightly...(so slightly that I am the only one that notices it; though it could also be my mind playing tricks on me since I has such high hopes!). The product did not work for me as well as it seems to have worked for others. Some of the pros are that it didn&#x27;t give any irritation and/or darkened my eyelids (which I&#x27;ve read other products can do).  I don&#x27;t personally think it&#x27;s worth the money, not for me anyhow.</li>
    <li> This serum really works as advertised with no apparent side-effects. My wife has always been a little self-concsious about ther eyelashes. Three weeks ago she finally broke down and asked me to buy her a product. I can honestly say that this conditioner is great. We are already seeing results after only three weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen her this confident in a long time! She only has praises for this stuff. I will definitely be reordering this soon. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is something I have needed for some time now. I don&#x27;t have super thin eyelashes but they are not thick either. Usually I have to add 2- 3 coats of mascara to my eyelashes to make it look thick. As soon as I got it I started to use it. Within a few weeks I could tell such a difference. I would have taken a picture but right now I have really red eyes do to allergies so they aren&#x27;t to pretty but my lashes sure are. I was also very happy with the fact that it did hurt my eyelids or eyes in any way. I didn&#x27;t break out or anything. Another thing I really like is the ease of applying the Envyderm daily to your eyes. I did apply to my upper and lower but it is really up to you what you want to do. If you are wanting thicker lush eyelashes then this will diffently do the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought Envyderm from my dermatologist&#x27;s office for my girlfriend a few months back, because she kept complaining about her brittle eyelashes. She seems quite happy with the results, since I haven&#x27;t heard any more complaints from her. I don&#x27;t know how much this product improved her eyelashes, but I do know that it&#x27;s a lot harder to say no when she gives me those puppy eyes.</li>
    <li> The older I get, the more I notice both my eyelashes and eyebrows have begun to thin out and don&#x27;t look as full as they once did. While I had reservations about whether a product could really help both grow, the way my eyelashes especially looked bothered me enough to give this product a try. While I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, for the price I was paying, I was expecting to see some results.    It&#x27;s been three weeks now and I used it exactly as directed. I have to admit, I do see a difference.  Before I started using the product, there was a small area of left eyelid in which I rubbed too hard and a few of the eyelashes came out. I had noticed they were slow to fully grow back. However, when I used the serum, I noticed the quick growth and thickness with these new lashes before I noticed a change with the older lashes. (The new lashes grew in about ten days.) Seeing this gave me confidence this product works.    After two and a half weeks, my lashes were much fuller to the point where I no longer felt self-conscious about them. I have to admit, while there was a change in my eyebrows, I felt the product worked better on my eyelashes.  When I first began using the serum, I did experience a bit of a tingling sensation. This seemed to go away after the third night I put it on.    My one small issue is that the packaging is quite small. You really can&#x27;t apply this product liberally like you would mascara or liquid eyeliner. You have to use it sparingly to make it last. I was afraid using too little wouldn&#x27;t give me any results, but I seemed to have found the right amount because it&#x27;s working and I have a lot left.</li>
    <li> When I received this I was using LiLash eyelash serum, which is also non-prescription.  After I finished the bottle of LiLash I switched to this product.  I gave it a month but during that time I seemed to have less eyelashes and they weren&#x27;t as long as when I was using LiLash.  The truth is that none of these non-prescription eyelash serums are going to work as well as the prescription.  I was at the dermatologist recently and my doctor told me that the company that sells the the prescription product has a buy one/get one free deal right now so I decided to switch to the prescription.  After I use it a for a few months I&#x27;ll try cutting back to every other day and if that works it won&#x27;t be terribly expensive.</li>
    <li> Used it for the 6 weeks, didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. I get my eyelashes permed for the same price and see results immediately and for as long as 6 weeks. Was hoping this would be a great at home alternative but it wasn&#x27;t. My understanding from the lady that does my eyelash perming, that it&#x27;s difficult to see differences from the serums and creams since our eyelash recycle (guess that&#x27;s a nice way of say fall out and regrow) about every 4-6 weeks. Gave it a try, but not great results as expected.</li>
    <li> My lashes really do seem to be visibly longer and thicker.  Application is easy, but for a woman I would think that you&#x27;d only put it on at night: I can&#x27;t think it would work under make-up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item about two weeks ago and within the first three days of using it I saw a little sprout in my tight curly lashes. My lashes are not long and flowly like most women. I have those lashes that are really curly that causes me to brush them out from the top just to get some length on them. I have baby lashes and its not attractive--well, at least not to me they aren&#x27;t. I am in my second week of using Envyderm and my little curly lashes have some length to them-with NO help from me that is:). I must admit that I use this product before I go to bed, and when I awake. I have also been using it on my bottom lashes and they are growing faster than my top lashes!    BOTTOM LINE--THIS PRODUCT WORKS FOLKS! ITS WORTH THE PRICE--GREAT SELLER--AND YOU&#x27;LL BE SATISFIED. I KNOW I AM!!    God bless,  K~</li>
    <li> Only a week...ok so far...no burning or itching which is plus...I have sensitive eyes...used Lilash good product but a bit on the expensive side...also burn from time to time....Envyderm no lashes dropped out...will post update in 3 wks with results.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought what the hell...I&#x27;ll try it.  I&#x27;ve been using every day for the past 2 months and not one ounce of change in my eye lashes.  waste of money for me</li>
    <li> I have been using the Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum for the last 2 months now. Nothing happened, no growth or lengthening of the lashes.  It was a waste of money. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for about 6 weeks and noticed no difference in thickness or length, but it did seem to help with conditioning -- I don&#x27;t notice my eyelashes breaking or falling out as much as they used to.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I figured this was worth a try. I have used for two weeks and see no major improvements. I suppose if you really have thin and short eyelashes to begin with, perhaps you might see some improvement.  My eyelashes aren&#x27;t in too bad of shape, they just seem to be getting shorter and I thought the concept of \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; sounded good. This was $50 I could have definitely found a better way to spend for myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month now and there has been no change whatsoever.  I bought the product based on the fact that the reviews were generally quite good.  Unfortunately, for me, it was just a very expensive waste of money.</li>
    <li> OK - first let&#x27;s make this perfectly clear - I am a lashless wonder.  It&#x27;s like God&#x27;s cruel joke. I have gorgeous, big brown eyes and itty bitty lashes. This product did not necessarily make my lashes substantially longer. What it did do, however, was cause me to grow a double row of lashes. So while my lashes may not be much longer than they were when I started using Envyderm they are much fuller and thicker which gives my mascara something to work with. I would have given it 5 stars but I didn&#x27;t achieve the long, lush lashes I was looking for. Just got the lush part of the deal.</li>
    <li> It was fast shipping and i have only used it for a week now and I just have to wait longer for results. Hopefully, I get results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for 6 weeks now.  I can definitely say that it works! There was an area where my lashes were not growing back, but I actually have growth in that area. My lashes are much longer...I was hoping it would make it thicker and fuller too, but mostly a difference in length.</li>
    <li> Never believed in such product but heard from people it may work. Bought one and used it for two weeks now, every piece of my lash is at the same length as they were 2 weeks ago, short and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish i could return it. It may work for others but not for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I get SO many compliments on my lashes. I notice a change when I don&#x27;t use it and immediately want to go back. I have nice eyelashes to start with but this amazing product makes my lashes look so full, long, and youthful. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I used Latisse years ago for a very short time and it made me very dizzy and gave me scary neurological symptoms. I was so happy to find something safe. It can get slightly crusty if you put too much on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ~$50 tube of eyelash serum for the claim that it helped lashes to grow longer.  After using it for the last month, I have seen no visible difference in the length of my eyelashes, upper or lower.  I guess the only way to get the real thing (like the prescription product, Latisse) is to go to a dr. for the prescription.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I was religious about applying it nightly and waited hopefully.  After almost two months, nothing.  Maybe I&#x27;ll pop for the expensive stuff.  That way I&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s just me or the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy miracle elixers or promises in a vial, but I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s under $50. I used it as directed every night and have seen absolutly no growth, thickness or difference other than the occasional stinging sensation when it drips in my eye. If you don&#x27;t have $50 to gamble, just go get some real nice mascara that you can test and have the option of returning at Sephora or fun falsies.</li>
    <li> I have tried several lash growth serums and have to say this one seems to work for me. My lashes are definitely longer, not sure if they are fuller. It did take a while to see results.  The other brands that I have tried did not seem to work as well as this one.  It could be that different people react to differnt kinds of formulas.  As stated in other reviews it&#x27;s important to use every day on clean eyelids.  Consistency is very important.  It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long time so the investment is actually quite small.  Give it a try and if this brand doesn&#x27;t work for you try another brand.</li>
    <li> i got an empty bottle of the envyderm, it has literally nothing inside the bottle, i cant believe it i just paid almost $44 for this item which is empty. it is very dissapointing</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly. I have used it since it arrived, for about a month. I use it 4 to 5 times a week, and yet feel it works a little bit, but no apparent effect.</li>
    <li> After a bad allergic experience with another lash growth serum, I had trepidations about trying a new one.  Alas, my lashes were getting desperate.  WhooHee!  The first good news was, I had no allergic symptoms with EnvyDerm!!!  One problem down.  Within two weeks of using it once a day, my lashes were coming in noticeably longer.  Within a month, my lashes looked thicker.  Super thick, no... but thicker than they were before. Some ads for lash growth products state the product will make your lashes curl or become darker.  Not for me.  My lashes were longer but grew straight out (thank god for eyelash curlers).  You do have to be consistent when using the product.  That means putting it on daily.  If it&#x27;s going to work for you, you&#x27;ll have to give it several weeks. And, if and when you stop, the eyelash growth will stop and revert back to what it was prior to usage.   Also, it did work on my eyebrows.  My growth is not thick but I am gaining more new hairs than I am losing now.  Yippee!  And the tube lasts for months!  It was a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> I am about five weeks in and have eyelashes!! In addition to the serum (after I remove makeup in the evening) I have cut way back on the amount of waterproof mascara I use. My eyelashes are growing longer by the day and there are more of them every day. I will be buying this again when I start to run low!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 6 mos. and applied it according to the instructions and had no results.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> ... even though I only remember to apply it 3-4 times per week.  That is pretty important to know, because if you are as busy as I am and sometimes fall into bed with not much energy left for the teeth etc, you can still benefit from the product.  I&#x27;m sure it would work better if I used it every day, but I do see thicker, longer, darker lashes with my use pattern of using it a little more than half the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed, every night, since I received it three months ago.  To date I have noticed only minimal improvement in my eyelashes, which have been quite thin for several years.  It may be that my condition is such that no product like this would have any effect, but I will continue using it until the container is empty.  I will revise my review if during the next three months, I notice any significant improvement.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Saw no difference in the growth or darkness of eyelashes. Not worth the money. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product religiously in the morning and before bedtime and I have not seen any difference in the length or thickness of my lashes. What I HAVE noticed is the burning sensation when it seeps into my eyes and the crusty layer it leaves when it dries. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks so far, and I have been able to see a difference in the length and thickness of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the best time to consistently apply this is after washing my face and just before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any bad side-affects or burning when using this.  My eyes occasionally burn with some eye products, so I was expecting a little here, but so far it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only note I would add is that I was hoping that this would help fill in one small section of my eyelash line where I had scarring from chicken pox as a teen (one very small area where no eye lashes have grown back for YEARS!), and while it has thickened and lengthened the lashes surrounding the little area, making it less obvious, it didn&#x27;t help with re-growth yet.  Still crossing my fingers though.</li>
    <li> what ever it  was supposed to do make my lashes longer and lustrous  ...it didn&#x27;t do, I was so terribly dissappointed</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s started using it since like 3 weeks back, and she reports her eye lashes seem stronger and not brittle. She feels they are more healthy and getting thicker. She did not feel much irritation. She says the product seems to be working indeed as advertised, and looking at how long the bottle lasts, the price is also ok.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what my wife says and she says she likes it.  As for side effects, can&#x27;t really say there are any.  My wife is one who often has dry eyes and this product did not increase or affect her condition at all, and she reports nothing negative from it.  Because of how it works, you will need to use it consistently over a long period of time.  For those that may know, hair grows in cycles, have their on/off periods and shedding phases.  This product extends the growth cycle and delays the shedding phase.  Not everything works for everybody but for those that do, it seemingly is a great product for women as women love to have big, thick and long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they could create the same thing for us men...</li>
    <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, I have noticed minimal differences.  I did not experience any side effects with this product either.  I have very sensitive skin and my eyes are easily irritated so I was worried about the possible side effects, but there weren&#x27;t any which was reassuring.  Although it is less expensive than other eyelash enhancement products, it does not seem to give dramatic results.  If you are looking for dramatic results, I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few months now and sadly have noticed no difference and to add to it, it stings my eyes! Surely a product designed for your eyes should not sting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You would think by now that I would learn my lesson about trying cheaper products to save money but ultimately get NO results.  This is the second brand I have tried that DOES NOT work.  The ONLY brand that works for me is LiLash and I am going to order another tube as soon as I am done writing this review.  Yes, Lilash does darken my eyelids ever so slightly but as I have learned, once you stop using it that issue goes away entirely.  Besides, I always wear some amount of eyeshadow so you don&#x27;t see it anyway.  Don&#x27;t settle for less........this stuff is junk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 weeks now and I can tell the difference! Hope it continues working as it has....</li>
    <li> i really dont know yet, but i feel like i can see my eyelashes getting thicker but not necessarily longer.  i think i need to wait a little longer to see any real noticeable results, so i will have to be patient with this one!!</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. It may work for some but definitely spend money on better product.  My lashes at did not grow as advertised.  I will be  going back to some expensive lash growth product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c8b1a6389ec6caef2968422f052ef80]] Firstly, this is a non-prescription product that helps safely grow &amp; strengthen your lashes, as well as repairing lash damage. It is both ophthalmologist &amp; dermatologist tested too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for longer, stronger, thicker &amp; fuller lashes and eyebrows, this could be the product you&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing makeup &amp; cleansing the area, apply at bedtime to upper lashes, lower lashes and/or eyebrows, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this serum from EnvyDerm has certainly made my lashes stronger, lengthened them, and they appear to be more voluminous &amp; dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this product every single night, as it says you can do - maybe 2-3 nights a week over about 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother tried the product a few times too, and noted a difference that quickly at the length of her lashes.</li>
    <li> Ok but didn&#x27;t really do much .</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. It has not worked for me at all. Purchased this product based on others review and have not seen any change in my lashes. I have been using it for three weeks as recommend. Not planning on trying any other products.</li>
    <li> I tried the Envyderm Cosmetics Eyelash Enhancement and Conditioning Nighttime Serum, and the only claim it lives up to, for me, is that the tube does last about 5 months. It probably conditioned my lashes, too, but I didn&#x27;t notice any results such as darker lashes, thicker lashes, longer lashes, or any other result that would make me look in the mirror at my eyelashes and say \\&quot;WOW!!!  Thank you, Envyderm!\\&quot;  I have to laugh at the product description&#x27;s assertion that this product is a great alternative to false eyelashes, because to me, that&#x27;s like saying that&#x27;s like saying a graham cracker is a great alternative to a TV remote.  Doesn&#x27;t even come close to accomplishing the same thing.  I&#x27;m really glad that there are people who&#x27;ve had amazing results from this product.  I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t see any results, so from where I stand, this product is overpriced snake oil.</li>
    <li> The formula is too watery to really stay in place. I glooped it onto my eyelashes every nights for a few weeks but didn&#x27;t see any improvements.</li>
    <li> I had to use this for a year and all my lashes came back.  Used it religiously and went through 2 tubes of it.  I was very pleased that all my missing lashes came back.  A month after I quit using it, the lashes fell out!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT FOR MY AUNT AS A PRESENT, SHE HAS VERY SHORT LASHES, SHE TOLD ME APPLIED HER EYELASHES EVERY DAY AND NIGHT AND THEY ARE LONG NOW AND IT&#x27;S VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, NEXT TIME SHE HAS TO BUY IT HERSELF, I THINK IF SHE STOPS THE TREATMENT, THEY WON&#x27;T GROW THAT LONG ANYMORE, AND IT TOOK ABOUT 2 MONTHS FOR HER TO SEE THE RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Envyderm gave me the longer lashes I&#x27;d been looking for. It&#x27;s a great product that didn&#x27;t give me any side effects; just the longer, thicker lashes I wanted. My eyelashes are twice as long as they were before I started using Envyderm.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  I thought I was buying a product similar to Vita Lash.  I was wrong</li>
    <li> I like this better than the Revitalash lash product. Bigger brush ok, goes on easy and really works! Thank you</li>
    <li> Did not work. Bought latisse works great</li>
    <li> Envyderm really seems to be working, I just hit week four and my lashes are definitely longer. I would say the best thing you can do with this product is be consistent, use it every night after removing all of your makeup and right before you go to bed. The first time may burn just a little (like the way bio freeze or icy hot \\&quot;burns\\&quot;, but on a much smaller scale), but that is just because you are getting used to it. That goes away after the first use. I have read that other products leave brown lines on your eyes where you apply the product, that does not happen at all with this. I highly recommend this product for several reasons, one because it works, two because it&#x27;s so easy to put on, and three because it is all natural and works very well with your body. Warning though, be careful when you are putting it on not to get any of it in your eyes because it will feel like you got soap in them. If you do, rinse it out and then start over. I have gotten it in my eye once or twice and nothing bad happened, like your eye ball isn&#x27;t going to disintegrate or anything! So don&#x27;t worry. Have fun with it, I think it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> Im gonna be very honest.. Ive read all the reviews before i purchased this product. I just wanted to give it a try. I havent been able to put it on every night , either i forget or too tired when i get home.. But when i use it 2 nights back to back i swear its For real, It grows your lashes over night! I have no lashes on the buttom they are very thin and you can hardly see them, when i put envyderm on buttom lashes over night they getvfuller and longer. So for those who are willing to use it every night, unlike me please purchase and share your experience with others and spread around how good it is!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for one week and I can already tell my lashes are getting thicker and longer!  My only complaint is it does burn a little and cause my eyes to water.</li>
    <li> i used latisse for 2 years and spent 120.00 for each bottle. i researched this product and read all the reviews. i ran out of latisse and started this sept. 4. this stuff works. my lashes are longer and thicker. i will continue. i want to see if my daughters get the same results having not used latisse. for 50 dollars for 6 months it is worth it. and its free shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  I bought my second tube because I loved the first so much.  I started out with trying to improve my lashes with eyelash extensions.  I loved them but I lost most of my lashes due to overuse/ and the glue with the extensions.  When I tried Envyderm, I was skeptical but desperate at the same time. I absolutely love the results since I started using this product about 6 weeks ago! My lashes are not only longer than my original lashes, they are thicker too! I am afraid to be without this stuff!  My friends have all commented on how long my lashes look now too.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i almost gave up on this product! i used it faithfully every night for over 8 weeks and did not see any changes at all. it was headed for the trash when suddenly there they were! longer, thicker, darker lashes as if overnight! strange i admit, but true. give it some time, it works :) the only reason i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how long it takes to work.</li>
    <li> When considering this item...  do your research.  I purchased this product after my eyelashes started falling out due to stress.  With such great reviews, I decided to give it a try.  BIG mistake...  HUGE.  After using every night after my face clensing routine, I applied religiously.  Too much so.  I began to experience drying around my eyes...  especially in the outside corners.  Then, on my eyelids, my skin got so dry it started to flake and peel.  I could literally pull small patches of skin off much like a sunburn that was healing.  Then...  the last night I used it I woke up the next morning with swollen, red, inflamed, BURNING eyelids.  Both top and bottom.  Because you need to apply this to your lash line, with each blink, the product had rubbed onto my entire eyelid.  My eyelids (not eyes themselves) had become so irritated, swollen and red that I had to seek treatment from my PCP.  I could not apply a topical ointment due to the sensitivity of the affected area, so I was treated for a week with steroids.  STEROIDS.  I took time off work because my eyes were so swollen.  Finally after a week my eyes started....  STARTED....  to return to normal.  Aside from the product warnings of staining please use this product with caution.  The discomfort I experienced is in no way worth any possible promises of longer, thicker eyelashes.  Research natural treatments on line:  [...]  They promote the use of EVOO, \\&quot;combing\\&quot; your eyelashes daily and vitamin oil and/or vaseline.  Those contain natural ingredients and are far less risky.  If you have had success with this product, that&#x27;s great.  If you are considering purchasing for a first time...  do your research.  It was a waste of my money...  not only in purchasing this product, but in the time and treatment for the side effects it caused.</li>
    <li> I was not blessed with big hair, and that includes my eyelashes. They are fine and blond and practically invisible without mascara. I used Latisse, which is very expensive, for almost two years and saw no improvement. I&#x27;d about given up when Envyderm appeared in Vine and I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Envyderm for about 4 months now and there is no major improvement in my lashes, but I do think it works. I&#x27;m not surprised, after my Latisse experiment, that my lashes would be a difficult challenge for any enhancement serum. As I said, I didn&#x27;t really have much hope, but my lashes seem not only longer, but also thicker. I put Envyderm on every night and every day I look in my makeup mirror to see if anything is happening and I have been very pleasantly surprised. I can&#x27;t say for *sure* that my lashes are better, but it seems that way to me. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because the improvement is not dramatic. I&#x27;m hoping that my lashes will continue to grow and that in a couple more months I&#x27;ll be able to add a pleasant note to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I&#x27;m happy is that I love the idea that my eyelashes are getting better. I love putting Envyderm on at night and looking in my mirror every day. I really want to give it a good try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is much easier to use than Latisse, which is really weird about their brushes. They say you&#x27;re supposed to use one for each eye, and they stopped selling extra brushes. That was really annoying. Plus, it didn&#x27;t work. But the Envyderm just goes on really easy. I&#x27;ve gotten it in my eyes, but that was no problem at all. Really, one of the reasons I think it&#x27;s working is how much longer my lower lashes look, just from serum that has run down from my top lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Envyderm is certainly worth a try!</li>
    <li> Wife says it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product where if I bought one and it turned out to be a gimmick of some kind, I would feel really extra duped. I assume I&#x27;m not the only one.  Say I bought a new box of crackers that the manufacturer stamped \\&quot;NEW RECIPE! NOW LIGHTER AND WITH BETTER FLAVOR!\\&quot; and I took these \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; crackers home and gave them shot. If I disagreed and thought the crackers were not, in fact, \\&quot;lighter and better flavored,\\&quot; I&#x27;d probably shrug my shoulders and buy a different brand next time.  Not so with beauty products and their extravagant claims.  In my time I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products and found quite a few that live up to their claims of \\&quot;smoother, better looking skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;shinier, bouncier looking hair.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve also tried a few duds that changed my appearance absolutely zero. I buy more of the products that work and look for alternatives for the ones that don&#x27;t.  However, I believe there is a special place in hell for the gimmick product that isn&#x27;t looking to convert a customer for life but make a quick buck off of enough women buying their quack-juice product &#x27;just once.&#x27;  In my opinion, this Envyderm is quack-juice in a tube.  Getting this product was taking one for the team. I&#x27;d order one, give it a really long trial, and then report back so that others wouldn&#x27;t be duped or could know this was the real deal. Results in as little as 2 weeks, they said? Well, I&#x27;ll try it longer than that and let everyone know.  Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t seeing things and telling myself I saw results in the mirror that were no more than wishful thinking, I decided my trial of the product would be a scientific as I could be in my home bathroom. I applied the serum to only one of my two eyes and for good measure, dabbed a bit on my eyebrows in the areas where they are thinner. I figured if Envyderm worked, I could always begin applying to both eyes to make things even. Having uneven eyelashes for a while would be my second chance to take one for the team.  I never got the chance, because nothing. I saw absolutely nothing.  No gain in thickness.  No gain in length.  No gain in density.  No gain in quantity.  No gain in darkness.  Nothing.  I&#x27;m here to report that after 5 whole MONTHS of continuous use I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes in any form whatsoever.  I was lucky that I din&#x27;t have to pay for my tube. As a Vine reviewer I could choose one from a list of interesting looking books, a kitchen scale for measuring perfect portions, or this serum. I wish I had gone with the scale.</li>
    <li> I have been using EnvyDerm for over 2 months now (during the wintertime) and have seen improvement in length and in darkness.  I am almost 50 years young! so the appearance of my lashes has dwindled to practically invisible.  So yes, it does work.  I am not the type to wear mascara every day, so at least my lashes are dark enough to see them without mascara.  And when I do put on mascara they look substantial, much better than before using Envyderm.  But as a previous user of Lattisse, please do not expect that type of lash growth.  Maybe during the summer months ahead I will experience further increase in length .&lt;br /&gt;  But for the price, it is a BUY and TRY !</li>
    <li> Envyderm Eyelash Enhancement and Conditioning Nighttime Serum works okay, but I did not get amazing results. My eyelashes seemed a little softer and a little fuller, but I probably won&#x27;t be using the product again. Also, I have sensitive eyes and I had to be careful about applying it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this Envyderm product to work.  My eyelashes are thinning as I grow older, and I was so in hopes that my 70-year-old eyes would once again be rimmed with long, thick lashes (even just a little thicker and/or longer would have made me very happy.)  But no such luck.  Although the product description guarantees thicker &amp; longer lashes, there was absolutely no difference in my eyelashes after using this product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  It didn&#x27;t cause any skin or eye irritation, but it also didn&#x27;t change my lashes in any way after two months of use.  I haven&#x27;t tried Latisse, so can&#x27;t compare it.  The active ingredient in Latisse, Bimatoprost, is a prescription product and is not in Envyderm, which seems to be based mainly on botanical ingredients with moisturizers and protein.  I was able to try it free, but ordinarily I focus my beauty budget on products I know will work.  I can&#x27;t recommend Envyderm as a good value from that perspective.</li>
    <li> I have tried other lash enhancement that are better,did&#x27;nt really see a difference and the serum stung a little.The price was good</li>
    <li> perhaps just a little noticeable difference.  applied every night, maybe I was hoping for a miracle.  Live and learn.  LOL</li>
    <li> I wish this worked.  I have tried Latisse which does work but I don&#x27;t like that the product is liquidy and travels up your eyelid.  It also made my eyelid become discolored which did go away after some time passed.  I also used lilash which is a bit cheaper than latisse.  Loved it!  Very effective.  More of a gel that comes in a tube and you apply like mascara.  This was just as effective as Latisse but I liked it much better.  Then I got cheap and tried Envyderm based on the rather good reviews.  Slowly but surely  all my length has diminished and I will throw it away as soon as my Lilash gets here.  Envyderm was a total waste of money!  LIve and learn.</li>
    <li> I really would NOT recommend this item.  I used it every night for about 6 weeks.  Not only did I see no growth or increased thickness, but my eyes, especially one, got soooo red.  I looked terrible.  I had to discontinue use.  I was afraid of using it any longer.  It took about a week for my eyes to straighten up.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  It just did nothing for me.  I used the entire tube I believe I should have seen results by now.</li>
    <li> I use this about three to four days a week, and noticed my lashes longer in about two weeks, I  a, very please with it I will reorder</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it three month seriously and it seems my eyelash got thinner. It may work for you, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> is very slow working not at all what I was promised I do not think I would recomend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I used it for few months and I didn&#x27;t see any difference. It&#x27;s either overrated or it just didn&#x27;t wok for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with high expectations based on other reviews.  I have been using it for about 3 months now with zero noticeable improvements.  I have used revitalash in the past and that worked every time.  So when I am done with this little bottle I will order my beloved revitalash again.  Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other eyelash enhancers and this one just wasn&#x27;t great. I only saw a little bit of growth, there was barely any in the bottle when I first opened it. What was in there only lasted me a few weeks. I was surprised at how quickly it ran out. I&#x27;ve bought other brands that came with less product but lasted longer and worked better. I don&#x27;t regret buying it but I will not buy it again. It didn&#x27;t make my eyes itch or sting. I had no allergic reaction to it which is quite amazing since everything nearly makes me break out. I also feel like the tube is more heavy then is should be. At first I thought the tube was heavy because it was full of product but now that the product is gone, the tube is pretty much the same weight.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change. I think if you really want to see results go with the prescription stuff</li>
    <li> Works great, does not irritate the eyes and lashes grow beautifully!  I will continue to purchase this product every time I run out</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I removed my makeup at night and applied it on eyelids and eyebrows for several weeks.  At first it stung a bit but not bad.  My skin is sensitive.  But I saw no difference.</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully for three months, morning and night. I really saw no improvement at all. It is very pricy so I am returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> This is the one and only eye lash growth treatment I have used, and I am very happy with my results.  My eye lashes have always been non-existent, and now they are so long! Envyderm didn&#x27;t add any volume or darkening color to them though, but length is good enough for me.  It took some time and commitment but this product really does work!  I will definitely continue to purchase. Good luck guys! :D</li>
    <li> I waited a few months to review this product because I wanted to make sure I gave it a fair shot before reviewing it.  I have noticed visible improvement in the length of my lashes.  They also appear thicker and more vibrant.  I apply this at bedtime as part of my nightly routine. I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts but I have not experienced any irritation or discomfort using this product.  I am satisfied with the results and and will order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I havent had much luck with this it maybe that im not using it vigorously enough-or perhaps im just unlucky. I have seen little improvemnt after almsot 2months of use. Its easy to apply and use and I havent noticed any negative side efftects so I will continue to use try it.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I was using Latisse and my lashes were very long.  I thought I would try something different that didn&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s visit.  After using Envyderm my lashes went back to their original length.  I was also using the Envyderm mascara and eyeliner.  The whole product line was a waste of money and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> I have gotten good results with this product. My eyelashes are thicker and longer giving a wonderful full top lash with a thinner bottom lash.  Consistency is the key to really see and achieve good results. Amazon price is the best price I have seen for this product, and you better stock up at this low price!!</li>
    <li> I tryed it for a long time without noticing a difference at all.  I though well maybe i didn&#x27;t do it long enough, when i came to buy more the seller wouldn&#x27;t shipped to Canada no more.  I tryed contacting the seller but i keep getting that i have the wrong seller.  I&#x27;m relly desapointed.  Can someone help me please?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chantal</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews, I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.  However, after following all the instructions, and using this everyday for more than 4 weeks, nothing has changed.  My lashes have not grown a tad, nor have they thickened.  I wished that this product would work like they claim, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I had previously went through 2 tubes of Lilash and was looking for a cheaper alternative, so I went with Envyderm after reading all the positive reviews. I&#x27;m beginning to think all of the 5-star reviews were written but the company itself, especially the ones that were written within days of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum did nothing for me. Didn&#x27;t even work to maintain all the amazing growth that I had achieved with the Lilash serum that I was using before this. Also after the product dries it gets a little flakey and peels off, so this definitely does not work well during the day if you wear eyeliner. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, I think I&#x27;ll pay the extra cash and stick with my Lilash (it works!)</li>
    <li> I had used Rapid Lash first and it worked like crazy!..You could actually see my eyelashes growing in. They are so sparse from using an eyelash curler so much when I was young and it pulled so many out. I stopped using it for some reason..grrrr..then started again and it never did anything. So ordered another brand&amp;this brand...neither did a thing..NOTHING...I used it faithfully too!..was so bummed!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make a noticeable difference on my lashes. I expect it&#x27;s like a lot of supplements and it does work if the ingredients are filling in something your body needs. But for me, it didn&#x27;t work. And I don&#x27;t want to do it for a year and stay with the same conclusion. If I were seriously worried about my eyelash appearance, it would be worth it to try this in case it works..but just for going from normal to exceptional..not worth it.</li>
    <li> I used it on only one side (left) so I could compare.  After 6 weeks of daily applications I could discern no difference between my right and left eyelashes.  I guess it works for some but not all.  Too bad, but not sure if I would have persevered even if it had worked.  Long eyelashes are attractive but not that important.</li>
    <li> lilash works, but is $100. tried this one for $50 but it didn&#x27;t work. Bought lilash from a company called Blue Outlet for $50; it is the real thing. took 1 month exactly to receive product due to effects of Sandy. will order again.</li>
    <li> Call me a little skeptical, but after using this product I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference. It might help you, but I couldn&#x27;t see a positive or negative difference.</li>
    <li> Works! The hard part is making myself use it everyday! I used it before my wedding and my lashes looked great.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are pretty lame...thin, short and light brown.  I was really hoping this product would help but I have not seen any positive results after using it every single night for 4 months.  I guess it does help on some people because I read lots of positive reviews before purchasing it but not for me!  I will be trying the generic form of Latisse, can&#x27;t remember the name, and will be reviewing that as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve tried a few over the counter brands as well as prescription Latisse. All work well enough so there&#x27;s no need to pay the ridiculous price for a visit to a doctor on top of the cost of the product. This product is by far my favorite. I started using this after a brief obsession with eyelash extensions that left my lashes sparse and thin, and saw improvement within a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered the eyelash serum and got the liquid eyeliner instead.  When I opened the package, it looked exactly like the serum on the outside and I was rushed so I just threw away the box and receipt and put the tube with my cosmetics.  That night I tried to use it and discovered it was black liquid eyeliner, which I hate.  I&#x27;ll just give it away and order from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I have bought several wands of Revitalash over the last year and loved the results.  Lovely long lashes although no new lashes as I had hoped.  This wand does not seem to be yielding quite the same results so I have gone back to what is left of my previous wand which has another name.  I may research this kind of product again as the market seems to be filling up with options.  The price of this purchased on line was about half what my local beauty supply charged me for the first one.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3 months and did not notice any change.  So this was a waste of money for me</li>
    <li> I used it for a month every single day but i didnt see any diffrent.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money .</li>
    <li> I used this product on my stubby blond eyelashes, wishing desperately for it to work. After several weeks I see no improvement and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in September and it&#x27;s January now. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments my lashes get. With mascara, I even get asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes, but nope -- it&#x27;s just this product!  Be aware that it did sting the first couple times I used it, but now with diligence I&#x27;m able to keep it out of my eyes and have had no irritation or problems since.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was expecting too much or what but I saw absolutely no results when using this product.  I used it faithfully for a month and there was zero change in my eyelashes.  Nothing much else to say other than \\&quot;it didn&#x27;t work for me.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My eyelashes appear longer and thicker. I use it everyday as part of my morning routine. I have reordered twice and bought it for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I have  used this product since I received it and it is useless.  I must order Revitalash advanced which does work.</li>
</ol>
