      <li>/&gt;I have been offered this product for free to test and although the manufacturer (and Amazon) may not be happy with my review, it is my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Nice product but</li>
      <li>(there is some nice evenness where there was some discoloration before) and in smoothness.  </li>
      <li>This feels so nice on my combination skin.</li>
      <li>It appears smoother, softer and has a nice flow to it.</li>
      <li>The texture is nice although I have to say even after it  &amp;#34;dries,&amp;#34;  my face feels a bit tacky.  </li>
      <li>others have noted, it is not the best to call this a mask as you do not peel it off, it is more like a moisturizer, slowly absorbed during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I liked the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Not too much, but the perfect amount of hydration for my oil prone skin.</li>
      <li>I make my own skin creams</li>
      <li>Seems to be successful in minimizing fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the immediate results and will continue using this product until something better comes along.</li>
      <li>I love hydration masks and this one is particularly nice.</li>
      <li>I would say this product is more for people with oily or normal skin, it is a bit too light for people with drier skin but for summer nights/days this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Honestly this may be the single best product I have ever purchased besides Glam Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The gel is refreshing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s leaves the skin bright and fresh.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
      <li>I was initially more concerned with ingredients than fragrance, but examining the label</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and adds great moisture.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on</li>
      <li>It rubs in well, and feels refreshing to put on after washing your face at night.  </li>
      <li>I use a CPAP machine and wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work with it, but it dries in about 20 minutes, so I put it on before reading at night</li>
      <li>I did find my skin feeling smoother, but I didn&#x27;t find it feeling more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>As a mask, I put it on after serum and moisturizer (letting both soak in for about five minutes each), and that&#x27;s when it works its magic.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it takes care of my skin overnight. :)</li>
      <li>However I noticed brighter skin in a week, by week two i didn&#x27;t need to exfoliate as often and my skin looked more balanced and i felt more confident going make up</li>
      <li>You may have better results, but this did not work for me.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>Feels so light on my skin!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; meant that there would be a tell-tale mask on my face and worried that the product would get on my pillow.  </li>
      <li>I think this product will be really enjoyable to use in the summer since it has that cooling sensation I mentioned.</li>
      <li>My face is more hydrated than it has been in years.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks much better.</li>
      <li>and I do think my skin feels better in the AM from it&#x27;s use.</li>
      <li>This overnight mask has made me even more of a fan of the Olay brand.</li>
      <li>I love this overnight mask.  </li>
      <li>Love this.....</li>
      <li>Best of all, results are noticeable the next morning</li>
      <li>the morning, the skin was tighter and had a more even tone to it.  </li>
      <li>However, it did help a bit, and for the more normal parts of my face, it felt very nice.</li>
      <li>Its texture is very smooth, &amp;#34;spreadable,&amp;#34; and works easily into my skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin was becoming softer and more luminous.  </li>
      <li>I began to wonder if the mask was just a pleasant distraction from a real skincare regime.  </li>
      <li>More like a lotion than a mask, this is easily applied at night.  </li>
      <li>Super nice on my skin.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that the product is clear and absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m partial to luxury skincare products but this mSk is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Goes on easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and I love the fact that it stays on my face and does it&#x27;s work while I sleep.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face moisturized and somewhat reduces the fine lines around my eyes by morning.  </li>
      <li>And I did not notice any change in my pores or fine lines after using the mask as directed.</li>
      <li>The creamy texture glides on smoothly and leaves my face looking...</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may have missed a night here or there, but for the most part I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After 2 1/2 weeks of consistent use of this product I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer, more even-toned.  </li>
      <li>While I will not use words like &#x27;luminous&#x27; or &#x27;radiance&#x27; in my review, I did notice a significant diffference in terms of skin tone and appearance.  </li>
      <li>This mask goes on like silk, does not have a strong scent and is slowly absorbed during the night; with no residue on your pillow on the morning.  </li>
      <li>scent is pleasant enough to me, and texture-wise, this mask seems to hover between a cream and a gel.</li>
      <li>This is a large jar of a quality product that mostly works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super excited when I opened the box</li>
      <li>My skin feels amazing and so soft in the mornings.</li>
      <li>The Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask feels like a cool, hydrating gel.</li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh fragrance that I like.</li>
      <li>face mask has a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>after my first 30 days with the product I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
      <li>This means this mask is ideal for lazy people like me, who don&#x27;t want to be bothered with washing off a mask ever night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the moisturizer in my normal routine with this for most of the summer.  </li>
      <li>For me, it feel like a very light mask and as long as I avoided the nose area, it didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin at all; for her, she enjoyed the fresh, non-greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>I did test the product on my skin and it felt good at first, but later I got quite itchy.</li>
      <li>Out of the container, Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask is a generous sized jar of gel (as opposed to cream) and scented lightly with a crisp, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did test the product on my skin and it felt good at first, but later I got quite itchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be worth the hassle if the mask delivered, but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds my wife of fresh cucumbers and is not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The title &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; is a bit misleading, because this is really a gel moisturizer. It smells absolutely fabulous, like expensive spa facial products. When I first apply it, my skin tingles a bit, but not in a painful way. I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but for my skin (sensitive, mid-40s), I prefer the Total Effects Overnight Cream.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this.  It rubs in well, and feels refreshing to put on after washing your face at night.  I don&#x27;t like the slight stickiness left after letting it dry, so I would recommend using a little amount at first to see how it feels.  Overall, though, I like this as a nightly moisturizer.  No drastic changes in my skin since starting its use, but it&#x27;s become a relaxing addition to a nightly ritual.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Super excited when I opened the box and it revealed a beautiful, bigger-then-normal sized jar!  I&#x27;m a drugstore product junkie and I love this kinda stuff!  The jar is beautiful and the fragrance is really appealing to me.  I just couldn&#x27;t wait for bedtime to come so I could give this Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask a try.  It&#x27;s a thick gel and it only takes a dime size amount to cover your entire face - that&#x27;s unbelievable!  It&#x27;s super easy to apply and I love the fact that it stays on my face and does it&#x27;s work while I sleep.  After 2 1/2 weeks of consistent use of this product I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer, more even-toned.  In the morning I simply rinse my face off, apply lotion/sunscreen and my daily makeup.  I&#x27;ve even used less foundation because my skin looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more walking around the house and scaring my family with a thick white mask that I have to then peel off my face 30 minutes later.  Ain&#x27;t nobody have time for that!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 30 days.  I decided to use is each night and assess the product at the end of the 30 day period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a little surprised to learn than the term &#x27;mask&#x27; is misleading.  When one hears &#x27;mask&#x27; one thinks of the chalky green stuff that you either have to peel off the next day of wipe off with a cloth.  This is actually a gel/cream consistency (closer to gel -- more like a pearly-gel) that you smooth on and it absorbs into your skin.  There is none of that unpleasant tightness you get with a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to know that the fragrance wasn&#x27;t either heavily perfumed or heavily chemical.  It isn;t unpleasant, it smells vaguely &#x27;creamy-like&#x27; (if that is a thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So each night I cleansed my face and smoothed this on.  I have combination skin and a bit of an an uneven tone, so I was curious to see if I would see any result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied it, I applied too much.  You really don&#x27;t need much to cover the surface of your face.  This is 4.5 oz and after 30 days of daily use, I still have a LOT of product left.  Easily enough to see me through another couple-three months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not get this into your eyes.  Stings if it gets into the eyes.  Not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after 30 days I can say I do see a visible difference both in tone of my skin (there is some nice evenness where there was some discoloration before) and in smoothness.  It isn&#x27;t some dramatic thing, but it is noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after my first 30 days with the product I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this. I have broken out a ton but I think that is just an adjustment. Not sticky or tacky. Like the gel. But I can&#x27;t tell yet after two weeks if I see a difference. I think I need to rinse it off really well in the morning before my workouts.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product because of all the great reviews it&#x27;s gotten, especially since I have oily sensitive skin and a lot of people with the same issues have not had problems with it. I love the feel and smell of the lotion, but unfortunately when I woke up the next morning, I had broken out. I haven&#x27;t had pimples in over a year and overnight 3 new (tiny) pimples formed. I had to send it back and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since I stopped using it. Hopefully other people have better luck than me!</li>
    <li> I have had some noticeable results with the Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask. More on this later. First the packaging was nice as you would expect, the container was quite large for a face product, I usually find them coming in small containers for more money.  This product once applied takes about 30 minutes to an hour to absorb completely.  I did find my skin feeling smoother, but I didn&#x27;t find it feeling more moisturized.  The next morning, I could even see a slight residue left on my skin from the mask. Maybe that&#x27;s just my skin type, I don&#x27;t know, I am north of 50 now and have wrinkles and my skin just isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dewy fresh&amp;#34; like in my youth.  I will more than likely use up this product, but I don&#x27;t find myself purchasing it in the future.  I will just stick with my Regenerist moisturizer face lotion instead.</li>
    <li> I was initially more concerned with ingredients than fragrance, but examining the label I was more upset that it is not animal friendly (unknown source of glycerin, animal fat and concerned it is tested on animals) and it&#x27;s made in China! Ugh! (By the way, lots of Procter &amp; Gamble products are made in China, including this one!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other reviewers commented on the fragrance of this product (that it had a strong &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; scent). I was less concerned with the scent. It actually is fairly light, and soapy, clean smell, yet not particularly natural. I don&#x27;t find it overpowering, although I prefer all natural &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; which this is not. I make my own skin creams and I find the ingredients a little alarming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few ingredients in the list on the package compose of most of the 100% of what&#x27;s in this. The first few ingredient are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;butylene glycol (alcohol used as solvent and conditioning agent)&lt;br /&gt;glycerin (unknown source, see PETA&#x27;s &amp;#34;Caring Consumer&amp;#34; info)&lt;br /&gt;niacinamide (Vitamin B3)&lt;br /&gt;Although none of these are &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; per the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Data, they are not something I particularly like to use on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got to the 5th ingredient (cyclopentasiloxane) I decided this is not a product I want to use on my body. You can search for that ingredient in EWG&#x27;s database online (google it) and see that it has various &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; concerns. The one that stood out to me was &amp;#34;tumor formation at moderate doses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;isopropylisostearate, dimethicone, polymethylsilsesquioxane, morus alba root extract, lilum cadidum flower extract, lonicera japonic (honeysuckle) flower, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, tocopheryl acetate  (vitamin e), glucosyl hesperidin, panthenol (Vitamin B5), acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, dimethicone crosspolymer, aminomethly propanol, phenoxyethanol, dmdm hydantoin, ethylhexl salicylate, benzyl alchohol, cetyl alcohol, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, dsodium edta, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of chemicals. Lots of ingredients I don&#x27;t want to put on my skin. Only one thing good, they don&#x27;t include parabens, which are used as a preservative and banned in may contries since they have been attributed to cancer, especially breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been offered this product for free to test and although the manufacturer (and Amazon) may not be happy with my review, it is my honest opinion. I did test the product on my skin and it felt good at first, but later I got quite itchy. I tend to be sensitive to chemicals in skin products, but if you tolerate chemicals and like other Olay products, you just might enjoy this product.

    <li> Love this.....until now I have purchased at Target or CVS.</li>
    <li> I love this mask cream! It makes my skin very soft....</li>
    <li> I would say this product is more for people with oily or normal skin, it is a bit too light for people with drier skin but for summer nights/days this is perfect. It left my skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It is my ultimate favorite.  I live how soft it makes your skin feel and look.  I will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great overnight moisturizer.  I use a CPAP machine and wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work with it, but it dries in about 20 minutes, so I put it on before reading at night and it&#x27;s dry by the time I have to put my mask on.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and adds great moisture.</li>
    <li> Great, light fragrance.  This mask goes on like silk, does not have a strong scent and is slowly absorbed during the night; with no residue on your pillow on the morning.  The scent reminds my wife of fresh cucumbers and is not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, the skin was tighter and had a more even tone to it.  There was no special techniques needed to get it off, just a typical face wash before applying make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have noted, it is not the best to call this a mask as you do not peel it off, it is more like a moisturizer, slowly absorbed during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> REALLY like this creme.  Seems to be successful in minimizing fine lines.  Well greats.</li>
    <li> The Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask feels like a cool, hydrating gel. It feels good going on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take long to feel like it has been absorbed into my skin. It has a cooling feeling when rubbing it it. I don&#x27;t normally get that same sensation with a cream moisturizer. It seems misleading being called a mask, because you don&#x27;t rinse the product off after a few minutes. You sleep with it on like a moisturizer. My skin is dry in the winter and I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t be thick enough to moisturize my skin overnight. So far it has kept me hydrated. I think this product will be really enjoyable to use in the summer since it has that cooling sensation I mentioned. If you have extremely dry skin and additional moisturizer may be needed.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was expecting this overnight lotion to be like all other over-the-counter night creams I have tried, but Olay Regenerist was different at my first application.  The cool gel easily glides over your face and I felt a slight tingling sensation that lasted just under a minute.  You have to be a little quick on applying it on your face or it will start to dry and will form tiny balls as you rub it in as all gel products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel will quickly start absorbing in your face leaving no residue.  It has a pleasant aroma - a hint of citrus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed my face in the mornings my face feels clean without any nasty oily feeling.  It is like is disappeared and vanished deep down into my skin.  My face feels smooth and looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a huge jar at 4.5 ounces ad it should last for a very long time because a little bit goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is meant for night time use.  Since it is a gel it will not work well under makeup or a moisturizer because of the gel consistency.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist has added another wonderful product to their line of skin products. The Luminous Overnight Mask is a Gel based skin moisturizer which unlike other overnight masks you don&#x27;t have to peel off or scrub off the left overs after you wake up in the morning. Because it&#x27;s Gel based it absorbs into your skin and helps to soften, brighten and even your skin tone leaving it looking healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Olay to get the full benefits it could take up to 4 weeks of daily usage. However I noticed brighter skin in a week, by week two i didn&#x27;t need to exfoliate as often and my skin looked more balanced and i felt more confident going make up free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and it works well, especially in conjunction with other olay products. I would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this so far.  We will see as time goes by, whether It looks luminous.</li>
    <li> I have used different face masks and Olay Regenerists gave me even skin tone. I have dark spots on my face and it lightened! I love the fact that it takes care of my skin overnight. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask all summer and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve replaced the moisturizer in my normal routine with this for most of the summer.  My normal night cream is on the heavier side for warmer months and this is light and cooling and my skin seems to drink it in.  While it is lighter my face still seems to reap the benefits of a cream moisturizer in that it&#x27;s remained relatively on par with a normal moisturizer battling between hot and sunny and cold recirculated gusts (air conditioning). I am a big fan of this product.  My face tends to be combination these days with some parts being parched and other sections being in overdrive (like puberty all over again!).  This seems to be a happy medium between the more drying and age defying products in my routine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this gel-mask! The creamy texture glides on smoothly and leaves my face looking...well....hydrated! Just after a week of consistent usage before bed time, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. It appears smoother, softer and has a nice flow to it. I&#x27;ve never purchased a product like this before so to be honest, I have nothing to compare it to except general facial moisturizers but I believe this is the real deal! I am very pleased with the immediate results and will continue using this product until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement since using this, but it isn&#x27;t irritating. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m partial to luxury skincare products but this mSk is AMAZING!!! I noticed results after one day. I can&#x27;t stop using it. It&#x27;s leaves the skin bright and fresh. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering an overnight mask.</li>
    <li> I have such mixed feelings about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  My face is more hydrated than it has been in years.  I have only been using for a week and my face has a dewy hydrated glow. Honestly this may be the single best product I have ever purchased besides Glam Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the list of cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsanitary container this should be a pump or a tube.  I don&#x27;t want to stick my fingers in something I&#x27;m putting on my face night after night.&lt;br /&gt;Chemical smell to the product.  Not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;My face itches after I apply it.  Also a tacky sticky feel.  I f I had to wear this during the day I would give it 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the packaging.  If it contains pro vitamins will they degrade over time since the packaging is not air tight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my face looks great but its itchy and sticky.  I would have given it 5 stars except that my face is itchy after applying.</li>
    <li> Oil of Regenerative over night mask is great, it works!  I have Sun damage spots and was using another product cost$70.00 the damage was not going away I purchased the over night mask from Amazon and in three days it&#x27;s lightening up hasn&#x27;t disappeared but it works..yea!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is technically an overnight mask, but it also works really nicely as a regular moisturizer for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it both ways: I used it alone on my skin, and it moisturized quite well, though it couldn&#x27;t quite tackle my really dry, flaky patches. However, it did help a bit, and for the more normal parts of my face, it felt very nice. As a mask, I put it on after serum and moisturizer (letting both soak in for about five minutes each), and that&#x27;s when it works its magic. The next day, the flaky patches had nearly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant enough to me, and texture-wise, this mask seems to hover between a cream and a gel. When you rub it into your skin, it smooths out into a gel, but I found it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky for very long. Maybe my skin is just dry enough to suck it all up, but it absorbed pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, considering the downright huge size of the container, this product is a great value. It works very well for a drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> This feels so nice on my combination skin. It has a light, fresh fragrance that I like. My skin looks glowy in the morning. Love this!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. Really happy with this product..can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
    <li> Freaking made in CHINA....If i had known if was  made China I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> I have been using OLAY for a very long time. I trusted this brand so much that I didn&#x27;t see where it was made. MADE in CHINA.... I was so disappointed. Why in the world OLAY has to outsource all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Does Protect &amp; Gamble want to cut cost? Take an example like Lumber Liquidations-now they are in trouble because the Chinese company use cheaper materials to cut cost.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind if it is something to wear or use (like iPhone, etc). But something to apply on my skin? Yeah...it is time to look for other companies.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that OLAY will be smart enough to get their products back to Made in USA.</li>
    <li> Feels so light on my skin! And no bad smell either like the last night cream I tried.</li>
    <li> I love this! Not too much, but the perfect amount of hydration for my oil prone skin. My skin feels amazing and so soft in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my results. My skin looks much better.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily. No offensive odors or irritation. Best of all, results are noticeable the next morning: skin in cheeks is firmer, pores on nose seem shallower. After about three uses, bags under the eyes are lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also trying it on forehead, a face blemish, and neck. Results on these areas less noticeable so far but will continue to report.</li>
    <li> I love this overnight mask.  The first time I put it on, my face tingled a little.  I woke up the next morning, and my face still felt moisturized.  Every other night I&#x27;ve put it on there hasn&#x27;t been any tingling and I wake up with my face feeling great.  It&#x27;s a gel that dries fast and you can barely tell it&#x27;s on once it dries.</li>
    <li> I love hydration masks and this one is particularly nice. It is a gel-based mask and goes on smoothly, not oily, and absorbs quickly. In the morning, my face felt hydrated. I have sensitive skin so this probably will not be a daily ritual, but you certainly could use it as a nighttime moisturizer. My skin felt a little congested after a couple of uses, so I rotated back to my normal moisturizer. But I will use it as needed when the weather becomes very dry.</li>
    <li> This is a large jar of a quality product that mostly works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find the fragrance too strong or objectionable - to me, it was light and hardly noticeable after a few minutes. It goes on like any other gel product and is well absorbed into my skin (though it takes a while...maybe an hour or so of feeling sticky), leaving me feeling soft, smooth and moisturized. Definitely noticed results the next morning, and it seems to improve with more usage over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue to some might be that it&#x27;s a mass-produced item made in China, but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Shockingly, this is a huge jar for any type of beauty product.  I&#x27;m not complaining mine you - just a pleasant surprise.  The gel feels soft and creamy and a little does go a good ways.  I use it at night as directed and I do think my skin feels better in the AM from it&#x27;s use. I am a big Olay fan and think this product works well as a nighttime moisturizer.  It claims to even the skin tone and brighten the skin over time. I am not sure how much time that requires, but as long as it is moisturizing and seems to be good for my skin I am willing to keep using it to obtain the maximum result.  5 stars  Marilyn</li>
    <li> Super nice on my skin. The gel is refreshing and I liked the fragrance. (I know some people didn&#x27;t care for it.) It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer. At first I thought I had to rinse it off. Duh. No need. Just let it dry before your head hits the pillow! My face feels great in the morning. I&#x27;m still old though.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have seen such results, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just noted today, my laugh lines were less prominent  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> More like a lotion than a mask, this is easily applied at night.  It is not greasy at all, and a little goes a long way, helping it last.  While I will not use words like &#x27;luminous&#x27; or &#x27;radiance&#x27; in my review, I did notice a significant diffference in terms of skin tone and appearance.  My forehead looks quite a bit less wrinkled, and my cheeks have a much more even tone than before.  I am rather pleased with the results for something that only adds 30 seconds to my nightly routine.  In short, it is an easy step that shows results.</li>
    <li> While this is intended to be used as an overnight mask, I actually prefer to use it as a daytime lotion. It works great as a moisturizer. It glides on clear and absorbs into the skin completely after a few minutes, leaving a subtle citrus scent. There is actually no mask feel to this product - meaning that there is not a layer of film that forms that you feel like you have to wash off. But I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so maybe it&#x27;s not compatible for day use if you do.</li>
    <li> I like the silky feel of the product, and how far a small amount will go (a small dab is enough to cover my entire face).  It leaves my face moisturized and somewhat reduces the fine lines around my eyes by morning.  However, it seems to cause blemishes (zits) which I find to be highly annoying and they take days to go away.  I would love this product, but the zits are not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> My wife and I tested this out - my skin is oily and blackhead-prone whereas she occasionally has dryness. For me, it feel like a very light mask and as long as I avoided the nose area, it didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin at all; for her, she enjoyed the fresh, non-greasy feeling. I didn&#x27;t personally notice any differences in wrinkles though my skin felt rejuvenated and she felt it took about two weeks but there was an impact on visible wrinkles. The fragrance wasn&#x27;t strong enough to bother either of us and this is a large enough container to last 3-4 months for one person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now pretty religiously.  I may have missed a night here or there, but for the most part I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; meant that there would be a tell-tale mask on my face and worried that the product would get on my pillow.  I was happy to see that the product is clear and absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is alot of product in the (4.5 oz) in the container and after using it for three weeks, it looks as if it will last me at least triple that time.  I&#x27;m not happy about the container though.  I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers  into my products.  Although  I wash my hands thoroughly,  I sometimes wonder if I&#x27;m transferring germs into the container and contaminating it. The product itself is a thick gel and easily sticks to my index finger to get the right amount for my face.  Its texture is very smooth, &amp;#34;spreadable,&amp;#34; and works easily into my skin.  The texture is nice although I have to say even after it  &amp;#34;dries,&amp;#34;  my face feels a bit tacky.  I&#x27;ve also noticed when I wake up the next day, my face still feels a bit tacky.  But, after I rinse (no washing) my face in the shower, my face feels amazingly soft and hydrated.  I can even get away with less make-up; just a bit of loose powder and blush and my make-up is done.  I&#x27;m not sure if a &amp;#34;more even tone&amp;#34; was  advertised but it really seems to be evening out my skin tone.  The scent is subtle and a bit &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; &amp;#34; but dissipates quickly and not bothersome to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to others who are looking for a hydrating overnight mask.</li>
    <li> Out of the container, Olay Regenerist Luminous Overnight Mask is a generous sized jar of gel (as opposed to cream) and scented lightly with a crisp, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, the gel takes a few minutes to soak in, but once it does it left my face feeling soft.  However, I have dry / combo skin and it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling like my skin was particularly hydrated.  Nice product but not exactly what I prefer.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on easily&lt;br /&gt;- Not greasy or oily&lt;br /&gt;- Does not stain sheets and pillowcase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;- why is it made in china? Why can&#x27;t it be made in USA?</li>
    <li> Although the packaging is pretty, and the mask feels nice on my skin, I&#x27;m disappointed with this product. The mask is messy and you can&#x27;t sleep in in without ruining your bed linens or putting a towel over your pillow. It&#x27;d be worth the hassle if the mask delivered, but doesn&#x27;t. Yes, it softens and moisturizes your face...but no more than any other good moisturizer. And I did not notice any change in my pores or fine lines after using the mask as directed. You may have better results, but this did not work for me. Sadness!</li>
    <li> This overnight mask has made me even more of a fan of the Olay brand. I love the way it feels and it does dry completely before I go to sleep. I can tell that it moisturizes my face while I sleep, leaving it looking great when I wake up in the morning. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> With this face mask, a little goes a long way, and with such an enormous pot of product I do mean a LONG, LONG way.  I&#x27;ve been using this to close to a month now and I&#x27;ve only used up about a quarter of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face mask has a fresh, clean scent.  It&#x27;s definitely of chemical origin, but the fragrance is light and fades pretty quickly.  The mask itself is white and has the consistency of a gel rather than a thick cream or paste.  Once applied, it slowly sinks into the skin instead of hardening or congealing into a solid, peel-of substance.  This means this mask is ideal for lazy people like me, who don&#x27;t want to be bothered with washing off a mask ever night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first week of use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. I began to wonder if the mask was just a pleasant distraction from a real skincare regime.  I mean, rubbing the mask on each nice is refreshing and soothing because the gel is always cool to the touch, but was that all it was?  However, as the second week progressed I began to detect a subtle change.  My skin was becoming softer and more luminous.  As I continued to use the mask it became smoother and healthier-looking.  True, there are a couple of dry patches that remain stubbornly rough, but the mask has done wonders for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> For $24 (the current price), this is a good mask considering the 130 mL size - which is bigger than most masks at that price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it several days, I was happy with the results, although I&#x27;m not sure if many people noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to leave it on for a bit longer than they suggest, but I haven&#x27;t done an experiment to see if that really makes a difference. Overall, it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
