<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice deodorant for years but recently ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find any in local drugstores - so I looked on the&lt;br /&gt;Internet. In order to stop sublimation, I keep it in the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;The new deodorant smalls a little different but still nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Old Spice Classic Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant stick for nearly 20 years. I am not particularly attached to the smell (although others seem to recognize it on me immediately), and it does leave the white residue everywhere I go for a few hours after applying, but I continue to use it, and only it, because it works the best for my sensitive skin. Spray on deodorant, gel deodorant, and regular stick deodorant irritates my skin after a few days, and other antiperspirant deodorants (basically the \\&quot;white chalky\\&quot; deodorants) either only last a few hours, leave a giant mess everywhere, or stain my shirts. Old Spice does none of that. It lasts all day, which is important to me as I am a pretty active person. It doesn&#x27;t destroy my clothes by staining them, and the powder residue is relatively small, compared to other antiperspirants, which is a good trade-off for comfortable, clean-smelling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about Old Spice Classic is that it is so hard to find! One local supermarket carries it, but when they are out, I have to go to a backup brand until they restock because no one else carries it. When they are out for weeks at a time, I am left to buying from an internet drug store that always has it in stock, but takes forever to deliver. Needless to say, I was HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY to see that Amazon prime carried it, in bulk, for less than half the price of my local source. I have no idea how long it will take me to go through twelve of these things, but even if I don&#x27;t make it all the way through and have to toss the last few because they dried out, it&#x27;ll still be less expensive (and more reassuring) than continuing to go to my local source.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff my husband will use and I can only find it online now - if they ever stop making it he is going to smell!  Great deal!!</li>
    <li> This product is labelled and promoted as \\&quot;Old Spice Classic Stick, Original Scent\\&quot;.  However, it is not the original scent, despite the label.  It is a more heavily perfumed product which would seem perhaps appropriate for feminine tastes, but certainly not for a man.  I have used the original Old Spice for 50 years but could not find that original product anywhere in stores.  I purchased this item in the belief that it was the original Old Spice, and now possess 12 sticks of this stuff that, quite literally, smells like a bottle of bad perfume.  Unless Old Spice brings back their original product, I&#x27;ll not purchase this item again and will not use what was delivered.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this specific type of Old Spice the new one just does not work for me. Unfortunately it is my favorite brand. I think it works better than any of the others.</li>
    <li> Since 1954 I have used religiously used Old Spice Classic Deodorant Stick, Original Scent, 2.5 Oz.  Nothing else that Proctor &amp; Gamble even comes close to being this product, no matter how much the dress it up and pretended it is the same.  Has anyone noticed that the other shapes of the Classic make you smell like a French whorehouse plus some ingredient in it, pulls your armpit hairs out?    Now I will pay very close attention to whatever I buy to make certain it is not made by Proctor &amp; Gamble, \\&quot;the company that doesn&#x27;t care, it doesn&#x27;t have to care.\\&quot;  I will carefully shop and see if I can find a different company for anything I traditionally by made from Proctor &amp; Gamble!    Now days they have deodorants that no only make you smell like you have just come from a French whorehouse, but like you were rolled in tropical fruit on the way out the door.    Remember:  Proctor &amp; Gamble, \\&quot;the company that doesn&#x27;t care, it doesn&#x27;t have to care!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> great price on an item that i could no longer find  locally. it seems that every one wants the stuff that  gets them the HOT women...... all i want is the spice  scent that i have been using for nearly 25 years</li>
    <li> Great price and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant/deodorant my husband will use.  He just does not like new new varieties.  Thank heaven I can still get it on the internet.   Price is great and I can get his years supply!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades.  This antiperspirant applies smoothly and provides excellent, long-lasting, protection.  I find it better than many of the \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; antiperspirants from P&amp;G.  It&#x27;s a good thing - no need to change.  I am unable to find this product on the store shelf in my area, so availability on-line is a great find...</li>
    <li> I love Old Spice Original Scent. I have not been able to find it in local stores so this was a good find for a good price.</li>
    <li> Old Spice Classic Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant Stick, Original! This is the best they make. This is the one we want! But and I say but, we can&#x27;t find it! This is without a doubt the best. It is a classic scent that was formulated from the seamen who sailed the seven seas!</li>
    <li> With three guys in my home - two of them teenagers - I&#x27;m very grateful for this!  I love the smell, and it seems to work great.</li>
    <li> This will get all over your shirt, every time you wear it. The consistency is pretty cakey. It&#x27;s generally okay as far as antiperspiration, but not the best.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers Old Spice, original. I was glad I could find it in bulk on Amazon. The product arrived in a timely fashion and the package was intact.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I buy in quantity from Amazon and love the deodorant that I have used for 30+ years.</li>
    <li> Excellent, good protector for sweating, is not greasy, my wife loves the scent and feel very cool with their use</li>
    <li> Great smelling old spice.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.  Good value for the bulk purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the original. Why do they make such a good thing hard to find? This is the white solid original scent.</li>
    <li> I really like the original Old Spice scent. It reminds me of my father, who would only use Old Spice products. I recall standing at his knee while he shaved and then applied Old Spice After Shave. The deodorant works and smells like my dad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice classic for years - don&#x27;t ever discontinue it! I&#x27;ll keep on buying when I need too</li>
    <li> Same classic original deodorant!!  Wish this one came in a larger stick, but you can barely even find it in the store anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years.  Cant find it in stores anymore.  I&#x27;ve tried different deodorants but this works better.</li>
    <li> It is the old one that my husband has worn for forty years and can no longer be found in our local Kroger.</li>
    <li> This is a very good item especially in the size in which it can be carried in the air plane</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used it for years, maybe as long as two decades. In the past couple years it has become less common to find in the local supermarkets. It is great to know it&#x27;s available online through Amazon, in-bulk and at a reasonable cost. Was concerned I would not be able to find it locally and therefore be required to use the more recently introduced products that do not work as well for me and for which I do like their aroma.</li>
    <li> The line now is you wouldn&#x27;t be here if your Grandfather hadn&#x27;t used Old Spice. Mine did, as did my father and so I continue the tradition for the last 50 years. Nothing like the smell of Old Spice to give you the memory flash back we all enjoy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and worth the bulk order .  My stores no longer carry it and I&#x27;ve been using this forever.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years !  it&#x27;s the only one i want !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like Grandpa used to smell! This deodorant does just what it&#x27;s supposed to in a handy size. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find in stores and we save money with Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> This is the original scent.  The quality is just like you buy in the store.  I order these by the 12pk because this scent is hard to find.  The hubby prefers the plain ole original and it&#x27;s hard to find in my town. I can find everything BUT original.  This saves me the time and trouble of having to go to 10 stores.  This is my third order with FREE SHIPPING.  Yippie!</li>
    <li> This is the best old spice product they make  in my opinion you can get double protection from this product have used it for over 30  + years the best</li>
    <li> It is the one I have been using for years and don&#x27;t want anything else. When you get something you like you stick with it.</li>
    <li> Old Spice Classic Anti-perspirant &amp; Deodorant Stick is still the best. Works all day long with a single application. I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 35 years.</li>
    <li> really hard to find in stores anymore and this original works. The new high endurance does not!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years.  Now our boys do too.  Classic manly scent.  They like that it is an antiperspirant and deodorant.</li>
    <li> My husband and I had searched everywhere for this traditional scent that he wanted. We now have enough to last him for quite a long time. If this is the scent you want, go for it.</li>
    <li> have used this product for 20 years  cant find it anywhere,  thanks</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  I can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore for some reason and it&#x27;s all my husband will wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> my whole family has been using this product for  years.  i find this particular one hard to find in the stores and was very happy to find amazon subscribe and save. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love my Old Spice Deodorant. Great small profile stick that fits well in my travel case. Still love the effectiveness and aroma. Great buy even as a 12 pack/</li>
    <li> My husband has used this type of Old Spice for years and it has been increasingly hard to find in stores in rural Alabama. This is exactly what we were looking for and at  great price.</li>
    <li> This is hard to come by where I live.  I had asked my guy what he was wearing.  He said nothing.  I had to smell him all over, before I realized I was smelling his pits.  Now I still do.  Kinda gross, I know, he thinks so too.  But love it so much, I got a case, and don&#x27;t bother with cologne anymore.  I will say that it does leave the white residue.  He doesn&#x27;t care and neither do I.  It works too.  Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Old Spice Classic in the original 2 ounce stick is surprisingly hard to find in my local stores.  When I do find it there are typically only a few sticks left, which is a pain.  Finding the 12 pack on Amazon was awesome.  5 stars for a favorite product in volume at a great price!</li>
    <li> My husband has very few choices when it comes to wearing a deodorant that won&#x27;t make his sensitive skin break out. This is an effective choice, too, although he is not a big sweater, or a stinky one. Has a pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> This stuff turns my armpits into hellfire burning red welts that itch and burn for days after one use.  Never again.</li>
    <li> My husband has used only Old Spice Classic Original antiperspirant/deodorant for 40 years. He does not care for any of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; scents. Because this Old Spice stick is such a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; item, it is very difficult to find stores that carry it. All of the stock seems to be the current, jazzed-up fragrances. It was wonderful to find Amazon offering it as a 12-pack buy! What a relief to learn that it&#x27;s not a discontinued product and that there is obviously still a market out there for this tried-and-true basic, clean fragrance. Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I get reactions to many deodorants and anti-perspirants and have found that Original Old Spice works very well for me. Many retailors have stopped carrying it so it is getting harder and harder to find. On a whim I searched it on Amazon and I found that I could get it for a great price without a shipping fee if I bought a dozen at one time online. Though it will take me awhile to use a dozen I won&#x27;t have to try to find it now until I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire transaction exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for great service Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they ever stopped selling this in stores, but I am some happy that I can still get it here</li>
    <li> I have used Old Spice Classic for as long as I can remember.  The price was just great because I am unable to find this product in any stores here.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, works as intending; and on the plus side, if you forget or don&#x27;t use cologne, has just enough scent to attract that special woman!</li>
    <li> Simple and effective.  Glad you have it everyone around here has quick caring it.</li>
    <li> Product is almost impossible to find in stores.  Arrived as promised in excellent shape. Product was fresh. Very good price. Only wish I could have used my coupons. I will buy again as soon as I use up all 12.</li>
    <li> been using it forever</li>
    <li> I love these. However they do stain clothes (yellowish stain).</li>
    <li> Smells good. I guess it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; scent but it still smells good. It also stops sweating, although not good as degree.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of hormone changes at my age or what, but my regular brand of deodorant (Dove ultimate) was starting to fail me. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and that&#x27;s been my brand since my 20&#x27;s. It wasn&#x27;t the sweat that the problem, it just smelled like I forgot to put deodorant on when I just did a few hours ago especially if I went out in the sun. Weird... so I thought I might have to buy the expensive &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; brands, but oddly enough, I  just bought this brand for my teen son. I wanted to get him a lot because he never tells me before he runs out. This Old Spice was a great price, so I bought it. One day I was in a rush and all I could find was this stuff, and I was amazed how well it worked for odor protection on myself. I was like &amp;#34;you got to be kidding me.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t even smell like men&#x27;s stuff when I wear it. It&#x27;s so weird. It just works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Old Spice, what more is there to say. I have been using these products for over 50 years and I hope to continue.</li>
    <li> Perfect, the stores don&#x27;t sell this one anymore. The only one my husband likes.</li>
    <li> I can seriously never find this at the drug store.  Its the classic, white stick, original scent.  No frills, just old Old Spice.  This is a great deal, and will be buying them by the case indefinitely or until Amazon stops selling it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one I want, and it&#x27;s what I buy.  A case will last about 7-8 years, the smell is not very strong, it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, Great Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores so I get it a case at a time.</li>
    <li> The product came to me and i so happy, i recomend to everyone !</li>
    <li> The original Old Spice scent is very pleasant, and this product has not been irritating to the men in my family.  My husband smells fresh and can use this even though he has sensitive skin.  We have bought this product for at least 40 years and have never regretted it.  Old Spice with never go out of style in our household</li>
    <li> Expiration date is less than a year.  Can&#x27;t possibly use 12 deodorant sticks in that time frame. Would not order again.  Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Husband won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a long time, but recently all the stores in my area have decided to stop carrying it.  If I had to compare what it looked like, it would be closer to High Endurance than it would be Red Zone/Sweat Defense.  It&#x27;s not invisible, and it will get on the inside of your shirt, but it smells good and does a good job as an anti-antiperspirant and deodorant.  Goes great with the Classic Bodywash, as well as the Classic Aftershave and Cologne, making it easy to keep a uniform scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend who was very distressed that he could no longer find his favorite deodorant. He had been using this particular Classic version of Old Spice for many years and swears no other brand can perform as well. He was elated to receive his package and will be ordering more from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> best deodorant on the market; hard to find in stores because it works</li>
    <li> Old Spice original has been my deodorant since I was 13 years old and I am now 55. So I&#x27;m a little bias but it&#x27;s the best to me.</li>
    <li> Our local WalMart made these extinct quite some time ago. Unfortunately it was the hubbys favorite brand.  He claims it works better than any of the others.</li>
