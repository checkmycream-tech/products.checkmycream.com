      <li>the price was right!  </li>

      <li>I contacted Ocean Potion manufacture customer service, she told me first</li>

      <li>The fragrance is mild, and it soaks into dry skin like a fine lotion.</li>

      <li>For now ~ I absolutely believe in this product, and will continue to use it on our children (and us ~</li>

      <li>(although I do like the unique orange smell of the blue 30spf bottle).</li>
      <li>I am extremely pale, so I burn very easily.</li>
      <li>The smell was the same medical smell that so many have.  </li>
      <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Get the new formulation (more expensive), available on drugstore.com</li>

      <li>Our children are INCREDIBLY pale and burn easily ~</li>

      <li>This sunblock works for me as no other.  </li>

      <li>It goes on white, and rubs in clear.  </li>
      <li>We have never needed to reapply, and neither child has ever so much as gotten pink!  </li>
      <li>Since we live in the desert southwest, this has been a lifelong problem.  </li>
      <li>works really well, the skin on my face did get a bit of an irritated feeling for a little while after applying but no redness appeared.</li>
      <li>Went on a little greasy, but was gentle and didn&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>

<li> I fully believe the 80+ minute rating ~ as our boys are ROUGH when it comes to water sports or just running around.  </li>
<li> Finally decided to research &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; alternative sunblocks for our kiddo&#x27;s after using your everyday run of the mill store brand sunblock for a couple of years.  </li>
<li> so she doesn&#x27;t use it for everyday use, but when she will be out in the sun a long time this stuff does the trick.</li>
<li> No funny smell either</li>
<li> I wear every day on my face due to sun spots.  </li>
<li> It is not worth the hassle of returning it.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend this to other parents for their children!  </li>
<li> But alas, this product seemed off from the start in that it did not have the same shade of pink as the bottle bought from the store.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; although you will be slightly</li>
<li> It&#x27;s significantly less expensive than Neutrogena&#x27;s sensitive skin sunblock, and it doesn&#x27;t have the chalky whitecast.</li>
<li> Small</li>
<li> This is what I have been using on my face for a few years now, but I am unable to find it in stores.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Ocean Potion and I wish stores here in California would sell it! This is non greasy, light weight, but works fantastic. No funny smell either (although I do like the unique orange smell of the blue 30spf bottle).</li>
    <li> love this ....... have used for 10+ years</li>
    <li> This is great for my kid with eczema. Went on a little greasy, but was gentle and didn&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
    <li> I love this sun screen! I am extremely pale, so I burn very easily. This sun screen keeps me unburnt for about 6 hours in direct sun light.  What they don&#x27;t say in the product description, which should be an added bonus, is that this company does NOT test on animals.  It goes on easily, and does not leave my skin feeling filmy.  I will definitely be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a non-greasy, long lasting sunscreen. The fragrance is mild, and it soaks into dry skin like a fine lotion. It also comes in a 30 Spf travel size. We like Ocean Potion better than Coppertone Sport.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I wear every day on my face due to sun spots.  I isn&#x27;t greasy or stinky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock for years.  It works great and never feels greasy.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find in local stores, so being able to purchase on Amazon is fantastic!</li>
    <li> the price was right!  I will purchase this product again.  Not greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.  Love it</li>
    <li> I asked for Sunblock but sent me something in Spanish.  I contacted Ocean Potion manufacture customer service, she told me first this product in Spanish is not allowed to sell in USA because it did not meet FDA requirement; second she suggested me to dispose this product.  I am very disappoint it.</li>
    <li> This is what I have been using on my face for a few years now, but I am unable to find it in stores.  So Amazon to the rescue again.  It is a light non-greasy sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I received this item quickly and in condition advertised.</li>
    <li> My kids have super sensitive skin from allergies. This is the best sun screen I have ever bought and it works the best!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand, every different sunscreen they make is excellent. Its a treat to put it on and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great company as they are making excellent &amp;#34;sun&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not greasy at all!</li>

The spray&#x27;s always seemed relatively risky, and after doing some research ~ found that Ocean Potion was about the best you could get without going &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;.  We did want to stay in the chemical realm so our children didn&#x27;t turn bright white or have to have it reapplied every 30 minutes like some of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used EWG.org as our guide for safety ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to EWG ~ This sunscreen rates a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; on a scale of 1 - 7 (With 1 being safest).  We were happy with that 3 rating, as that is the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; you can get while still using a &amp;#34;chemical based&amp;#34; sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review itself ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Easy to find online.  Several competing stores keep the price relatively stable!  When in doubt, order from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;2)  Goes on white, rubs in clear (See Picture)&lt;br /&gt;3)  Non spray!&lt;br /&gt;4)  Protects well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Wish we could find it in retail stores ~ but we have yet to see ocean potion anywhere locally!  Small Gripe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen on our boys (Ages 1.5 and 3) for about a month now.  We&#x27;ve used it at the park, hot summer outdoor festivals, pools, and splash pads.  I fully believe the 80+ minute rating ~ as our boys are ROUGH when it comes to water sports or just running around.  We have never needed to reapply, and neither child has ever so much as gotten pink!  We absolutely love this sunblock!  It goes on white, and rubs in clear.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; although you will be slightly shiney!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be when we head to the beach in a month or two!  For now ~ I absolutely believe in this product, and will continue to use it on our children (and us ~ the parents!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend this to other parents for their children!  Our children are INCREDIBLY pale and burn easily ~ And if it can keep our kids from turning pink/red ~ it can keep just about any child/adult from burning!r their children!  Our children are INCREDIBLY pale and burn easily ~ And if it can keep our kids from turning pink/red ~ it can keep just about any child/adult from burning!</li>
    <li> did not like the smell</li>
    <li> My wife has very sensitive skin and this sunblock is effective and doesn&#x27;t cause her to break out in a rash.  It is very creamy and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin well so she doesn&#x27;t use it for everyday use, but when she will be out in the sun a long time this stuff does the trick.</li>
    <li> Really love this sunscreen. Not sticky, fragrance free, fine for face, reasonable cost. Perfect!</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen. My family has really sensitive skin and this works for us.</li>
    <li> We have used the children&#x27;s and babies.  This is the easiest sunscreen to apply, not lumpy, and does not leave white streaks.  It goes on like a good quality lotion and the kids and I don&#x27;t fight putting it on!</li>
    <li> Love Ocean Potion because it is made in Cocoa, Fl and the surfers love it. Goes on feeling dry and never oily or greasy. Love the scent as well. Very pleased with product. A bit healthier than most of the stuff in local drug stores.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for years. I would never use another sensitive skin sunscreen again.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the Sunblock that was advertised. Different bottle and label. Not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I went to Amazon to order Ocean Potion sunscreen because Target and Wal-Mart stopped carrying it.  I love the smell that reminds me of the orange popsicles with vanilla ice-cream inside.  It smells like summer.  But alas, this product seemed off from the start in that it did not have the same shade of pink as the bottle bought from the store.  Then I smelled it.  The smell was the same medical smell that so many have.  It is not worth the hassle of returning it.  Someone will use it, but I guess I have to give up on my favorite sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen both I and my daughter-in-eaw can use. I have a problem with scents and my daughter-in-law has a problem with aloe. We spen alot of time together in the sun on our boat so this sunscreen works out best.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen seamless transaction&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Ocean Potion is by far the best sunblock my family has ever used.  My daughter does not tan at all and has very sensitive skin.  Since we live in the desert southwest, this has been a lifelong problem.  Over the years, we tried all brands of sunblock.  Ocean Potion is the only one that provides enough protection to allow her to spend time in the sun without burning.  My daughter is now grown with a baby daughter of her own. The new baby and sensitive skin formula works well for both of them - sun protection without a skin reaction.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like to protect my skin like I would protect a baby&#x27;s skin. When I know I&#x27;m going to be in the sun for long periods of time I prefer an SPF50 so I don&#x27;t have to think about reapplying. I also prefer a Sunblock over a Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This sunblock works for me as no other.  Excellent protection while not making my eyes tear.  Please continue to offer this product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Intense but what I wanted.  This is real sunblock.  You can feel it go on as a protective cover.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the product advertised. I received a different formula/ bottle that caused my family&#x27;s skin to sting and burn.</li>
    <li> I am an adult and have very sensitive skin. This is the only product I can use</li>
    <li> This is the OLD formula which includes oxybenzone, EWG rated 8 ingredient.  Get the new formulation (more expensive), available on drugstore.com but I don&#x27;t see it (yet) on Amazon.</li>
    <li> wonderful for face and all day protection</li>
    <li> works really well, the skin on my face did get a bit of an irritated feeling for a little while after applying but no redness appeared. did not get burnt after hours out in the sun without reapplying.</li>
    <li> Most sunscreen/sunblock makes my face BURN LIKE FIRE. Not so with Ocean Potion. It&#x27;s significantly less expensive than Neutrogena&#x27;s sensitive skin sunblock, and it doesn&#x27;t have the chalky whitecast. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
