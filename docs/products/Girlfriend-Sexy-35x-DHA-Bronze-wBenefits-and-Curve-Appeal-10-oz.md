<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I smelled a sample of this on my sister after she was tanning one day and LOVED it.  I thought she had on a nice fruity perfume and was startled when she said it was her tanning lotion.  I automatically went online and purchased a bottle of my own.  I am use to using the Newer White 2 Black (extreme?) and I found that the bronzers in my previous lotion were better, but you can&#x27;t beat the smell of this lotion.  The feel is just okay...reminds me of most other lotions, although I personally prefer something a little less heavy on my skin.  I now rotate the two lotions and always use this one if I have plans for later that day in which I do not want to smell like burnt skin.  I will probably buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Other than the fact that it smells great, I notice a difference each time I use it and it does not fade quickly.. Which is good for when I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to tan.</li>
    <li> This good product was a much better buy online that it was in the salon. I like the scent and the bronzer</li>
    <li> I did not buy my lotion from amazon because my local tanning salon had a deal going on that if you bought a bottle of gf sexy tanning lotion that you would get the extender for free and two of the things that I&#x27;ve liked most about both lotions is that they smell amazing!!! I use the extender right out of the bed and when I get out of the shower because it smells so good and both lotions make your skin feel super silky soft without being greasy! I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin seems to get warmer in the bed and when I get out my skins somewhat pinkish but not in a bad way! I tan very regularly so to get even more color than usual is nice! I think this lotion is worth trying because it feels good and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the smell it&#x27;s amazing even after you tan you can still smell the beautiful aroma and the way it makes my skin feels im in love, I&#x27;m a regular tanner and I also try different lotions all the time trying to find the best and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this will buy over and over again thanks</li>
    <li> Expired product!!  Seriously, you&#x27;re better off buying from a salon.  I absolutely do not trust a product that has expired OVER a year ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos:  The bottle that I bought at a salon has an expiration date of 4/2015, while this one (left) has an expiration date of 5/2014.  It is JULY...</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT LOTION! It smells SO GOOD and makes you a pretty dark golden brown color!! Love this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing even after you lay! Highly recommended! Must try! Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used so far! Will continue using! Love love love!</li>
    <li> Im giving it three stars because it does work pretty well as a tanning lotion, not slimy like some are. I see all these reviews saying how good it smells, but I think it smells terrible! It smells good before you tan but after it smells like burnt cinnamon. As for bronzing, it does a little bit. I saw results after three days or so in a bed less than 10 mins each time. So not awful, not great but oh that smell! YUCK.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today. It smells amazing and the color looks nice! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Tanning lotion bottles were heavily wrapped and sealed but upon removing wrapping the bottles had heavy wear and appear to be used, I bought three different kinds also. if seller corrects this, I will update</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do for me what the description said, I should have just stuck to my usual products but when I saw this and the reviews it was another thing I got &amp;#34;Stuck&amp;#34; for!</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of most tanning lotions but this smells amazinggg.</li>
    <li> loved this so much. smelled the best of any lotion I half ever tried and it was half the price of the girlfriend sexy one at my salon. deffinitly recommend</li>
    <li> Love the product! I saw a noticeable tan within three uses, and that was without the maximize or the tan extender.  It still hasn&#x27;t faded and it&#x27;s been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve been in a bed.  It smells nice after getting out of the bed, that is if your bed is air conditioned and you don&#x27;t get out all sweaty. Leaves skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. And the smell is amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to try it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Love love love it...smells great before an after tanning..skins feels great an gives great color..im very happy with it. Was shipped out quickly got within days in a whole I rate this lotion with 5 stars...would purchase it again..love it. Would recommend this to anyone..smells great an great color</li>
    <li> This is amazing bronzer at a fraction of the price at the salon. Only regret is I wish I would have purchased more!!!</li>
    <li> I tried a packet at my local tanning salon and liked it but the salon prices are way to high. Got it here and for a good price. I have tried the JWow Black bottle and this gave me a better bronzing effect. It smells sweet and stays smelling good after tanning.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! It works great!</li>
    <li> 100% the same product that I paid three times the price for at my local salon. This is my absolute favorite lotion. Delicate, but darkening, with a luscious scent that I don&#x27;t mind wearing all day even AFTER tanning.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Girlfriend Sexy keeps my tan nice and soft and smooth for weeks after the first tan!Bronzer I&#x27;s a plus</li>
    <li> I am typically difficult to tan and require multiple visits to see any results! That was not the case with this lotion! I could see major results after only 2 visits! Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I usually can use any lotion from the salon but this lotion I had a reaction to. I love the smell but it made my skin sting when I used it. I did have a nice tan but it wasn&#x27;t worth the reaction using it.</li>
    <li> This is def the best lotion I have ever used! It has such an addictive scent. I have gone thru 2 bottles of it along with 2 bottles of the extender in 2 months. The extender smells the same. its amazing and I&#x27;m the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Great gentle bronzer. I have used a lot of bronzers and this one is top on the list now. Smells so good and had a great color that doesnt stain my hands like others do.</li>
    <li> The smell and the consistency (not too sticky) are amazing</li>
    <li> Not happy with this one at all.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, however didn&#x27;t notice a good browsing effect after first use like I have with other lotions. Still will buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Smells great too! I us I tan and used this product once and saw a difference... In stores is like $60 and on amazon it was like in the $20s</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite tanning lotion.  I&#x27;ve gone from the $10 bottle at Walmart to the $90 bottles at the salons.  This is my all time favorite. Love the smell, and I get a great color from it.</li>
    <li> Sleek, sexy and smells really nice! The bronzer level I think should be a 15-20. It&#x27;s good for a nice base tan. It&#x27;s not as good as the old Swedish beauty bronzing line which I miss and that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> Great price! I got my first bottle of this at the tanning salon I go to and it was $70</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for over year now. You&#x27;ll see a quick tan in a week. It is literally the most perfect tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever had. The smell is seriously from angels. I now use the lotion called solid black, and I use girlfriend sexy afterwards. It also works as a tan extender I&#x27;ve noticed. I get compliments everywhere I go because the smell is so strong. If you&#x27;re second-guessing yourself on a tanning lotion, I promise you will not go wrong with this one. I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only one that has really worked for me.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend sexy goes on smooth with no residue, also it doesn&#x27;t leave any after tanning scent which is nice.  I usually tan during my lunch hour and don&#x27;t have time to shower, this lotion is an excellent pick for someone in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that since using this lotion my tan is darker and my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Smells great!</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion for a good price.. would give it five stars but i didn&#x27;t care for the after tan smell! However I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I used to always get a lotion with blush but with this you don&#x27;t need it. I am terribly pasty white, especially my legs. They are hard to tan but only after 4 sessions with this lotion I am darker than I&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;m exited to not have to spend $40 on it at the salon now. It smells fantastic and I highly suggest pairing it with the extender lotion. They are both amazing!</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy this lotion. It smells so good. There is no streaking whatsoever. I like the color it gives me as well. Only an hour in the sun and I&#x27;ve got a nice glow to my skin already. This girl is happy :)</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  Fav tanning lotion so far!</li>
    <li> It is working well so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and am having good results.</li>
    <li> I started using this and within two day I could see a HUGE difference! My skin tone is usually a pasty white, and this product, within TWO DAYS, I have a nice tan going on. Would definitely reccommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product! Not to smelly!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product for any level 2 or higher indoor tanning bed!! smells great, and gives a beautiful bronze with out turning you orange!! I normally have a hard time tanning but not with this!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Smells great! Smells like bubble gum after tanning. No gross after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells great. Good lotion!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used this once and the same product, but the intensifier, once and love them both. My skin is soft and it smells great!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells so good! No after tan smell! Tans super fast too!</li>
    <li> I love my Girlfriend Sexy, it smells amazing, and gives me the perfect tanning results I wanted!</li>
    <li> After using Snooki Black Bronzer, I was disappointed in the bronzer in this one. The smell is great, before and after tanning. It makes your skin feel wonderful and there is some bronzing, just not what I am used too...If it had more bronzer, like snooki black bronzer, I would be sold on the product. As of now, I am alternating between, Snooki Black &amp; Girlfriend Sexy. It is a great product....Just wish there was a stronger bronzer...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best bang for your buck!! It beats salon prices... Make sure you wipe your hands after application, Otherwise, leaves your skin soft and silky, and has a pleasant fragrance..</li>
    <li> the smell is sooo good like Victoria&#x27;s secret lotion and you still smell good after tanning! This is my number one lotion...been using it for a while. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT. Smells very sexy and feminine. Can&#x27;t wait to buy again.</li>
    <li> Sometimes lotions work and sometimes they.don&#x27;t. This one did.not work for me. Smells good. Nice size bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> this lotion is awsome and is the best smelling tanning lotion ive ever used.. my tanning salon cannot keep it in stock everytime i go to buy it it was gone so i checked amazon and it was so much cheeper i recieved it within 5 days of placing my order and couldnt be happier with it i was darker with the 1st day of using it i will be buying more</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Very good. Love it. Will order again</li>
</ol>
