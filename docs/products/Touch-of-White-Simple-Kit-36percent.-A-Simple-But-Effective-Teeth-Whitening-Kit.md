### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>He showed me this product, and I bought it; he said it was what he used, and he has perfect, movie-star-white teeth, with no veneers, bonding, or anything--and he&#x27;s a coffee junkie.</li>
      <li>so I had to try my best and re-do it..</li>
      <li>I think the gel is very good.</li>
      <li>AND IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
      <li>Does not taste good.</li>
      <li>I told my parents about how great it was and ordered 3 more, one for my mother, father and myself.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Unless you have your own trays I do not suggest purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>Since this product isn&#x27;t perfect for the aforementioned reasons, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars in good conscience.     </li>
      <li>After using this once it worked amazingly, making my teeth many shades whiter with one use.</li>
      <li>but it still works better than anything else that you can buy.</li>
      <li>The top turned out much better than the bottom for me, but it ended up still working once I put the gel in.</li>
      <li>This worked so much better than what my dentist had sold me that I told him about it.</li>
      <li>This is generally a very nice product and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I am so excited!</li>
      <li>Luckily, I decided to talk to my dental hygienist uncle before paying that kind of money.</li>
      <li>and it was fresh and more effective.</li>
      <li>If you purchase this do so at your own risk as you may not get fresh gel.</li>
      <li>It was strong</li>
      <li>I use this regimen about twice a year for beautiful white teeth.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s amazing regardless, and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>They are so cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It really is quite amazing.</li>
      <li>With practice of the teeth molding I would say this is by far the most inexpensive and effective way to go.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had was getting a successful mold of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to have bright white teeth again!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m never buying any strips again, this works much faster and is a MUCH better value.</li>
      <li>you want to get your teeth whitened quickly for a cheap price, this is the right product to get...</li>
      <li>I WAS SUPRISED AT HOW QUICK IT CAME.  </li>
      <li>Plus, this is super inexpensive.</li>
      <li>The delivering was fast and the instructions were easy.</li>
      <li>The gel is powerful.</li>
      <li>and I had to throw out the rest since it was no longer fresh.</li>
      <li>These mouthpieces are inexpensive, so not including more of them is simply the manufacturer being cheap.</li>
      <li>When it arrived, per said uncle&#x27;s suggestion, I started using it nightly for one hour, right before brushing and going to bed (except the day I got it--</li>
      <li>I sucked the air out and used my hands to sort of mold the trays close to my teeth and got a pretty decent fit.</li>
      <li>Good deal for less than $20 with shipping.</li>
      <li>hisa-okay first, because if you have any cavities or enamel problems, your mouth will be extremely sensitive and in a world of hurt after whitening with something this strong.)     </li>
      <li>You can get more at your local drug store for about a buck or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well....</li>
      <li>Today was my first day trying this out.</li>
      <li>This product is the same that dentists sell for MUCH, MUCH more than the price listed here at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but this was the first time with with the 36% solution.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off sticking to the white strips sold at the pharmacy.</li>
      <li>Basically the whitening gel works really well, but it will make your teeth super sensitive.</li>
      <li>If your teeth aren&#x27;t very stained, you might fare better going with something less potent to avoid possible sensitivity, but it&#x27;s your call.</li>
      <li>They still work, so I guess that it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
      <li>Except its much cheaper here.  </li>
      <li>After just 30 minutes I took out the mouth guard and saw the my teeth were much whiter.</li>
      <li>This product really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very stained as I am a smoker</li>
      <li>Just be careful and be sure not to get any on your gums.</li>
      <li>but honestly for such a low price I didn&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>Molding the trays was not very difficult.</li>
      <li>I think I used too much gel this first time and it got onto my gums and bleached them a bit, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most whiteners as I have sensitive gums anyhow.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price--it&#x27;s the EXACT same stuff your dentist will give you, only insanely, mind-bogglingly cheaper.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave this a four was because the trays are kind of hard to use, and really don&#x27;t fit the teeth so well.</li>
      <li>One tip--just make sure that the trays are trimmed slightly below the gum line or else you will have some blanching of the gums and some sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>When I had to have two permanent teeth pulled (luckily hard-to-see back teeth!)</li>
      <li>Many root canals, fillings, and a cleaning later, my teeth were in tip-top shape, but they still looked yellow.    </li>
      <li>I have used other trays before that were easy to form for use.</li>
      <li>Works better then white strips by far, especially since you don&#x27;t have some slimy thing falling off your teeth.</li>
      <li>I, like other reviewers, felt that the trays didn&#x27;t fit as snuggly.</li>
      <li>After struggling with [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]] to get some decent whitening, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>He told me that regular in-store whiteners would work, but it would take a lot of time and money to get my teeth back to their original pearly whiteness, since they contained 10% carbamide peroxide maximum.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever had an issue in ten years.</li>
      <li>I smear a small film on my front teeth and my teeth are a nice consistant white!</li>
      <li>If the gel gets clogged, just stick a clean pin down the nozzle to unclog it.</li>
      <li>I started taking care of my teeth, and I saved up the money to get them all fixed at the dentist.</li>
      <li>All this did was burn my gums and give me sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>NO TROUBLE</li>
      <li>I did exactly what the instructions said and used hot but not boiling water, only submerged the tray a few seconds, and then put it in my mouth to mold it.</li>
      <li>For twelve bucks, I honestly didn&#x27;t care that the mouth trays were hard to fit and uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>You have to boil the trays to fit your teeth and it totally shrinks to small</li>
      <li>Within a week, I had near snow white teeth.</li>
      <li>, my parents barely saw any difference in their teeth either.</li>
      <li>However, if your teeth are naturally a darker color, I would advise you to look for a different product.</li>
      <li>apparently it has worked well for others.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t), you can pick up a tube of [[ASIN:B001ET6YCE Sensodyne Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth and Cavity Prevention, Maximum Strength, Extra Whitening, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] and use that.</li>
      <li>I totally screwed up &#x27;molding&#x27; the first one, and learning from what I did wrong, was able to do the second one semi-successfully.</li>
      <li>I could barely feel any tingling in my mouth as I used it and after using it I saw no difference in my teeth</li>
      <li>that were the exact same as what the dentist offered, but for a lot less money.</li>

<li> I am currently using sensodine toothpaste, so the sensitivity didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Only needed half of one syringe in order to completely whiten all of my teeth, which was five uses for me.</li>
<li> I apply the gel directly to the teeth using a q-tip then put the tray on for half an hour.</li>
<li> If you keep it there more than a few seconds it suddenly shrinks and totally looses its shape and becomes useless.</li>
<li> As long as the form fits your teeth it will not ooze gel.</li>
<li> I have used the whitestrips of various brands and even used GoSmile a few months ago and they did not even get my teeth as white as they are now.</li>
<li> The whitener also made my teeth a tad bit sensitive, but it was bearable, and any peroxide tooth whitener is likely to cause sensitivity, especially at high strengths--but, again, that still doesn&#x27;t mean the sensitivity didn&#x27;t happen or wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
<li> This is a great whitener, it will definitely make your teeth very white, although it does taste bad and is uncomfortable while wearing the mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought four times the amount of gel from ebay for half of the same price</li>
<li> The product wasn&#x27;t what I expected but you be the judge.</li>
<li> Also be careful when you put the thermoforming trays in boiling water.</li>
<li> (Hard stuff when you&#x27;re a poor college kid, but definitely worth the money!)</li>
<li> /&gt;My only complaint, and it&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give it five stars, is that they need to include four, not two, mouthpieces.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I highly recommend this product!</li>
<li> I have used this product as directed (20 minutes each day, and not eating dark colored foods afterwards) for about a week.</li>
<li> Be very careful if you order this product!</li>
<li> I rinse and do it again for another half hour</li>
<li> I would not recommend ordering it, though, because as previously mentioned it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff dentists use. My teeth have never been whiter. I use this regimen about twice a year for beautiful white teeth. I apply the gel directly to the teeth using a q-tip then put the tray on for half an hour. I rinse and do it again for another half hour (total of one hour), for 3 days. I will definitely repurchase and have referred friends and family to this product. If the gel gets clogged, just stick a clean pin down the nozzle to unclog it.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this a four was because the trays are kind of hard to use, and really don&#x27;t fit the teeth so well. They still work, so I guess that it doesn&#x27;t matter so much. Basically the whitening gel works really well, but it will make your teeth super sensitive. I am currently using sensodine toothpaste, so the sensitivity didn&#x27;t last long. Only needed half of one syringe in order to completely whiten all of my teeth, which was five uses for me. The instructions say to only put it on your front six teeth, but I put it on the entire tray since the stupid strips Ive used in the past didn&#x27;t whiten the back. I&#x27;m never buying any strips again, this works much faster and is a MUCH better value. Just be careful and be sure not to get any on your gums.</li>
    <li> I have been using bleaching trays for a decade but this was the first time with with the 36% solution. OMG! Horrible experience! Within five minutes my gums were burning and turning white. No, I did not put an excessive amount in the tray. This is the first time I have ever had an issue in ten years. Threw the rest out. Back to my prior brand. Adios!</li>
    <li> I WAS SUPRISED AT HOW QUICK IT CAME.  NO TROUBLE AND IT WORKS GREAT. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JERRY S. HIGBY</li>
    <li> The gel is powerful. As long as the form fits your teeth it will not ooze gel. Does not taste good. But for the money I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received my whitening trays and gel in the mail today and could not wait to use them. My teeth are very stained as I am a smoker and I drink coffee every day. Molding the trays was not very difficult. I did exactly what the instructions said and used hot but not boiling water, only submerged the tray a few seconds, and then put it in my mouth to mold it. I sucked the air out and used my hands to sort of mold the trays close to my teeth and got a pretty decent fit. The top turned out much better than the bottom for me, but it ended up still working once I put the gel in. I think I used too much gel this first time and it got onto my gums and bleached them a bit, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most whiteners as I have sensitive gums anyhow. After one application of 30 mins I can already see a difference! I am so excited! I have used the whitestrips of various brands and even used GoSmile a few months ago and they did not even get my teeth as white as they are now. Plus, this is super inexpensive. I love it! I can&#x27;t wait to have bright white teeth again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t take care of my teeth when I was younger, and it showed. When I had to have two permanent teeth pulled (luckily hard-to-see back teeth!) before I turned twenty, it was a wake up call. I started taking care of my teeth, and I saved up the money to get them all fixed at the dentist. (Hard stuff when you&#x27;re a poor college kid, but definitely worth the money!) Many root canals, fillings, and a cleaning later, my teeth were in tip-top shape, but they still looked yellow.    I tried whitening strips, gels, rinses, you name it. They helped, but not nearly enough, so I figured it was time to pull out the big guns. I asked my dentist about whitening, and he gave me an estimate of $500. That included custom-made whitening trays and 35% carbamide peroxide to take home and use.  I was almost willing to cough this up to erase the stains of poor-dental-hygiene past.     Luckily, I decided to talk to my dental hygienist uncle before paying that kind of money. He told me I could get at-home bleaching kits online that were the exact same as what the dentist offered, but for a lot less money. He told me that regular in-store whiteners would work, but it would take a lot of time and money to get my teeth back to their original pearly whiteness, since they contained 10% carbamide peroxide maximum. He showed me this product, and I bought it; he said it was what he used, and he has perfect, movie-star-white teeth, with no veneers, bonding, or anything--and he&#x27;s a coffee junkie. I also bought an 8-pack of 35% carbamide peroxide syringes without the mouth trays.    When it arrived, per said uncle&#x27;s suggestion, I started using it nightly for one hour, right before brushing and going to bed (except the day I got it--I couldn&#x27;t resist using it ASAP then). In three days, my teeth whitened what took a month to achieve with whitening strips. Within a week, I had near snow white teeth. Needless to say, I highly recommend this product! (But you probably should see your dentist and get hisa-okay first, because if you have any cavities or enamel problems, your mouth will be extremely sensitive and in a world of hurt after whitening with something this strong.)     My only gripes with this are with the included trays and sensitivity. For twelve bucks, I honestly didn&#x27;t care that the mouth trays were hard to fit and uncomfortable. However, even though I didn&#x27;t mind, they were still a hassle nonetheless. The whitener also made my teeth a tad bit sensitive, but it was bearable, and any peroxide tooth whitener is likely to cause sensitivity, especially at high strengths--but, again, that still doesn&#x27;t mean the sensitivity didn&#x27;t happen or wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. For both of those faults, I subtracted one star. Since this product isn&#x27;t perfect for the aforementioned reasons, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars in good conscience.     But it&#x27;s amazing regardless, and I highly recommend it! You can&#x27;t beat the price--it&#x27;s the EXACT same stuff your dentist will give you, only insanely, mind-bogglingly cheaper. If your teeth aren&#x27;t very stained, you might fare better going with something less potent to avoid possible sensitivity, but it&#x27;s your call.</li>
    <li> product was defective, I couldnt even get it to come out and it was Coagulated sooooo not worth your time or money!!!</li>
    <li> This worked so much better than what my dentist had sold me that I told him about it. My dentist is ordering some of it for his office to use..imagine that.</li>
    <li> Today was my first day trying this out. The delivering was fast and the instructions were easy. The only problem I had was getting a successful mold of my teeth. You take the thin mouth guard and put it in boiling water for a few seconds then place on your teeth.. The rubber kept folding in so I had to try my best and re-do it..but honestly for such a low price I didn&#x27;t care. After just 30 minutes I took out the mouth guard and saw the my teeth were much whiter. I would estimate that after 3, maybe 4 days my teeth will be perfectly white. Works better then white strips by far, especially since you don&#x27;t have some slimy thing falling off your teeth. With practice of the teeth molding I would say this is by far the most inexpensive and effective way to go. 5 stars..</li>
    <li> This is generally a very nice product and it works very well. But I suggest that if you want to buy this, buy it from ebay. The one that I got from here was more expensive and the gel was partially dried and it had become very stiff and it was very hard to get it out of the syringe. I bought four times the amount of gel from ebay for half of the same price and it was fresh and more effective. Also be careful when you put the thermoforming trays in boiling water. If you keep it there more than a few seconds it suddenly shrinks and totally looses its shape and becomes useless.</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t what I expected but you be the judge. You have to boil the trays to fit your teeth and it totally shrinks to small It&#x27;s A hassle and you do not get the results you expect.</li>
    <li> After using this once it worked amazingly, making my teeth many shades whiter with one use. I used my custom made trays that I got from a different whitening system. It was strong so I allowed a few days rest to allow my gums to heal before trying to use it again but I ended up forgetting that I had it and I had to throw out the rest since it was no longer fresh. After a week the whiteness of my teeth faded.   I told my parents about how great it was and ordered 3 more, one for my mother, father and myself. But when we all used it, it wasn&#x27;t the same. I could barely feel any tingling in my mouth as I used it and after using it I saw no difference in my teeth, my parents barely saw any difference in their teeth either. If you purchase this do so at your own risk as you may not get fresh gel.</li>
    <li> I think the gel is very good. It does the job like it should. The only issue that I have is the terrible trays they sent along to use. They are so cheaply made. I have used other trays before that were easy to form for use. These are terrible. Unless you have your own trays I do not suggest purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> After struggling with [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]] to get some decent whitening, I decided to give this product a try. What a difference a few days make! Not only does it whiten faster, one application once a day for 15 minutes is all it takes. You&#x27;ll notice a difference after one use, and a very big difference after three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and it&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give it five stars, is that they need to include four, not two, mouthpieces. I totally screwed up &#x27;molding&#x27; the first one, and learning from what I did wrong, was able to do the second one semi-successfully. These mouthpieces are inexpensive, so not including more of them is simply the manufacturer being cheap. You can get more at your local drug store for about a buck or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary: Dump the whitestrips, and try this product. It really is quite amazing. And if you notice sensitivity to your teeth (I didn&#x27;t), you can pick up a tube of [[ASIN:B001ET6YCE Sensodyne Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth and Cavity Prevention, Maximum Strength, Extra Whitening, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] and use that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke, but my teeth are naturally a very yellow color. I have used this product as directed (20 minutes each day, and not eating dark colored foods afterwards) for about a week. My teeth have not changed color in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any gum sensitivity, and I cannot vouch for whether or not this product works for \\&quot;stained\\&quot; teeth - apparently it has worked well for others. However, if your teeth are naturally a darker color, I would advise you to look for a different product.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as I received it in the mail--quick delivery.  Within a few days of usage my tooth stains were gone--mostly from coffee which is my passion.  This product is the same that dentists sell for MUCH, MUCH more than the price listed here at Amazon.  One tip--just make sure that the trays are trimmed slightly below the gum line or else you will have some blanching of the gums and some sensitivity.  I, like other reviewers, felt that the trays didn&#x27;t fit as snuggly.No big deal! Sometimes before I go to bed I smear a small film on my front teeth and my teeth are a nice consistant white!</li>
    <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t work. The process is also long and tedious and quite unpleasant. The gel WILL burn your gums if you let it get to them. And also bleach your gums. Be very careful if you order this product! I would not recommend ordering it, though, because as previously mentioned it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
    <li> This gel is one of the gels the dentists use. Except its much cheaper here.  save yourself the money the dentists charge ($200.00) and get this here.  your wallet will thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well.... The trays are not very good as previously commented on, but the gel does whiten your teeth a few shades. It does not give you ultra white teeth but it still works better than anything else that you can buy. Good deal for less than $20 with shipping.</li>
    <li> All this did was burn my gums and give me sensitive teeth.  You&#x27;re better off sticking to the white strips sold at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This is a great whitener, it will definitely make your teeth very white, although it does taste bad and is uncomfortable while wearing the mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get your teeth whitened quickly for a cheap price, this is the right product to get...</li>
