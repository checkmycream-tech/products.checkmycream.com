    <li> ONLY LASER OR A FACE LIFT CAN GIVE YOU THE RESULTS THIS CLAIMS. DURING OUR SLOWED ECONOMY PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS.$$$$$$$$$$$.  $73.00 BUCKS CAN BUY A LOT OF BACON.</li>
    <li> Good ,I like the results leaves my skin clear and soft for days</li>
    <li> Not the real product! I tried the real product and this is a fake!</li>
    <li> Also love -- will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Miracle product for people with high-maintenance, problematic skin. Not sure exactly how it exfoliates, but the substance seems to bind with the oils in my skin and is removed along with the dead skin cells as you gently rub it off with your fingertips.  I have acne-prone skin and large pores that get clogged with whiteheads and blackheads. It&#x27;s recommended usage is twice per week, but I need this product about once or twice a day to effectively clear my active pores and prevent breakouts. Acne products and serums get absorbed more effectively and make-up goes on more smoothly after each use. This product also lightens blemishes, dramatically reduces wrinkles, and makes your skin look smooth and youthful.    I follow up with the ultra light Auravie Serum that goes on very smoothly, absorbs instantaneously, and makes my face feel supple, clean and fresh. Non-greasy. So light you can&#x27;t feel it.    I initially bought the peel for $9 ONLY and stocked up, but the price has increased. I will definitely repurchase since this is the only product that works for me.    i&#x27;ve already wasted too much money on other products. AuraVie Refresh Facial Peel and Serum are the most promising by far. Incredibly priced, considering its efficacy.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and loved it!  It doesn&#x27;t  take long and there is no messy clean up and it works immeadiateky</li>
    <li> great product! along with the other products from this company helping to keep your skin clean,healthy and refreshed..</li>
    <li> The best and fastest product to sluff off dead, dried up skin!! The price is really good compared to buying it directly from Auravie.</li>
    <li> Love it...That is ALL...</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Instant peeling with no harsh acids. This is a must for all acne sufferers and anti-aging product users.I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I go through my usual cleaning process, then use peel twice a week on face and neck.  It is very effective, just gently peeling. Then follow up with rest of routine.  I love it because it has started removing my &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; and makes my face feel very, very smooth.  I have even purchased bottles for my niece (age 40+) and the lady who does my monthly facials.  They love it also.</li>
    <li> Soft and smoothing.  Super peel.  It will surprise you how much skin comes off.  You immediately want to use it again.  I use it 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> peels skin well, but leaves some irritation.</li>
    <li> Not sure of it&#x27;s authenticity for it cleans my face and it feels better</li>
    <li> I am truly amazed at how clear and fresh my skin looks. Highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Not sure about it yet. I&#x27;ve tried it on a table and stuff came off but it could also be from my finger. I&#x27;ve only used it once</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any benefits from this product.  It just clumps and it is difficult to get off.  really disappointed.  would like to return</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using  AuraVie for several years and other people have noticed a difference in my skin&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
