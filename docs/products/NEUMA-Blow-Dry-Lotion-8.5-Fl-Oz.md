      <li>Light and smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>The quality and ingredients of this product are exceptional.</li>

      <li>Lastly, I love the way this smells!</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery - Great Hair Product!!</li>
      <li>They smell wonderful and work really well.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, I will have better luck</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>This is the best blow dry lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt softer or been more smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m switching over to Neuma because of my stylist--but I&#x27;m more easily able to do at home what he does to me in the salon, which makes the price worth it.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly!  </li>
      <li>Neuma has no added fragrance, it leaves my hair very manageable and nice.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny with the frizziness.</li>
      <li>This entire line of products is great.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is light and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Did nothing special for my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent product, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>Well worth trying.</li>
      <li>I am a vegan who uses the most natural products (makeup, shampoo, etc.)</li>
      <li>I use this on damp hair before a blow dry and it turns out amazing.</li>
      <li>The Blow Dry Lotion is light and gives good all-day hold on my short hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, and most product tends to weigh down my hair and make it appear oily.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this one</li>
      <li>Gives extra body to my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It really helps in the smoothing process.</li>
      <li>It is much thicker - not runny at all.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and limp</li>
      <li>Great for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
      <li>It cuts down on the damage the heat from blowdryer does to your hair which cuts down on fly aways.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t use conditioner since it makes my hair even more limp.  </li>
      <li>This is ok, it sometimes feels a bit heavy.</li>
      <li>I usually use and does a better job leaving my hair soft, fuller &amp; smoother without feeling like there&#x27;s a lot of product in it or weighing my fine, color-treated hair down.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny and manageable when I use Neuma products.</li>
      <li>Although, the product is somewhat expensive, it is a much higher quality product that produces better results.</li>
      <li>I can really tell the difference - and with the blow dry lotion is no exception.</li>
      <li>and I loved it but hadn&#x27;t finished the last expensive products I bought</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo&#x27;s &amp; conditioner&#x27;s from this line, which is why I will probably try out a few other products.  </li>
      <li>For reference, I have thick but fine blond hair.</li>
      <li>I like that it does not weigh my hair down, but if you have curly hair it does not tame it as much as a product with argan oil or something like that</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>It still worked but seemed to be watered down some - very runny.</li>

    <li> Reduced frizz and added some shine.  Use a very little amount (dime size or less)</li>
    <li> I just started using Neuma products a few weeks ago after my stylist applied them during an appointment. I can really tell the difference - and with the blow dry lotion is no exception. My hair is noticeably smoother and less frizzier after using it. Although, the product is somewhat expensive, it is a much higher quality product that produces better results.</li>
    <li> great  seller and great product</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery - Great Hair Product!!</li>

    <li> Did nothing special for my hair.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives extra body to my fine hair. Styles last all day long even through wind! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is another product my stylist introduced me to and I absolutely love it.  It cuts down on the damage the heat from blowdryer does to your hair which cuts down on fly aways.  It really helps in the smoothing process.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dry lotion I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny with the frizziness. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is ok, it sometimes feels a bit heavy. Occasionally my hair looks greasy when I use this.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Recommended by hair stylist and cheaper to buy at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am a vegan who uses the most natural products (makeup, shampoo, etc.) that I can find. I am so impressed with this company for making all their products with wind power. And, it delivers! My hair has never felt softer or been more smooth. I use this on damp hair before a blow dry and it turns out amazing. The bottle will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need a lot. The quality and ingredients of this product are exceptional. What are you waiting for? For reference, I have thick but fine blond hair. I find this moisturizing (my hair tends to be dry) but not oily.</li>
    <li> Neuma blow dry lotion is made with organic, renewable plant based ingredients. Their packaging is made of 85% recycled materials, too. Aside from the good for the planet, this is a great styling product. I have very fine hair that tends to be very dry and flyaway in NH&#x27;s cold winter weather. My hair is soft, shiny and manageable when I use Neuma products. This is a great product to use to help protect the integrity of highlights or color, too. Lastly, I love the way this smells!</li>
    <li> Product weighs down the hair.  Would have returned but it was past the 30 days after i realized what it was doing to my hair.</li>

    <li> This entire line of products is great.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this one but like it a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this on line because my salon quit selling it for a time. It still worked but seemed to be watered down some - very runny. My salon is carrying it again so I bought my next bottle there. It is much thicker - not runny at all.</li>
    <li> I use this daily!  Great for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am alergic to fragrance and have had a really hard time finding hair product that does not make me break out.  Neuma has no added fragrance, it leaves my hair very manageable and nice.  The blow dry lotion helps keep your hair from drying out with blowdrying.  Plus, since I&#x27;ve been using their products, the color stays in my hair longer, bonus!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses this on me and had given me samples and I loved it but hadn&#x27;t finished the last expensive products I bought so put off buying this.  I finally broke down to have it for my son&#x27;s wedding and wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long. This one product replaces 3 I usually use and does a better job leaving my hair soft, fuller &amp; smoother without feeling like there&#x27;s a lot of product in it or weighing my fine, color-treated hair down.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and most product tends to weigh down my hair and make it appear oily. This product smoothes out my hair, without weighing it down. I love it and wonder how I lived without it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly!  Great product</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is very fine and limp so I can&#x27;t use conditioner since it makes my hair even more limp.  This lotion is light and smooth.  I also use the shampoo, mousse, and hairspray.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I like that it does not weigh my hair down, but if you have curly hair it does not tame it as much as a product with argan oil or something like that would.  I love the shampoo&#x27;s &amp; conditioner&#x27;s from this line, which is why I will probably try out a few other products.  Hopefully, I will have better luck then I have with the blow dry lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Light and smells wonderful!</li>
