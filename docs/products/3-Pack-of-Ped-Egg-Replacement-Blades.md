      <li>I love my Ped egg.  </li>

      <li>Great product, cheap price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I really like my Ped Egg and have had great success in getting nice smooth skin on my heals.  </li>
      <li>This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>I find that one blade refill is good for about 3 to 4 uses (except for the very first time and then you might wear it out on the first use).  </li>
      <li>And, they didn&#x27;t even fit my Ped Egg.</li>
      <li>and my feet have stayed smooth for three weeks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to find Ped Egg replacement blades in any local stores so was so glad to find them on Amazon!</li>

      <li>I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
      <li>Why buy a whole new ped egg when this is available for a fraction of the cost?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy, safe, does the job quickly and being partially disabled, the long handle makes it easy to reach where I need it to.  </li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>Also, they wear out really fast.  </li>
      <li>However, when I ordered this product from the particular seller, I thought that I was getting a product in a package, much like you get at the store.  </li>
      <li>Fast, soft, no harm, no cuts, no blood and no feet</li>
      <li>The price on the replacements was much more expensive on other sites than what I found here though Amazon and the shipping was very quick!</li>
      <li>I bought the pedegg and I was a little skeptical, but it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>and they were all sharp and ready to go.  </li>

    <li> The package looked like it was previously opened. The blades looked used (seriously, they were dirty and looked used). And, they didn&#x27;t even fit my Ped Egg. They were too small and so I couldn&#x27;t even have used them if I wanted to. Stay away from these!</li>
    <li> I have never received this product and according to fedex tracking it was never picked up for shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for almost a year and they are very good at gently removing callouses.  They work without ripping or tearing the skin.  The Ped Egg shape is easier to hold than the typical files with handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks:  The powdered callous doesn&#x27;t all go into the compartment and get trapped.  Quite a bit of it falls off and gets all over the area.  Also, they wear out really fast.  I find that one blade refill is good for about 3 to 4 uses (except for the very first time and then you might wear it out on the first use).  I do my feet every 1-2 weeks.  But, they work so well I don&#x27;t mind buying refills.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I really like my Ped Egg and have had great success in getting nice smooth skin on my heals.  However, when I ordered this product from the particular seller, I thought that I was getting a product in a package, much like you get at the store.  When it arrived, there was a tray, and the replacement blades, but there was no packaging around it.  The replacement blades are also black and not white, like it says they are.  That wasn&#x27;t as big a problem as the no packaging.   I don&#x27;t know about other people, but when I buy a specific product based on the picture given, I tend to expect that product.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Why buy a whole new ped egg when this is available for a fraction of the cost? Great product, cheap price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was the best bang for my buck and they were all sharp and ready to go.  They were shipped promptly and if they had more I would purchase more.</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All that you see on TV is TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast, soft, no harm, no cuts, no blood and no feet doctor.&lt;br /&gt;- I use it once or twice in a Week for almost three years and no complains.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades last for 6 six months to 1 year, depending on your needs and edge sensitiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Sometime the remains of the use felt down in the tiny hole of the blades.</li>
    <li> I love my Ped egg.  It&#x27;s easy, safe, does the job quickly and being partially disabled, the long handle makes it easy to reach where I need it to.  The delivery time was outstanding!</li>
    <li> The product was excellent and I was very satisfied with the ite,.  It did take a bit longer to get to me than I had anticipated.  Some items I had ordered a week later than this product came in almost a week before the Ped Egg arrived.</li>
    <li> I have been using the ped egg since it first came out,this site was the least expensive for replacements will definitly buy here again.</li>
    <li> I bought the pedegg and I was a little skeptical, but it&#x27;s great.  It works really well.  A lot of people told me to use it right after I shower and then put lotion on my feet and socks on.  I did this and my feet have stayed smooth for three weeks.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  Fits the ped egg perfectly.  Removes tough caliouses without a problem.  Nothing else needed to say for this product.  Amazon needs to reduce their word quantity requirement!</li>
    <li> I love the ped egg and have been using it for years! When used on a regular basis it really helps keep your heels looking nice and smooth! I like to use it between pedicures! The price on the replacements was much more expensive on other sites than what I found here though Amazon and the shipping was very quick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to find Ped Egg replacement blades in any local stores so was so glad to find them on Amazon! They are pricey but a single blade lasts a very long time, and I use mine at least 3x per week. The only thing that helps diminish the callouses on my heels. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> They do a pro job of callous trimming and stay sharp for long life.</li>
    <li> Before I started using a Ped Egg, I had thick callouses on my heels.  Now, those callouses are gone, and I only need to use the Ped Egg sparingly now.</li>
    <li> Practical for maintenance of the Ped-Egg foot files</li>
    <li> Great for your feet !</li>
