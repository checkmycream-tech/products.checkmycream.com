      <li>I also enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it, is that it smells good.</li>
      <li>but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell, I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how amazing this makes my hair smell, defiantly a bonus.</li>
      <li>My hair did not move freely and I could not run my fingers through the bottom of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I gave it a try and will definitely be repurchasing it.</li>
      <li>Secondly, this product does smell great</li>
      <li>and I am so happy that I could actually cry.</li>
      <li>My unwrapped hair is not greasy/oily and lifeless but has movement and is smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I honestly did not notice much of a difference with my ends.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference but</li>
      <li>I have long hair and have a great deal of split ends, after using this product</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a natural products user for the most part anyway</li>
      <li>and so far my ends do look better today than the day before.</li>
      <li>While it is a bit pricey for the size the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>Only use when hair is wet and you will have excellent results!</li>
      <li>I had the &amp;#34;grand idea&amp;#34; to have my hair highlighted for an event last October and while the color was gorgeous, my hair in a matter of months went from shiny healthy hair to dry beyond belief.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Had high hopes that it would be fabulous, based on hearing HSN hosts and CD&#x27;s owner talk about it.  </li>
      <li>The ends of my hair can be pretty ratty at times but when I use this product it looks like a fresh pack of weave LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a very strong fragrance. I did not see a difference in my hair. I am not sure it actually worked.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money - did not repair split ends at all. It seemed to good to be true and I should have listened to my instinct. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to someone who wants less rigid ends and it smells wonderful. This little bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for years, but my hair was always dry and I had split ends. A couple of months ago, I switched to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, and the difference is absolutely amazing. My hair looks great, and it smells wonderful for at least two to three days. I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good product makes my hair really soft</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great hair treatment! Can notice a difference with every application. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works quite like it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> Great Leave in  Anti-Frizz Conditioner - that mends and seals &amp;#34;Split ends&amp;#34; !!!  This stuff works well on all hair types  especially on Natural unpermed hair !  Will buy again !  Great for those of us that is into using &amp;#34;Keratin treatments&amp;#34; zero salt agents !&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but  it&#x27;s a great product !</li>
    <li> Received my order promptly, actually sooner than expected.. I live in an area with high humidity and the product took away the frizzy ends and seamed to seal off split ends!!! Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for taming down fly away hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I use to purchase it from HSN but it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> just another winner from this brand, it really helps with split ends and to give that smooth finish that shines</li>
    <li> I loved this product!! The smell is awesome. My ends are always splitting I needed something to stop the damage that was occurring. This is the product to use!! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this product, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily or matted down. Worth the price and much less expensive to buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over six weeks with great results. Only use when hair is wet and you will have excellent results!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after I heard various rave reviews on it, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the results. I do have to start out by saying that this product DOES seal split ends very effectively. However, it made my split but relatively soft ends brittle and extremely dry and actually ended up pulling out a considerable amount of strands due to almost matting effect the sealer had on my hair. Wasn&#x27;t the worst product I&#x27;ve tried and did seal my split ends, but I definitely would not repurchase or recommend.</li>
    <li> greata really great read who would have known. but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
    <li> I have natural (no dyes/chemicals added) hair. I straighten it often with blow dryers and flat irons which results in lots of split ends. I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and don&#x27;t see a noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea for a product, just didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. They&#x27;re amazing for my fine, over processed hair. I highly recommend these products. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is another example of how Carol&#x27;s Daughter makes a great smell, but the product in size is ridiculous compared to the price. As good as it smells I will not be buying another product from this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m personally not a huge fan of Carol&#x27;s Daugther products. Personally, I think they&#x27;re overpriced and they&#x27;re not natural or organic so those two reasons alone made me take off a star. Secondly, this product does smell great but I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement towards my split ends. Granted, everyone&#x27;s hair is different so this may be doing wonders for someone else&#x27;s hair but mine isn&#x27;t really feeling it. I&#x27;m a natural products user for the most part anyway so I love Shea Moisture, EVOO, Unrefined Coconut Oil, Lavender oil, Organic Shea Butter, stuff like that. And for the price, I just don&#x27;t see the value in CD products, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> made hair nicer and soft. It held moisture and stopped breakage.It was good for the price and the size.Loved it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product. I use it daily with my relaxed hair and it does work if you are consistent with it. The downside is that the size is extremely small and I have long hair so it does take me 2 pumps instead of the recommended 1 pump, but it still does last over 2 months even in the small size.</li>
    <li> Love this treatment! I have seen a difference in my hair strength and it seems like my hair stays straightened longer after flat ironing or blow drying.</li>
    <li> When used with the Nonoi shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask, it worked well. Got excellent result. However, I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star because I did not like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I was starting to see a lot of frizz with my natural twists.  Initially I bought this at the Carol Daughter counter in Macys.  It worked but it was very expensive.  The cost on Amazon was much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product eggs excellent it does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do I love it my hair never felt so great thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this produce for my daughter for just under a year.  She loves it!!  Her hair is growing and it actually stops the split ends.  Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter for another excellent product that shows the beauty of the different textures of African American hair.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter to try to preserve her hair length but it did not do anything. Maybe it will work with her twist out. It did nothing for her hair as far as flat ironing.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed.  I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good product.  I have gone natural and I&#x27;m still finding my &amp;#34;dream team&amp;#34; of hair products.  I would suggest others still be willing to give it a try.  You never know...</li>
    <li> I originally received this as a sample in my ipsy bag and was more than happy to purchase it!  It has a nice smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  While I&#x27;m not 100% sure it seals split ends, my hair feels healthier and I am more than happy with the product.  I have shoulder length hair and I don&#x27;t have to use too much product - a little less than a pea size drop.  I have used it on both dry and damp hair. Both worked well, although I tend to use it more before I blow dry my hair.  I have fine, naturally curly hair and it does NOT leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  It helps reduce frizz too, which is a huge bonus for me!</li>
    <li> Condition the hair and smell great , but nothing else .  This is my first and last bottle.  Love... The conditioner though.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not notice much of a difference with my ends. I would save my money on this product.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely NOTHING for my hair</li>
    <li> I barely have to clip my daughters ends since using this product. I love what it does and how it smells.My daughters hair is growing more steadily.</li>
    <li> I only used this product once so far, and so far I have noticed a great improvement in my hair.  I have long hair and have a great deal of split ends, after using this product I noticed that my split ends basically cut in half even more. I cant wait to see the long term effects!</li>
    <li> I am switching from the overpriced &amp;#34;WE...&amp;#34; products and with my fine hair this really does what it is supposed to do.  My hair has changed over the years and since I relax it but this only results in soft curls I need a product to help with the split ends since I use the flat iron when I want to wear it smooth.  We live in the hottest place on the planet (Georgia) and there is a greater number of extension/weave shops than there are salons that will actually care for your hair.  BTW...I have over 15 years experience in the hair industry and worked as a production show planner, color specialist, and trainer in both ethnic (black, Asian, Jewish, African, Hispanic...) and Caucasian hair, so with this being said; I know a good product when I find it.</li>
    <li> Def helps with smoothing and stopping split ends.</li>
    <li> It work my hair is thick and it stop coming out and I will order more when because it work</li>
    <li> The product makes big claims, but does&#x27;nt live up to the hype.  I used this along with the same company&#x27;s Smooth Chocolat collection (shampoo/conditioner/blow dry cream) and my hair actually looked better BEFORE is used it.  The conditioner and shampoo seemed to strip my hair of it&#x27;s moisture.  It seemed a little brittle afterwards.  Using this product didn&#x27;t do anything to help the situation.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I had been looking for a split end sealer for a while now but was afraid to spend $20 plus bucks on one that wasn&#x27;t going to work on my hair. After reading the reviews I finally decided to try this one. I have thin, naturally curly hair that tends to breaks and dry easily. Split ends have been my worst nightmare despite me using good shampoos and staying clear from mousses and gels which make it even worse. I also don&#x27;t blow dry or straighten my hair so who knows why I get split ends. Anyway, this product is awesome!! I&#x27;ve only been using for about two weeks and already I have noticed a different. I use it wet right after I brush my hair (after I shower) and I haven&#x27;t noticed any drying. A small amount goes a long way and it smells fabulous. I think this 1.7 oz bottle could easily last me a month or more. I&#x27;m happy I gave it a try and will definitely be repurchasing it. Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff !!! Used it together with the carol&#x27;s daughter hair milk and their hairdress n my hair stopped breaking!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL, AND THE TEXTURE, AND IT ACTUALLY DOES REPAIR THE SPLIT ENDS. For a time. This order was to replace last bottle ordered.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time this weekend.  Had high hopes that it would be fabulous, based on hearing HSN hosts and CD&#x27;s owner talk about it.  Used it on my newly cut hair. I recently had to have 6 inches cut from my hair due to extensive split ends.  Always being a long-haired girl, that was traumatic!  So, I set out to find something (anything!) that would prevent that ever happening again.  I wear my hair in protective styles, so the split ends came mostly from not getting it trimmed when the split was manageable and waiting too long.  But I digress... So, I put it on my ends before and after straightening it.  I admit, using it before AND after may have been too generous. All the reviews I&#x27;ve read seem to point to overuse or wrong use as problematic.  Still, using a product should not be rocket science for the consumer.  Make it simple.  And yes, I read the directions. It gives the suggested amount to use but little else.  Didn&#x27;t explain the little nuances of using a product which can be the difference between success and failure.  My ends stuck together and even with the first pea-sized application, felt as dry as parchment paper.  By now, it&#x27;s too late to return it (I waited weeks before opening it).... I&#x27;ve decided to give it one more try, this time on wet hair before I call it a total &#x27;non-starter.&#x27;  For now, I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt with 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good ratings, and having heard the brand name as being really good. It does seem to temporarily seal split ends, but because of its liquid consistency (and inconvenient pump-style packaging), I need to either blow dry or flat iron my hair afterwards, which kind of defeats the purpose, because those steps cause the most damage.  It even seems to dry the hair out a bit and give it a brittle feeling once it does get all absorbed. Maybe this is an issue of my hair type. If you&#x27;re the type of person who can leave the house with wet/damp hair and get a hairstyle out of it, this product could be very effective. But for me, it just too thin and wet. I was looking for something that would be a finishing step in my styling routine and this just isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> The smell is unbelievably horrendous.</li>
    <li> This hair product works well on my hair it smells good. It makes my hair feel so soft. I have less breakage.</li>
    <li> This particular product was excellent.  When I have time, I will order it again.  I also enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of months ago along with other Monoi products, and let me tell you it really does work!  I am 7 months into my hair transitioning phase from relaxed to natural, and I am super conscious about the products that I utilize in my hair as it is be prone to breakage. My hair is armpit length when blow-dryed.  I don&#x27;t use this everyday (I will use 3x&#x27;s a week then stop for about two weeks, then resume).  I went for a hair trim a yesterday (the last hair trim I had was 9 weeks ago) and I hardly had any split ends! Usually my hairdresser cuts 1/4-1/2 inch, but I had 1/8 inch or less this time around.  I also use the hair mask once a month. Yes, I do notice that the ends of my hair can become a little dry if I become over zealous and use more than a nickel size throughout my ends, lol, but the end results (less trimming) are definitely worth it. My suggestion would be to use this product in moderate amounts and if you feel the ends of your hair are too dry then follow up with a small amount of unrefined coconut oil for moisture.  The product is expensive, but can last you for a while. I anticipate purchasing more in another 3 months. I hope you enjoy the results as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I love this for my dry brittle ends. I will continue to purchase and based on this product, I plan on buying more products from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use on my the lower half of my hair once it&#x27;s dry. It binds the ends together, getting rid of all frizz.  It&#x27;s a total lifestyle changer (I no longer need to blow dry my hair).  The only problem is that my husband complains that the smell is awful.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell....  To keep him happy, I&#x27;m searching for a similar product with less of or a different smell...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to expectations and actually caused my hair to get split ends more. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it really does seem to improve your ends. I do think the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0099LC5OK Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Split End Sealer 1.7 oz]&lt;br /&gt;****I just got this product and today was my first day using it. It smells nice and so far my ends do look better today than the day before. I put the product on my dry hair and wrap my hair last night. I didn&#x27;t use any heat after un-wrapping my hair and my ends looks ok. So I will keep using this product to determine any major growth. I do have one question? Is it safe for everyday use; the direction did not state how often to use the product.</li>
    <li> I used this product 2 times and I did not like the results at all.  My hair felt like I had some thing sticky in it towards the ends.  All day long it bothered me.  My hair did not move freely and I could not run my fingers through the bottom of my hair.  I would love to return this product for a refund!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently had a few mishaps with boxed hair dye. After dying my hair 3 times and getting professional highlights/glaze my hair was looking a rough to say the least. I was searching Sephora to see what they offered and I decided to give this a whirl. As soon as the package was delivered I read the directions and put some on my hair. The first thing I noticed was the smell, I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how amazing this makes my hair smell, defiantly a bonus. I only need a pea sized amount on my fingers to run though the ends, I could immediately see the split ends disappear. While it is a bit pricey for the size the results are worth it. If used sparingly, this could easily last me 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> I notice nothing of any difference with this product.  It&#x27;s of no consequence whatsoever.  It&#x27;s ok I guess.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  You don&#x27;t get much in the bottle.  After a couple of squirts, it seems as though all the product is gone.</li>
    <li> Great great product for split ends.Wonderful clean smell.It does exactly what it says.This product will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Love it a little goes a long way and it smells so good,really helped my split ends. I wash my hair with Wen</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair! It didn&#x27;t seal or repair my split ends. It was overpriced and tiny. It left my 4a type (kinky) African American hairy feeling sticky and hard. The only good thing about it, is that it smells good. I will never buy any more of Carol&#x27;s Daughter overpriced crappy products!</li>
    <li> Too many petrochemical ingredients that made my hair slick in a non-natural way.  Wish I had my money back.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. It really helps my hair and the smell os so soft and pleasant. Not overpowering like some other hair products.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok I have yet to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Product very good and has reduced breakage for transitional hair styling...growing out of relaxer to natural hair and actually spending as much time styling as I was with perm. Saving from expense touch ups ever 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Thanks to everyone who responded to my inquiry about using this product on dry hair (recently shampooed and styled hair).  I have been chemical free since 2010 and have naturally dark brown hair. I don&#x27;t know what grade of hair I have, but let&#x27;s just say it is not considered &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; hair by any standards in the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; community. I had the &amp;#34;grand idea&amp;#34; to have my hair highlighted for an event last October and while the color was gorgeous, my hair in a matter of months went from shiny healthy hair to dry beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt; I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on products from Target and Macy&#x27;s trying everything from Agave and Aveda to Shea Moisture and other Carol&#x27;s daughter products. I mean I was desperate!&lt;br /&gt;As a black woman in my late 40&#x27;s, I was afraid that I was going to have to do a big chop to get rid of the color. I was so tired of watching my bra length hair being trimmed to death because my split ends were looking like hay!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product yesterday and used it on my dry ends. I allowed it to &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; before I styled it. (actually I got distracted by playing Boggle) I wrapped my hair, put on my scarf and decided to see if I was going to have to go and return this in the morning.  MUCH to my surprise, my hair FEELS AMAZING! It is not unruly, my ends are not hay like and I am so happy that I could actually cry. My unwrapped hair is not greasy/oily and lifeless but has movement and is smooth and shiny.  I can finally stop sweeping the bathroom before going to work.</li>
    <li> oh my God this product is the best thing ive ever used in my hair ever! Let me just say. it also gets rid of my frizz aswell as binding together my split ends. My hair is relaxed and I press it three times a month but I have managed to grow my hair and maintain its length to my waist. The ends of my hair can be pretty ratty at times but when I use this product it looks like a fresh pack of weave LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent* it is a very perfumey scent, not bad and it does fade by the next day, and it dosent conflict with your leave in conditioner of choice either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;texture* it is like a thick paste but it is not heavy at all and I can see this being great for all hair types as it isnt heavy and dosent leave any residue feeling on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results* this isn&#x27;t going to permanently fix your split ends it just seals them back together until your next wash and how that helps your hair grow is because u dont have to cut off your ends as fast because when you seal them back together the split ends dont have the ability to keep traveling up your hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how it compares to nexus* I have been using the nexus split end mender stuff for awhile and I thought it was great but this stuff beats it hands down give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff, highly recommend everyone try it!</li>
    <li> Not so sure it helps seal split ends completely, but certainly has a lovely smell to it. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product isn&#x27;t exactly what people made it out to be. $23.00 for a cream that doesn&#x27;t last that long was not worth it. I don&#x27;t like the Gardenia smell to it. On the plus side one pump was enough but it just didn&#x27;t please my standards as I thought it would. Maybe I had to high of expectations.....I would just save the money and buy so,etching cheaper.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I bought this along with the Monoi sample kit to try and i got great results. After going to the stylist i smoothed a pea size amount onto my straightened ends (my hair is natural) and they look fantastic. For those who say it makes their hair hard or sticky try using it on your hair after its dry, only use a pea size amount and only apply to your ends brushing immediately after.. Thats what i did and now i will ALWAYS use this product even without the Monoi shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Got it for my ex, she loves it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have naturally curly and highlighted blonde hair so it can get very dry. This is lightweight enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy but definitely smooths it out. I sometimes put a pea size amount in my wet hair before blow drying but usually I apply a small amount to my dry hair. My hair looks healthier, smoother and longer! And the smell is INCREDIBLE. Imagine the most luxurious sun tab lotion you&#x27;ve ever smelled. My boyfriend is crazy about it!</li>
    <li> I used the whole Monoi line and I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. Only upside was that it made my hair smell good.</li>
