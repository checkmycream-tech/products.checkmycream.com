      <li>very good product .</li>
      <li>so that is an all around great reaction to a great product!</li>
      <li>Activated Charcoal alone is incredible for detoxifying the body from &amp;#34;preservatives&amp;#34; to the poison fluoride and also nutrileze the sugars and acidic foods we eat that cause gum damage, it&#x27;s win/win all</li>
      <li>and they stay like that for over 24 hours it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
      <li>5 stars, real nice item.</li>
      <li>I have good feelings for this though!</li>
      <li>Tastes good!</li>
      <li>This product is good but don&#x27;t expect perfection!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I kind of like this stuff... But the flavor is so gross and the texture just bothers me so much. It makes a huge mess when using it and if you get a little water in it the whole thing goes bad..&lt;br /&gt;I still gave 4 stars since it does what is it suppose to do which is brighten your teeth and kill bacteria but I can honestly say I hate using this stuff..</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!! Who knew that turning your teeth black would result in a whiter smile?! At first I thought it tasted like I licked a clay flower pot, but after three weeks of use it almost has a sweet, chocolaty taste. LOVE.THIS.STUFF.</li>
    <li> I use this for my teeth as well as a mask once a week. Just make a paste with water and leave it in for a while then rinse... It draws all and I mean all impurities:)</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this, but it&#x27;s a MESS! We tried sprinkling it onto our toothbrushes, which just makes you feel like you&#x27;re wasting it and tried putting coconut oil on the brush then dipping it into the jar, but other reviewers said that introducing moisture to the jar could cause mold so that wasn&#x27;t a solution. I wanted to like this but I just can&#x27;t have black mess all over my bathroom every time I brush my teeth</li>
    <li> Messy but awesome.  At first it was an acquired taste but after awhile I got used to it and like it now.  My teeth seem to be sparkling when I am done brushing them and extremely clean.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff ! Works the first time using it. Teeth are whiter and shiny.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily but maybe every couple of weeks. Hard to imagine but it turns black in your mouth yet polishes your teeth as well as the dentist. I use Earthpaste for everyday brushing and this natural tooth and gum powder as a optional polish.</li>
    <li> I use this with Tom&#x27;s whitening toothpaste. My gums are definitely the main benefactor of this stuff. On my 3rd jar. Great stuff</li>
    <li> but it hard to get off,my teeth.</li>
    <li> Just awesome!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After just the 3rd use my results are amazing&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews on any product good or bad but I just have to share the great results I have had with this product. I had great results but don&#x27;t know if it will be the same for everyone:)</li>
    <li> Definitely weird to get used to.. But love that its all natural and much safer than commercial toothpaste. Seemed to help whiten my teeth as well. Nice product</li>
    <li> Very good results even after first use....</li>
    <li> I find it so messy and it has no breath freshener in it, but it does whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> We make our tooth paste out of this with coconut oil and essential oil and we love it</li>
    <li> I ca see my teeth whiter and leave my mouth feeling fresh, I notice an overall improvement in my oral health.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I liked it. However, the price point is outrageous, given that one can purchase 5x as much activated charcoal for the same price. I will not purchase again; rather, I will mix up my own.</li>
    <li> I have to see results with this</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff! I ordered the charcoal toothbrushes as well. Teeth are whiter after a week. I mixed with a little coconut oil and keep it in a mason jelly jar. I will be a regular customer for sure.</li>
    <li> This product prevents build-up of plaque and keeps breath clean and teeth white.  No fluorides or additives.</li>
    <li> I really like the feeling my brushing my teeth with this powder.  The only downside is its messy, so you will need to rinse the sink and your brush very thoroughly after each use.</li>
    <li> Using now for about 2 weeks.  Although my teeth are not any whiter right now and it doesn&#x27;t help with making your breath any better.  I guess maybe I need more time.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER! i love this stuff it makes my mouth and teeth feel so squeaky clean always! and it really really whitens teeth! not to mention it is all natural! great product:))</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I&#x27;m planning on buying more of it. I love it!</li>
    <li> It absolutely whitens your teeth</li>
    <li> Great flavor and a feeling of a clean fresh mouth .  I just switched from store bought toothpaste to this product.  It is an excellent value.  I think that it will be more economical than store bought toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, more like every other and always in conjunction with a tiny dab of toothpaste. If I use it alone it makes my bamboo toothbrush feel weird - it&#x27;s a sensory thing like nails on a chalkboard - and the mess is minimal. I&#x27;ve included a picture of my sink immediately after using this product. Maybe I&#x27;m not as wild with my tooth rushing habits as others because I just don&#x27;t experience the mess I read about in these reviews. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it as a result but glad I did.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool item. Definitely gets messy. I&#x27;ve not seen any difference at this point to post about.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far and love that it is all natural!</li>
    <li> want a nice smile i sugggest you get this for natural white teeth this is the trick right there</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak on how the product works, but have comments about the product. I knew the product would be black since it&#x27;s charcoal. However, what I didn&#x27;t expect was how it attaches to everything. When I started brushing I panicked when I saw how black my teeth were. I was afraid the black wouldn&#x27;t come off - it did. However my sink stayed black and I had to actually clean it (this stuff can&#x27;t be rinsed off). My toothbrush stayed black. I soaked it in hydrogen peroxide and that helped but toothbrush is still a bit dark. I won&#x27;t try brushing with this stuff again. Too much clean-up!</li>
    <li> I feel my mouth freshh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;mI&#x27;mt seeing a difference. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice, good taste, I feel my teeth clean, I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Received product before time. I can say I brush after practically each meal I have. The taste is not that bad. I did notice a my teeth felt significantly cleaner after the first use. I even had husband test it on himself. So far we like the results.</li>
    <li> Horrible, messy and tast nasty. Looks like it turned my teeth color  2 shades darker.</li>
    <li> Great product! Tastes good!</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and my mouth feels cleaner when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. You have to watch how you stand while brushing because the run-off looks like liquid charcoal. However I do notice that my teeth are whiter. I use a salt toothpaste as well. It has a pleasant neutral taste.</li>
    <li> Love love love! My teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> This product is great, my teeth always feel polished, and it has whitened a shade or two in only a week or so!  It doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all.  So many reviewers talk about how messy it is, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be messy.  Here&#x27;s my no-mess protocol:&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS USE A DRY BRUSH.  Water will cause the powder to mold.&lt;br /&gt;1. Put a VERY small amount of toothpaste (I use Tom&#x27;s no-fluoride) on your dry brush--you can push it in with the end of the tube.  You don&#x27;t need very much, only enough for the powder to adhere to.  Don&#x27;t go all the way to the top end of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dip the brush into the powder (the jar itself, or you can pour some into the cap).  Get a fair amount on the brush, you will have to experiment to see how much powder you like.  Tap off excess back into jar (it will be dry--the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t wet it).&lt;br /&gt;3. Run just the very end of the brush under the water.  The idea is to just get enough moisture to mix the toothpaste and the powder.  Yes, you will lose a little bit of powder from the brush, but if you haven&#x27;t put toothpaste at the end, there won&#x27;t be much.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Brush your teeth with your lips around the brush--you don&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; while you brush your teeth.  Once the powder is wet and has combined with the toothpaste, there will be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it!  I never have any mess at all.  If you brush your teeth more than twice a day, you may have to have more than one brush, as the brush must be dry to start out.</li>
    <li> Rhis stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but seem to get just as good results with regular activated charcoal.  If you are interested in the herbs too get this.</li>
    <li> Love that this is natural. Even historically &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34; have been bought by large corporations and their ingredients are Appalling. Even the toothpastes in the WF aisle contain crazy ingredients. I couldn&#x27;t find one product that actually was natural, despite their labeling. Which is how I ended up here. If you are committed to natural toothpaste then the texture of this product is the last thing you will worry about. You can look in the mirror while brushing and laugh because your teeth are temporarily black. It&#x27;s worth it because the ingredients are all labeled and things I have heard of (and I know are not carcinogenic). If you wouldn&#x27;t consider yourself in this category, don&#x27;t buy this product. Otherwise, I would highly recommend for all uber heAlth conscious folks.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to just using regular toothpaste.  I love this stuff.  Flossing and brushing with this makes me feel like I went to the dentist.  Buy it if you are on the fence, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder! works amazing and will last you longer than the average toothpaste tube if you do not get any water on the inside. My teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter and it works great if you have strong morning breath.</li>
    <li> my teeth feel clean and fresh ..there has not been any gum bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this gum powder..</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I immediately felt a better clean after I use this toothpowder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are not careful, this will literally go everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;2. For all your hard brushers... be gentle because it WILL splatter against your bathroom wall and everywhere else&lt;br /&gt;3. Kind of a hassle to open the lid and use a small wooden spoon from a mask I bought but other than that, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;4. Drink TONS of water after you brush your teeth. It will make your mouth a desert.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I did all the Crest white teeth products. But this beats them all!! No chemicals, and I do notice the difference. Takes a little getting used to the color. My teeth have never been whiter, gums feel great too!!!!</li>
    <li> Takes all the hard tartar off my teeth, too soon to see how white they get...but so far so good. :)  No big mess, just rinse in the sink and with water wash it off... no big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this! Instantly makes my teeth feel more clean and white. Very happy I decided to try it. I use charcoal for everything and it&#x27;s a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using this in combination with EarthPaste for remineralizing and coconut oil pulling to get rid of streptococcus mutans. All I really wanted this powder to do was pump up those efforts, but it has far exceeded my expectations. My mouth feels pristine, and as someone who cannot (and wouldn&#x27;t) use whitening strips due to severe tooth sensitivity from hydrogen peroxide, it makes my teeth look simply gorgeous. They were noticeably shinier after the first use, but after two weeks of twice daily brushing, they&#x27;re blinding. Where has this stuff been all my life?</li>
    <li> Tastes great - even my kids doesn&#x27;t mind using this.  no chemicals, fresh breath and white teeth!</li>
    <li> Really works on whitening teeth!</li>
    <li> This is not as good as the pure activated charcoal. It&#x27;s okay as a mild cleaning</li>
    <li> Great stuff.. thought it would be super messy reading these other post but it&#x27;s not.. I love this stuff and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i like how clean it leave my tooth</li>
    <li> Use to whiten my teeth.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> I really love what it does to my teeth and gums, but I really hate what a mess it is to use. Careful not to get any water in the jar, I take a a small plastic picnic knife, scoop a little black powder and then carefully over the sink dump it onto the tip of my rotating brush head; inevitably some amount of it goes into the sink--both a mess and a waste. Invitamin, can you not come up with a smarter packaging? What about a soft plastic bottle with a spout so you can squeeze a little onto the toothbrush?</li>
    <li> This makes my teeth whiter and my gums don&#x27;t itch any more!</li>
    <li> I found the product did not deliver the results I was looking for. Would purchase a different product the next time.</li>
    <li> Something to get used to but nice to know i&#x27;m not putting toxins in my body.</li>
    <li> After two uses my teeth feel silly smooth. I already received one compliment that my teeth looked &amp;#34;shiny.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be messy, but I pour a small amount in my hand then dip my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my sore gums. Not a bad taste...and as I was just using charcoal powder is a definite improvement over that.  Will use over the next few weeks to see if there is a noticeable improvement in the health of my gums and will come back and post again.    Update: Okay...have had a chance to try this for awhile and unfortunately I can not use it...through no fault of the product. I have Lichen Planus and the essential oils irritate this condition. Have gone back to just the activated charcoal with no additives. This was definitely an upgrade in texture and taste...but just isn&#x27;t right for my problem.</li>
    <li> just like the description fAst shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this product a few weeks ago hoping it would help with bleeding gums.  I saw a good 80% improvement within 10 days.  It leaves your breath  fresh and teeth whiter.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  Oh, and customer service is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Great, love it.... But it&#x27;s got stevia in it</li>
    <li> I alternate using the powder with toothpaste. It&#x27;s kind of a hassle to get onto the brush, but the taste is okay and it definitely helps as a whitener.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a long-time fan of charcoal and clay, so when I saw this product with both of them, I decided to give it a try. I bought some charcoal toothbrushes, because I didn&#x27;t know if it would make a regular toothbrush look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s WONDERFUL! I have a tiny spoon that I use to scoop a small amount into my palm, then run the wet toothbrush over it to moisten. I feel a little bit of abrasion as I brush my teeth, and it&#x27;s a little weird to see your teeth all black. But it rinses completely, my teeth feel smooth and they are definitely whiter. Minimal mess in the sink, just have to rinse the hand that held the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container lasted a long time, because I alternated with a regular toothpaste so I could use my sonic toothbrush. But this is so much better on my teeth, I believe I&#x27;ll bit the bullet and try it with the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; taste, but my whole mouth feels healthier, so I&#x27;m okay with that. I&#x27;m ordering my second  jar.</li>
    <li> My suggestion would be to add this to a natural toothpaste.  It definitely made my teeth more white after one use and I would give it 5 stars for that, but doesn&#x27;t have enough cinnamon flavor to freshen breath.  I will keep using it to whiten my teeth, but disappointed I still need to find a toothpaste and just fyi it&#x27;s super messy trying to get it on your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I like it but it is messy! I keep some in a separate cup so I can dip my brush in.</li>
    <li> Love what this does form my gums and overall mouth feel and health! But it makes my teeth greyish, not white. I bought a miswak and solved the color problem, but still use this in the mornings because it&#x27;s honestly a joy for the mouth! It makes everything feel great. I&#x27;ll never use a commercial paste again.</li>
    <li> Just received it today. I LOVE the taste! I don&#x27;t see a difference in the color of my teeth unfortunately and don&#x27;t really feel that they are cleaner than normal but will keep trying and updating! Update: it&#x27;s fine, really. doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth as clean as toothpaste but was a fine substitute for when I was out of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> As far as teeth whitening, my teeth do look a tad bit brighter (I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now) but I have noticed that the plaque I used to have on my teeth is GONE! Many reviews say it&#x27;s messy, but I just put tooth paste on my brush, dip it in the powder and brush my teeth in the shower. Whaallllaa, no mess :) highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thumbs up! A staple.☺</li>
    <li> A little messy but worth it!</li>
    <li> I believe this product is actually whitening my teeth; which is funny, because as I brush with it, I have a very black mouth. But once rinsed, very clean and bright teeth is the result. It is not at all unpleasant to use. Just make sure to rinse out the sink. If you are a messy person, I do not recommend this product, as you will have it everywhere. I wish the manufacturer could come up with an easier way to get the powder onto the brush. I use a tiny spoon, but a bottle with an &amp;#34;ant eater type pouring spout&amp;#34; would make using this easier. I switched to this product because my gums are sensitive and &amp;#34;Sensodyne&amp;#34; and the like, were not helping matters.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t think it is for me. messy trying to keep on tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Whitens teeth, a lil messy but overall great!</li>
    <li> Works like a champ. I won&#x27;t go back to toothpaste with all the chemicals.  The powder is very fine, and my teeth feel clean and bright. It has a subtle nice taste.</li>
    <li> Love using this. I have seen an improvement not drastic but very satisfying. I recommend it. It&#x27;s not like the whitening strip that make your teeth sensitive. You feel your teeth clean and smooth. A must try! :)</li>
    <li> This tastes great and definitely whitens your teeth and freshens your breath. Even though the jar is small, you will get lots of use from it and it will last you a long time if you use it sparingly. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first as gimmicky but I have to say, this really works. My teeth are noticeably whiter with only a week of diligent use (brush 3x a day). The powder has a very silty texture to it, like moondust. It is all black which makes it a little bit of a mess to clean up if you are not careful. Take an old 1/4 teaspoon measurer from your kitchen and use that to scoop it into your mouth, rinse around and then brush. Saves you the mess.  As for the taste, to me, it has a subtle hint of lime to it. It&#x27;s got an earth, citrusy flavor to it that I think most people could tolerate.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product, but I&#x27;ve definitely used higher quality tooth powders. This one just kinda dissolves in your spit so you can&#x27;t even rub it against your teeth. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had purchased three jars however, I experienced my teeth turned yellow within two weeks. inVitamin should have stated clearly the potential problems of the item in users manual.  my experience did exactly correspond with what was described below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I wonder if this practice is something that a dentist would endorse for everyday use-or at all. So I called Dr. Ryan Fleming, a dentist based near Indianapolis, to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, he&#x27;s not a fan. Not only is there no evidence of charcoal living up to its claims, its abrasive nature could cause problems if used too frequently. \\&quot;You have to be careful with anything that&#x27;s overly abrasive,\\&quot; he says. \\&quot;If you someone brushes with something like a pumice or activated charcoal every day for a year, you&#x27;re going to certainly do irreversible damage to the enamel of the tooth,\\&quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once enamel is brushed away, the yellow-tinged dentin beneath is revealed. Fleming says once that happens, there&#x27;s nothing you can do to regain the white look of enamel, other than restoring the tooth. As with traditional whitening treatments, Fleming says it&#x27;s probably best to brush with activated charcoal once or twice a year. But since the stuff isn&#x27;t proven to whiten like peroxide-based solutions, teeth-whitening treatments may be my best bet. Bring on the whitening gel\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Very interesting brushing with charcoal (not in a bad way at all).  This is all new for me, I usually use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste but was intrigued by the benefits of using all natural charcoal.  It is messy, never believe anyone who says otherwise.  You get used to it though, the first time I had black all over my sink but now I am more careful and rarely make a serious mess on the bathroom counter/sink.  If I am going out, I will brush really quick with traditional toothpaste to make sure to get all of the little pieces of charcoal out of my smile (sometimes it is hard to rinse them all out).  It makes my teeth feel really nice, and I love the bacterial benefits (I think this totally helps my breath when I brush just before going to bed).  I love the taste too, it&#x27;s not overpowering - just enough flavor.  All in all I like it, and have been using it for about a week every day (2-3 times a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the benefits of whitening my teeth, I have not noticed that yet but then again my teeth were not really yellow...hopefully it helps keep my mouth looking nice because I am a coffee-a-day (or two) drinker and over the years I do worry what this will do to my teeth.</li>
    <li> works good and tastes good</li>
    <li> It is a bit disconcerting to brush your teeth with this but rest assured it works!!  My teeth feel smoother and my overall gum health is great!  If you want that feeling of foaminess in your mouth add a pinch of this to your regular toothpaste and expect the same great results!  How I lived without this I will never know!</li>
    <li> This product tastes great and the flavor last a long time, my gums were swollen and in much pain before I began taking this product but after three days the soreness of the gums subsided and and after the first five days the pain was gone. It definitely work on bad breath but the does not eliminate it completely but I found that it&#x27;s because the bad breath was coming from gas build up in my stomach and so I ordered the active charcoal pills to ease digestion and with the two I have complete success but at times the bb still surfaces but if you use this after eating it works great. I put a spoonful in a shot glass to avoid the whole jar being exposed to water or moisture. A small amount of &amp;#34;synsodyne &amp;#34; toothpaste on the tooth brush and dip it into  the gum powder that&#x27;s in the shot glass and away I go. It avoids the big mess by combining the products together and the overall flavor is great! This product is good but don&#x27;t expect perfection! It will motivate you to want to continue brushing for a long time. At times you may need to hold your head up as you brush and keep your mouth closed.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers - it does make teeth feel very clean and shiny.  Tastes good too.  Does leave black bits so you have to rinse your mouth afterwards with a water pic or something though.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I have fairly white teeth that could use some whitening. I think maybe it&#x27;s more about the abrasion for some people than actual charcoal whitening the teeth? I kind of feel that if the same people used baking soda they would see similar results? By any account, this didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s also pretty messy, must wash sink afterwards and rinse toothbrush for a long time. Tastes fine, has some peppermint oil or something in it that makes the taste okay.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week! Went to my dental check up and my doctor and hygienist were amazed. Perfect gums and teeth!</li>
    <li> Almost a 5 star product.  I don&#x27;t like the packaging.  I find it an inconvenience to have to screw off the large top then scoop out the powder onto my brush while wasting product at the same time.  I do this because I read not to put the wet brush in the jar (the reasoning made sense).  I normally use the powder toothpaste that comes in a functional plastic flip top bottle; perfect packaging.  But alas, that powder does a better job cleaning my teeth.  I drink a lot tea and I find using this powder I have to whiten my teeth a lot less often.</li>
    <li> Very messy and can&#x27;t really see difference when used.</li>
    <li> Wow, my teeth are bright and clean!  Here&#x27;s how I use this: in a shot glass I drop a pea-sized amount of toothpaste, a half teaspoon of baking soda, a small scoop of this powdered charcoal and finally a few drops of hydrogen peroxide, enough to make it a paste. Brush well and thoroughly. Rinse. Tah dah! Beautifully white, healthy teeth!&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is mildly minty.  The color of course, takes some getting used to as the paste is a dark charcoal gray, obviously. But other than that, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using natural toothpastes and powders. I&#x27;ve known about the benefits of activated charcoal and I&#x27;ve broken open capsules a time or two in order to brush my teeth with the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tooth powder has all natural ingredients, cleans and whitens your teeth,and has a hint of a mint taste (just a hint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy, but I know that before I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an electric toothbrush. I open the lid and hang the top of my toothbrush over the lid. I take a plastic spoon, which I keep in the medicine cabinet and use only for this tooth powder, and scoop a small amount of powder onto the spoon. I slowly pour the powder onto the toothbrush and I&#x27;ve gotten so I no longer spill as much as I used to. Once I&#x27;ve finished brushing my teeth I floss again (I haven&#x27;t been able to easily get rid of my habit of flossing before I brush). I then shake whatever&#x27;s fallen into the lid back into the container and close the container. Then I have to clean the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect this tooth powder to last several months. My dentist appointment isn&#x27;t for 4 more months so I&#x27;m not sure how my dentist feels about the new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, tell you kids to watch you brush your teeth with this stuff, or have them try it. They think it&#x27;s hilarious! Bonus!</li>
    <li> This stuff works, you can literally dip your toothbrush in it and then put toothpaste over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow within a few brushes my teeth seem so much whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff and how clean and healthy my mouth feels after using, especially with the combo of oil pulling first</li>
    <li> Works good but you have to acclimate to the taste and texture.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for the whitening aspect.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference with that but I love the product anyway.  My mouth feels so clean after using it and I love that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I had to get used to is that due to the fact that it is a powder, sometimes I have to cough while using it as it irritates my throat.  It is a little messy but cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> Wish it was easier to dispense. Makes a big mess when trying not to get water in it on from the toothbrush</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of this product. This product has whitened and brightened my teeth within 1 week of use. I&#x27;m amazed &amp; impressed. I&#x27;ve tried several products &amp; none have given me the excellent results as this product has. It has a peppermint flavor. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now, and My teeth are so white!&lt;br /&gt;***to avoid mold in bottle, I scoop a little bit into another jar to dip my toothbrush into.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last you a VERY long time if you take a small portion out at a time, and use that.</li>
    <li> Works well however if you&#x27;re getting just because it says cinnamon.. Like I did..it has no flavor but works so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything again, love there&#x27;s no sour taste when you eat after. Very palatable flavor, I got cinnamint. Using a spice spoon to take out amount and using with coconut oil, followed by dr. Tungs scraper and thieves mouthwash.Every other day I brush with Herbi Plus toothpaste, it&#x27;s wonderful. Great routine and super fresh breath naturally :) Check out my pics!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for sending me another one after the mail lost it! I really aprreciate it, the product is great!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, i thought it would taste like dirt and be a challenge to get my husband to use, boy, was i mistaken. This is the best tooth powder i have ever tried. Taste great and feels even better after i use it, my teeth are super squeaky clean, and brighter. Plus its a big hit with all the family members, kids too!  I am hooked and look forward to updating you once we go through the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Pricey, messy, no flavor, clogged toothbrush and wouldn&#x27;t rinse clean.  Did not get my mouth as clean as other natural tooth paste I&#x27;ve used.  Tried this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  This will be gifted to them and I&#x27;ll go back to what was working.</li>
    <li> It really leaves your teeth feeling like you just went to the dentist.  It has a great taste and leaves a fresh after taste.  It is slightly more messy than conventional toothpaste but worth the extra sink cleanup time.  Unlike other products I&#x27;ve read about, I haven&#x27;t had the concern of my enamel wearing away.  I haven&#x27;t experienced increased sensitivity or anything that has caused concern.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 3 weeks so far. It is having an affect on lightening my teeth, but it&#x27;s not nearly as fast working as everyone says. Still giving it a chance for a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Unlike many reviewers, I actually gave this a product a month of use before writing this. I think sometimes when people&#x27;s expectations are so high, they write a review prematurely before they really know for sure if what they&#x27;re saying is true. I thought at first that I was noticing positive results with this, but I now believe that was wildly in my head/imagination because of all the positive reviews I saw here. I was so sure I was going to like it, that I convinced myself it was a great product... that is the first week of use. After 3 weeks, my teeth have gotten yellower. No, it isn&#x27;t because I started drinking wines or other teeth staining substances. I do what I&#x27;ve always done. I am 100% sure that this product caused my teeth to look more unhealthier and full of pigment. Just because something is &#x27;mysteriously black&#x27; doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s going to be a great product. Be weary before buying this, I think I&#x27;m going to move back to the professional products that actually have science to back up their claims.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It took getting used to, because of the gritty texture, and you definitely will keep up with flossing when you use it.</li>
    <li> The activated charcoal has a hidden benefit of getting stuck between your teeth. These little black specs encourage you to floss on a daily basis (just as your dentist recommends). I alternate between regular toothpaste and the powder throughout the day. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to Toothpaste. My last dentist checkup was the best I have ever had. And that is saying something cuz I always have amazing reviews from my dentist. This is really messy so I have to clean my counter top often and I always have to floss afterwards to get the little bits of gunk out between my teeth. So for me that is all the more reason to keep up with this product. I like to use a spoon to get the powder out and put it in my mouth rather than dip my toothbrush in the jar. I find it to be far more convenient to do it this way.</li>
    <li> Really works nicely. I use this at night and use regular toothpaste in the morning. You need to keep using it in order to see a difference. Also eliminates bad breath. I don&#x27;t wake up with morning breath which is awesome.  Packaging was simple. Maybe wasn&#x27;t as secure as I would like it to be but the glass jar is really thick. Also comes with a seal to let you know if its safe had hasn&#x27;t been opened. Which is nice.</li>
    <li> Good product but a pain to use. Needs to be sold in a container that allows you to apply a small amount much easier.</li>
    <li> I am an R.D.H. and use this as my only dentifrice. Love this product and highly recommend. Excellent for stain removal and gingival health.</li>
    <li> It does a great job at teeth cleaning.  I&#x27;m jut not to fond of the taste.  It has a diet aftertaste to me.</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research and activated charcoal is the best thing for true cleaning and natural whitening.  This is easy to use and tasty.</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVABLE!!! I&#x27;m attaching a photo of my teethe in the EXACT same lighting in my bathroom !!! This was the first day!!!!!!! NOTICEABLE difference.. I LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t use this very often because it is messy and turns my entire sink and everything around my sink BLACK with splatter. I spend more time cleaning up than actually brushing. It&#x27;s also awkward to get onto my toothbrush. I was wetting my toothbrush and dipping into the jar, but that would get water into the jar so obviously it&#x27;s not the best way. I can&#x27;t say if it actually whitens because I only used it once or twice. Not convenient AT ALL. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like it, however, it took some time to get used to brushing your teeth with black powder.</li>
    <li> Can be used without toothpaste. I use with my toothpaste, simply apply toothpaste and dip in the charcoal gum powder. Teeth have never been so white.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Activated Charcoal alone is incredible for detoxifying the body from &amp;#34;preservatives&amp;#34; to the poison fluoride and also nutrileze the sugars and acidic foods we eat that cause gum damage, it&#x27;s win/win all around.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a little hard to get the powder into a paste but once you catch on it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;  It has a sutle &amp;#34;wrigleys gum&amp;#34; flavoring to it,</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It works better on its own, if you&#x27;re using it to whiten teeth. I use it both on its own, and mixed with toothpaste. Gives your teeth a very soft, clean, polished feel, and whitens very well. Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. A very generous amount for the price. Will last a long time. Shipping was really really fast, and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> So, so. I bought this to help whiten my teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t all that bad, but a little extra whitening minus a bunch of harmful chemicals is a good thing. I figured what could it hurt. My biggest complaint is the aftertaste. Sweetened with stevia leaf powder. I would prefer no flavor whatsoever to having stevia. The taste is very unpleasant to me, some people cannot tell, I can, and it&#x27;s repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t so concerned about chemicals I just wanted something that worked without being overly harsh. If I pair this with my normal toothpaste and rinse extra well I can use it, but only when at home and best in the shower. I have not been able to see any difference in whitening either.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be intimidated either by how this looks or tastes. This stuff will get your teeth whiter than any of those stupid strips with all those harmful chemicals. Try this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a chance. I admit it&#x27;s a little messy but well worth the experience.</li>
    <li> This is a great tooth powder!  It doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything and gets your teeth very clean.  It seems like my teeth are a shade or two whiter since I have been using this  I have been using it for several months but I noticed after a few uses that my teeth were already getting whiter.  It last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non-toxic toothpaste replacement for a while now. I can stop looking. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> its a great product, my son used it for about 3 weeks and it was a noticeable 2 shades lighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it two days and already hooked. My teeth feel clean and stay clean. The whitening effect is a pleasant bonus!</li>
    <li> Arrived super quick. I love this product, everyday I have that just left the dentist polish feeling!!!! I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the second use and it&#x27;s all natural!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Best whitening product I&#x27;ve used. Safe, natural and organic, can&#x27;t ask for more than that! Order it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Super messy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now. I will start with the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are astounding and immediate. My teeth were visibly whiter, shiny and smooth after the first use. My husband said my teeth were &amp;#34;gleaming&amp;#34;  I have tried the at-home whitening strips and toothpastes, but they always irritated my gums terribly. This product left my gums tingly. I love that it is all natural, and that it does not use peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks are:  It&#x27;s very weird at first, looking like you are brushing your teeth with mascara. It is also very messy - I had black stuff all over the sink. This may get better as I get used to using it. So at least for the first few times, expect that it&#x27;s going to take you about three times longer to brush your teeth. I also have had to floss afterward to get bits of black from between my teeth, but at least it will force me to remember to floss! I use it with a sonic-care brush, so that does make for more splashing of it around.  But to me, so worth it. I drink coffee, tea and wine every day, and I am always worried about my teeth being stained. This really seems to take care of that. Most definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I received this tooth powder just yesterday. I opened it and used it as recommended and I notice a difference in my teeth the first time I used it. Tonight before going to be I brushed my teeth and noticed that my gums are showing a tremendous improvement. I will not go back to regular toothpaste ever again. I&#x27;m going to buy this for my family. Oh and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I was honestly skeptical about buying this product, seeing as it&#x27;s a black material that yields white teeth. However, even after the first day of use I noticed a dramatic difference in the shade of my teeth! My teeth were noticeably whiter. Just beware, if you use too much of the powder (like I did during my first use) your gums will bleed. So, be careful, use in moderation (once a week) and enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> Love it.  It really works well</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect using this as it&#x27;s my first attempt at using a product such as this. I&#x27;ve used it standalone, and with toothpaste. Standalone is great as there is no minty aftertaste, just a clean feeling. When I want that minty taste, I use my toothbrush dry with some toothpaste on it and then carefully dipping into the charcoal powder. Overall I&#x27;m pleased so far. Will update as more time passes.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the excellent results I have been getting. It has a pleasant taste and is a welcome change/addition to my regular oral care routine. I have only recently learned about the benefits of activated charcoal and I decided to give it a try. This product has excellent reviews and for good reason. Excellent packaging, fast shipping and a very effective natural product with very beneficial ingredients.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This has taken away my bleeding gums, whitened my teeth, freshened my breath, and taken away the pain I had while flossing. I used to use Desert Essence Neem Toothpaste, but it did not take away my bleeding gums, and after I brushed with it, it felt as if I hadn&#x27;t really cleaned my teeth. With this, you pass your tongue over your teeth and they feel clean, and your breath smells great afterwards.    It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to clean up the charcoal on the sink, but that&#x27;s the only issue with this. And c&#x27;mon for all the benefits it gives your teeth, you can choose not to be so lazy and just clean it up. It&#x27;s worth it.    My suggestion is to put a good amount on your hand and then press the toothbrush over the powder and brush away. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be abrasive for twice a day, but we&#x27;ll see in time how it works out. I am just really happy my bleeding gums left and that I can actually floss my teeth without it hurting. I&#x27;m hoping that in time I&#x27;ll be able to remineralize my teeth as this has no glycerin or heavy layer of stuff. In the beginning it may feel as if you didn&#x27;t really clean it because it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy build of toothpaste, but in time, once you&#x27;ve yanked off all that s*** that toothpaste leaves, you&#x27;ll see that this cleans just fine. You just have to be willing to experiment and change. I was hesitant at first as I had tried so many toothpastes, and even used to clean with only ToothSoap and the Toothsoap left my teeth yellow. This leave your teeth clean and looking almost white or the natural color of your teeth. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products but after suffering so long with bleeding gums, I thought I&#x27;d help people out with my honest review. So far this is good. If it starts not being good, I&#x27;ll let ya&#x27;ll know, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, and as I&#x27;m the only one that uses it, the powder lasts me a while.    I also suggest that you don&#x27;t mix it with toothpaste. Let the powder work on its own and try eliminating toothpaste all together. I brush with the powder at night and in the morning when I just want to rush out, I&#x27;ll use healthy toothpaste, but I try not using toothpaste anymore, so that I can let the powder do it&#x27;s work. Otherwise it won&#x27;t work as effectively. I&#x27;m gonna try using this twice a day and eliminating toothpaste as perhaps it&#x27;ll work even better. Yellow from my teeth has gone down. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> All natural...I like that. It definately polishes your teeth well. Doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as other natural tooth powders I have tried, Like I said...it will polish and clean your teeth very well and the charcol and clay are supposed to absorb toxins from old mercury fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE : april 20 -&lt;br /&gt;I continue to be impressed with this product. It really shines your teeth and keeps them white. Just ordered another jar since my last one got water in it and grew mold. DO NOT allow your tooth powder to become damp or wet. Pour the powder onto your toothbrush. DO NOT put a wet toothbrush into the jar or it will mold up.</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference, you&#x27;ll get used having charcoal in your mouth!</li>
    <li> Leaves mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything positive or negative to say about this tooth powder.  It does not have any negative taste, but it is a bit messy.  Not sure what the positive impacts of using it are, but don&#x27;t feel any obvious positive affects.  Too soon for me to tell.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It whitens my teeth without using those harsh whitening strips. I was worried it would taste gross, not it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, I have been using natural toothpaste for a while now and none of it has a great flavor/taste and this falls in the same category but it is not taste and or flavor I am going for.  It is a really good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Recamended, feel like my teeth are whiter, no gunk on teeth nice and smooth</li>
    <li> great product, good taste, leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Been using for almost 2 weeks and happy with results so far.  Teeth appear a little whiter and everyday they feel clean, even hrs after I have brushed my teeth.  Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> OMG THIS PRODUCT IS MORE THAN AMAZING!SO GLAD I FOUND THIS ITS THE BEST! DO YOUR MOUTH A FAVOR AND BUY IT.</li>
    <li> Just started but I can see that my teeth look brighter. I will continue using this with Toms toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Little messy but will get your teeth white without all of the chemicals. Personally I think the best combination would be this product,  and coconut oil after you brush with this. I think they go hand in hand for best results.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery; good tasting altho a litttle messy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so neat! I&#x27;m vegan so I&#x27;m always looking to alternatives to everything on the market bc of animal testing. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now it&#x27;s like a fun experience and my teeth have never been so clean it&#x27;s like fresh from the dentist clean and they stay like that for over 24 hours it&#x27;s incredible. I even got my 11 year old brother into it heoves turning his teeth black he thinks it&#x27;s cool and tastes pretty good. I highly recommend this stuff!!;)</li>
    <li> This product takes off dead skin and allows new &amp; healthy skin to surface. Works great!</li>
    <li> It does feel like getting a cleaning but didnr help me with my sensitive gums, and since the powder is black, my teeth were getting into a dark color as well.. I&#x27;m just using limon and baking soda now, that works better</li>
    <li> So far I found this powder good to clean up stain of teeth. I don&#x27;t know how far it good for mouth as a whole. Before to buy any charcoal tooth paste/ powder please go through the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Just used for the first time, it&#x27;s messy but what do you expect? Cleans up easy.. My teeth feel really clean but no immediate whitening. I&#x27;ll update in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This tooth powder is the best I&#x27;ve used!  All ingredients are natural and feel so clean after use.  I can recommend this product to everyone&lt;br /&gt;who is not satisfied chemical packed tooth pastes.</li>
    <li> Thought it would do more in terms of whitening.  I ended up getting pure activated charcoal and using that. But, it does make teeth smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I feel the product seems very well but I had read that it was great for whitening but I find it to not be doing what I expected. I still like the product though.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth power&lt;br /&gt; My teeth feel very clean after using. I believe  in the ingredients</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother because she was complaining about how yellow her teeth were. She (and all of us in the family) have really sensitive teeth, so whitening strips or sessions at the dentist are out of the question. She told me she feels like her teeth are freshly cleaned fr the hygienist every time she brushes. For someone who doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance &amp; can&#x27;t go as frequently as she would like to, this is great! She also noticed her teeth were getting whiter so that is an all around great reaction to a great product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I haven&#x27;t noticed if my teeth are whiter, but definitely my gums feel much healthier now.  My only complaint is that so much of the product is wasted because of packaging.  The jar is messy and because you can&#x27;t dip your toothbrush in, it spills no matter what implement I use to spread it on my brush. I think some kind of a tube would work better.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE TASTE...IT&#x27;S EASY TO MIX,...AND ONLY TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT!</li>
    <li> Been using this, love it teeth are whiter, feel like a cleaning after every use. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I tried this because I just can&#x27;t stand toothpaste. Wow, what a difference. After just two weeks my teeth are whiter, and feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t understand is why I hadn&#x27;t heard of this before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a day since I bought it. I thought it would do more than it does but I am happy with the product. Polishes my teeth and leaves them white!</li>
    <li> I read on Pinterest that activate charcoal brightens and whitens teeth so I wanted to give it a try. I had a lot of gum build up that wouldn&#x27;t go away-- after the first day almost all the build up was gone. My second night of using my teeth were a shade whiter. The only down side I have found is that it is messy-- not sure if I should be sticking my toothbrush in the jar or dabbing it on like I&#x27;m doing now--- but be prepared for the powder to get everywhere. Honestly though the results are worth the mess!!</li>
    <li> OMG...I love it! My teeth are whiter and I no longer use regular toothpaste. I highly recommend. Definitely will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Yumm. I like the taste a lot. Mouth feels cleaner after using it. I think it works whitening too, even after a couple times. I just wish there was a little spoon with it so I could apply it to my tooth brush easier than dumping it and spilling some. 5 stars, real nice item.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was a bit hesitant when I first tried this product, I was worried about taste and my mouth feeling like I was eating a charcoal brick but I must say I was happily surprised. I deposit a small amount in the bottom of a disposable cup and then add my wet toothbrush to it to make it pasty enough to get it brush. I LOVE the way my teeth feel after using this - like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about 2 weeks and there has been no change.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user so it was weirdly cool to see black foam on  my teeth. I do feel the smoothness and the cleanliness after I brush my teeth with the powder. I also mixed it with the Jason toothpaste for extra clean power I guess. I have so many fillings on  my teeth and I have extreme sensitivity as well so when I read the natural  ingredient this Contained I felt compelled to try it and so far I like it! I do also hope that this helps me Remove some yellow Stains from  my teeth but I&#x27;ll  give it some time but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Like the way it makes my teeth feel.  It tastes like toothpaste without being overly sweet.</li>
    <li> Because of this Amazing product, I don’t need to buy any teeth whitener products, mouth wash, or tooth paste anymore. This the best teeth cleaner, mouth freshener, and teeth whitener I have ever had.  Plus to top it all off it literally leaves my teeth feeling clean and silky smooth ALL DAY LONG. I am CERTAIN that my mouth is so much healthier because of this product. One more note: I am not a mean person but I have a certain friend who I admire, and that person brushed and flossed their teeth faithfully (on every break we had), but the breath on this person always seemed to kick, well after I “carefully” insisted to brush with this powder, the odor of that stinky mouth went away in three days! Plus it’s been 2 WEEKS since I seen this person chewing gum, and this person always had gum in their mouth always! This person thanked me immensely for sharing this product with them. YOUR doing more than you think by saving relationships from awkward moments, AND our NOSES...... so thanks inVitamin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really works! My mouth feels cleaner and noticeably whiter after just one use. Great product.</li>
    <li> From the start of using this product my teeth felt clean, similar to when you leave the dentist after a cleaning!  they have gotten noticeably whiter in the first two weeks of using! love this!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My family is seeing a nice difference in just a few brushings.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t think it works... Kind of gross</li>
    <li> The best tooth &#x27;paste&#x27; we have found! Finally my teeth are remineralizing and whitening! I will recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Tastes really good. I moisten my toothbrush, put it back into its holder, and of course, water is off (no wasting water!). I open powder container, insert a small measuring spoon I keep near it, scoop up a tiny bit, put into my hand. Then I move wet toothbrush around my palm, then start to use it, just a tad. Then I close container. Time to start brushing! YUMMY! Then wash spoon.</li>
    <li> Seems to get your teeth suuuuuper clean.  Sometimes you will wake up in the morning feeling like your teeth are a bit slimy.  It feels squeaky clean still when brushing with this stuff.  Definitely weird to brush with black powder, but the results are pretty awesome.  Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago &amp; have used it every day since. I had a super sensitive tooth in the very back of my mouth for over a year &amp; had to brush that spot very gently due to the sensitivity &amp; pain. After using this product for only a few days, the sensitivity &amp; pain are completely gone. I am totally amazed after having the problem for so long &amp; having it healed so quickly. My teeth are also getting whiter.  Also, it is a bit messy at first, but once you use it several times it&#x27;s no longer a problem. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I like this product, makes my teeth look awesome. Only 4 stars because the flavor isnt all that great and its somewhat messy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using activated charcoal to whiten my teeth, but since I am dealing with gum issues, it seemed worth a try. When the jar of powder arrived, I&#x27;d already brushed, flossed and rinsed for the evening, but decided to shake a bit of powder out and and rub it onto my front teeth-just for laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy, does not taste bad, and rinses out pretty easily. The laugh was on me for my skepticism, because when I spat out the grey rinse water, my front teeth were easily a shade brighter and they looked slick, smooth and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have been doing to avoid a dirty looking sink and grey marks on my lips is to use this when brushing my teeth in the shower in the morning. My dry toothbrush gets a big dab of Tom&#x27;s Mango flavor toothpaste, then it is dipped into the gum powder and I brush to my heart&#x27;s content under the shower water. The powder in the jar stays dry, the mess goes down the drain and my teeth look brilliant, even after a few uses!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast I received this product. I ordered it Monday and received it Wednesday evening. I have tried it and so far I&#x27;m loving it. The only thing that I see is my teeth are a little sensitive but it may just be me. But in regards to the cleaning and whitening it incredible the difference I feel in regards to using just regular toothpaste</li>
    <li> After first using this I was shocked to see that my teeth had were whiter. I hadn&#x27;t expected that.&lt;br /&gt;Mouth feels cleaner.  Once you get past the gross appearance of a mouth coated with black stuff&lt;br /&gt;you can enjoy this in the knowledge that it&#x27;s doing your mouth and teeth a lot of good. I moisten it with&lt;br /&gt;a few drops of Biotene mouthwash before brushing because putting a charcoal covered dry toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;in the mouth isn&#x27;t a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, leaves your teeth feeling fresh. I use a waterpik to rinse.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Okay let me first say, wow love love love this product! Before purchasing this product I did an extensive review through the Amazon reviews to make sure what I was getting. Since I find people are pretty honest on Amazon about their opinions of a product, I decided the powder had enough positive reviews to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my powder on December 30th an decided to wait to give an honest review. I had read  how messy the power was an if you got it wet the possibility of mold could grow since this has no preservatives added. My solution was to take a small measuring teaspoon to scoop out a little product, wet my toothbrush, then tap on the powder over the lid. I&#x27;m able to insure I save powder an don&#x27;t allow for water in my jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this powder I noticed my teeth were a little whiter, slick an smooth just like getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, breath smelled good. Around happy!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week an three days since I&#x27;ve been using this product an I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothpaste again! My teeth are a few shades whiter, enough my husband noticed the difference. My overall gum health has improved an my breath smells good. I&#x27;m so happy with the results so far I&#x27;m looking in to other inVitamins products!</li>
    <li> Taste well. Works well. I also use it to brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by it, but my husband uses it often. It makes me want to gag. Just gets to me..yuck!</li>
    <li> My teeth and mouth feel clean but as to whitening, my tight are just a shade lighter than yellow.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  So watch out for my update! ;)  I have good feelings for this though!</li>
    <li> good stuff a little messy but good and minty &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> bought two so far, took most of the mineral spots off my kids teeth, they look very good now, and my kids do not complain at all about the taste and they call it tooth paint!! it rinses off easily, but looks like they are brushing their teeth with dirt, which they love of course, being boys!! have never felt cleaner teeth in my life!! i follow with a coconut oil teaspoon every night, and my kids love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth and gum powder ever.  I will never ever go back to using any type of commercial toothpaste.  My gums are steadily improving and my teeth are two shades brighter and polished.  Thanks In vitamin, great product.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I pull it into the top and rinse &amp; dry the top every time I uses it. Because, as I read another user&#x27;s review before my purchase, it is messy and I don&#x27;t want any mold by sticking a wet toothbrush in.  I wish it came in paste form.</li>
    <li> Good flavor. I didn&#x27;t find it to messy. I&#x27;m going to use in combination with tooth whitening and remineralization. Charcoal gets my teeth and tounge very clean</li>
    <li> No instant results and will have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> Works well and natural but it is very messy to work with it. So I do not use it on a daily base.</li>
    <li> awesome to use when you don&#x27;t have dental insurance and you need to take care of your teeth. Polished smooth, brighter whiter and no tartar build up either....just awesome!</li>
    <li> This is worthless, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This thing really whitens your teeth its amaing</li>
    <li> I am still using this. I do like it but I think I would buy a powder tooth product that was white next time. I had no idea I would get in such a mess and splash all the walls with this! ha. However, that said, it cleans the teeth well and you KNOW it&#x27;s natural which is a comfort. No fluoride rubbish.</li>
    <li> Great quality tooth powder.</li>
    <li> I ordered this tooth powder on my sister&#x27;s advice not sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. It has a decent taste but more than that, once I am done brushing, my teeth feel polished. It is like getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist right at home. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This STUFF--you gotta try it! I never thought that using something like CHARCOAL (and other natural ingredients, read the list) would work so well to clean my teeth, get rid of tartar and plaque build up over time, and just feel so darn good. This stuff is wonderful--messy, yes. Don&#x27;t get dressed before brushing your teeth, LOL. Oh, and don&#x27;t use white washcloths!!! haha. I had to use commercial toothpaste once after using this powder for a month, and wow, I can&#x27;t believe I used to put that stuff in my mouth--so harsh and full of nasty chemicals that you can really taste and feel after using this powder. Also, the commercial toothpaste seems to ENCOURAGE tartar and plaque buildup. The activated charcoal powder does not do that--teeth feel amazingly clean throughout the day. I keep an extra toothbrush with me just to scrape the buildup off my teeth a little later in the day, but otherwise, my mouth just FEELS FRESH almost all the time now. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My feels cleaner than when I&#x27;ve ever cleaned my teeth with toothpaste.</li>
    <li> A huge and very noticeable difference in my smile. also I no longer suffer from tooth sensitivity as much as I used to.</li>
    <li> Used it 3x and like it a lot! Not a strong flavor, but can see a difference in the whiting already! Looking forward to see how white my teeth get!</li>
    <li> I wanted to do something new and tried this out instead of conventional crest and colgate. I honestly can say I am happy with this purchase. I still feel fresh and clean after brushing well when coupled with proper brushing practices. I gave this piece a four star because it isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as I was hoping, but still good enough to purchase and keep using.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had a canker sore when this arrived in the mail so I used it right away. The sore went away very quickly. I also discovered that this product destroys pimples. I just mix it with a bit of water and use it as a mask; it can be drying so follow with a good moisturizer.  The powder is very messy and does have to handled with care or you will have black powder everywhere.</li>
    <li> Works for me for the gum sensitivity, teeth whitening and fresh breath</li>
    <li> I like how clean my mouth and teeth feel after using this.  I notice whitening too, but not sure if it does as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> Havnt used it that long but i love the polishing effect this has on my teeth when done. If you dont mind your teeth looking black for a few seconds then this is a great product. Cant wait to see how this works in the long run for the health of my gums and teeth. Doesnt take a a lot either, so event though it is a small jar, it will last a while. Just takes a dab of it.</li>
    <li> Very good , great ingredients</li>
    <li> I had my reservations about this item but after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  The price is right so I would not lose much if I did not like it.  WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW I cannot believe how clean my teeth look and much lighter.  I am very much into oral hygiene always taking very good care of my teeth but I wanted my teeth to look lighter and brighter without having the dreaded blue look I see on some people who get their teeth professionally whitened.  Also the price is steep.  The product is a bit messy but what I do is I shake powder into a demitasse cup and I have enough for three or four uses.  The rest stays in the jar nice and dry so that it does not develop mold.  I dip my toothbrush in the powder and start brushing away.  You will have to really rinse your mouth since your teeth will look black but when you take the Charcoal off you will feel and see the difference. I do this in the AM and in the PM.  This is my second day using this to brush my teeth and I can see the difference already.  I am so amazed and happy with this product I already ordered another jar.  I always like to have a back up so I do not run out totally of an item I like.  After I rinse I brush my teeth with regular toothpaste again just to make sure the film on the tongue and the roof of the mouth is brushed away thus keeping the bad breath away.  Love this product.  A little messy inconveniernce but the results are totally worth it.</li>
    <li> It works well, keeps teeth clean - but I find the flavors end up tasting a bit like licorice (not a licorice fan). I also found it wasn&#x27;t great for my breath without also using a rinse.</li>
    <li> Gums feel alot better after using. Bit on the messy side while using but worth it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a mess. BUT I like it, leaves my teeth clean and you can feel the difference. I use it every other day now and will keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite messy but worth it.</li>
    <li> The things we do for a brighter smile! I decided to try this and received it a few days ago. My first time trying, I carefully tried to dump it on my already wet toothbrush and my sink looked like I just came off a 12 hour shift from deep in the coal mines. The actual brushing wasn&#x27;t bad, a little dry at first but that went away quickly. After a minute or two I was done brushing and well, went into shock as everything I spit out looked like pond water. I felt like one of &amp;#34;The Walking Dead&amp;#34; gang that drank out of a mud puddle or something. BUT, after 3 days and getting used to it, I love this product, and in all seriousness can see a difference already.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth with this! It&#x27;s a little strange at first, but you get used to it and it makes my mouth feel very clean with the harshness of commercial toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make teeth as white as anticipated, however, I can see  a difference. Feels amazingly clean, like after dentist cleanings. Have ordered more than 1 time.</li>
    <li> Works well but is very messy.</li>
    <li> It worked a little bit.</li>
    <li> Does all that it claims  highly recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I originally purchased a more expensive brand, and thought that I would try this out to save some money.  It feels and works nothing like the other brand I used.  The powder is very thin feeling compared to the other brand that I tried, and it also has a strange taste.  I really wanted to like this product so I could save some money versus the other, but instead I ended up wasting money because it is just sitting in my bathroom cabinet, not being used.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s all I will use for my family and recommend to clients:-)</li>
    <li> Recently I saw something on Pinterest about how activated charcoal whitens teeth.  I was a bit skeptical about the before and after photos people were showing but I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This stuff does as good of a job as any whitening strip you&#x27;d buy at the grocery store but it doesn&#x27;t cause gum irritation or tooth sensitivity.  Plus it is so much more reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this bottle will last forever...well maybe not forever but probably a few years.</li>
    <li> When I found this product, I was already considering making my own tooth powder and decided to try this version first.  The combination of natural ingredients intrigued me, having heard of them but never used them.  Prior to this, I was using my own concoction made with baking soda, but I didn&#x27;t find it to do a better job than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  It took a few tries before coming to the least messy brushing routine, but the results have been very impressive.  Firstly, I&#x27;ll address the amount by saying I now use a 1/8 size teaspoon measure which I keep with the jar, pour it into the palm of my hand, and mix into a paste with a wet toothbrush. For me, that&#x27;s enough to reload the brush a second time.  The unusual flavor/fragrance is very green, earthy and fresh smelling, and the stevia leaf powder adds a slightly sweet taste. A few days before I started using  it, I had just scaled my teeth and so I was interested in how long it would be before I noticed any plaque reappearing.  Now having used it for nearly three weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed none!  Nada!  Zero!  In addition, I&#x27;ve discovered that after rinsing, if I don&#x27;t brush my tongue of any remaining powder, it will absorb and remove any whitish paste, leaving  fresh breath, and tongue and gums a beautiful, healthy pink, so no tongue brushing or scraping is necessary either!  I&#x27;ll admit that I was in search of a natural tooth whitener and I have noticed an improvement but I think that&#x27;s subjective. The antimicrobial ingredients, combined with the absorption nature of the charcoal, have won me over completely - the whitening effect is a bonus.  This product will be all I ever use from here on.  If oral health is your goal, and you&#x27;re looking for a powerful, natural alternative, keep an open mind and give it a reasonable trial period, and I believe you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
    <li> You only need a dime-sized amount of this powder, and a few drops of water. I use my Soft Bamboo Charcoal Tooth )Brush to mix it into a past (in the palm of my hand, and thoroughly brush my teeth. Rinse/gargle thoroughly with cool water rinse, until any tiny grains of the paste are rinsed away. Your mouth and breath will feel naturally fresh and clean, and it does not stain your mouth or teeth. Just rinse well, and you&#x27;re all set. The container states that you can get 175 brushes from this jar; however, I would say that is an underestimate. I would at least double, and possibly even triple that number, depending on the amount of powder you use daily. A great natural product that I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for teeth whitening purposes, but I did not see a noticeable difference with using this. I have been a smoker &amp; coffee drinker for about 8 years, and it shows.....was hoping this would help, but to no avail. BUT, it does leave your teeth feeling incredibly smooth and clean feeling, so it does have it&#x27;s advantages. I put this on my toothbrush, put a small amount of water in my mouth, and start brushing (yes, it will look scary...don&#x27;t worry, it rinses out, lol). After I have rinsed this from my mouth after brushing, I then follow up with regular toothpaste, just because the activated charcoal doesn&#x27;t have a toothpaste taste, and because it stains your tongue black..so it has to be brushed away.</li>
    <li> Amazing! A+&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from constant canker sores , sodium laurel sulfate is in most commercial toothpastes and it is known to cause them along with other problems.  So I decided to switch! In love!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for .....an all-natural, safe whitening tooth powder. Works great, whitens my smile and I feel good about the ingredients. Thinking I need to check in to more of inVitamin&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Super messy when trying to get onto the tooth brush and while brushing - BUT, I really think my teeth are cleaner and whiter after using it for a week.</li>
    <li> I like it. It makes your teeth whiter. It&#x27;s very messy you need a small spoon or something to put it on your toothbrush. I tried to slowly poor some in my hand and half the container went in the sink and everywhere.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.. I love it..will purchase again !</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I actually added it to my homemade coconut oil toothpaste and it solved the bakingsoda flavor, and my mouth still tastes fresh afterwards even though i&#x27;m not using a minty foamy toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Immediately noticed brighter and whiter teeth. It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything to me. Absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes, messy, use your hand, like others have recommended, however, it does clean the teeth , rather like a polishing, it will take time to see how this works out, but it did remove coffee stains! gum health will again take time to see, no bad taste either, so I plan to stick with it and see how it works out over time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not overly gritty when brushing and leaves you with a light flavor of cinnamon unlike toothpastes which are over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Does make teeth black while brushing (obviously) and you have to rinse a bit more and make a habit to clean the sink after brushing very well. However overall excellent alternative to toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have tried it but not often. I like how it made my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much. In just a week I have seen improvement in my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering two more for gifts!</li>
    <li> Charcoal whitens teeth. Be careful not to use too heavily as it can irritate the gums though.</li>
    <li> Really great.  Teeth feel clean</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this product at first, but after I tried it once, I knew I would be switching from my old toothpaste to this one!&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me a lot of the polish they use at the dentist, which takes a bit of getting used to, but once you see how it polishes your teeth, you almost don&#x27;t want to stop brushing! Leaves your teeth with that smooth, shiny &#x27;after dentist&#x27; feeling!</li>
    <li> Wow. A friend recommended this to me, and I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people that never goes to the dentist, and I&#x27;m doing everything I can to bide my time until the inevitable day when I must make an emergency trip to have something done.&lt;br /&gt;I have gingivitis as a result, a discolor ing from antibiotics as a child, and I have a hard time keeping my mouth feeling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this earlier this week. I brush with sensodyne pro amen, and then dip the brush in the charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it tastes gross. I don&#x27;t think that can be avoided. The texture is strange too.&lt;br /&gt;However, the results are stunning.&lt;br /&gt;Fou days later, no more gums bleeding. My teeth feel polished, and my friend who recommended this to me asked me yesterday if i ever started using it because my teeth look whiter (I haven&#x27;t noticed this myself, and figured it would take longer to see noticeable results.)&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I will still have that inevitable dentist trip, and it would be great if I could finally get a good dental plan to get some major maintenance done like normal people thanks Obama (just kidding).&lt;br /&gt;Also, like others posted, this product is very messy to use, tastes nasty and has a strange texture....but it most definitely works way better than brand name products.</li>
    <li> everything was on time &amp;excellent product  5 stars</li>
    <li> Used this product 3 times and already notice the difference. Would recomment</li>
    <li> I love this powder, I notice a difference the first time I used it. I&#x27;m a smoker and it cleaned by teeth really well. My teeth are pretty white except from staining in between on the bottom and this powder removed them quickly. I just place some of the charcoal in my hand dip a wet toothbrush in it and start brushing. Highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Not as messy as if you bought just activated charcoal. This tooth powder has a great taste as well. Simply dampen your toothbrush, dip it into the powder, and brush.</li>
    <li> Makes my whole mouth clean all day!</li>
    <li> Healthier alternative to traditional toothpaste, but it&#x27;s messy!</li>
    <li> The best product ever</li>
    <li> Looking forward to trying this product. Received promptly</li>
    <li> Just received mine in the mail .. Is it supposed to be sealed ?? Mine only came with a sticker on the side.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC product! Really does the job......the whitening power is hard to believe.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super legit! I have tried so many different tooth pastes and this stuff is fabulous. My family consists of me &#x3D;) a 29 week pregnant 26 year old female, a 29 year old husband and an 8 year old daughter. We have all used it and it makes your teeth feel clean. Using traditional toothpaste for years because of not knowing about this has made me very upset. When using traditional tooth paste my teeth never felt &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; they always felt gunky and especially after eating and even immediately brushing my teeth afterwards. I also floss my teeth a lot and with using this, it feels like I have no need to floss. My teeth are whiter, smoother and it gets rid of my morning breath better than the minty poop. I have super sensitive teeth and this stuff has been great for that even. I take my wet tooth brush, then dip a dry q-tip into the charcoal (with a nice little clump) and put it on my tooth brush and I&#x27;m good to go! It doesn&#x27;t really have a taste to it in my opinion, but it makes your bad breath go away. Watch out to not get it on your clothes when brushing your teeth, it will come out , it&#x27;s just a pain!</li>
    <li> Definitely did not believe this would work as well as it did! I drink coffee in the morning and unsweetened tea most days. After two uses, noticeable improvement, even my husband noticed. I am very happy with this product and telling everyone about it. Still hard to believe it works this well. Main thing is to be extremely careful not to let moisture get in the container. Also when you put on toothbrush, hold directly over sink drain, very messy but 100% worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about twice a week in place of my Earthpaste and I can definitely see a difference in the brightness of my teeth when I do. While I wouldn&#x27;t only use this to clean my teeth, it&#x27;s a great addition to keep them sparkly white. My daughters have both used it before prom/special events and commented on how much cleaner their teeth looked. It is a little messy, but so is EarthPaste so no biggie, just be careful or get dressed after you brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this! I bought it because I have &#x27;geographic tongue&#x27; and most toothpastes and mouthwashes really irritate it. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before and it leaves my teeth feeling really clean. I use it mostly with a little bit of natural toothpaste, have been using it for a month or so and no more bleeding gums when I floss. Will definitely purchase again but this will last a LONG time. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my teeth look the same , still waiting to see whiter teeth .</li>
    <li> Use it weekly with some other natural tooth paste I have. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this blend, it leaves my mouth cleaner and  fresher longer. It has also whitened my teeth by 2-3 shades. I have purchased it twice and will continue purchasing it. I mix this with organic coconut to avoid the possible mess than can occur using in powder form. The coconut allows me to make a paste. Also coconut oil is healthy for your gums and tastes good. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with a better application meghod</li>
    <li> Would be awesome if it wasn&#x27;t so sweet.</li>
    <li> I use it for making a face mask and I can tell it helps my pores a lot!</li>
    <li> Great, will be ordering more soon. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> I started use few months ago. At the beginning no great deal, but when time go on is hard come back to your regular toothpaste. Great sensation of fresh and cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is messy to use and makes my teeth look black until I rinse it off, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Seems like it actually has a whitening effect over all.  The taste is pleasant and it leaves my teeth feeling really clean afterwards.  It makes an awful mess in the sink when I spit it out, but I keep a sponge handy and wipe out the sink after each brushing.  Often some of the black paste is still visible between my teeth until I floss to get it all out.  Make sure to read the instructions and don&#x27;t dip your toothbrush into the jar.  What I do is keep a plastic spoon by the jar to dip out a little into the palm of my hand, then dip the wet toothbrush into my hand.  I read somewhere that activated charcoal should not come in contact with metal, so that&#x27;s why I use a plastic spoon instead.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of natural toothpastes and even experimented with making my own, looking for the perfect one to address my particular dental issues.  It turns out this one is the perfect one for me.</li>
    <li> takes away tea/coffee stains like a professional cleaning, leaves teeth squeaky clean</li>
    <li> Messy but leaves teeth feeling very clean.  Not sure if prolonged use would leave mouth feeling fresh.  I keep reaching for the toothpaste for every other brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to admit, trying a natural tooth powder was a different experience. I&#x27;ve used Crest or Colgate toothpaste my whole life and the biggest adjustment was that this tooth powder doesn&#x27;t &#x27;foam&#x27; - which takes getting used to.  What I&#x27;ve experimented around with is after I brush with the tooth powder, I&#x27;ll take a swig of Spry Oral Rinse (cool mint is my favorite). That seems to accomplish both the goals I&#x27;m personally looking for: using a natural tooth powder but still having a clean feeling in my mouth similar to conventional toothpaste. I like the organic ingredients in this product. I&#x27;ve found that it is unique in that perspective. With this tooth powder, spry mouth rinse, I&#x27;ve found a great solution. Great product! And very nicely packaged. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Whitens brightens polishes and cleans. Has not made my sensitive gums hurt. In fact Id say its actually lessened the pain of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Messy. Will get stuck in some crevices be it on your bathroom surfaces or even in your mouth. Wipes off and a quick rinse of the mouth with some toms mouthwash took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain about anything it would be that despite my mouth feeling clean....it lacks the minty flavor and fresh breath feeling regular toothpaste gives HOWEVER thats fixed with the gargle n swish of mouthwash that Ill be doing anyways so its not a big deal. So far (3 uses) Im liking it alot.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a more zerowaste option this seems to work well in place of toothpaste. I have only used it once so far. You do need to make sure that you rise out your mouth well or you will have black outlines between your teeth. The bummer for me was that it was mailed in a plastic bubble wrap envelope. I do wish it had been sent in a more eco friendly package. I do understand that since it is a glass container it may be easier to send this way.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, tastes great, leave mouth feeling 20x cleaner than toothpaste chemically feeling. not sure if this is the best in the category as it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried, so I will reserve that determination until doing further testing with some other products, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> This works well and tastes fine. It&#x27;s strange having black in your mouth. My teeth are pretty white so I don&#x27;t see a big difference but I like it</li>
    <li> Initially, I gave this product three out of five stars. I am modifying that as I believe this is whitening my teeth. However, the method I have seen success with is not brushing and spitting but rather pouring a bit into my mouth and using saliva to make a paste. After this paste is made, I let the product sit on my teeth for approx. 10 minutes. Activated charcoal is known to soak up and draw out impurities so perhaps this method is reasoned and not just my imagination.  The method of brushing did little to nothing but I believe this paste method is producing result.  YMMV</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This product is great! It has a slight sweetness to it and once done, your teeth feel smooth and CLEAN. Will continue to buy and use. Goodbye toothpaste!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> very messy--it is after all activated charcoal! but it really does clean my mouth and whiten my teeth wonderfully--my daughter-in-law tried it as well and loves it.  She said after using it her teeth felt like she had just gotten them professionally cleaned--and they were whiter then she had ever seen them.&lt;br /&gt;I only use the charcoal powder once or twice a week as an adjunct to a healthy dental regime I have been using for over a year now of a coconut oil pull once a day, and brushing with baking soda tooth powder twice a day instead of traditional toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Product was shipped right away. First time using this type of tooth powder, it is different from using toothpaste. I am loving the way it cleans</li>
    <li> Awful texture  - took an minute to get use to...so did the taste.  Awkward to put on to the toothbrush without having to just dip it in to the container....BUT!  It took my fiance&#x27;s bad breath away almost immediately!  will order again.  ps.  Super messy!</li>
    <li> white teeth , healed gingivitis! is this real ?</li>
    <li> Although this is very messy when brushing your teeth, it does come through as being a great product! High gloss on teeth after the first use, I will continue to see if I notice a big difference in the removal of staining. I have noticed some. I use this product twice a day and hsve done so, for a 5 days now.</li>
    <li> I saw a few people raving about this stuff on Pinterest, and I honestly thought I was just going to be wasting my money on another hyped up product. But since I am obsessed with my teeth, I decided it was worth a try either way. IT WORKS SO WELL! Seriously, it was like magic. I&#x27;ve tried whitening products in the past, and all of those are expensive and take multiple weeks to see results, but this stuff literally takes like 5 minutes of leaving on your teeth and it removes all those tea/coffee stains. Way cheaper and faster results than what I was used to! Also, this stuff left my teeth feeling very polished and smooth, unlike using my regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI though… DO NOT SWALLOW!!! I repeat, DO NOT SWALLOW! Lol, it will give you crazy diarrhea! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth powder I&#x27;ve tried thus far. It is very gentle but does a good job of removing stains and keeps the plaque at bay.I use the end of a Popsicle stick to measure a small amount and put it in the palm of my hand then dip the damp toothbrush into it about 5 or 6 times during my brushing session.With the amount required for a good brushing this jar should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Great. Arrived promptly. The taste isn&#x27;t bad, not great but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Tastes like the smell of a headship :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took the stains off my teeth, yay! I can&#x27;t really tell if its whitening my teeth any. Its definitely helped with my breath which was the main reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a star because of the packaging. A jar, not best for application on a toothbrush. Especially a powder to wet brush situation... Can&#x27;t dip it, can&#x27;t sprinkle it. I put some powder on the lid and do my best to scoop it with my brush but it leaves goopy chunks on the lid that need to be cleaned off before resealing the jar.</li>
    <li> Convenient bulk/loose powder form. performs as expected. Great stuff with a million uses!</li>
    <li> I just finished brushing my teeth with this and am so impressed! My teeth are very noticeably whiter and feel so clean when I touch them with my tongue! This is absolutely a wonderful product! I am very satisfied with the level of care it provides, as I lost dental insurance and am trying to take optimal care if my teeth on my own! It seems silly to think of ever using even natural, fluoride free toothpaste again! Also, the company provides a page full of information and directions on how to use this, which I found interesting and helpful! Clay minerals and charcoal work magic!</li>
    <li> Awesome made my teeth super white!!!! will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> This seems to work. Its not a brilliant instant whitener that will make your teeth ultra clean, but it has a noticeable effect after some use.</li>
    <li> Black Magic? I don&#x27;t understand how this is working so well ?!?!?~ I ended up using an old pumpkin pie spice container to apply to my wet tooth brush. I just tilt and tap it to apply. After the FIRST use I noticed my teeth are whiter, cleaner, shiny- it just KEEPS WORKING better?!?! Bleachy whitening products hurt my gums and make my teeth sting. This is crazy good stuff man.. I&#x27;m confused &amp; happy</li>
    <li> First and most importantly, this is an excellent product to brush with.  It takes some getting used to, but it really works and my teeth have not felt cleaner.  However, I have to give it 4 stars, but it really needs a better delivery system.  I use this every time I brush.  I use this with my kids every night they brush.  Every single time we use it, product is wasted and a mess is made.  I tried many ways.  Using a spoon, putting a little in my hand etc.  Always product is wasted.  So I am thinking, there has to be a better way than just putting this stuff in an open jar.  What about having a removable plastic top with a small sliding opening on top of the jar so that you could shake a little on?  I would pay for the extra packaging.</li>
    <li> used this for about 3weeks as instructed and I didn&#x27;t see any whitening change but I did notice that my teeth were polished. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Rcvd today so of course I had to try ASAP!  Can&#x27;t tell yet if the pearls are whiter but I can tell you this, my teeth feel so clean and amazing!  Such a nice fresh taste also.  Which, I have to tell you, I was skeptical about.  Fast forward several hours later and teeth still feel clean after eating dinner and cashews.</li>
    <li> Hard to use... And wash off</li>
    <li> This product not only makes your teeth feel great, it is fun to use!  Just look in the mirror while you&#x27;re brushing...wow!  But seriously, this is a nice, tooth powder that leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.  I was worried that going from a prescription toothpaste for sensitive teeth to this that my teeth would be extremely sensitive. I have had no problem with sensitivity.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  It is so much nicer than using plain graphite powder.  It has helped clean and whiten my teeth and I have only been using once or twice  a week.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it tastes great! It really makes my mouth feel clean and I can tell a difference in the brightness of my teeth immediately! I sometimes mix it with my toothpaste too for a little extra scrub action!:)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite by far with taste and my breath smells fresh for a long time afterwards. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product, but it does have other ingredients. I just purchased the charcoal powder and hope it works even better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Monday I received the product Thursday I use the product and the results were more than I expected my teeth were smooth and shiny the best part is my husband who never uses anything but toothpaste and mouthwash he smokes he drinks he doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance his teeth were clear grey and yellow his gums were sore he used the product after the first use his teeth had a white coat on top of them he was astounded he said he is surprised this stuff is not mega sell out everyday he uses this product if he is so amazed he is constantly looking in the mirror looking in the mirror while he is driving because his teeth look that good we can&#x27;t wait to go back to my dentist just so they can see the results it&#x27;s amazing I never wrote a review you can check this website I&#x27;m writing the review not because of my pleasure but because of secondhand pleasure for my husband how he loves this product</li>
    <li> shipping was pretty fast, packaging was good, product is great. will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Stil getting used to this powder. It does make my breath fresher. Only issue I have is applying it to my toothbrush. It&#x27;s a little messy at first. I don&#x27;t dip my brush in the jar to prevent any mold that might occur on the powder. But other than that, it&#x27;s a really good product. I just have to figure out how to not waste so much powder.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this more than I do, but for me it&#x27;s a textural thing. It DOES make my teeth feel super clean though, so in that respect it totally works!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as it says, but it helps. If you want to see fast results don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Container arrived broken so I had to put the powder in another container. Works well and makes your teeth feel nice and clean, but tends to make a mess of your sink. Just be prepared to clean your sink a lot if you use this stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is a good product if you are very careful about brushing your teeth and application of powder to toothbrush.  Since it is not sanitary to dip a toothbrush in with the product I transferred it over to a container that was easier for application.  But it still just makes a mess.  Very hard to control powder and since the powder is black it gets everywhere and is hard to clean.  I feel like it takes a lot longer to rinse my mouth of the black powder as well.  It is a shame because the product really does feel like a good natural cleaning product and the ingredients are all great for a healthy clean mouth... but it is just too messy with the charcoal.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting use to but I&#x27;m still testing it out to see if it actually whitens.</li>
    <li> Will keep your teeth shiny and clean . I would not use it more than twice a week . It is very strong . very good product .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I didnt use it all, but they say it works.  I&#x27;d give it a try if I were you.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Makes my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just been polished by the dentist. I love the way it feels as I brush my teeth I feel like I can feel it pulling out stains and polishing like when you put wax on a car. My teeth went down a shade in color in the first week. Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling like it got blasted out with mint. So sometimes I wonder if my mouth doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh as it could. So I just use gum. Breath itself is great, just not &amp;#34;super blasted minty fresh&amp;#34; like with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Good product with a great taste.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, yes, can be messy, but once you get the hang of using it, the cleanliness of your mouth makes it worthwhile! And to top it all off, it really does whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product. It can be messy so use a touch of toothpaste and it will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I like it! I pour just enough in a little dish or the palm of my hand along with the damp toothbrush. #Bam #Satisfied</li>
    <li> I can feel the clean on my teeth after using</li>
    <li> whitens, heals gums, and leaves my teeth squeaky clean. Will continue to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend rubbing on your teeth and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes before rinsing out. It&#x27;s gritty, yes, but it whiten&#x27;s just as good as crest strips. The activated charcoal is the magic ingredient, so much healthier than chemicals!</li>
    <li> I really like the product&#x27;s taste, and it seems to work for cleaning my teeth. It is a bit difficult to use, as it does make a mess. No matter how carefully I use it, I end up with a lot of black that I have to remove from my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as its efficacy, the jury is still out on that one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good does give you results I recommend you use it in the shower it&#x27;s less of a mess</li>
</ol>
