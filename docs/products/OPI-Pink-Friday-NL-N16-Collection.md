      <li>I Love nicki</li>
      <li>I receive so many compliments when I wear it, which shocks me because it has been out for a while.</li>
      <li>I love Nicki Minaj OPI collection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect, not too bright nor too pale.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing the color right now, and I love it!</li>
      <li>I saw youtube videos describing this as a perfect pink.</li>
      <li>Pink Friday a beautiful pastel bubblegum pink cream nail polish great for spring and summer with a great tan thank you.</li>
      <li>It has a nice resistance to chipping, after a week I had minor wear around the edges, just be sure to have a good top coat.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is the perfect pink!</li>
      <li>it drys really quick to its amazing and true to its word</li>
      <li>, I thought the color looked super cute online.</li>
      <li>I loved it, Pink Friday is one of my favorite nail polishes!</li>
      <li>I was so thrilled when it came and saw that it was real</li>
      <li>OPI is one of my all-time favorite brands due to long-lasting wear, great coverage and resistance to chipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the bright, bold pink that I associate with Nicki Minaj, but it&#x27;s really nice anyway.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful, light baby pink</li>
      <li>But, the color did fade significantly after a couple of days.</li>
      <li>Okay at first when I bought the Nicki Minaj OPI</li>
      <li>I enjoy having an array of pink polish, and this is a great color that isn&#x27;t duplicated often.</li>
      <li>glides on smoothly and very very pretty color</li>
      <li>Not to bright and not to soft, Just right.</li>
      <li>love this color and fast shipping</li>
      <li>However, it is my luck with OPI that some bottles have a perfect formula and some are way too thick and streaky and don&#x27;t spread well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice cool, blue toned pink and works great in winter or summer.</li>
      <li>It is soooo pretty; men and women alike have complimented me on it!</li>
      <li>Love this color beautiful cotton candy pink if you are familiar with Nicki Minaj&#x27;s pink friday lipstick she has with M.A.C</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>its very streaky and it fades super quick.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty but roll the nail polish, and do yourself a huge favor, double coat and top coat.</li>
      <li>Glides on smoothly, stays on longer, and the shade of pink is strong enough to show well with all your summer clothes, yet not glittery and cheap looking; actually a soft sheen of the perfect shade of pink.  </li>
      <li>Pink Friday the PERFECT color shade of pink for the summer.  </li>
      <li>Very cute bubble gum pink color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth creme that required only two coats for full opacity.</li>
      <li>I will purchase more of this color; this will be a standard in my collection; and yes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still pretty but faded.</li>
      <li>You need to use a few coats to make it look good, not one of my faves but can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
      <li>Remember, all other nail shops sterilize their instruments, but why would you use a polish off the wall of any salon, no matter how clean, that has had the brush touch HOW MANY NAILS?????</li>
      <li>mostly I do two coats just to be safe, but this really is a adorable pink in between a bubblegum, and a basic light pink.</li>
      <li>Some nail polish&#x27;s that don&#x27;t have glitter can sometimes be very streaky.</li>
      <li>I love pink</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very streaky and even after two coats.</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t even look to pink but more of a salmon color..</li>
      <li>I love this shade of pink.</li>
      <li>This is such a gorgeous shade of bubblegum pink.</li>
      <li>i love this pink!</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to use a polish thinner on a brand new bottle of polish!</li>
      <li>I bought it on Amazon, and I felt the price was decent.</li>
      <li>the brush is easy for me to use, although a little wide for some toenails, the formula stays on my nails, and the colors are very pretty and generally get compliments.</li>
      <li>I put it in my 6 year old&#x27;s polish pile, I won&#x27;t be wearing it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty baby pink.</li>
      <li>It looks a hot mess just like Nikki Minaj.</li>
      <li>So i bought Super Bass Shatter, Pink Friday, and Save Me, to recreate a swatch i saw online.</li>
      <li>I like wearing polish that is shiny and pigmented and interests other people, and this pretty pink definitely falls into that category!</li>
      <li>before cause the nail polish seemed a little thick, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>

    <li> If you are an OPI lover and user as I am, you will fid this OPI Pink Friday the PERFECT color shade of pink for the summer.  Glides on smoothly, stays on longer, and the shade of pink is strong enough to show well with all your summer clothes, yet not glittery and cheap looking; actually a soft sheen of the perfect shade of pink.  I will purchase more of this color; this will be a standard in my collection; and yes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring my OWN polish to the nail salons, always!  Everyone should! Remember, all other nail shops sterilize their instruments, but why would you use a polish off the wall of any salon, no matter how clean, that has had the brush touch HOW MANY NAILS????? Think on that one!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item here as I couldnt find it in stores. I saw youtube videos describing this as a perfect pink. And it is!! But the product was old and thick. It streaked horribly. My nails looked terrible.What a mess,what a waste!!</li>
    <li> glides on smoothly and very very pretty color it drys really quick to its amazing and true to its word</li>
    <li> I loved it, Pink Friday is one of my favorite nail polishes! I was very satisfied with this product. Might order more.</li>
    <li> It came in on time and in good condition. However, it did seem like it was useds before cause the nail polish seemed a little thick, but it&#x27;s okay. Good thing my mom is a nail technician and I can get some polish thinner. Great buy! I love Nicki Minaj OPI collection.</li>
    <li> my husband love this polish on me.Nice spring time summer color. love it.I never wear pink but i really love this one. this color is really light not to bright.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this color in the local stores, but nobody seemed to carry it. I bought it on Amazon, and I felt the price was decent. I&#x27;m wearing the color right now, and I love it! It&#x27;s the pink I&#x27;ve always been looking for!</li>
    <li> You need to use a few coats to make it look good, not one of my faves but can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> This polish was very weird. It reminds me of pink white out. It&#x27;s very streaky and even after two coats. I just can&#x27;t get this polish to look good. I put it in my 6 year old&#x27;s polish pile, I won&#x27;t be wearing it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of pink. I get a lot of compliments on the shade. Not to bright and not to soft, Just right.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite color to get in the nail salon so I decided to just buy it so I can do my own touch ups at home.  I receive so many compliments when I wear it, which shocks me because it has been out for a while.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is the perfect pink! Also, it wasn&#x27;t chunky and it was the correct color. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite OPI colors.  I like it so much I am sure that they will discontinue it so I am going to stock up.</li>
    <li> I adore this sexy girly color! It is soooo pretty; men and women alike have complimented me on it! OPI is one of my all-time favorite brands due to long-lasting wear, great coverage and resistance to chipping.</li>
    <li> This color works in winter and in summer. It lasts even on my manicure. Would buy again! I like to look good and OPI is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Love this color beautiful cotton candy pink if you are familiar with Nicki Minaj&#x27;s pink friday lipstick she has with M.A.C this is the twin in nail polish form...I get loads of compliments when I wear it and it looks great on all skin types.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! This is one of my all time favorite OPI colors! You do need 2 coats but I do that any ways.</li>
    <li> Love this color! mostly I do two coats just to be safe, but this really is a adorable pink in between a bubblegum, and a basic light pink. love it!</li>
    <li> Opi is known to not chip. This polish chipped after 2 days and I&#x27;m lead to believe it is fake and not authentic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty baby pink. I got tons of compliment on it. It&#x27;s perfect, not too bright nor too pale. It compliments your skin tone (I&#x27;m Asian)</li>
    <li> This is such a gorgeous shade of bubblegum pink. It&#x27;s not the bright, bold pink that I associate with Nicki Minaj, but it&#x27;s really nice anyway. It&#x27;s a smooth creme that required only two coats for full opacity. However, it is my luck with OPI that some bottles have a perfect formula and some are way too thick and streaky and don&#x27;t spread well. Unfortunately, Pink Friday was the latter. It was goopy and I had ugly brush marks and thin spots in the polish. I shouldn&#x27;t have to use a polish thinner on a brand new bottle of polish! Hopefully yours won&#x27;t have the same problems.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for this polish and finally found it here! At first i was skeptical in buying this polish because i thought it would be a fake since it&#x27;s scarce. I was so thrilled when it came and saw that it was real (trust me i know real from fake). Shipping was quick, and the polish came in good condition. Kudos to the seller.</li>
    <li> i love this pink! I&#x27;ve said in reviews before why I personally like OPI: the brush is easy for me to use, although a little wide for some toenails, the formula stays on my nails, and the colors are very pretty and generally get compliments. I like wearing polish that is shiny and pigmented and interests other people, and this pretty pink definitely falls into that category!</li>
    <li> Very cute bubble gum pink color! Looks great on every skin tone! I Love nicki Minaj Nice polish love it!!!</li>
    <li> So i bought Super Bass Shatter, Pink Friday, and Save Me, to recreate a swatch i saw online. when i tried it on myself it looked like someone threw up pink, purple, and glitter on my nails...it looked great in the blog i saw...but not on me. maybe if i practiced more, i might like it. idk.</li>
    <li> I think there is something wrong with the consistency of this nail polish. I own bunch of OPI nail polishes and this one can&#x27;t seem to treat me well. It looks a hot mess just like Nikki Minaj. LOL I love the color, its beautiful. I just don&#x27;t like how it applies on my nail.</li>
    <li> Honestly I want to throw it away.. Some how I find the nail polish streaky/watery.... The color doesn&#x27;t even look to pink but more of a salmon color..</li>
    <li> Again another OPI, and it&#x27;s my girl Nicki Minaj pink Friday nail polish! I love her polish it&#x27;s a beautiful, light baby pink I love pink that&#x27;s my favorite favorite color! This is the best polish!I love Nicki Minaj Polish, lipstick, lip gloss!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Pink Friday a beautiful pastel bubblegum pink cream nail polish great for spring and summer with a great tan thank you.</li>
    <li> The color was brighter than the one used on me in the salon. But, the color did fade significantly after a couple of days. Still pretty but faded.</li>
    <li> love this color and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Okay at first when I bought the Nicki Minaj OPI Pink Friday nail polish, I thought the color looked super cute online. When it got to my house it seemed that the color looked a little bit duller than the one the internet.I put it on anywho and its cute but... its very streaky and it fades super quick.Some nail polish&#x27;s that don&#x27;t have glitter can sometimes be very streaky.Sometimes adding glitter can solve this problem, but not always. Another solution is \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; your nail polish, because when nail polish sits sometimes it gets streaky.You know how when you try to warm up your hands when you&#x27;re cold you rub them together? Well do this with the nail polish in the middle of your hands and \\&quot;roll\\&quot; the nail polish. Some people like to shake their nail polish I don&#x27;t like it. When you shake your nail polish you cause a lot of air bubbles that show up on your nails. So over all I like the color it&#x27;s pretty but roll the nail polish, and do yourself a huge favor, double coat and top coat.</li>
    <li> I enjoy having an array of pink polish, and this is a great color that isn&#x27;t duplicated often. It has a nice resistance to chipping, after a week I had minor wear around the edges, just be sure to have a good top coat. It&#x27;s a nice cool, blue toned pink and works great in winter or summer. Not clumpy, not streaky but I prefer a few coats to achieve max coverage.</li>
