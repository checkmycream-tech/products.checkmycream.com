      <li>Obviously it was originally a part of some package deal.</li>
      <li>I am hesitant to leave a positive review on this item because when I received the bottle, it was not packaged very professionally - looked like it came from someone&#x27;s warehouse - in bubble wrap, taped up and without a receipt but just a hand cut printout disclaimer.</li>
      <li>Although this product has the Shalimar fragrance I like, I was hoping for more of a typical lotion consistency.</li>

<li> Although this product has the Shalimar fragrance I like, I was hoping for more of a typical lotion consistency.</li>
<li> No other can take it&#x27;s place!</li>
<li> Not a very good product as it is a very runny consistency.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers have noted, the consistency is a little thinner than other lotions I&#x27;ve used, but the REAL Shalimar fragrance is there</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way, so one tube of lotion will last me for months!</li>
<li> Maybe it was on the shelf a little too long.</li>
<li> This is very thin and you have to be careful it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube too fast.</li>
<li> It has a bit of the spicy Shalimar scent, but other than that it smells like bubblegum and acetone!  </li>
<li> This does not smell like any of my previous Shalimar products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is my favourite perfume, but I was a little disappointed because the fragrance was not as strong as I felt it should be.  </li>
<li> Fragrance from my past.</li>
<li> I bought this for my mom, but was disappointed in the consistency of it…quite runny…and didn&#x27;t seem to have the Shalimar smell as much as I expected.</li>
<li> This stuff smells like a bad knockoff.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like to give bad reviews, but this is awful.</li>

    <li> There is nothing like it!  It&#x27;s been around for eons and hopefully will continue to be available.  It smells wonderful and no one is ever sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product as it is a very runny consistency.  Like the scent though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn the lotion and the cologne for 35 years. It&#x27;s my signature scent. No other can take it&#x27;s place!</li>
    <li> For day or evening, I always love wearing Shalimar and the scent of the body lotion seems to linger longer than the cologne.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to give bad reviews, but this is awful. I have Shalimar shower gel, and wear the lotion all the time, as well as the perfume. This does not smell like any of my previous Shalimar products!&lt;br /&gt;I always purchase the larger bottle of Shalimar lotion and have never had a problem. I wanted a smaller travel bottle, so I purchased this smaller bottle.  This stuff smells like a bad knockoff. It has a bit of the spicy Shalimar scent, but other than that it smells like bubblegum and acetone!  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to the larger bottle of lotion from my local department store.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and is easier to put on than cologne or perfume. Most fragrances irritate my asthma and allergies but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite perfume, but I was a little disappointed because the fragrance was not as strong as I felt it should be.  Maybe it was on the shelf a little too long.</li>
    <li> Makes perfume smell better, smell stronger and last longer. Great addition without much money. This vender was excellent to order from, fast, received well and good price, Thank you.</li>

On the bottle it clearly says &amp;#34;NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34;, so it makes me wonder if this is a reputable seller of Guerlain products or if it is even new or not. Obviously it was originally a part of some package deal. Made the impression of receiving something from eBay or individual seller site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it arrived on time, undamaged.</li>
    <li> Iwant to order I more</li>
    <li> I have always loved Shalimar.  Price wise this is great.</li>
