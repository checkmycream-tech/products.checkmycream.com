      <li>I have paired this with the &#x27;Nail Shield&#x27; product and am in love.  </li>

      <li>I love this product and believe it is totally worth.</li>
      <li>Phenomenal and worth every penny.</li>

      <li>/&gt;UPDATE - one more positive thing I just noticed.</li>
      <li>This product is probably good for those of you who have long nails and just want to keep them strong.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in years my nails are long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>Or at least nails that would stay beautifully manicured for more than 8 hours without chipping or peeling.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I have long, beautiful nails</li>
      <li>I absolute love this stuff</li>
      <li>It is good but leaves yellow nails</li>
      <li>Overall good purchase.</li>
      <li>When I compare my bottle with the one on the picture it looks just as full.</li>
      <li>Do not place on full nail, but just the tips.</li>
      <li>This gives me super nice, strong nails without a parasite or the related pregnancy side effects.</li>
      <li>My nail tips are instantly hardened and feels more healthy.</li>
      <li>My nails always peel at the ends into layers or tear across the nail below the quick.</li>
      <li>I always turn to Mavala to get nice long strong nails.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried that, but when applied as directed gel polishes worked like a miracle on strenghtening my nails and are very pretty besides.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a month and within the first week of using it i could see and feel the difference in my nails!</li>
      <li>(something definitely sinks in, and I&#x27;m sure some more vaporous stuff disappears into the ether)...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Não recebi o produto no prazo determinado no hotel onde estava hospedada. e agora já retornei para o Brasil e não recebi o reembolso do produto até hoje. Muito insatisfeita....</li>
    <li> I am surprise it okay I recommended but is not an excellent product, for the price is good tats it..</li>
    <li> Excellent I use to use this 20 years ago and it is still an excellent product for nails. It is important to your nail only holding your hands down so that the liquid does not go down to your cuticles as this will make them hard which you do not want. You can also put  a little under the nail for extra protection.</li>
    <li> Nails are noticeably stronger and less likely to break. You really only need to paint the free edge of the nail.  Anything more and you waste the product.</li>
    <li> Mavala scientifique is very good hardener.i recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle! My nails are much stronger now, and growing a lot faster! I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work in my nails.</li>
    <li> Not an overnight miracle, but does actually work for me overtime.</li>
    <li> Really makes nails grow fast and stronger. Mavala has the best nails products. It really works. Try it. It´s worth.</li>
    <li> This stuff works especially when you combine it with vitamins for nails. This combination left me with the longest and strongest nails I have ever had. Try it if you want lovely nails!</li>
    <li> I have used it for two months! I have seen how some claim they saw results within weeks. It took me longer then that, but now, 2 months later I really do see longer nails. I also have used it more then what is recommended,I have used it  at least 4-5 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, you don&#x27;t have to use it on entire nail. Just the tip is enough. And it works - even my weakest nails are longer then what they usually are. Whatever oil is on the brush when you take it out the bottle is enough to cover all nails, so this tiny bottle will last a while. As much as I have used it in two months, I really have not made a dent yet.When I compare my bottle with the one on the picture it looks just as full. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, using it 5 times every week, this bottle will last me a year.&lt;br /&gt;And it is less messy then using  nail strengthener, waiting for it to dry and then removing it later. Plus of course it ends up being much cheaper! I can&#x27;t say \\&quot;it&#x27;s better then anything else out there\\&quot; because I am sure there are other things that would work just as well.  Nailtiques Formula 2 would do the same job, but I much prefer Mavala nail hardener oil.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to stick to it - consistency is the key! I love it and I will stick to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - one more positive thing I just noticed. Usually when I&#x27;ve used other nail hardeners that work and I have a longer nail then usual, and I cut my nails with scissors, the entire nail starts cracking, it&#x27;s like the nail is long, but the texture is messed up.&lt;br /&gt;This time, when I cut my nails, not one single nail started cracking. So I have to take back the words when I said that some other products have done the same work. Mavala Nail hardener is exceptional!</li>
    <li> I like the company because they were fast. The product was what I expected, it does not do miracles but, it is the best I saw so far, and trust me I tried a lot of the similars.</li>
    <li> Nope doesn&#x27;t work at all..the opposite..ruined my nails.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING makes your nails really strong!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product I have never been able to grow my nails and now my nails grow so much that I essentially have to cut them. It has been four months since I  first bought  it and I have already cut my nails three times. My nails were short, paper thin, and yellowish and now they are long, strong and very white. I highly recommend it. Remember don&#x27;t use more than directed.</li>
    <li> Am sooo in love with this stuff! My nails have grown in just a matter of a month!! If you want your nails to grow and be hard and strong, I recommend this! I use it conjunction with Biotin and twice a week I massage my nails with coconut oil. Im a nail biter and my nails were awful!! They were very short, torn, dry and split. This product has made my nails strong and they have grown to the point I can paint them! Follow the directions and watch them grow! Has no Harsh smell and takes VERY little to use! Comes in a very small bottle but will last a long time. Definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I have terrible nails that chip and split at the tips.  This has done nothing to relieve that so I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! For the first time in my life I have long, beautiful nails and they don&#x27;t break or split!</li>
    <li> I found the product okay. Maybe is too soon to rate it since I started to use mavala a few weeks ago. So far, I have to say that it just so so.</li>
    <li> The product is true to its name by girlfriend loved the product it helped keep her nails from breaking and cracking I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> My nails always peel at the ends into layers or tear across the nail below the quick. This stuff works to keep my nails strong to withstand pretty much anything. They have stopped peeling even in the middle of winter! Perfect addition to my manicure routine.</li>
    <li> The only nail hardener I have found that makes them stronger AND does not cover the nail like a top coat. Disappears into the nail. I normally have very soft and flexible nails, but by using this I can have them long and looking good</li>
    <li> Is true!!! Finally a real hardener!!!!</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but it&#x27;s only been a week.  I have paired this with the &#x27;Nail Shield&#x27; product and am in love.  I suffer from miserable weak, peeling nails and had just had enough. I wanted pretty long healthy nails like everyone else.  Or at least nails that would stay beautifully manicured for more than 8 hours without chipping or peeling.  So far, this has done the trick wonderfully. Im used to painting my nails almost every day because the color just wouldn&#x27;t last.  Now the color stays put and my nails haven&#x27;t peeled a bit!  I&#x27;m at a loss!  I did a heavy house cleaning, which included dishes and laundry and putting things away and the manicure not only lasted, but the nails felt strong enough to tackle things like - opening a make up compact and picking away at a label on a jar without peeling or breaking.  It&#x27;s probably full of poisonous chemicals that will give me a third eye, but I DONT CARE. My hands look GORGEOUS and my nails are growing and strong!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I really wish I&#x27;d have taken a picture of my nails before I started this product, they were so short from constant peeling and breaking the hurt! All I could do for them was to cut off the free edge and hope I could stop the peeling. They were flakey as well as peeling. I tried every product imaginable, I did hot oil manicures , still nothing stopped the flaking and peeling that lead to the constant thinning and breaking of my nails. Now I have nice healthy looking nails no more peeling or breaking! Finally they have a free edge that covers the tips of my fingers. Just make sure when you use this you use a good cuticle oil, the product can dry your surrounding skin. Be patient , it took a good 6 -8 weeks for it to take hold and work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> Was a nice product, not too hard on my nails but only noticed a minor difference</li>
    <li> I bought this from another vendor about 6 months ago, and started using it about 4 mo ago, since I had to wait until my thin nail tips grew out enough to use as directed on tips only. I used it twice a week for about 2 weeks and then noticed the edges of my nails were chipping and peeling worse than before. My nails are very thin, bendable(can fold them over 90*) and have ridges. Knowing the product has 4.5% formaldehyde, I decided to wait a few weeks until I could file off the chipped ends and start with a diluted to about 50% water mixture in a small glass container and paint the entire nail instead of the tips. I also used DeLore nail oil after each application to moisten the nails. The results are that the tips aren&#x27;t chipping as bad and I think it strengthened the nails just a bit with the cross linking it does, but my nails are still pretty thin and ridged after using this in my modified fashion for about 9 wks now. So I still can&#x27;t get my nails to grow much past the fingertips before they split or tear or chip. I&#x27;ve tried just about every nail hardening product there is and I take 10,000 much of biotin, plenty of calcium and other minerals per day, so I&#x27;m still hunting for something that really works. Some products have made my nail beds burn like crazy and discontinued use, but using this in my modified fashion on the entire nails hasn&#x27;t caused that at least.</li>
    <li> My nails used to be all my life very very soft and it was peeling all the time. It has no meaning if I had short nails or a bit longer (0.2 mm max) . It&#x60;s already 2 weeks I&#x60;m using this product and the result is breathtaking !!!! My nails are 10 times harder and is no longer peeling ! Everyone who has the same problem as I had, do not hesitate to but this product. It really does miracles</li>
    <li> This product is not good dosent work for my nails l spend my money for nothing!</li>
    <li> I would buy again great seller as well. I have not used this as much as the other Mavala product but it does work great.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I don&#x27;t know why there are 1-star reviews.  It really works.  I&#x27;m a guitar player and have been using this product for over 20 years now and I would recommend it to anyone who needs stronger nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, helps nails grow strong and healthy. Great product to add to your manicure routine</li>
    <li> Mavala Nail Hardener turns my flimsy fingernails into nails with a firmness that make my nails like real and normal fingernails.</li>
    <li> Good price point ...Good Product!...I would buy this product again if needed! Would recommend to friends too. Overall good purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had formaldehyde. I  will not use it. I probably should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I read all the reviews before purchasing.  I decided to order because my nails would chip and break after reaching a certain length.  It worked!  My nails stopped breaking and grew past the point they normally did.  I use it only once every 2 weeks and it does the job.  My nails are normally brittle and kind of dry.  They are also very thin.  So in between using the Mavala, I use almond oil every day (at least once a day, twice would be better!) to keep them supple and flexible.  If you keep doing this, your nails will grow and not split or chip.  Believe me!  Make sure you don&#x27;t get the Mavala hardener on your skin or cuticle.  So, yes, your nail has to have a little growth before you start using Mavala.  If you adapt a nail care program like saturating and rubbing your nails and cuticle with oil everyday, your nails will begin to grow.  When they get a little length, that&#x27;s when you start using the Mavala nail hardener. Once every week or every two weeks. And here is where you&#x27;ll notice the BIG difference.  Your nail begin to grow, without chipping or splitting.  They will look strong and healthy.  And because you&#x27;ve been using almond (or whatever) oil faithfully, they will be flexible and supple; not hard and brittle.  Also, use playtex gloves (or synthetic, if you&#x27;re allergic to latex) when doing the dishes or any other household chores that require your hands to be in water and harsh detergents.  If you want long nails, you have to work at it!  No shortcuts.</li>
    <li> Wow&lt;br /&gt;yes it works, absolutely. it easily hardens my nails and keeps them from layering and peeling. I love this product and believe it is totally worth.</li>
    <li> Okay I have nails that have a line from the cuticle all the way down to the tip of my nail. It is very hard to grow my nails out because as soon as they get just past the end of my finger the split along that line and have to be clipped off.  So I heard about this product and I purchased the combo of nail hardener and cuticle cream.  I opened the box for the nail hardener and a round cardboard disk falls out.  The disk says nail protector on it and it has a slit in it.  Hummm  I open the instructions and it says to place the end of your nail through the slit in the disk and apply the hardener to just the tip.  And if you cannot grow a tip?  The picture shows a very long nail tip that grows well beyond the fingertip.  I can&#x27;t get my nails that long and believe me there is nothing to place inside the disk.  The instructions say do not get this product on the cuticle or your skin!  Thus the protective disk.  This product is probably good for those of you who have long nails and just want to keep them strong.  Forget using it if you have short nails that won&#x27;t fit through a slot and stick out the other end.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolute love this stuff and it lasts forever!! I will definately buy again, my nails are amazing! I was paper thinn nails that broke if I looked at them too hard, now I can do anything with them and no issues!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. My nails have never looked better. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it because it really works.</li>
    <li> I work as a chemist, which unfortunately exposes my hands to a lot of chemicals. This makes my nail peel. I had almost given up on having long, useful nails. I decided to buy this, not expecting it to work as well as the reviews said it would. I have been using it for a month, and no more peeling is evident. It&#x27;s fantastic. I paint a little on every night and kept my nails short until the peeling stopped. Now they are long and strong. I will definitely continue using this since it is worth every penny to me.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few weeks now, and I think it is like the lash builder by Mavala.  Very slow progress.  I have noticed a slight difference in my nails but they are still chipping.  I am going to give it a chance and keep applying it every few days.  I know the lash-builder works but it too 2 months before I started to see even slight progress.</li>
    <li> This product works as promised. However, it is formaldehyde. You don&#x27;t put it on your skin, though. I apply it as directed; I brush it on my nail tips, let it dry, then wash my hands before applying nail polish. The only time my nails have ever looked this good, been this strong, or grown this long is when I was pregnant. This gives me super nice, strong nails without a parasite or the related pregnancy side effects. (Pregnancy was the WORST for me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of natural/non-toxic alternative stuff. I&#x27;m one of those annoying tree-hugger hippies who takes their own sacks to the store and totes around my reusable water bottle 24/7, I compost, our recycling is always more than our trash, etc. But I will keep buying this and using it because it simply WORKS. Users exposure to the chemical is limited if you apply as directed. Just don&#x27;t drink it or rub it all over yourself and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine. Keep out of reach of children, because DUH.</li>
    <li> It is good but leaves yellow nails</li>
    <li> I heard about this from my cousins and she always had trouble with nails, said it worked wonders for her. I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference. I don&#x27;t have time to do my nails every week, or regularly, and maybe I didn&#x27;t use it enough. Either way, for me it didn&#x27;t do much,</li>
    <li> I like it. So good product</li>
    <li> Ok, I rarely write reviews but just had to for this. I used to have beautiful nails, but after I turned 40 they started flaking and breaking. I was so frustrated!! The ends of my nails were peeling and splitting. I decided to give this stuff a try based on other reviews and I can honestly say after 2 months of usage my old hard, strong nails are back!! I apply this 2x a week, then cover with clear pollish. Perfection! It took a while for all of my nails to grow back and to feel better, but it was worth the effort. only put this stuff on the very tips (white part) of your nails. Try it!!</li>
    <li> Using for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen much improve.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Mavala Scientifique nail hardener, well... you should. I was introduced to this stuff by my mother around 20 years ago back when I was trying out every nail strengthening/hardening/protecting product I could lay my little teenage hands on, and finding (to my frustration) that none of them worked. Naturally, being a teenage know-it-all, I rolled my eyes at my mother&#x27;s many suggestions that I try painting a little of the liquid in this tiny little jar of hers onto my nails, but when I finally deigned to humor her and give it a go? Yeah. It worked. This stuff is amazing... I have no idea how it works, just that it does, and have turned many of my friends onto the stuff over the years. It&#x27;s just a shame that it&#x27;s such a total pain to find it in stores these days... and I&#x27;m talking in Europe, never mind here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pick up a bottle, here is all you need to do: paint the tiniest amount of the liquid onto the very tips (like, the last 1mm - no more than 2mm max - honestly, don&#x27;t paint it further down the nail than this as it won&#x27;t help) of each fingernail. Sit there for maybe 30 seconds to a minute waiting for it to absorb/evaporate (something definitely sinks in, and I&#x27;m sure some more vaporous stuff disappears into the ether)... you&#x27;re done for the day. Repeat this process once a week, maybe twice if you&#x27;re a little obsessive like me. If you paint your nails, you need to do this UNDER your nail polish or it won&#x27;t work. It won&#x27;t leave any kind of coating on your nails, so you can paint over the top of the nail hardener, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely PROMISE you that you will find, within a pretty quick timeframe, that your nails will stop splitting apart and peeling and breaking at the tips. The ends will also seem much more resistant to chipping and breaking when you bash them against things. I honestly don&#x27;t know quite what this stuff does, but... it works. That is all I need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Scientifique is seriously great stuff, and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time. Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time. Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!, by far the best I&#x27;ve used to make my nails grow. For the first time in years my nails are long and beautiful. I highly recommend it. If any one follow the instructions, no disappointment at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  Be patient and follow the directions.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t broken a nail since I have been using this product! I am 100% satisfied with it and highly recommend it if you have soft, brittle, and peeling nails. Apply just once a week to nail tips and your nails will reach incredible lengths, best of all, without breaking!!</li>
    <li> Made my nails slightly harder, but it caused my nails to have cloudy white spots.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. Be sure to add oil to your nails at the cuticles. But wait a few weeks and your nails will get stronger. I had fake nails on and this product maintained my length.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has been having trouble with breaking fingernails - ruining his guitar and mandolin playing.  It didn&#x27;t work for him, as he said it made the nails harder, but brittle... so they just broke in a different way.  I may try it though and will let you know the results.</li>
    <li> I always turn to Mavala to get nice long strong nails.  I tend to use it every other day and about a week into it I can already tell my nails are growing.  Helps keep my tips nice and white without it irritating my cuticle.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now and wish it was sold everywhere but alas its not so I always turn to Amazon. Doesn&#x27;t clash with nail polish but I do recommend putting it on a bare nail to ensure the product gets quickly absorbed into the nail.  It dries within seconds as its very water and not thick like nail polish.  Doesn&#x27;t yellow and doesn&#x27;t sting either.  Its magic.</li>
    <li> Very thin runny product, so it&#x27;s difficult to apply without getting it on your skin when your nails are very short. (It can be caustic and burn on skin or on nails past the cuticle.) I had to keep my nails very short because they split in layers frequently, even down past the cuticle.  This product dried the nail tips out, but did not prevent my nails from splitting or make them stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want stronger natural nails that don&#x27;t split, try gel polish manicures (I like Gelish). If you don&#x27;t want the full manicure (e.g. you are male or have weak nails from chemo), you can try applying a clear gel polish, letting it soak in for a few minutes without curing under UV light, then wiping off excess. One Gelish reviewer said this made nails much stronger without need to soak off the polish later. Haven&#x27;t tried that, but when applied as directed gel polishes worked like a miracle on strenghtening my nails and are very pretty besides. Nails are very strong with no splits or breaks, and manicure lasts from 1-3 weeks without chipping. My two cents, anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to strengthen my nails ,but it doesn&#x27;t walk.I think it is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommand.</li>
    <li> Mavala Scientifique is very good product. it&#x60;s realy works. i&#x60;m very content  with this purchase. I will advice it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I tend to have my hands in water a lot, so I&#x27;ve been plagued with the tips of my nails constantly flaking. I tried all sorts of things: keeping my nails painted made them turn yellow, natural nail strengtheners failed, and I didn&#x27;t have time to sit and rub moisturizers etc. into my nails for hours at a time.  I eventually remembered Mavala from my teen years, found it on Amazon, and rather dubiously decided to try it again, thinking that it was unlikely to have the same impact on my menopausal nails as it did on my teenage nails. But it worked!  Within a week or two my nails were no longer flaking, they grew out, it was a miracle!  I was planning to get a manicure, but then ... alas, both my thumb nails cracked just where the nail separates from my finger, and I had to cut both nails off, as short as I could.  Weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I learned why, thanks to Lauren from MA (see her November 2012 review) -- too much Mavala ends up making your nails *too* hard, and brittle, and they can break.  So I need to curb my enthusiasm, re-read the instructions, and I&#x27;ll start again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note: It is true that this product contains formaldehyde, that is why it works, but as long as this is the only product I am using that contains it, I&#x27;m not worried about it, you use so very little, it&#x27;s just the tips of the nails every week or two (or less, as I said, I need to re-read the instructions).</li>
    <li> I have been having serious problems with my nails breaking. This product has made a terrific difference.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned however...don&#x27;t get it on your skin.  It should be applied to just the TIP of the nail.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the good ratings it got. My finger nails are breaking off even more since I started using this product, so I would not recommend it at all. Now I have to start all over again to find something else that will do a better job. I was trying to get something before my nails broke to the quick(as women know that hurts), and this didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, and a true nail saver. The secret is that you cannot use it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, this item uses formaldehyde much like Brazilian straightening systems for hair. By painting this on it changes the cross links in protein causing the nails to become stronger. However, formaldehyde is both dangerous, and applications of too much causes brittleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow directions closely, only apply to nails, and wash wash wash when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Have bought this product now for myself and my daughter.  We both love the fact that it actually works.  Only drawback ... make sure you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;use too much as we were starting to do.  Make sure you use a moisturizer with it (some sort of oil for your cuticles) ... underneath your nail&lt;br /&gt;beds will get dry and yucky !!!  Other than that ... I love this product because now I can pitch all the commitments to the nail salon and do&lt;br /&gt;my own nails because now they are hard and long !!!  Truly ... they will grow from a nail with no hope to a nice long hard nail in approx. 3&lt;br /&gt;weeks.  I use clear during the week and as soon as my Friday rolls around providing I have no commitments, I apply a thin coat to my nails&lt;br /&gt;approx. 4-5 times a day !!!  If your nails appear to be turning blue ... it is just the stain from the product.  When you take a shower and&lt;br /&gt;wash your hair, the blue will disappear.  Love this product ... these are all my tips !!!</li>
    <li> This product is magic!!! makes my  nails so hard, in a few days!!! I feel like I have new nails!!!You have to taste it!!!</li>
    <li> its was recommended.... im trying.....</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that Singapore does not sell this item as it is extremely effective. My nail tips are instantly hardened and feels more healthy. Recommended for those who wear nail polish too often, or those with soft weak nails. Do not overuse it - it says in the instruction that you can use it up to 2 times a week if I am not wrong, but I never exceed that dosage anyway. It comes in a very small quantity for this manner of usage. Do not place on full nail, but just the tips. Watch how much your nail grows, stronger and quicker as well!</li>
    <li> Love thissssss works great</li>
    <li> Awesome product! A friend of mine recommended and I love it. It does exactly what it says, my nails do not break as it as before. I do a lot of manual work, and by using it once a week, it has helped me have healthier nails.</li>
    <li> it worked really well.. till I stopped using it. I like it a lot though !!</li>
    <li> Have used in past. Excellent product to strengthen nails. Has been difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal and worth every penny. My nails have never looked so elegNt and beautiful like this before. Thank you. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Estoy haciendo el tratamiento desde hace tres semanas. En el interín, las uñas se me fueron rompiendo. Seguiré con las aplicaciones, quizá sea cuestión de tiempo. Por ahora, nada.</li>
    <li> I used this product and did not notice a difference on my nails. I would not waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and it actually working.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product!!! I have been using it for a month and within the first week of using it i could see and feel the difference in my nails! You use so little of it that it will last for years!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work on my nails. I follow the interactions but my nails never grow</li>
</ol>
