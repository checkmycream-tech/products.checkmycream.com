      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>The thermal spa vibrating mitts were sent along with a prepaid USPS label to return the first ones sent.  </li>
      <li>The product was exactly as described and seemed in the picture.</li>
      <li>The high and low heat and massage settings are nice and even on high, they don&#x27;t get too hot</li>
      <li>This is probably a good product in a spa setting, or perhaps at home sitting in a chair -- but definitely not for personal nighttime use.</li>
      <li>I was very disappointedwith these mits.</li>
      <li>Following the instructions, my hand barely fit in the pouch.  </li>
      <li>very bearable.</li>
      <li>They are a little cumbersome, but very comfortable and really help my wife&#x27;s arthritis.</li>
      <li>He puts the setting on medium heat, leaves the hand in for 20 minutes or so, and his hand feels better for a few hours.  </li>
      <li>The low heat setting is too low and the high heat setting gets very hot.</li>
      <li>They get VERY HOT so be careful.</li>
      <li>The heat is great for anyone with circulation problems that make your hands constantly chilly.  </li>
      <li>Her hand pain has diminished considerably.  </li>
      <li>The mitts do not massage , all it has is a vibration and loud .</li>
      <li>Low/High&lt;br /&gt;Includes soft fleece outer cover and washable liners</li>
      <li>There weren&#x27;t soft covers on them.  </li>
      <li>It would cost too much to send them back so there in the Attic.</li>
      <li>The mitts came earlier than expected in their original package including a manual and 60 washable liners.</li>
      <li>did heat up fast and the vibration aspect was very relaxing after a hard day work on the keyboard.</li>

    <li> As others have said, the heat settings are quite extreme. If you leave them on for a while on high heat and then try to put your hand in, it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable as it&#x27;s too hot. But, if you have your hands in first and then turn the heat up, it seems fine. very bearable. The massage is a vibration versus a squeeze, but still helps. These seem to be a fairly unique product, and I was happy with them.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the thermal spa electric vibrating spa mitts and hand warmers. When I ordered them originally I  did not receive the mitts that vibrate.  The company, learning of the mistake, corrected it immediately!  The thermal spa vibrating mitts were sent along with a prepaid USPS label to return the first ones sent.  Very impressed with how quickly things were handled!  Warmers work great, and the vibration helps with stiffness!  Thanks!  Would definitly work with Devin Hollands again!  Hope this review helps others!</li>
    <li> These mitts do not work. They heat up, but as soon as you put your hands in, they cool!</li>
    <li> They get VERY HOT so be careful. The bags that came with it don&#x27;t open though and you end up wasting more then using.</li>
    <li> works great helps take the pain away</li>
    <li> 12\\&quot; x 8\\&quot;.  It takes a while for it to warm up.  The highest heat setting gets really warm so I like the lower setting.  The mitts are a snug fit so you can feel the heat/vibration from fingertips to wrists.  It is relatively quiet.  Helps with carpal tunnel discomfort.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> The item isn&#x27;t described correctly.  There weren&#x27;t soft covers on them.  These were more expensive than some others.  I was willing to pay it for this feature.  Something needs to be corrected.  Other people have had this problem, too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just what was needed.</li>
    <li> warms and massages the hands and is great for hand / occupational therapy.  Would be great for arthritis in hands also.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who has arthritis finger.  The doctor called for warming and this fit the bill.  She says she is happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice item it helps me to relax,and feel good with my RA&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning I feel like they didn&#x27;t warm up evenly ,but I got a system now.&lt;br /&gt;Vey nice</li>
    <li> These hand warmers are fantastic for anyone who has hand problems.  The heat is great for anyone with circulation problems that make your hands constantly chilly.  It&#x27;s also good for people with arthritis problems.</li>
    <li> The mitts came earlier than expected in their original package including a manual and 60 washable liners. The product was exactly as described and seemed in the picture. I tried it out just when I got it and I was very satisfied to see that it worked perfectly. My hands are very dried due to my work and the results were noticable even from the first usage. All the wounds that incommoded me around the cuticle area were eliminated by the next day and my skin is now deeply hydraded. It helps in the better absorption of the cream/lotion and lets a very pleasant feeling of softness to your hands. I am very excited about the product and the services of &#x27;&#x27;Hair products&#x27;&#x27;. I would definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous for arthritis relief! Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these.  It has a nerve condition in one hand and it is often cold.  He puts the setting on medium heat, leaves the hand in for 20 minutes or so, and his hand feels better for a few hours.  The vibration is not really effective.</li>
    <li> They are a little cumbersome, but very comfortable and really help my wife&#x27;s arthritis. I would buy this product again any day of the week!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom, who has very bad arthritic hands.  They are [almost] a God-send!!  She uses them daily, sometimes twice, and they have vastly improved her ability to handle daily tasks that used to give her trouble.  Her hand pain has diminished considerably.  Best gift idea ever!</li>
    <li> I did not receive the correct item! The item I received does not have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-position temperature and vibration switches: Off/Low/High&lt;br /&gt;Includes soft fleece outer cover and washable liners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT HAPPY! I am returning this immediately!</li>
    <li> My Mother uses these for her cold hands and shooting pains daily. It&#x27;s amazing how she can get almost instant relief.</li>
    <li> I was buying these, really only needed 1, for hand therapy for rehabilitation after a fall in July, 2013.  Following the instructions, my hand barely fit in the pouch.  Definitely made for a woman&#x27;s hand!&lt;br /&gt;It did heat up fast and the vibration aspect was very relaxing after a hard day work on the keyboard.</li>
    <li> beyond my expectations. A life saver.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointedwith these mits. The vibrations were very soft and the heat was so low that it was hard to feel. VERY LOW HEAT. It would cost too much to send them back so there in the Attic.</li>
    <li> I needed something to help with some nighttime hand numbness. These are kinda one-size-fits-all and huge for my hands. In addition, the &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; for the electrical cord is cumbersome to handle. This is probably a good product in a spa setting, or perhaps at home sitting in a chair -- but definitely not for personal nighttime use. Returned it.</li>
    <li> these work right &amp; with Bag Balm can heal up hands very good &amp; are easy to use 2 +</li>
    <li> Ordered for my dad who was recovering from a stroke.  Did not work at all.  Greatly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom because she had arthritic  pain in her hand. It does help alleviate the pain and softens the skin according to her. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this one . The mitts do not massage , all it has is a vibration and loud . Sending back this does not meet expectations of what I would like my clients to feel . Thank you</li>
    <li> These are great ,especially for arthritic hands . The high and low heat and massage settings are nice and even on high, they don&#x27;t get too hot so it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> It did not FIT. too small Ordered it for a man&#x27;s hand  I was hoping to find a hand  heating unit for using on arthritis</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my sister so I didnot open it.When she opened it the paperwork was missing. I hope it works-- she has not had a chance to try it yet.</li>
    <li> Outsourced to some laser something company and never got my item. They then proceeded to take forever to get my refund. Terrible customer service from both companies. Ordered from another company and had no problems, if trying to get this item, or any other outsourced, I suggest you do the same!</li>
    <li> Too big and bulky for practical use for us.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Mitts for my brother who had lost feeling in his fingertips due to surgery.  The Mitts have helped with circulation, but the heating element is difficult to regulate...The low heat setting is too low and the high heat setting gets very hot.</li>
    <li> broken after 3 months.</li>
    <li> Returning the product.  The lower of the two heat settings was hotter than my wife (a stroke survivor could stand.) When I put a thermometer in the mitt, it was 139 degrees....NASA and other Internet sources tell you that anything above 113 will be burning to the touch.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED FOR MY WIFE.</li>
    <li> great help to loosen up hands</li>
