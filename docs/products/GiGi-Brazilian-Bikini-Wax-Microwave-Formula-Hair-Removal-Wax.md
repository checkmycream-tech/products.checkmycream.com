      <li>This is also great for touching up eyebrows.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t overdo it, and make sure to do it away from fabric</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t many wax products in the market that are great for FACE wax.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product for home self waxing!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Simply I love it!</li>
      <li>It melted easily, spread well and gave great pull.</li>
      <li>so the hair was nice and long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product at all for Brazilian waxing, or any kind of waxing for that matter.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>To each it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>I liked Surgi&#x27;s microwavable Brazilian Waxing Kit, but then Surgi changed its formula.</li>
      <li>so to be honest</li>
      <li>and then you have to warm it up again.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Keep cortisone 10 handy.</li>
      <li>Make sure to buy gigi&#x27;s post shave/wax in grown hair treatment to make sure the aftermath of waxing is pleasant.</li>
      <li>Great product for entire bikini area, didn&#x27;t have the best of luck with my underarms, but I do love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and the results is good as any pro services.  </li>
      <li>in all, this product is amazing &amp; definitely worth it when you save money from having to go to a salon to get it done, but to each their own!</li>
      <li>This wax is equally suitable for women and men.</li>
      <li>This wax is equally suitable for women and men.</li>
      <li>This wax isnt exactly like the old sally hansen formula, but it is the best i have been able to find i  years!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s become easy for me to do my own brazilian wax within 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wax is nice because it doesn&#x27;t get everything sticky, but I found that it hurts more than using waxing strips and also does not remove the hair as easily.</li>
      <li>And I must say, this product is better.</li>
      <li>Gigi&#x27;s microwavable Brazilian Bikini Wax is better anyway.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d say this product is okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>considering what this product is supposed to do, but just like if I were to go to a salon, I take Advil 30 minutes before I wax to help with the pain &amp; swelling, but having done it so many times now, I no longer need pain medication to help.</li>
      <li>It seems Surgi&#x27;s blunder that sent so many customers in search of another product was a blessing in disguise.</li>
      <li>The wax is also more brittle than Surgi, which makes it easier to remove from the floor, sink or wherever it dripped.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s microwavable and works way better when it&#x27;s all melted</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of not needing wax strips.  </li>
      <li>And still more to spare.</li>
      <li>I still love the idea of waxing and not needing strips, but this wax when it dries doesn&#x27;t pull off in one chunk.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Hope this helps. :)</li>
      <li>and you will be fine :).</li>
      <li>I would say that waxing is better than shaving any day because how much more clean the feeling is.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly but is very easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>Just apply, let cool, and pull off!  </li>
      <li>Easy to work with.</li>
      <li>They are inexpensive and better than rounded applicators for getting a clean line or applying wax to hard-to-reach places.</li>
      <li>Delivered very quickly and the price is riight.</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re easy to get of whatever they fall on.  </li>
      <li>They are inexpensive and better than rounded applicators for getting a clean line or applying wax to hard-to-reach places.</li>
      <li>It washed off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>It was easy to heat up and apply and then from there its all you.</li>
      <li>and it comes out relatively easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much more gentle on the skin than strip wax, making it ideal for the sensitive bikini area.</li>
      <li>Very happy that it grips to hair the first time, it doesnt drip as much as sally hansen and the wax doesnt see to get as hot as sally hansen.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin once, not to mention how effective it is!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, super easy to use</li>
      <li>If you can get the technique down, this wax is the best.</li>
      <li>Takes some experimentation to get the temp and consistency down,  but this wax is perfect for eyebrows,  underarms,  and bikini area.  </li>
      <li>so if you have fine hair you should be fine.</li>
      <li>Its a bit thicker and lava-like compared with the honey color waxes, but seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>If you use this product as directed it will work just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for a quick wax</li>
      <li>Plus I have only used it once (but probably won&#x27;t try again lol).</li>
      <li>so you have to heat it up more than it says to smooth on good enough to cover any surface.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not recommend this product at all for Brazilian waxing, or any kind of waxing for that matter. It dries down to an unbelievably hard plastic texture that painfully yanks out the hair.  I don&#x27;t understand how this has such high reviews because it has to be one of the worst at-home waxing products I&#x27;ve ever tried. I did three strips and just stopped, having to cut out the little pieces of wax that remained on my skin and hair. The pain and the inconsistent hair removal was enough for me. I promptly returned this product to the Sally&#x27;s I had purchased it from. Just a horrible product!  I may try the GiGi hard wax that needs a wax heater sometime in the future but for now, I&#x27;m happy with what I found afterwards and use now: Cirepil Blue -- a far superior product that I HIGHLY recommend for those who are delving into doing their own Brazilian waxes at home.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. If you are looking to wax your underarms I highly suggest this wax. I have sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin once, not to mention how effective it is! Your first time is always a little abrasive, but this wax makes the experience quick and easy to do yourself. The only reason I have this 4 stars instead of 5, is because when doing multiple areas the wax can go quickly, but it&#x27;s definitely affordable and works great so to be honest that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wax for at least 6 to 8 years.  I used to buy it at a beauty supply store, but found it cheaper on amazon.  Experiment with how long to leave it on before you rip it off.  No pain to speak of.  By the time your brain registers the pain signal, the rip is over with.</li>
    <li> Works great like it should and is very easy to microwave.  It heats up very quickly.  Use it for my nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of microwave waxes and this one is really good. The only thing not so good about it is that in the end you will have a lot of little pieces of wax in your skin. Don&#x27;t worry just go shower with hot water and it comes out relatively easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It cools really quick so you have to keep reheating it. It&#x27;s its to thick it will not pick up hair. It&#x27;s ok for a quick wax but if you want a clean wax then you might want another brand</li>
    <li> i guess i just dont like this texture and how it applies that doesnt mean its not good its just not for me</li>
    <li> The product is great, but it didn&#x27;t come with a spatula.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this product quickly.  It came without a box, nor did it come with the applicator. I am living in a remote area overseas with no store hence why I bought this product online. Now I have a tub of wax and no way to spread it....(nor is the tub sealed); it looks like it was returned and re-sold to me.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of not needing wax strips.  It&#x27;s the best hair removal experience EVER.  BUY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing my review to 3 stars after using for a while.  I still love the idea of waxing and not needing strips, but this wax when it dries doesn&#x27;t pull off in one chunk.  It breaks off or leaves behind a small chunk attached to hairs that makes the process harder and messier.  Also when heating this thing, the bottom becomes super liquid and the top half is still one big solid.  Then You have to go in and stir and all that jazz again.  I am trying to save time and effort so will search for something diff.</li>
    <li> If you want a quality wax, this it it. It melted easily, spread well and gave great pull. The 8oz jar was enough for me to do a full brazilian, my underarms, upper lip and eyebrows. And still more to spare. I havent waxed in 8 yrs (been shaving) and after the great experience I have had with this product, will stick with waxing now.</li>
    <li> If you use this product as directed it will work just fine. Use the pre-epilation oil so the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to skin, or you&#x27;ll pull the skin. I&#x27;ve tried it without and you&#x27;ll just be there picking wax pieces off skin. Also use baby powder to help wax adhere to hair and absorb moisture. Also doing thin layer spread in small sections pulls hair out more efficiently. Then remove any excess and treat with baby oil/ coconut oil after waxing. Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> The wax i received was good in quality and reached in time. But one thing buyers keep in mind that apply wax and remove quickly otherwise it will dry and stick to the skin difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> worse product, don&#x27;t waste your money, and you will regret it.</li>
    <li> Was not expecting this to be green. I am accustomed to the honey color wax, so it was different, not bad, just different. Its a bit thicker and lava-like compared with the honey color waxes, but seems to work fine. My only problem would be I felt it was a bit crumbly once it because dry, so if it wasn&#x27;t layered thick - it would crumble/break apart which made removing a bit challenging.</li>
    <li> Kind of strange texture, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I will never use regular wax again because this stuff works wonders. I have not had any ill experiences with this product and find it to be quicker, cleaner and less painful than other types of wax. The trick is to let the wax dry almost entirely and hold skin TIGHT as you rip off the wax. Letting it cool a lot will help it remove more hair at once, leaving less strays for later. This type of wax is clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue while hurting less than ripping off a bandaid.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Esta cera es buenísima!!!!</li>
    <li> After years of sugar waxing my go-to product was discontinued. I purchased this based on reviews, and must say it is the BEST wax I have ever used. Yes, there is a learning curve (and several great youtube vids that will help you sort out how to use it), and yes, it can be messy if you have a clumsy moment. It will not come out of fabric so leave your bathrobe and shower mats outside your working space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets every last hair, even the baby fine hairs. With the use of the prep oil it hardly hurt at all. Just do smaller sections until you get the hang of it.  I didn&#x27;t adore the scent, but I didn&#x27;t hate it either. Considering how well it works, I wouldn&#x27;t care if it reeked.</li>
    <li> First time waxing and I&#x27;d say this product is okay. It dries pretty quick and isn&#x27;t too hard to use. A bit messy but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Its very thick and messy... and it doesnt grab all the hair. It only grabs about half of what it covered so to keep going over the same spot again and again and it still hadnt grabbed everything was pretty painful. I dont have sensitive skin and it left my skin very red and irritated after waxing one spot once, and I used pre epilation oil. Was left irritated, in pain, and still hairy.</li>
    <li> Make sure you melt the wax COMPLETELY before using it, otherwise it worked really well</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product just as described!</li>
    <li> It works, BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes the most stubborn hair but wait a few days later, you&#x60;ll face the worst skin experience you would ever have, you&#x60;ll have to deal with crazy itch and painful ugly furuncle that would not easy go away</li>
    <li> Wonderful for home use</li>
    <li> Arrived early and I always love this product. Best wax on the market.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better than the Surgi I normally get at Sallys beauty supply store.  Another beauty supply store had this brand too and it was around the same price as well.  It works the same way as the surgi bikini wax.  I just wish it was easier to remove the residue.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars if I knew how to do this properly. Basically I had a tragic experience where I let the wax get too hard and subsequently spent 3 hours trying to get it off with heated oil and a LOT of crying. If you can get the technique down, this wax is the best. It is very messy because it is pretty thick. I used newspapers to pick up the wax drippings and stuff. Make sure to buy gigi&#x27;s post shave/wax in grown hair treatment to make sure the aftermath of waxing is pleasant. This was my first time waxing down there so it was inexperience + pain. I would say that waxing is better than shaving any day because how much more clean the feeling is.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, super easy to use</li>
    <li> OMG, I bawled like baby, because it hurt so bad.  I usually shave down there, but that doesn&#x27;t always work out great either.  A friend of mine raved about this stuff, so I tried waxing.  Never again!  I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other waxing products, but NEVER AGAIN!  I usd the 2 prep solutions that come in the kit and I warmed the wax to a modest</li>
    <li> I was excited about using this after reading the reviews but when I tried it I hated it and ended up throwing it away. Doesn&#x27;t come with sticks, an excess wax removal, nothing! I bought Sally Hanson body wax and love.it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work !! :( and is s mess use it !!! Dont recomend !!!</li>
    <li> This wax is nice because it doesn&#x27;t get everything sticky, but I found that it hurts more than using waxing strips and also does not remove the hair as easily.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST wax I have ever used! The process is very cumbersome. The wax is very tacky and it gets everywhere!! Not to mention, when I tried to rip it off, it also ripped off some of the skin. I did not like finding wax all over the place once I finished. What I assumed would be an easy task became very frustrating!!! I even called to get a refund and was told that they would replace it. Why would I want to get the product replaced when I did not like it in the first place? I recently used Poetic Wax from Bliss spa and I am VERY PLEASED! These two waxes are like night and day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t mess around with the tacky stuff that requires papers - you will never get that stuff off and you will make a huge mess in the process. This stuff hardens and comes off easily with the wax removal lotion of the same brand. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as other types of wax. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean up, and relatively painless. I recommend the pre-hon treatment as well as the post-wax removal lotion. The other stuff (pre-cleaner and slow-growth) are less important but nice if you get them in a kit.</li>
    <li> I use this on my eyebrows all the time. I don&#x27;t find it to be painful at all. It leaves no red bump, irritations, that I have received with other wax products such a Sally Hansen, which I cannot use it all cause there is something in it I am allergic to. Others I&#x27;ve used it on has said that it&#x27;s a little bit painful but not bad, they can tolerate it completely and it goes so quickly that the little bit pain is worth it compared to plucking with tweezers or threading. the only thing I wish is that there was a larger jar of the microwave formula available for when you want to do larger areas like the legs.</li>
    <li> Convenient packaging. Really messy to work with but great results. I prefer this over shaving or plucking. I think with time I&#x27;ll learn how to use it a little less messy.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Would repurchase</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out, but helps to an extent!</li>
    <li> I have made my husband swear to use this on me if I get to the nursing home before he does!!!! LOL!!! It&#x27;s that simple and quick to use and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love this! Before discovering this product, I used to use Sally Hansen&#x27;s Brazilian Bikini wax version... And I must say, this product is better. I like the formula because it doesn&#x27;t turn rock hard after leaving it on for a while, it still has a bit of flexibility left in it that makes it easier to yank off. The Sally Hansen one hardens up like rock hard... And when that happens... Dang it&#x27;s really painful to get off! So yeah... I think this is an awesome product. I use this on my underarms by the way.. And I wax every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Hope it&#x27;ll come in larger tubs! Will definitely get more of this stuff.! (:</li>
    <li> I think it works very well, it removes the hair completly, no mess. I just think it&#x27;s a little over price for only 8 OZ.</li>
    <li> The only wax I use. Removed hair effectively, easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
    <li> This wax is extremely stringy, making it a tad bit difficult to apply, but it&#x27;s worth the mess. I used it on my upper lip and it worked absolutely great. BUT I have an extremely sensitive bikini area, and when I tried it out it was a catastrophe. It hurt so bad I thought I was going to pass out - not joking. I am middle Eastern so it could be because I have very thick hair follicles so if you have fine hair you should be fine. Plus I have only used it once (but probably won&#x27;t try again lol). I would say for facial hair it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t overdo it, and make sure to do it away from fabric so you don&#x27;t ruin anything!</li>
    <li> First time using, no problems...5 star...i like this product, works wery well on my coarse hair. Spesially bikini area and my armpits,skin is smoove and silky after use. I have seen bad reviews, but its only when ppl dont what they doing. Instractions has several languages including English. .Only what is a lil off..that wax getting cold quick...you just have to know how to apply it and be really fast.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works, but it is painful to take off. You have to use an actual wax applicator stick because Popsicle sticks and other substitutes don&#x27;t work with it. I didn&#x27;t have an actual applicator stick so it was hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail yesterday and tried it right away. It&#x27;s been years since I waxed and I had never done it myself. I did know that my favorite esthetician used a hard wax like this and it was so fast and relatively painless. Even with years of shaving since my last wax I can say that this was relatively pain free on the bikini and underarms. What I mean by that is that besides the initial second when you yank it off :D it really leaves skin smooth and painless. I don&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s super dry. I remembered my esthetician used wait until it was barely dry and still a bit elastic. She would peel off a bit from the bottom to have something to hold on and just yank. I actually can&#x27;t believe I could do it on my own. Don&#x27;t put it on too thick as the bottom part will harden and the top will stay sticky and elastic. that&#x27;s what makes it messy. Absolutely loved using this wax.</li>
    <li> waxed my underarms to save myself $20 each time i go to salon for full leg. it worked great!!!! first time was a breeze. i have been waxing for over 15 years at salons and finally decided that charging $20 for underarms was too pricey for such a small area. great stuff!</li>
    <li> I made a mess the first time i used it. It needs a little getting used too. It is best effective and less painful after a warm shower. Keep cortisone 10 handy. Apart from that awrsome. Will buy again. I use wooden chopstick for application. It works well.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done. my advice is, don&#x27;t put on a thick layer. whenever i put on a thick layer, it stretches when i am trying to rip it off.</li>
    <li> This wax gets all the hairs out but it is sooo difficult to work with. First of all i hate that its the green thick material thats very hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;Once you put it on your skin u have to work superfast like a superwoman and take it off with the waxing stripes. Otherwise it hardens and no waxing strip can take it off unless u apply even more from the wax, which is first, annoying, and second, a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;Even the product in the bowl dries quickly and becomes stringy and gets all over the place and then you have to warm it up again.&lt;br /&gt;You can work with this wax, but you just need a lot of patience.</li>
    <li> I hate waxing. But decided to try this anyway. This has two stages: 1.) too gummy to rip off in a whole piece or 2.) you&#x27;re tearing off small chunks of hair. That&#x27;s torture to me. Buy of you will, but listen to the reviews as your guide.</li>
    <li> this wax is wonderful!!!! the best waxed i used so far!</li>
    <li> i find this product disturbing, color is light green it melted  after about 1.5 minutes on high inside a microwave, it does the job, but this product seems very plastic, just very weird to compare from the other wax that i have used that has more natural feel and texture, as i swipe my stick on top of the rim of the container the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; didnt melt at all it stayed very hard and while the remaining wax melted inside the container, my husband commented that this wax dont seem like a wax. iam very unsatisfied with this product. it dont deserve even one star. i also look up all the ingredients and it just scares me. i will dispose the remaining and what ive used and will never use this product/brand ever again.</li>
    <li> This formula is awesome. Although you have to work with it fast because when you apply it to your skin, it gets dry really pretty quickly. This small little jar will last a while, trust me. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product,  It&#x27;s the best wax that I ever found.  It&#x27;s practical because it&#x27;s a microwave formula and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
    <li> Best wax ever. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> After years of having to choose between skin reactions to shaving and abraded skin from strip waxing, I came to my senses and started using hard wax on the bikini area. It&#x27;s so much more gentle on the skin than strip wax, making it ideal for the sensitive bikini area. I liked Surgi&#x27;s microwavable Brazilian Waxing Kit, but then Surgi changed its formula. I decided to try Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian Bikini Microwave Wax. They&#x27;re both made by American International Industries. Gigi is their salon hard wax line, and Surgi (formerly One Touch) is their home waxing line. I prefer the microwavable hard wax, as I am only using it on the bikini area. I don&#x27;t want to invest the money or storage space in a wax warmer, so the little microwavable pots are very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi Brazilian Bikini Wax comes in 8-ounce pots, twice the size of the Surgi pots. The first thing I liked about Gigi was that it is less expensive per ounce than the Surgi hard wax. After using Gigi, I came to prefer it to Surgi. The Gigi wax is a light green color, compared to the dark grey-green of Surgi. The wax heats up faster, in a minute or less, where Surgi took several minutes. This is a thinner wax that dries faster. I can apply it to one area, move on to another, and by the time I have finished applying to  the second area, the first is ready to rip. The wax is also more brittle than Surgi, which makes it easier to remove from the floor, sink or wherever it dripped. I recommend using newspaper or something similar underneath you, because hard wax inevitably drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this adds up to faster, easier waxing. It seems Surgi&#x27;s blunder that sent so many customers in search of another product was a blessing in disguise. Gigi&#x27;s microwavable Brazilian Bikini Wax is better anyway. It&#x27;s not absolutely necessary, but using some kind of pre-epilation oil or mineral oil before waxing makes the job easier on your skin and the wax easier to remove. I haven&#x27;t tried Gigi&#x27;s Pre-Epilation oil, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I do recommend Gigi&#x27;s large Accu Edge Wax Spatulas. They are inexpensive and better than rounded applicators for getting a clean line or applying wax to hard-to-reach places. This wax is equally suitable for women and men. It has no particular scent; it smells like wax.ent on that. I do recommend Gigi&#x27;s large Accu Edge Wax Spatulas.

    <li> This stuff rocks!!!!!!! I have used wax for years and been waxed for years and this is super easy to use and painless... NO JOKES! Will use it till I get too old to reach!</li>
    <li> As a person who usually buys the GIGI&#x27;s hard body wax, I hated this product. I know hate is a strong word but this product is completely MESSY. It doesn&#x27;t get completely hard. To each it&#x27;s own but this was a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; for me. So much so I through the entire thing away and orderd my Gigi&#x27;s hard body wax, which is much more predictable and easier to work with.</li>
    <li> Small but the results you get with this wax are unbeatable! There aren&#x27;t many wax products in the market that are great for FACE wax. This one s awesome :D</li>
    <li> If you are looking to wax yourself with no problem and to save money, then this is your product. The wax works really well. It heats within 30-45 seconds and it wont burn your life when you apply it. If it is your first time it can get messy.but it is wax and that is what happens. A little practice and you will be fine :).</li>
    <li> Waxing always hurts and is always messy. This is the best at home wax I&#x27;ve tried so far. Because it doesn&#x27;t use strips, it&#x27;s a lot easier to use on your delicate parts. It can be a bit messy, but definitely no more than any other wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I expected more out of this microwavable wax. It&#x27;s okay I felt like it was super messy but maybe all waxes are.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Formula set where it came with the Pre Hon, Pre-Epilation Oil, Wax Off Lotion, Slow Grow Oil &amp; small/large applicators &amp; have continued purchasing the wax by itself now replenishing my 5th jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think women should complain about the pain considering what this product is supposed to do, but just like if I were to go to a salon, I take Advil 30 minutes before I wax to help with the pain &amp; swelling, but having done it so many times now, I no longer need pain medication to help. It&#x27;s tolerable now at this point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using the Pre Hon, then Pre-Epilation oil as directed because it helps the wax ease off the skin easily when you&#x27;re ready to pull off the wax on the area you&#x27;ve applied it on. There were a few times I tried it without the Pre-Epilation oil because I felt it made it too slippery, but it was more painful to pull off the wax. I realized I had to apply very little of Pre-Epilation oil for it to work &amp; voila! It&#x27;s become easy for me to do my own brazilian wax within 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get a little messy depending on your own application &amp; it will take practice especially if you have no clue what you&#x27;re doing, but I don&#x27;t think these are good reasons to give this product a bad rating (like some people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would recommend from experience is that depending on the voltage of your microwave, it takes me 2 minutes to get my wax hot enough to melt down, BUT- I let it cool down for about a minute or until it gets to more of a caramel consistency (it&#x27;s more watery when it&#x27;s too hot) before I start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is amazing &amp; definitely worth it when you save money from having to go to a salon to get it done, but to each their own!</li>
    <li> This is not a regular wax (the honey + sugar stuff). Some kind of resin which sticks to everything which comes into contact and hard to remove. My wife had a very bad time. If you spill you are gone. Droplet are still there in our bathroom hard to remove. The remover which I bought along with this another useless product. I feel sorry for buying this.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and the results is good as any pro services.  I have been using it for many year now, used different brands but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for actual bikini wax, mostly for underarms and eyebrows and I love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and store, and works really well!  Just apply, let cool, and pull off!  No adverse reactions, no problems with it missing spots, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for home self waxing! I have been using this for 4 years and will not use any other product. It is easy to use and completely removes your unwanted hair. I cannot tell you it is painless as it is waxing, but it works and with continued use results last weeks.</li>
    <li> Old standby. Delivered very quickly and the price is riight.</li>
    <li> Great product for entire bikini area, didn&#x27;t have the best of luck with my underarms, but I do love this product.  I have been waxing for two years, so I don&#x27;t know how great it is on stubborn, thick hair. Good for sensitive skin, perfect flexibiity of a hard wax. It is a solid light green color, not too &amp;#34;stringy,&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t have to apply too much for great results. I have just recently ordered Cirex blue hard wax only because I just ordered the Gigi wax heater and this product is microwavable, but I love both products and don&#x27;t think I have a preference. This is also great for touching up eyebrows. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure how i feel about waxing after this product. It dries really fax so you have to heat it up more than it says to smooth on good enough to cover any surface. However that makes it sooooo hot, I burned my skin actually.  But i guess thats my fault im just going to try out epilating.</li>
    <li> Heat the sucker up, put it on my eyebrows, tear it off... bam, no more hair. Just don&#x27;t do it twice in the same area, I learned the hard way and had to walk around with red eyebrows for an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Coolest cheapest wax ever! No strips needed, just a microwave, lotion, and wax sticks. In case your wondering the wax is green.</li>
    <li> Imagine getting a ball of hot laffy taffy stuck on your pubes. That&#x27;s exactly what this product is like. It sucks and didn&#x27;t remove any hair whatsoever. Just pay some unfortunate soul to wax your lady (or man) bits for you.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year now. This wax works well for me.</li>
    <li> difficult product to use.  In the end, it didn&#x27;t do a thorough job.</li>
    <li> Takes some experimentation to get the temp and consistency down,  but this wax is perfect for eyebrows,  underarms,  and bikini area.  No more razor burn and unsightly rashes. The trick is to pull out after as soon as it is no longer tacky. ..don&#x27;t wait too long or it gets brittle.  Grabs all the hair so don&#x27;t miss!</li>
    <li> I used this so much until I got a warmer kit by Gigi. But this is still one of those easy products that can be melted in 2 minutes and ready to use! I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought for the second time! Simply I love it!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Just used this product for the first time a moment ago.  My arms have become more and more sensitive to razor burn each year and this year they broke out like crazy after shaving twice in a week and I realized I needed to do something new.  So I ordered this while waiting for the irritation to heal which took weeks so the hair was nice and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit messy when it&#x27;s really liquid - long strings of it will drop off the applicator but they&#x27;re easy to get of whatever they fall on.  I did my underarms in two sections on each side.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward to do yourself, but doable.  Pretty quickly after you put it on start using a finger nail to pry up the edge you&#x27;re going to pull from so you get a bit of a lip to grab.  It hardens fast and the wax was really grippy on the hairs.  It stung, but wasn&#x27;t terrible and seeing all those hairs in the wax was very satisfying.  Glad I found a product I can use at home and takes very little time.</li>
    <li> Worst wax ever used!! I usually use soft wax and it&#x27;s great but this Brazilian wax, requiring no strips did not remove any hair and made a mess! would have asked for a refund but already opened and used.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sally hansen hot wax and they changed their formula several years ago and i have been so dissapointed with it.  My biggest complaint with sally hansen wax is it doesnt grip all the hair and it tears/stretches.  It is hard enough to wax, but i find that i have to wax several times over, often tugging at hair and ripping out left over wax pieces.  I was reluctant to try new wax, but glad i did!  This wax isnt exactly like the old sally hansen formula, but it is the best i have been able to find i  years!!  Very happy that it grips to hair the first time, it doesnt drip as much as sally hansen and the wax doesnt see to get as hot as sally hansen.  I have found my new wax, def not going back to sally hansen!</li>
    <li> honestly this is a great product. smelled great. good quality wax. can be used with strips or by itself (just be wary if you&#x27;re not using strips to apply in a manner that you can grab the end to rip it off). also they&#x27;re not lying when they say it gets brittle if you leave it on too long so just take a deep breath and rip it off as soon as it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also it&#x27;s microwavable and works way better when it&#x27;s all melted so you may have to make multiple trips to the microwave until your job is done. it&#x27;s worth it to keep it soft and pliable.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing myself for over 15yrs. I have used a variety of products and this is by far the very very worst. I heated the wax, applied it, went to strip it off... and it wouldn&#x27;t come. I have no idea why not. I have tried repeatedly, using different types of strips, but the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to have any stickiness with which to adhere itself to the strip. So I was left with a green waxy armpit that I had to pick at all morning in order to remove. I&#x27;m only thankful I started on my armpits and not anywhere else...</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face, it did not full off any hairs on my eyebrows or upper lip. It seems to only word well on long thick hairs.</li>
    <li> I am not experienced with wax at all. I just recently got my first professional wax and loved the result but all my friends who have regularly waxed told be that they now do it themselves since it is so much cheaper. So when my hair started to grow back I thought why not. I really liked this product. It was easy to heat up and apply and then from there its all you. It takes some time to get used to applying the wax well and then ripping it off at the right time but once you get it you get results just as good as a professional.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and not as messy as other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It washed off easily with soap and water. I used it on my bikini line and was happy with the results, especially given the cost compared to going to a professional!</li>
    <li> Not at all good.. very harsh on skin ! I will not recommend even not easy to use ! Hate it !</li>
    <li> Took longer to heat then per directions. Was very hard to get off skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is the best wax on the market for waxing the pubic areas without strips. Great Product!</li>
    <li> All of the instructions are in other languages&#x3D; no English.  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Works great. Arrived quick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very easy to use! Idiot proof as long as you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Always test on the back of your hand before using it on more sensitive areas</li>
    <li> I have used other waxing products with strips in the past and GiGi is by far the best product I have ever used.  It dries quickly but is very easy to remove.  On tip...make sure you put a decent layer on because if it is too thin it is hard to grab hold of it to pull it off.  It was the least painful wax removal I have ever experienced also...even compared to a professional wax. It only took me about 10 minutes to wax my bikini compared to 30 minutes with strips. I love GiGi and I will be a forever client!!</li>
