      <li>I love this product---it just WORKS.</li>
      <li>has helped my damaged hair to become more healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I USED ONLY TWICE, BUT I LIKED,</li>
      <li>This Filling serum is put on first....</li>
      <li>Did not work very well.  </li>
      <li>My hair used to be dry, but after a good conditioning with a regular conditioner like Aussie, or Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil, it would be soft, and have bouncy ringlet curls.</li>
      <li>But now it&#x27;s totally unmanageable, one big FRIZZ- ball, NO ringlets, and more straw</li>
      <li>I saw this product on TV- Live Well Network and the segment they showed claimed that this product fixed dry,over-processed, straw-like hair (like mine), but all it did (after TWO treatments!)</li>
      <li>Too expensive for what is, besides it is too much work because you have to combine with the L&#x27;Oreal Serie Expert Fiberceutic Restorative Hair Sealing Treatment, it is not difficult but for the price kerastase can do much better.</li>
      <li>Hair feels like soft silk.</li>
      <li>My hair is supper dry, frizy, and curly, and after my first treatment it&#x27;s still dry and frizy.  </li>
      <li>Its suppose to last ten washes and I know that I probably have to go through at least three more treatments, to notice any improvement, but with my terrible hair I will probably need many more treatments.</li>
      <li>It is helping my thin, fine hair to be stronger, and to finally grow some length to it.  </li>

    <li> Amazing product. If you want a beautiful and shining  hair...just go for it!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on TV- Live Well Network and the segment they showed claimed that this product fixed dry,over-processed, straw-like hair (like mine), but all it did (after TWO treatments!) was make it WORSE! My hair is SO wrecked now it&#x27;s a frizzy MESS! My hair used to be dry, but after a good conditioning with a regular conditioner like Aussie, or Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil, it would be soft, and have bouncy ringlet curls. But now it&#x27;s totally unmanageable, one big FRIZZ- ball, NO ringlets, and more straw-like then EVER!  I am very disappointed as I&#x27;ve tried everything to fix my dry, over-processed hair and this product was my last chance!  I&#x27;m very disappointed and don&#x27;t know what else to do/use.</li>
    <li> I USED ONLY TWICE, BUT I LIKED, BUT I BOUGHT THE FIBERCEUTIC CREAM, AND I USED TOGETHER FOR BEST RESULTS</li>
    <li> It is great. Perfect combination with the Hair sealing treatment. Excellent results. Hair feels like soft silk. Very nice. Love it.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for your hair to promote shine and growth.  Our salon charges $30 per treatment so this is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  has helped my damaged hair to become more healthy.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way split ends are mended and I think it helps with strength, but, it is touted as hair botox and it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this product---it just WORKS.</li>
    <li> Use this every few weeks in my hair and it makes it feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Did not work very well.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any difference from other deep conditioners</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  This must be used with the &amp;#34;Sealing&amp;#34; treatment.  It&#x27;s part of a 2-step process.  This Filling serum is put on first....just one syringe (provided....and about 1/2 of the little bottle), then immediately followed by the &amp;#34;Filling&amp;#34; serum, which is left on for 5 minutes, then rinsed out, and done.  I love it.  It is helping my thin, fine hair to be stronger, and to finally grow some length to it.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVE IT. ITS VERY GOOD REALLY</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what is, besides it is too much work because you have to combine with the L&#x27;Oreal Serie Expert Fiberceutic Restorative Hair Sealing Treatment, it is not difficult but for the price kerastase can do much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to &amp;#34;Hair Fixer&amp;#34;;  a product that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it came with no instructions so I&#x27;ll have to wing it.</li>
    <li> My hair is supper dry, frizy, and curly, and after my first treatment it&#x27;s still dry and frizy.  But, after a couple of washes I noticed it is a tinny-tiny-bit softer.  Its suppose to last ten washes and I know that I probably have to go through at least three more treatments, to notice any improvement, but with my terrible hair I will probably need many more treatments.</li>
