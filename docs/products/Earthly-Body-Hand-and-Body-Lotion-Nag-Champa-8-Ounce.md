<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells so good. I think my skin feels much softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> If this sounds like something you would like, IT IS!! I love this stuff. Wear it everyday! Quality lotion with a great scent</li>
    <li> I love the smell of nag champa and this stuff smells great. it doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the incense but it smells just as good or better. It has a more wholesome smell, and it leaves your skin not only soft and smooth but nourished (has nutrients). I will buy more when I run out, definitely worth the value!</li>
    <li> The scent is intoxicating for those who like nag champa. When I wear this lotion I get many compliments from people around me. Also very moisturizing and the hemp oil works as a deep moisturizer. I do not recommend using it on the face as the oil may break you out a little.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but really strong and sweet. Not quite what I was looking for. My husband hates it. I don&#x27;t mind it in very small quantities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year now. I am obsessed with it. It feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t smell too potent. I get lots of compliments on its scent. It&#x27;s all natural and works, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had this lotion given to me as a sample gift. Looked for it online as it is a great product.</li>
    <li> this is a very strong scent. almost too strong. I&#x27;m very disappointed as I like all of the earthly body products. . I ordered this thinking that two bottles were a great price for this. now I see why it&#x27;s so cheap. besides the packaging that it came in was opened and I&#x27;m surprised that it was delivered to me.</li>
    <li> I love that it is made with hemp seed. It makes my skin feel so soft! And the smell is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> If you love earthly scents like sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, etc...you will LOVE this amazing lotion! The nag champa scent is feminine and delicate with a hint of 1970s to it. The scent lingers all day. I always get compliments or questions about what I&#x27;m wearing when I use this lotion. Men also seem to love it.      It&#x27;s a good quality lotion, too. I have very dry skin and this lotion absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy film. Just a nice healthy glow!    Love Love LOVE this lotion! I wish they made it in a larger size, like 32 oz!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a year ago in Ariz. and had been unable to find it in stores here, so I was so happy to find it, and order through Amazon. I love the Nag Champa sent, and people ask all the time what I&#x27;m wearing, no need for perfume. Love it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this lotion this past Christmas.  It was given to me as a gift.  I loved it so much I don&#x27;t wear any other lotion.</li>
    <li> i have sensitive, acne prone skin and I find this product to be best for my type.  It has an earthy smell like incense which i love.  I will receive tons of compliments.  Also converted many others to use this product as well.  product arrived on expected date.  I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances!  Great price and great scent! I bought it for my friends too! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I use them almost exclusively &amp; have been asked so many times about my scent.  They always say I smell like really great incense.  I&#x27;ve had people say I smell like \\&quot;peace\\&quot;, \\&quot;serenity\\&quot;, etc.  I feel more peaceful when I can smell it on me.  LoL!!  It&#x27;s also a nice, thick lotion &amp; my skin is soft &amp; youthful - I&#x27;m 41.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite lotions. I keep re-ordering it because I always get compliments that I &amp;#34;smell so good.&amp;#34; Nag Champa is my favorite brand of incense, and this smells just like it - very nice.</li>
    <li> This is some of the nicest lotion I have ever used.  Smells wonderful and  when  used daily it really softens  the skin.  It is gentle enough to use even on the face.  I love this product and have replaced all of my lotion  with it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this Nag Champa lotion it leaves my hands very soft and smells fantastic . the best lotion in the world.</li>
    <li> delivered quickly and enjoyed thoroughly</li>
    <li> A friend once gave me a tiny bottle of this and I was instantly hooked and was thrilled to find it here. It is the most moisturing cream I&#x27;ve ever used and the scent is incredible!  Warm, not perfumy. I give it as gifts to my friends. When I wear it occassionally mention that the room smells so nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lotion. It does smell very strong. If you love the smell of nag champa, you will love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is my second order and I plan to keep getting it. It smells and feels good. Good.</li>
    <li> This lotion tends to break out my sensitive skin if I wear it too often, but it smells amazing. I always get compliments when I wear it. Smells just like the incense.</li>
    <li> I decided to try because I am a fan of the nag champa incense..I love the lotion, great smell that last a long time and it was at a great price...I will buy again when I run out..Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Non greasy , softening, smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I gought four bottles, gifted two and kept the rest for myself!</li>
    <li> This was one of the best gifts I have received! I have slightly sensitive skin and most lotions with fragrances make me itch... this does not. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized without a greasy film. A little goes a long way on this lotion. The scent lingers all day, leaving the scent behind on my clothes. If you enjoy warm, earthy scents, you will most likely enjoy this. I have a problem with scents turning \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; on my skin but this stayed warm and musky. I found it to have a SLIGHT powdery undertone which did not take away from the overall earthy and warm Nag Champa scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is made in the USA, is Petroleum and paraben-free, has no animal ingredients and is not tested on animals. The only negatives are the PEG-100 stearate, glyceryl stearate, and phenoxyethanol listed at the end of the ingredients. While not completely natural, it is a product that works wonderful and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use again. And again. And again.</li>
    <li> I received the Nag Champa hand and body lotion today.  Packaging was great, but the pump spouts on both bottles were broken, therefore, I cannot use the pump feature.  I opened the bottle to smell the fragrance of this lotion, but was overwhelmed by the smell.  It is too strong and offensive to me.  I was expecting a pleasant fragrance similar to the hair products I have used.  However, I was quite disappointed with this product and will not order it again.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the incense that I love to burn!  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t smell as good, but it does.</li>
    <li> Excellent, long-lasting Nag Champa smell. I didn&#x27;t think it initially smelled like it, but after it is on the skin...totally!</li>
    <li> The scent is simply amazing, but you must truly love the Nag Champa smell since it&#x27;s really a strong scent. The lotion is very moisturizing. And the price is great. I gave a bottle to my mother &amp; she&#x27;s asking for another..will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the same brand of the nag champa body oil, I love both of these! I do use the oil a little more often, since it is so much easier to just spray on and use, but I also love this lotion! it smells great! (I love the smell of nag champa, and while no beauty product will ever smell just like the incense stick, this still is pretty darn close!), I love the way it made my skin feel, and it is an overall good lotion. I really do recommend this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This lotion is like a sensual whisper...\\&quot;  Everyone asks what I am wearing... no need for perfume anymore - this is my new signature...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Body Lotion for 4 years. I just love the smell and the lotion isn&#x27;t half bad either.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, so I thought I would try it in a lotion.  I am very happy with its packaging and overall the texture of the lotion. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I loved it its so retro and for me very relaxing smell. I have been asked by friends what is that your wearing! so i have to share it with them . Thanx</li>
    <li> I need to order more...  Love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Will totally buy more this is the best lotion both smell and feel and makes my skin so soft to the touch,</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last very long around here --and NOT because of anything lacking in the product or packaging thereof ...These are simply used often :)</li>
    <li> this is a great product - it smells just like the Nag Champa soap and incense - its not heavy on the skin and absorbs quickly leaving skin hydrated and feeling good. no oily residue or film.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very affordable for a quality cream. Reminds me of an eastern temple. There are so many wonderful natural ingredients. I will definitely get more. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and get compliments when I wear it. Or someone will say \\&quot;I smell incense!\\&quot;, Still a compliment to me. I also love that this product is free of parabens!</li>
    <li> Earthly Body Hand and Body Lotion, Nag Champa, 8 oz pk of 2 is the best hand and body lotion ever! it&#x27;s more like a pumpable body butter with the old school scent that will take you back to the days of suede shoes and pants under dresses! The scent is wonderful to me! I like when I first apply as the scent fills the room and makes the room smell like my insence as my daughter says but likes it! It does lighten up over the day but I love it so much that I use every time I use the ladies room for a freshen up on my favorite scent! Try adding a tsp of Now Sweet Almond Oil to the bottle and see just how much your skin will love you for it! Wicked Good!</li>
    <li> I purchased based on others reviews. I just received the product today. I can&#x27;t stop using it! It&#x27;s addicting! It leaves you with the Nag Champa scent that is amazing. My boyfriend just kept saying you smell amazing and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling me.I will be a return customer . I had an amazing bottle of Nag Champa oil that is running out and can no longer purchase it. This product makes up for it hands down. You really don&#x27;t even need to add any additional fragrance as it&#x27;s scent is strong enough without being overly cloying. If you love the scent of Nag Champa this product is for you. Plus you get two bottles that are very reasonably priced. Best purchase I have made in a while.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME!!  It keeps my skin so soft, silky and moisturized all day!!!  I get told all the time that I smell good too!</li>
    <li> We have been buying this product locally for $13.00 per bottle, Seen on Amazon I could get 2 bottles for $13.00  But, Buyer beware, if it looks to good to be true then it is. This is the same bottle, but the lotion is not,  its a brighter white and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. My other Earthly Body lotion has a nice Nag-Champa fragrance, and this stuff has a totally different smell, Don&#x27;t know if I even want to use it since I don&#x27;t know what it is thats in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great. It&#x27;s unique and stays strong for hours. It&#x27;s also smooth and not greasy. Nice value!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of this stuff - not overpowering but certainly better than musk or other produncts.  I purchased the &amp;#34;hemp seed&amp;#34; type but look forward to trying other Nag Champa fragrances.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion after having bought the body oil. I wanted something less heavy on my skin after the shower....having discovered the scent of Nag Chama in an incense stick years ago and falling in love with it I searched on Amazon for items featuring this heavenly scent, and found this lotion. Some might find it heavy, but I think it&#x27;s light...it smells SO good and does a fantastic job of softening and moisturizing my skin! This is also a good deal for not one but two bottles. I kee one in the bathroom and one on my vanity. My boyfriend loves it, too...don&#x27;t even have to wear any other scent! Thanks, Earthly Body and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I just finished my bottle off from christmas of 2011, and am ordering again.  I get tons of compliments on the smell, which to me is a very authentic nag champa smell without the overly soapy odor that you get with a lot of other nag lotions and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I wanted to smell inscensey and it is definitely that!  I mix it with some black opium oil and amber in the winter and with orange oil in the summer :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the record, it works GREAT as a skin softener too ;)</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the way this lotion makes my skin feel but was not happy with the pump bottle. When the bottle is almost empty, it is very difficult to get the remaining lotion out of the bottle. If I order this product again, it will not be in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> love it! smells great, feels good on your hands, I gave one bottle to my daughter in law and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this product based on my experience with natural/herbal based bath and body products as well as numerous online purchases of various types of merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered on time and packaged very well.  I can honestly say the quality of this product is excellent.  The consistency of the cream is outstanding and I was pleased with the amount of fragrance in the cream.  For the reviewer who complained about the pump bottle, this is no different than any other pump bottle they all work the same.  When I get to the bottom of the bottle I unscrew the pump each time until I use up all the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewer who complained about the product being too strong, Nag Champa is a fairly strong fragrance oil.  That is exactly what attracts me to this particular cream.  I hate when companies under scent a product because they are too cheap to add fragrance or essential oils.  I will definitely order this product again and look forward to trying other products!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. The scent is a bit overpowering though. I put it on while I&#x27;m still wet from the shower to thin it out a bit. It is definitely Nag Champa. I guess I&#x27;ll try High Tide next.  I sure do wish they&#x27;d come out with samples for us.</li>
