<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these as &amp;#34;favor&amp;#34; filler for a recently baby shower that was &amp;#34;spa themed&amp;#34;.  They were ok.  A little flimsy, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Love them. Great design and work great!</li>
    <li> So cute! Perfect size</li>
    <li> Fast service &amp; the files are great! As described</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Great Product</li>
    <li> This is not what I ordered, They look nothing like the ones in the picture. The ones in the pic are pink &amp; lavendar. The ones I got are white, purple and orange. I didn&#x27;t even open them- looking to return them.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great little stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Nice cute emery boards.  Bought to give to Jamberry clients and are perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Jamberry vendor events and prizes!</li>
    <li> Ordered these to place in bags for the homeless shelter</li>
    <li> Great and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I hand them out with my avon business card...folks love them</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine, but I received a COMPLETELY different color scheme from shown in the picture. Orange and purple. I would have preferred the ones shown in the listing--it&#x27;s deceptive to ship a different product.</li>
    <li> Great files, good size for giving as gifts with Jamberry samples!!</li>
    <li> I am a Jamberry consultant and these nail files are perfect for what I needed. Super cute, not too rough, and priced just right so that I can send one home with each of my party guests. The true colors of the product are slightly off from what is pictured but otherwise I have no complaints. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> They are almost as shown.  They are purple and RED, however....was hoping for the hot pink color.  I bought them to go with nail polish for a wedding shower, hoping to use the colors of the wedding.  They&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> Purchased these a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; gift items to put in gift packs. Would have been better if EACH had been individually wrapped, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Nice boards and perfect for what we needed them for!</li>
    <li> this are nice for little gifts!</li>
    <li> They wear down quickly only good for a 1 time use and are orange and  dark purple not lavender and pink.</li>
    <li> Cute and fun- great party bag gifts</li>
    <li> Great to give away however price increases every single day! Received mine went to purchase more and price increased 5 dollars then checked 2 days later and now 2 more. Would be a great price if still at original price. Otherwise now u can get more for ur money at walmart or sallys!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for individual client kits and they are the perfect size and grit.  The bulk amount was perfect for setting this kits up.  The design is very cute.</li>
    <li> The ones I received are an ugly orange and purple, not the cute pink and white. I can tell, without taking them out of the package, that they are super flimsy. I bought them to give to my customers with nail wrap orders, but I would be embarrassed to have them associate with the high-quality Jamberry products. They are going back!!!</li>
    <li> These are good files, but their color is not as pictured.</li>
    <li> perfect for jamberry parties</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter&#x27;s cheer team.  We created &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s nail this competition&amp;#34; gift bags and included these along with polish and remover for each girl.  They loved them!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed just wish there were multiple designs</li>
    <li> I bought these to hand out during a vendor show and people were constantly wanting to buy them!  For a bulk item you can&#x27;t get a better price for the product!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughters 18 birthday party along with some nail polishes and they are perfect in size, they fit in the palm of your hands and are a great fit in your makeup bag..</li>
    <li> used for daughters bridal shower and bought the Kleancolor Collection - Awesome pink 12 pack, tied with ribbon and gave as favors</li>
    <li> The emery boards work well but the abrasive surface is very thin so they are not effective for very long.  Luckily you have a few dozen.</li>
    <li> What I asks for.  Perfect size to hand out with my nail samples.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed. They are cute and well made. I will definitely order these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of these emery boards.  They are made beautifully, and are very sturdy.  The money I paid for these cute ones is so well worth it.</li>
    <li> Super cute received all of them.  A hit with my clients</li>
    <li> Very sturdy nail files.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> High quality and just the right price!</li>
    <li> These are short versions of the foam center embryo boards.  I was pleased with the quality.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not the color I wanted. I thought they were purple with pink and they turned out to be purple with red. Other than that the product is great.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and were as described.</li>
    <li> These emery boards are great for a sample manicure that I do with Jamberry. not what I would use for an entire manicure but great for a couple of nails.</li>
    <li> Look great and work well.</li>
    <li> Love these Emery Boards! Price was reasonable especially for the quantity I&#x27;m getting for my Jamberry business.</li>
    <li> Great little item. Keep in purse, desk, car. Gave to daughters for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Files are not like the ones pictured and are flimsier compared to others I&#x27;ve used.  I am surprised by all of the positive comments.</li>
    <li> Great for goodie bags and to give out with my products at in home parties. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good emery boards.  Bought them for thank you gifts at a baby shower.</li>
    <li> These are the cutest little emery boards!  I give them out as prizes with my Jamberry orders.  The only issue I had was the color is a little off... the pink hearts in the photo are actually orange in person, but still very cute!  I&#x27;m happy either way!  The quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist,  I file my nails daily, this  is very handy for me, quick and easy no problem</li>
    <li> Cute. Fun. Love them!</li>
    <li> Not the right color at all but will still do the job!</li>
    <li> Would have been nice to know that this is not the color I would get. I wanted the pink and purple and got white with purple and orange hearts, horrible color combo but will work for my sample packs I suppose.</li>
    <li> Great for a couple uses. The files I recieved have orange and purple hearts and not nearly as cute as the photo depicts.  Ok overall but wish I knew the color was off.</li>
    <li> I will be returning these. There is hardly any grit on them at all</li>
    <li> Perfect for the little girl spa parties I do. Girls love them and they work great.  The design is adorable.</li>
    <li> Used For Baby Shower Gift and worked really nice.  Everyone thought they were so cute!</li>
    <li> These are cute and fun for girls to use, They are good for little gift bags of some goodies to use!</li>
    <li> These served their purpose. I use them in gift bags for new clients. I found out later that I could get better files for the same price elsewhere, but they were good for what I wanted,</li>
    <li> Perfect as an addition for my business (echomayernik.jamberrynails.net) freebie samples!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a little girls spa day with friends or a mommy day spa we did at our school for Mothers Day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet... but I bought it for beauty school while attending for when I have a client. it looks very girly and cute. Wish it came in more of a variety of different design+colors though.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these twice now for my small business and love them! Cute enough to send with little gifts and perfect to carry in my purse! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  This work great and the perfect size for what I need!</li>
    <li> I bought these when they were $6 I would not purchase this at 19 because the grit is barely enough to file one fingernail before it is gone. :/ pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cute and good quality. Perfect grit for filing when applying Jamberry wraps :)</li>
    <li> No where near the same color as the picture shows, it will serve its purpose, just wish it was as advertised.</li>
    <li> LOVE  perfect small size and nice pattern and color. They work as expected...I use as part of a gift for my Jamberry Customers</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the item I received does not match the picture. The colors are very different, and the colors do not work for what I purchased these emery boards for.</li>
    <li> I *might* order again because I&#x27;ve had trouble finding anything better in a reasonable price point for giveaways.  They aren&#x27;t the worst quality yet not good quality either.  They do look exactly as pictured, so they&#x27;re cute.</li>
    <li> These emery boards are perfect for my business and the design gives it a little more fun look to add to it. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I sell a popular nail wrap and bought these for prizes/giveaways and events/in home parties, they are perfect for that and get the job done. Great price, great quality for what I need them for. I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> I purchased these nail filers as marketing material for a DS I work for. I throw one of these nail filers in the gift bag and they are well received. They shipped very quickly and appear to be good quality for a small emery board. I would say they are a medium to course grit.</li>
    <li> Cute and as described</li>
