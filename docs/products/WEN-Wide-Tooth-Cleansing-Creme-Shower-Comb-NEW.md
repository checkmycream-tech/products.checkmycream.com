<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> detangles my hair in the shower very well and excellent for dry hair</li>
    <li> It is a fake. I bought 3 of these combs and they are sharp, angular, and not the right shape. They would definitely damage hair which is the opposite of the Wen combs. I have many real Wen combs and they are smooth everywhere.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping happy with the comb</li>
    <li> I love this comb so much I don&#x27;t use it with the shampoo, I use a knock off. Very soft and sturdy and gets out any and all knots possible with my American-Italian girl hair. I have friends that love it too. Highly recommend for ALL hair types.</li>
    <li> The comb works fantastic for mixed hair. I have thick colored hair and the comb worked like any pick. I would recommend this comb for any one who asked.</li>
    <li> The comb works well but had a very strong plastic smell that never went away. Keep in a ventilated area.</li>
    <li> Like the wide teeth and how hair glides thru.  Good product</li>
    <li> Received very fast!! I have used Wen for 2 years, but never had the comb. This is a heavy great quality comb!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have been a WEN girl for over 4 years now and I have to say my hair has never been nicer.  LOVE Chas Dean and all of his products.</li>
    <li> I live this comb. It is so easy to use and easy to grip in shower. This comb is one ritual used to distribute the cleanser in your hair. Its very durable, not that cheap plastic crap. I would recommend this product to all WEN users. Hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with the hair product. We had problems with the product itself, so this comb will be used to comb conditioner through the hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine  hair, and found the comb was fine, but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.  A good comb, when used.</li>
    <li> The big teeth on this comb did not comb my hair through like the original one did.  I can only use the small teeth portion.  The big teeth seem like it is cut wrong.</li>
    <li> great with tangles getting out and little pain</li>
    <li> This is the worst comb ever!  I have my original comb from Chaz and it is wonderful.  The best comb I have ever had.  I purposely purchased this comb because I wanted an exact backup comb in case I lost the first.  Well, this comb is not like the first.  It hardly goes through your hair.  It says shower comb.  Does that mean it is only for the shower?  There is no way to distinguish between the original comb and this shower comb on line until you get it home.  I don&#x27;t want this comb.  I want the original.  If I could have given zero (0) stars...that&#x27;s what I would have done.</li>
    <li> Yup, i&#x27;s a comb. Does a nice job when I&#x27;m combing!</li>
    <li> These Wen Combs are not made as well as the one I got from Wen Chaz Dean in the year (2011).</li>
    <li> It is the only comb I use.  I like the Sturdy plastic for combing through the hair.  Detangles the toughest tangles with ease.</li>
    <li> Good size, appreciate that (so far) it has not broken when dropped.  It definetly works well with the WEN shampoo. It&#x27;s also nice to have both the fine tooth and wide tooth comb in one.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I lost my WEN comb...well my grand-daughter &amp;#34;borrowed it&amp;#34; LOL! she&#x27;s 2. I look all over and couldn&#x27;t find it, so I decided to see if I could order a new one. I looked on Amazon and much to my surprise I found one. I ordered it and when it got it I was disappointed, it seems to be a knock-off. It&#x27;s the same shape but isn&#x27;t the same quality, the edges of the teeth are much sharper than the original comb that I have, oh btw I found the one my g-d borrowed, and then could compare the two. Lets just say I&#x27;m glad that I found my comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is exactly what was described and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I does not break my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  You.</li>
    <li> These combs are nothing like the originals I got from QVC.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for four months now and I love it! My hair length is medium to long. I got this comb thinking it would be the best thing ever. My hair is usually tangled when I take a shower so once I applied my WEN and went to comb it through with the comb it pulled my hair. It hurts because of it being a hard thick plastic with no give. I would suggest just using a wet/dry brush in the shower instead because the bristles will move with your hair and not cause any pulling or breaking.</li>
    <li> The teeth ends are rough and scratches the scalp unlike the previous comb I received originally along with my Wen initial purchase where the comb teeth are rounded.</li>
    <li> These are clearly either fakes or rejects. Normally the teeth of a comb comes to a point. The end of the teeth are so wide you can&#x27;t comb anything.  Save your money.</li>
