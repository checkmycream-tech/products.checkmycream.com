      <li>So, in my latest efforts to figure this problem out, have bought several John Frieda products, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer</li>
      <li>John Frieda Frizz-Ease Clearly Defined Style Holding Gel is advertised as helping to calm curly hair and prevent frizz.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I causes so much build up that you&#x27;d have to wash your hair after ever use.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon for having just about everything.</li>
      <li>Which doesn&#x27;t really work with curly hair.</li>
      <li>This gel really helps define the curls and holds them in place even in humid weather.  </li>
      <li>and he really likes it.</li>
      <li>Wish I could still purchase this in the stores, it works very well for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a product of the John Frieda Corporation and is quite reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products for my mostly curly hair, but they are either too oily or do not keep my  hair from frizzing</li>
      <li>Use much more than they recommend, apply to damp not wet hair, massage through hair, especially the ends.</li>
      <li>Purchasing many a buy from today on to other today&#x27;s later!</li>
      <li>It dries soft, so no one can tell you have product in your hair</li>
      <li>, we have long hot humid summers in Wilmington, North Carolina, my home.</li>
      <li>It enhances my curls, defines them without being heavy or &amp;#34;crunchy,&amp;#34; and helps control the frizzies and is light weight.  </li>
      <li>And my hair is naturally curly with a tendency to frizz.  </li>
      <li>They instruct that the user should distribute the gel evenly through damp hair, and that, for looser, naturally wavy hair, the user should rake fingertips through hair to define its wave pattern.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hair gel that can hold my frizzy hair under control no matter how high the humidity is...</li>
      <li>The company adds that its alcohol-free formula with encapsulated silicone beads will allow the user to  smooth and define curls and prevent frizz; that it will provide a soft, workable yet lasting hold that isn&#x27;t stiff, sticky or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I like John Frieda products in general.  </li>

    <li> this is great stuff. it works for my wiry white hair.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  It works best on wet clean hair.  After I apply it all over my hair, I twist my hair into curls using my fingers, scrunch from the bottom, and pull hair up from the root to give it volume.  It dries soft, so no one can tell you have product in your hair (once it&#x27;s dry)  I let my hair air dry for best results.</li>
    <li> Getting harder to find this hair gel in the stores anymore.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  I have curly hair &amp; wear it curly.  This gel holds my curls thru the Houston humidity.  I also use it with the Frizz Ease Serum.  I like that the this gel doesn&#x27;t have a sweet smell, as I don&#x27;t need to attract anymore mosquitos!.  The seller got me the product quickly with my Prime membership.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Wish I could still purchase this in the stores, it works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gel but not too stiff, can use a small amount of it.</li>
    <li> This gel really helps define the curls and holds them in place even in humid weather.  Good product, and very affordable also.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, I turned to the internet and praise fortune found what I wanted.  It works for me and when I run out of it, if my local stores still don&#x27;t have it in stock, I will resort to the internet again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good strong hold. Very Slick.</li>
    <li> my hair tends to be dry so I always appreciate something without the alcohol content.  Plus it&#x27;s nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel that can hold my frizzy hair under control no matter how high the humidity is... It is tops!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for my mostly curly hair, but they are either too oily or do not keep my  hair from frizzing out.&lt;br /&gt;This helps keep  my hair &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; and looking great</li>
    <li> This gel is really good. Got it for my husband and he really likes it. Does the job well. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the Frizz Ease Clearly Defined Style Holding gel (Curly) and have not been able to find it in the stores or online so I went with this gel instead.
