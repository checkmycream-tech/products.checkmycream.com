      <li>It absorbed quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just love this. I have been using this for few years now and its the best. it dries out quickly yet protect me from that annoying static shocks when I touch any metal during winter and keep my skin look human not like some lizard&#x27;s skin. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is the best of the best for a straight forward lotion that is not filled with perfumes. I am bummed it is no longer a add on item or part of the super saving shipping. It now has a shipping cost of 5 dollars or more. I will not be ordering it for that price in shipping. Bummed. Love the lotion and the deal they once had. I hope they come back to offering it with a shipping deal and a subscription option. Great lotion... go back to the shipping deal!</li>
    <li> With all of the botanicals and other ingredients that are found in most moisturizers these days, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product is very basic. Even for hyper-sensitive combination skin like mine. I don&#x27;t just use it on my body, but a small amount works well for facial moisturizing as well after cleansing.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best lotion to bring your skin relief after a tattoo has been done on you. Replenishes the skin and brings the tattoo to life!!</li>
    <li> Are you serious do you really need a review for lotion? Fine whatever, it works well, just like most lotions do.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HELPS WITH ROUGH AND DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> Smells great and not greasy</li>
    <li> I have skin problems and my doctor suggested this product.  It seems to keep my skin from itching.</li>
    <li> I have sensive skin and this stuff is the only thing that I can use without looking like I have a third degree burn after using it. I only wish Ludriderm would make one that is a facail and has SPF.</li>
    <li> This is great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for long time.  Not sticky and really helps the skin.  I like the 24 oz. so I do not need to worry that I will run out of supply soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is easily absorbed by our body and is nice and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Many of my reviews on here for products like this will often be 5 stars. Quite simply, I&#x27;ve bought several of them before and because I like the product, I buy it again. Lubriderm is one such. It&#x27;s usually quite pricey in the stores. I can&#x27;t say that I save a &amp;#34;ton of money&amp;#34; by purchasing it on here but it&#x27;s competitively priced and it saves me a trip to a pharmacy often full of contagious people (which is why they go to the pharmacy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. In fact, this is mostly scentless - which I greatly prefer.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Lubriderm for the last two years, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I will concede that I have very sensitive skin.    Persuaded by the ads - the gorgeous lady and the alligator, I used this - and I insisted on using this, though it caused a terrible rash on my legs.  It wasn&#x27;t a rash exactly but my skin was blotchy, red, swollen like I had been thrashed.  More like welts.  I had hoped it was something else.  Or temporary.  It was cured and two things cured it.  I stopped using Lubriderm and diligently applied cortisone.  Plus it smelled like paint.  Never again.</li>
    <li> This is our family skin moisturizer since our son was a toddler.  I like the fact that it has no scent, it does not get in the way of perfume or cologne worn over it.  Reliably good to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Lubriderm for 25 years now. I like it because you do not have to keep putting more on. Other lotions have perfumes that make the hands dry out.</li>
    <li> This lotion is my #1 go to lotion. Have tried many lotions in the past, but always come back to Lubriderm. It absorbed quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Great price on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  My arms and hands can dry out and crack during the winter.  I like the non-fragrance type.  Reasonable price and does the job.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes great and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy!  My skin is on the dry side so it&#x27;s a bit difficult to find lotions that do the job as far as moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.  I also live in Florida, a very hot, humid climate where a heavy lotion that leaves you greasy just makes you sweat more. This lotion absorbed into my skin with no residue, and moisturizes great so I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I suffered third degree burns in 43% of my body twenty years ago and I haven&#x27;t found a better lotion to keep my scared skin moisturize.  Very good lotion.</li>
    <li> best price anywhere!!!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Lubriderm lotion. It isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a light and fresh scent. We have a wood-burning stove and live in a cold climate, so this lotion is useful for hands, body and feet. The moisture lasts 24 hours says the company. It is good for the whole family as the scent isn&#x27;t feminine or masculine.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin. When I put on lotion I feel like my skin is in a casket or itchy or just icky.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on with little to no scent. It is clean and does not make my hands feel clammy when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Neutrogena lover. However, this is the one I use on my hands, arms and legs. I keep one in the car and one by my chair.</li>
    <li> I used another Lubriderm and I liked more than this one .. in my skin feeling did not last hydration, however I like to use. it&#x27;s good cream.</li>
    <li> ...Eucerin, which I have decided to reserve for once-a-week and depths-of-winter use because it&#x27;s a good bit more expensive compared to the Lubriderm twin-pack that my local warehouse club sells.  My dermatologist recommended both brands but said that the Eucerin was the &amp;#34;heaviest OTC cream&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s what I tried first at the time, due to a particularly bad case of &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; which I originally thought was some sort of fungal infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubriderm is indeed a lighter cream, with a different tactile characteristic---it&#x27;s lighter yet feels slicker or more slippery/slimy when applying, and also seems to take a little bit longer to soak into the skin completely.  I get the impression the Eucerin is more expensive for a reason, but in any case will continue to use both this way.</li>
    <li> i developed a skin condition and my doctor ordered a prescription product which i used and when it was gone he said it would be very appropriate to use Lubriderm to keep the skin moisten.  The prescription was greasy but the lubriderm melts on the skin and does not rub into bedding.</li>
    <li> Though got wife prefers the extra dry skin on it still does the job till the next purchase where I would got with the extra dry skin</li>
    <li> I had this brand recommended as medically designed to promote healing and healthy skin. So I was startled to discover it has fragrance in it! I only used 1/4 of a pea size portion of lotion, but even after washing my hands three times and I still can&#x27;t get the fragrance off. It&#x27;s making me quesy, my hands are somewhat itchy, I&#x27;m having trouble breathing, and it&#x27;s making me lightheaded. If you have any chemical sensitivity, beware: this product will make you sick.</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF AND GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> real  stuff as described in listing, shipped fast. we liked it, keep it up. i may recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted plenty of money on moisturizing lotions that I use once and throw away. The one thing I&#x27;m looking for in a cream is that it not be sticky. Amazingly hard to find -- two that I&#x27;ve recently discarded (or downgraded to foot creams) are [[ASIN:B001IM5VT4 Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer SPF 15]] and [[ASIN:B00DG8F02Q Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion]]. I bought a travel size of this Lubriderm and absolutely love it. It completely blends in, leaving no sticky or greasy feeling. And it works on dry, winter skin.</li>
    <li> This is lightly scented in a clean scent. I&#x27;m super sensitive with odors and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies at all. Its not a watery or a greasy lotion. Its thick and creamy and soaks.in your skin fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I want something that&#x27;s effective and non-greasy at a good price.  Good on all counts.</li>
    <li> This lotion is ok but I have very dry skin as I am an older woman and I love this brand but ordered the wrong one, should have gotten the one for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great lotion - really moisturizes.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion at an affordable price! The bottles came wrapped individually in the off chance that it opened during shipment, which was not an issue.</li>
    <li> I use Lubriderm daily. I like the way it soaks into my skin and leaves it soft but not greasy. Other lotions I&#x27;ve tried have not moisturizrd my skin for a full 24 hours the way Lubriderm does.</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s the most effective lotion.  I wish it was organic that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;d change.  But I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other organic and great smelling lotions but none of them work as well for keeping my skin hydrated and soft.  I&#x27;m a man and I still remember a past girlfriend being shocked because my skin is so soft.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10+ years and eating healthy.  I know that&#x27;s why my skins in great shape.</li>
    <li> Not recommended for skin health in general...</li>
    <li> Love lubriderm. It is not so greasy but moisturises body well. Have been using this product for a couple of yeArs.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, dries fast, delicate scent, and has a nice white color.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from an everyday lotion.  I use it after showering and also after washing the hands.  From all the basic household lotion brands I&#x27;ve used in the past-- Aveeno, Cetaphil, Vaseline, Jergens, and Nivea-- Lubriderm&#x27;s lotions are my favorite.  Will not be replaced anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This is a quality skin care product and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken part. I can&#x27;t press when I used. Every day, I open the bottle and use it. It is horrible. I disappointed online shopping.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, I like the large size and the great price so I ordered two of them and they arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Again Amazon provides a great product at a great price!  A 16 oz bottle at any local store I go to costs about $7.75 or more on a regular basis.  This offer is just cheaper.  Bottom line: You are getting more for less and free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat it with a wooden stick, as my Dad used to say.  We go through a lot of this stuff as we&#x27;re older and our skin is rotting off our bones as happens as you get old.  I have vascular issues and have to use it under Dr.&#x27;s orders and my wife needs it as well.  Best price I&#x27;ve ever found.  To Amazon: Thanks for letting people like me have things I can afford on a fixed income i wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy otherwise.</li>
    <li> Trust this name until I found out about the harmful chemicals (Paraben). All lubriderm moisture I bought go straight to the trask.</li>
    <li> By far, this is the best undereye cream. It gets rid of dark circles just like that.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff! I have very dry skin and it hydrates very nicely.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of using Vaseline, I thought I&#x27;d give Lubriderm a try. Big mistake: within a week or two I developed a rash on every inch of my face and body -- redness, bumps, uncontrollable itching, etc. I&#x27;ve never had a physical allergic reaction to any product in my life (I&#x27;m 33), and it took three visits to a dermatologist, three exotic prescription creams, and four months of sleepless nights before I could get the outbreak under control. Apparently I solved the problem too late, because here I am a year later with permanent scars and discolorations all over. Needless to say, I am not a satisfied customer.  My reaction seems to be common. Just Google &amp;#34;Lubriderm reaction&amp;#34; and check out the boatload of victims on the first link alone (the MedHelp message boards).  I suggest trying another brand first. Right now I&#x27;m having a good experience with Curel.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. And a fantastic value as an add on item. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> According to my dermatologist, you are supposed to moisturize 4-5 times or even more in a day!  I do slack off a lot on moisturizing my skin.  Upon research, I saw a lot of recommendations for Lubriderm.  This specific one is good for those sensitive with smell it is not scented.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, which what really attracted me in the first place!  It&#x27;s perfect for everyday moisturizing with not a lingering scent to make your head pound.</li>
    <li> This lotion is not too creamy and not too watery. I love the consistency. It does wonders on my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> A Dermatologist in Beverly Hills Calif.  gave me a bottle of this lotion many years ago and I am still using it, simply because it works. It keeps my dry skin moist with a clean non greasy feel. Lubriderm is a wonderful product and Thanks to Amazon for providing a way that I can get it at a great price .</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job cheaply and well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice light, clean scent and my skin absorbs it quickly. Moisturizes well. I usually use it on my legs, arms, and face after I finish taking a shower. However, be warned that it feels slimy if you come in contact with water when it hasn&#x27;t been fully absorbed. I like that it has a surprisingly short and simple list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> Excellent time proven lotion. Most Tattoo artists worth their salt recommend Lubriderm for both before and after care. It keeps a new tattoo moist and prevents the leakage of ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubriderm is the number one recommended moisturizer by Dermatogens and with good reason. No harsh chemicals, safe for most any part of the body including your face and is non greasy. Not only was this bottle less expensive, with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot.</li>
    <li> Good product but the hand pump quits while there is still about an inch in the bottom. Then you have to remove the pump and shake out the rest Not exactly hi-tech!</li>
    <li> works well on extra dry skin</li>
    <li> Your skin is the largest organ of your body and it&#x27;s important to keep your body healthy both inside and outside. But sometimes harsh environments can get your skin feeling a little drab. I&#x27;ve used many different types of lotion to relieve days where my skin is really dry and sometimes itchy. None of the dry skin lotions I&#x27;ve tried helped. Most smelled horrible, left a oily feeling on your skin, and didn&#x27;t heal or relieve the dry skin. I received this in a Gift set for Christmas and it came with Two(2) Large bottles and a small portable one. The large 24 oz. lasts forever !! I still have mine and there&#x27;s still plenty of lotion left in the bottle. I use it every time I get out of the shower and my skin feels soft, smooth, and it leaves you with a soft fragrance that is pleasant rather than over powering or disgusting. I&#x27;m definitely making this my permanent lotion to keep my skin healthy and soft. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great lotion that works.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> I liked it very much. Very good for the price. Good value. I prefer though the Lubriderm Advanced Therapy is better</li>
    <li> This lotion is so amazing.  If you are sunburned apply liberally and not only will you feel better, but you probably will not peel.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion because it sinks it easily and does not make you look oily. Really does help with cracked and dry skin! Still probably not as good as the red version of this.</li>
    <li> i recently started using this moisturizer and will say I am very satisfied. Ive used it all over including a little for my hair at times. a little goes a long way, it moisturizes quickly, does not feel greasy, and does not clog my pores, for the price and quantity, it is a great deal, i was worried that it would cause breakouts, but this moisturizer is so light, it feels great and does what it is supposed to, I will be buying again</li>
    <li> Top quality at a reasonable price, what more can you say?</li>
    <li> This loction is perfect. Easy to wear and I love that fast absorbancy. It absorbs faster than most of other brands. Leaves skin soft and smell good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s a shame they changed the scent. I liked the old scent better</li>
    <li> Good lotion. I&#x27;m so moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for at least 2 years. I love it! I don&#x27;t like lotion that&#x27;s too sticky, so this one is perfect. Arrived 1 day early :)</li>
    <li> Lubriderm was recommended by a dermatologist but I like it because it works well with my skin.  Moisturizes without greasy feel and light.  I use it alot so like the large bottle.  Only complaint I have is that the pump tube isn&#x27;t long enough to reach the bottom and when you get to the end of the bottle, you have to just tamp it out.  It&#x27;s a great product so why do you encourage wasting this way??</li>
    <li> It the best for tattoos. It work geart.</li>
    <li> I actually got this for a gift for a friend that has psoriasis and this is the only lotion she has found doesn&#x27;t make it worse.  I was thinking that it was kind of a lame gift but when I gave it to her she almost cried.  This lotion is kinda of pricey so I couldn&#x27;t imagine this being the only lotion that you can use and not be able to afford it.  Anywho!  Great lotion and she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was fragrance free and itisn&#x27;t.  it came while  was in the hospital and my husband opened it and threw away the shipping and return paper work so I can&#x27;t send it back.  I will not be ordering it again.</li>
