      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>I am a 63 yr old Great Grandma of 4</li>
      <li>First off it came TWO days early which is always great!</li>
      <li>I also got the purple to pink and put it on my finger nails and loved amazing my friends with the color change before their eyes!</li>
      <li>It also dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>most fun is doing dishes ..</li>
      <li>This are cute, but flake right off.</li>
      <li>have always liked this two-tone polish for summer, and while I do not use a gel, glad to see it comes in gel as well as regular polish  </li>
      <li>The orange/yellow transition is so cool.</li>
      <li>It dries extremely fast which is good because in order to get the color really bright you need at least 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Not a really good quality, but great color change!</li>
      <li>Polish is a pretty color BUT DOES NOT CHANGE COLOR, and I gave two for gifts!</li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work good on long nails that are real.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so much fun for the past hour running it under warm and cool water and watching the change!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Neat, i&#x27;m excited to see new colors...</li>
      <li>I am going to be ordering several more colors..</li>
      <li>The polish does exactly what it advertises.</li>
      <li>fun to use in the summer, and it really works</li>
      <li>I love the colors, its like wearing 2 nail polishes at the same time.</li>
      <li>the hot water makes it the mango/yellow and</li>
      <li>Fun little polish though actuallychanged color nicely but does not stay on.</li>
      <li>I had nit sen it for a long time and am glad  now know where to locate it and its sister two-tone colors.</li>
      <li>Buy a good top coat use white as base and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>When painted it is really pretty in which the nail color is yellow with an instant color change to orange on the tip of the nail for a great french tip design.</li>
      <li>Reasonable shipping time.</li>
      <li>Really neat...</li>
      <li>It drys really fast so that won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO KEEP POLISHING THERE NAILS EVERY DAY</li>
      <li>also it takes a good 6 coats to get the intense color , but it does dry fast REALLY fast ..going back for a different color..</li>
      <li>it does change color though it&#x27;s kind of dull...</li>
      <li>If you put a layer of clear coat on it stays on much longer and still changes color.</li>
      <li>probably it&#x27;s the same with all color changing nail polishes, first time trying it</li>
      <li>have to put on some clear for shine</li>
      <li>I put it on my toe nails and topped it off with a clear coat</li>
      <li>I put a clear gloss over it and the colors STILL CHANGE...</li>
      <li>As product dries and warms bed turns vibrant canary yellow.</li>
      <li>It is however very dull and a shiny top coat is a must.</li>
      <li>CHIPS , BARELY CHANGED</li>
      <li>SO DID MY DAUGHTER.JUST WISH THE BOTTLE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER  OR MAYE IM JUST USING IT TO MUCH</li>

<li> I only gave 3 stars because it is a flat finish</li>
<li> The only thing that doesn&#x27;t give it a five stars is that it takes about 6-8 layers for the color to be dark enough.</li>
<li> Only complaint (and I knew this before I bought it) is that it&#x27;s dull, there is no shine like other nail polish but other reviews say that it still works with a top coat</li>
<li> goes on a little to thin other then that fine</li>
<li> Polish does not change colors as I expected.</li>
<li> Only problem is that the color is faint, so multiple coats are needed.</li>
<li> Please remember to put on a base coat because it will stain your nails &amp; it seemed to chip rather quickly.</li>
<li> DESCRIPTION IS FALSE.</li>
<li> the color change based on temperature like putting your hand under cold water.</li>
<li> the Cold water makes it the Papaya/Orange.  </li>
<li> but I use ultra nail growth by ruby kissing as a base coat (trying to grow my nails out)</li>

    <li> Chips momentarily! Not a really good quality, but great color change! I would only recommend to expect to wear this product for a day only.</li>
    <li> This are cute, but flake right off.</li>
    <li> CHIPS , BARELY CHANGED</li>
    <li> I have been looking for color changing nail polish that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. This color is bright and great for summer. I put it on my toe nails and topped it off with a clear coat and it lasted for over a week without chipping until I removed it myself. I also got the purple to pink and put it on my finger nails and loved amazing my friends with the color change before their eyes!</li>
    <li> love the color changes, just chips easily.</li>
    <li> Polish is a pretty color BUT DOES NOT CHANGE COLOR, and I gave two for gifts!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this. Add one coat of white polish and then the color for that awesome POP of color</li>

    <li> awesome I enjoy standing in the sun or playing in water .... well worth the money also this would make a perfect gift for any age.</li>
    <li> The problem I had polish would not stay on finger nails, rating 2stars only because it stayed on my toes.</li>
    <li> Even though the polish chips rather easily, I liked it. If you put a layer of clear coat on it stays on much longer and still changes color. It also dries very quickly. I love the colors, its like wearing 2 nail polishes at the same time. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Polish chip after applied. Even with topcoat</li>
    <li> item as described! mom loved it!</li>
    <li> LOVED THE COLOR N SO DID MY DAUGHTER.JUST WISH THE BOTTLE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER  OR MAYE IM JUST USING IT TO MUCH</li>
    <li> I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS THIS POLISH BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO KEEP POLISHING THERE NAILS EVERY DAY</li>

    <li> I am a 63 yr old Great Grandma of 4 and I love doing my nails...I ordered this and forgot to read the reviews but did the day I got it and I just love this ..Really neat...like others had said that is not shiny ...I put a clear gloss over it and the colors STILL CHANGE...most fun is doing dishes ..the hot water makes it the mango/yellow and the Cold water makes it the Papaya/Orange.  I am going to be ordering several more colors..I actually like having each nail a different color...so I think these work as advertised and good price....</li>
    <li> perfect everyone loves this  Thank you</li>
    <li> i did not like this color.</li>
    <li> I put on this polish and the changing colors are great.  However it chipped the next day on all my nails.</li>
    <li> i dont like the color</li>
    <li> No the Polish don&#x27;t work as I  thought the the Polish didnt have the shine as I thought.  The uv Ray gel polish works better. I dont like the Polish at all.</li>
    <li> does just what it says it does.. I only gave 3 stars because it is a flat finish have to put on some clear for shine also it takes a good 6 coats to get the intense color , but it does dry fast REALLY fast ..going back for a different color..I do like the orange / yellow</li>
    <li> Very cool. Works as it should</li>
    <li> Applied one day chip off the next sbout twice. Fun little polish though actuallychanged color nicely but does not stay on.</li>
    <li> Works just as the image shows. I love my polish!</li>
    <li> First off it came TWO days early which is always great! The color change is awesome and is very noticeable I&#x27;ve had so much fun for the past hour running it under warm and cool water and watching the change! It dries extremely fast which is good because in order to get the color really bright you need at least 3 coats. Only complaint (and I knew this before I bought it) is that it&#x27;s dull, there is no shine like other nail polish but other reviews say that it still works with a top coat so I will try that soon. It&#x27;s incredible and an would make an awesome gift!!</li>
    <li> it does change color though it&#x27;s kind of dull... probably it&#x27;s the same with all color changing nail polishes, first time trying it</li>
    <li> Love the color changes. It&#x27;s quick and very noticeable. It is however very dull and a shiny top coat is a must.</li>
    <li> Reasonable shipping time. Only problem is that the color is faint, so multiple coats are needed. It drys really fast so that won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Good nail polish, I love the color change but unless u out a top coat on top it chips and flakes off.</li>
    <li> DESCRIPTION IS FALSE. the color change based on temperature like putting your hand under cold water.</li>
    <li> goes on a little to thin other then that fine</li>
    <li> It works , It changes color based on temperature. I haven&#x27;t experienced any chipping yet but I use ultra nail growth by ruby kissing as a base coat (trying to grow my nails out) that&#x27;s probably why but I love 💛</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish. Beautiful transition. Buy a good top coat use white as base and you&#x27;re good to go. This doesn&#x27;t chip any more than normal polish just buy a good top coat. Mine lasts 4-5 days. The orange/yellow transition is so cool. Great for summer!  So many compliments.</li>
    <li> Polish does not change colors as I expected. Dissatisfied..</li>
    <li> The polish does exactly what it advertises. The problem I have is that the brush leaves streaks so you have to put on multiple coats. Please remember to put on a base coat because it will stain your nails &amp; it seemed to chip rather quickly. Not my favorite...</li>
    <li> Definitely needs topcoat-dries matte.  Goes on a gorgeous lightly frosted cantalope.  As product dries and warms bed turns vibrant canary yellow.</li>
    <li> The color is like what is displayed and it changes instantly according to the temperature. When painted it is really pretty in which the nail color is yellow with an instant color change to orange on the tip of the nail for a great french tip design. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t give it a five stars is that it takes about 6-8 layers for the color to be dark enough.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good on long nails that are real.</li>
