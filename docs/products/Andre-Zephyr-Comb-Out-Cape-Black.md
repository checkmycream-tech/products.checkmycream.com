<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not what I expect. Is very small</li>
    <li> Nice size to use it for makeup, do not make people sweat</li>
    <li> This does the trick. It comes together in the back with velcro. The material is nice quality. I&#x27;ve used it doing a couple hair treatments now and I love not worrying about staining my shoulders or clothes. Simple, well-made. Everyone who does their own hair treatments or cuts should have one.</li>
    <li> I used it to protect my clothes while feeding a very active infant. I like that it washes very easily.</li>
    <li> My favorite comb out cape for makeup applications and simple hair styling! I wish they had an option for the same size but with a button instead of velcro</li>
    <li> Good protection from hairspray - just enough coverage leaving arms free to style. It is just what I needed and was true as advertised.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s bigger than i expected. hair falls off anf is easy to clean</li>
    <li> This works very well to keep the color on your hair and not your clothes.  I also use it when dying my eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I got it because my back was breaking out from hairspray.  This works great and have not had any out breaks since I started using it.  Nice size and Velcro which really helps for better more precise closure no matter what size your neck is.</li>
    <li> The little comb out cape is perfect for me!  The length is just right to protect my shoulders without hampering the movement of my arms.  Any girl, or guy, who colors at home would like this product.</li>
    <li> I needed something to drape over my shoulders to keep my hair spray from messing up my clothing.  This is a very small cape, but it does exactly what I needed it for.  If you need it for cutting hair, I would think about getting a bigger size that covers more of the body; this only goes over the shoulders.</li>
    <li> Quality of the product is Okay. Fabric was a bit thin and size was a bit smaller than expected. Product was shipped immediately which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for hair cutting but I use it as well for applying makeup. Just bought an air brush for foundations, etc. and it is excellent for keeping the light overspray film from getting on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Keeps your clothing from getting messed up while applying makeup.  Just recently I forgot to put it on when doing my makeup and for the first time ever dropped my mascara wand, which really placed some mean stains on the top I was wearing.  I won&#x27;t forget that cape next time.  Also, works very well keeping hair spray off clothing.</li>
    <li> Great us in my salon when lightening hair, very useful to not damage my aprons.</li>
    <li> This cape was a requirement when taking a makeup artistry class.  This is perfect size, and it works as it is supposed to.  The quality is very good.</li>
    <li> I use this cape when doing my hair and make-up to keep my clothes clean.  I works really great for that purpose.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this cape.  It is lightweight and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> this cape works well. It covers to the belly button area. Holds up well and makeup or product wipes off easily</li>
    <li> I am a freelance MUA and a beginner at that. I needed just a cape which would protect my clients clothing that wasnt too expesive. Its easy to carry around and does what I need it to do. I would recommend if you were into Makeup. Not sure about hair but Im sure it would work fine there as well (since it was designed for that).</li>
    <li> The material is excellent quality. My only problem with it is that it only comes down the front and it&#x27;s kind of small. As a man, it doesn&#x27;t fit all that great. Maybe it would be much better for a smaller person.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Prevents getting hairspray on my cloths. I was pleased by the quality. Not plastic but nylon. Cleans easily and very sturdy. Velcro closure and hanging loop too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product it does what I need it to do.  It&#x27;s not thin and should hold up for quite sometime.</li>
    <li> I trim and color my hair every week; I use this half cape to make it easy and fast.  Just enough protection to keep everything off of me- easy to put on and off.  Cleans fabulously- never stained by bleach. Looks brand new after a year.</li>
    <li> Wore this last night coloring my hair and it&#x27;s well worth the investment. Didn&#x27;t soil anything I wore underneath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cape for a good while, and it&#x27;s still in good shape after using it every day. Washes nicely; just remember to fasten the velcro before washing, or it catches on the hem, or other finer fabrics.</li>
