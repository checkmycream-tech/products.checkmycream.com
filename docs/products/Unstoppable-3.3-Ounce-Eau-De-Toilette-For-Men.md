      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as deep, rich or masculine as Unforgivable, but it&#x27;s close enough and a wonderful scent&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent and price, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the high priced designer name but still wanted the same overall appealing fragrance</li>

      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like unstoppable</li>

      <li>Smells almost identical EXCEPt to smell isn&#x27;t deeply enriched as the original.</li>
      <li>It is dirt cheap and the scent lingers for days on your cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to Unforgivable by Sean John.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>So i was very surprised by the fragrance.</li>
      <li>After putting it on and getting positive review from my female friends, I knew this is the scent that suits me.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my son who would only wear the real deals until he tried this.  </li>
      <li>But doesn&#x27;t last long, and don&#x27;t spray too much because it can become OVERPOWERING!</li>
      <li>, it is similar to the real thing, but smelling them side by side you can definitely tell the difference.</li>

    <li> cheap but effective. I get lot&#x27;s of compliments wearing this.</li>
    <li> I got is for my husband because I couldn&#x27;t afford unforgivable Sean John and it smells soo good just like the Sean John I will be buying more when he runs out he loves it too ;)</li>
    <li> This product has a good unique smell that attracts the attention of the opposite SEX. But doesn&#x27;t last long, and don&#x27;t spray too much because it can become OVERPOWERING!</li>
    <li> Same name, same bottle, not same scent! I ordered this for my fiance because it&#x27;s his favorite, but, although the name and bottle are exactly the same, the scent is not the same.  I guess the kind that comes with body gel and aftershave is different from this.</li>
    <li> The ladies love it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance,but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last a long time. After about 1-2hrs you need to re-apply</li>
    <li> Love this product..... I purchased it for $3.50/3.3oz at Big Lots. (a thrift store) Comparably, this is expensive via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not very good.Bought two bottles,they did not even smell the same,and neither one smelled the same as the bottle I had.Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who would only wear the real deals until he tried this.  He is now hooked on the knock off versions and they say you a lot of money too</li>
    <li> I really like unstoppable</li>
    <li> Unforgivable by Sean John is the only cologne my son has been wearing for the last 5 years so I purchased this and was curious to see what he thought of Unstoppable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is similar to the real thing, but smelling them side by side you can definitely tell the difference. It&#x27;s not quite as deep, rich or masculine as Unforgivable, but it&#x27;s close enough and a wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent and price, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the high priced designer name but still wanted the same overall appealing fragrance</li>
    <li> I am very picky with colonge and this is defiently a good scent for a generic brand. Last for days on my clothes and has strong scent that women love. I would defiently recommend to any guy out there. Only thing is why I gave it four stars was the price of 19.99. It&#x27;s a little high.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the experience</li>
    <li> Heck yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I first had this cologne recommended to me from a friend. After putting it on and getting positive review from my female friends, I knew this is the scent that suits me. It smells great; it is like nothing I have tried before. It is dirt cheap and the scent lingers for days on your cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to Unforgivable by Sean John.&lt;br /&gt;This contains sicilian lemon, italian bergamot, green mandarin, moroccan tangerine, grapefruit, juniper leaves, birch leaves, champagne accord, mediterranean air accord, tuscan basil, florentine iris, clay sage, lavender, cashmere accord, australian sandalwood, amber, tonka bean, rum.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> So i was very surprised by the fragrance. It has a uncanny resemblance to Sean John Unforgivable. Smells almost identical EXCEPt to smell isn&#x27;t deeply enriched as the original. However Great scent, sure to please and delight, by the way it came VERY quick.&lt;br /&gt;I give the fragrance an 8 outa 10</li>
    <li> Great Fragrance. Just as described. Fast Shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne! My mom bought it for my boyfriend one christmas, couldnt find it again. I googled and searched and found it here. I bought two bottles! He loves it! I even wear it! Great price and excellent  customer service! I will continue to order from here! Thank You!</li>
    <li> This was the best price I have seen! I ordered five bottles! My friend loved!Shipped quick!My friend wants me to order more for him! He loves the smell! I paid more for shipping and I did not like that!</li>
