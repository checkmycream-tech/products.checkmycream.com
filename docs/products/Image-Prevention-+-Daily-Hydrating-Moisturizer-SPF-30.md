<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best mositurizer I have ever used. Try it you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
    <li> Awful cream, it feels like you are using solar protection, it does not hydrate at all, I threw it to the garbage.</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt, product is excellent and I am delighted with my purchase, great value for money!</li>
    <li> I loved the old product, the MATTE daily defense sun screen with SPF 30 and zinc as the active ingredient. This new formulation is very greasy. I look shiny and my makeup does not apply well. I also don&#x27;t feel like it protects my skin as well as the old version. The newly formulated matte version contains other active ingredients, and I prefer the zinc as the only ingredient. I will not be purchasing this again and will be in search of another matte product that contains zinc as the active ingredient. This is really too bad, as this WAS a fantastic product prior to reformulation. I am very willing to spend money on products that do a good job. I will finish off this tube, as it was quite pricey, and then move on.</li>
    <li> love this lotion! love how it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on your skin and you can use just a little all over and it lasts for a long time. Will continue to buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery , no problems, will order again in the future</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. Makes my skin feel great and I will buy again. Min word not met so ha ha</li>
    <li> Sunscreen in this product burns my eyes much worse than sunblock lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love all the image products, this one is even better though because it has the sunscreen included.</li>
    <li> I have acne, but dry skin from the acne medications I use.  How I use this sunscreen is that I first use my acne medication (benzoyl peroxide); second I use my moisturizer; then finally I use this sunscreen over it.  I wait a couple of minutes between steps to allow for my skin to absorb the products.  The sunscreen is very moisturizing and has a great smell.  It is a great base for applying makeup over.  I am happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This version of the Image Skincare Daily Hydrating Moisturizer goes on lighter than the previous version.  However it takes longer to absorb and feels \\&quot;greasier\\&quot; on my skin longer.  My face never really feels \\&quot;dry\\&quot; after application.  I generally have to blot my face with a tissue to apply my makeup to prevent clogging my brushes.  But the 30 SPF really works.  I&#x27;ve spent entire days out in the sun and not gotten burnt on my face.</li>
    <li> My skin was used to the old Image Daily Universal SPF30, and was brilliant! I have contacted Image asking which one of the new Prevention range was similar to the old Universal, and they suggested this one, the Hydrating. Since using it, my skin changed radically, is full of spots and greasy. Not happy as I have to restatrt my search for the perfect cream again. Nevermind.</li>
    <li> This is so far my favorite moisturizer. I tried other ones and keep coming back to Image one! Makes my skin feel fresh, young and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is NOT comparable to the tinted daily moisturizer!!!!!!!  The Tinted Daily is thin and goes on nicely, soaks in quickly.  This is more like an actual SPF!  It smells funny and is VERY THICK! SO, I use it for facial spf when I&#x27;m in the sun, but be aware- you would need to put this on like 15 minutes before putting on makeup as it is very thick.</li>
    <li> This is the best daily moisturizer I have used.  It is lightweight and provides spf protection.  Amazon price is cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Worth the money. Can tell a difference in skin tone after using Image product line for just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for semi-oily skin and it has a sunscreen in it.  When I first started using this I noticed a difference in my skin after 1 week.  I use it on a daily basis. Not oily and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I like the product it is not heavy or sticky when I apply it on to my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is just what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love Image Skincare products and use several of them. This one is a great daily facial moisturizer. It can be a little thick, so if you have really oily skin, you might want to consider a different product. But overall, I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Image is my favorite line for skin care and even my doctor makes a big deal on how awesome my skin looks! I am 41 and thanks to good DNA and the Image line I do not look it! This is well worth every penny, because no one knows I suffer from melasma and acne, not to mention it helps freeze the aging process!  I use Vit C, Ageless cleanser, Ormedic lip care, and some others I change out from Image depending on the season. It is affordable compared to other lines and is dermatologist grade (not the horrible drug store stuff). I cannot say enough good things about Image!!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived when expected. It&#x27;s a good performer as a moisturizer and as a sunscreen. It is a little thick and shiny when applied, but seems to absorb well if you give it some time. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m a blonde, and this product doesn&#x27;t aggravate and doesn&#x27;t let me burn.</li>
    <li> GREAT LOVE THESE PRODUCTS GREAT SERVICE</li>
    <li> feels good on except I wish it kept its moist look longer</li>
    <li> Have been using these products for years, I have very sensitive skin and this is the best product I have found that does not cause any reactions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens, but was introduced to this line by a friend who is an esthetician, and I didn&#x27;t have any funky reactions with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not chalky and has a slight scent that didn&#x27;t bother me either. Planning to stock up on extra since it actually worked and didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer and ingredients for spf won&#x27;t sting your eyes. love the product and would recommend it concerned with dry skin and sun protection</li>
    <li> Love the lotion. The Image line was recommended by my spa and so far really like the products.</li>
    <li> His made me super greasy! He old formula was so much better for my oily skin and now I&#x27;ve been trying every other moisturizer under the sun and nothing works the way Daily Defense did. So upset about this!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Its the first full sunblock protection product that I&#x27;ve had that actually is an excellent moisturizer.  It goes on and blendsver smooth.</li>
    <li> Used with the other Image products........it is a really good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with my skin. It left my skin dry.</li>
    <li> I liked the fragrance but the product irritated my eyes so bad that I had to stop using it. I tried different approaches to applying it to my face and still got the same reaction.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a long time and I love it! It goes on smooth and lasts a long time as little goes a  long way. The SPF 30 is great for protection from the sun and it has a moisterizer that leaves your skin very soft!.</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding a good moisturizer that would&#x27;nt make my sensitive skin break out. This has all natural ingredients and works great. I also love the tinted moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love this product great price</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s contains natural sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This goes on white. Have to rub in good. Leaves skin shiny. Seems more like a straight sunscreen than a hydrating cream w/ sunscreen. Not very appealing for the face</li>
    <li> Feels great on and I love Image products.  I wish that this was more of a matte finish.  I use powder afterwards, but if it could be moisturizing, protective and matte, I would like it even more.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and this product has not irritated my skin.  It moisturizes well although I do use the serum from the image skin care line underneath this product in the winter.</li>
    <li> I use this all year long and it is not greasy at all. I searched high and low for one that wasn&#x27;t greasy. Thanks Image.</li>
    <li> So I’m 26 and have started suffering from breakouts after I got my IUD, after a lifetime of clear skin. I just didn’t know what to do with myself, my friend is an esthetician and gave me a small sample of this product, she said my skin was dry (I live in a desert climate) and this should help. She said apply every two hours or there about if I could. This stuff is amazing! I wish I would have taken before and after photos, I was starting to get fine lines around my eyes (and some not so fine lines) because of my lack of sleep. Also this odd patch of skin that was just… not sure how to describe it but dry and almost rough? I drink tons of water but still the moisture clearly wasn’t getting to my face. I’ve been doing as she asked, I keep a little sample sized one at work and one at home and I’m not spot on, I likely put it on 5x at the least a day (It smells amazing and absorbs quickly) and my face has almost cleared up entirely! Also those fine lines and bags under my eyes? Gone! I went out with a friend the other night having just hopped out of the shower, no makeup, just this stuff on and she said “your skin looks beautiful!” then she touched my face “and soft!!” I cant say enough good things :) everyone has different skin but this was a miracle for me!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Their products seem clean and effective.</li>
    <li> Great hydration, perfect sun protection. I love this product. I used this daily and feel very protected and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> My favorite!! My go to!</li>
    <li> After years of battling acne, my normal to oily skin went dry. I hadn&#x27;t changed any of my skin care product and assume this is just a premenopausal symptom / hormonal issue (I&#x27;m 44).  My skin has also become very sensitive over the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most chemical sunscreens cause tiny whiteheads on my skin after a few days. Most physical sunscreens suck all of the moisture (natural and topical) out of my skin. After a few days of use my skin reddens with a white &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; of peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far that moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. But it is SUPER DUPER MOISTURIZING. Think of it more as a facial cream with added spf not the other way around, and you&#x27;ll be on the right track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will probably go on &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as others have noted. It takes about an hour for my skin to suck up the moisture and then my face looks normal. At one point I was using an additional moisturizer under this and it was too much. This is all the moisture I need for the day unless it is especially dry, cold, and windy (not often in Austin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal or oily skin this my not be the sunscreen for you, but it works great for my dry and sensitive skin. A little expensive, but worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Ok, a little greaser than I thought .but getting used to it and will probably order again.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I am in my 60&#x27;s, and my skin has improved with this and other Image products.</li>
    <li> This is the best spf moisturizer I have ever used.  It is greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a while residue on your face.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I seem to never know what I am getting when I purchase online. The scent it always different and sometimes it smells like it has been sitting for too long.</li>
    <li> Just takes a little dab to protect  and moisturize dry skin</li>
    <li> Natural, free of toxic sunblocks, goes smooth on skin, moisturizing, does not leave white &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; on my face, does the job of protection from CA sun</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because it has 18% percent  zinc oxide and it&#x27;s the only active ingredient in the product. The first time I used it, I really liked it. It went on very smoothly. I wore it all day and I reapplied it two times. When I washed my face the same night though, I had little red bumps all over my face and flaking around my mouth area mostly and all over my face as well. So, I decided to take a break and try it again. When I tried the second time, my face was in great condition but the results were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now scared to use this again. I think the problem is too much zinc oxide mixed with so many other inactive ingredients that it just too much. BTW, my skin type is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; to slightly &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; and overall pretty healthy.</li>
    <li> Excellent amazon seller. Item new as described. Fast post to Sydney, Australia. Thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered two different types of moisturizer but they ended up being exactly the same.  One had an off-smell to it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product before from a different source and it was creamier. They were also different prices.</li>
    <li> Nice sheen. Gives the skin a nice dewy moist look.  In the summer I do not need to wear make up.  Just lipstick and the moisturized/sunscreen</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It smells amazing, leaves skin feeling smooth, &amp; it&#x27;s non-greasy. Great product line!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years.  This has been the only product I can use for sun protection due to highly sensitive skin.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer with SPF I&#x27;ve been using it for number of years and I have found nothing that I have tried to give you that wonderful glow</li>
