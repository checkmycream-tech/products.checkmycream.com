      <li>I ordered this and the anti-static sandalwood comb with handle for curly hair (which I love the best).</li>
      <li>Because I know better than to expect a piece of wood with these dimensions to be perfectly stable; this is not metal, or plastic, or &amp;#34;stabilized wood&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This was a fairly good comb.</li>
      <li>My scalp likes it, as it feels nice with its rounded teeth going over my skin, and my hair looks very nice after use.</li>

      <li>The wood is smooth and has a pleasant smell.</li>

      <li>Make sure you choose an oil that will not go rancid.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I do feel that even despite not being \\&quot;perfectly\\&quot; sanded and smoothed that this comb is still a better alternative to plastic combs</li>
      <li>Such a great discovery to have made!</li>
      <li>I love using it too.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this comb</li>
      <li>Just wish they had sanded it better.</li>
      <li>My hair feels loads better since I started using it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t produce static and leaves my hair shiny</li>
      <li>Good , robust , easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair shiny, soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, between the tines there are some rougher areas (a bit more fine sanding could have remedied this).</li>
      <li>I used a circular file to smooth the wood and now it&#x27;s my all-time favorite comb.</li>
      <li>Feels good to have real wood in&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a cute little comb that does the job perfectly!  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent comb for curly hair, straight hair and naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>It is a sturdy comb that I don&#x27;t see breaking easily.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it beautiful</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it eliminates static electricity in hair, too.</li>
      <li>Use it every day for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have used Neem powder around the perimeter of the house to combat insects and it seems to work fine, without being toxic.</li>
      <li>its fine.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, and I love the comb.</li>
      <li>Comfortable handle.</li>
      <li>it is light weight looks</li>
      <li>This one is solid and smells great as well.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>The teeth are not sharp and feel good on the scalp.</li>
      <li>First of all, it is cracked on the top where two pieces are glued together.</li>
      <li>Excellent comb, I really like supporting hand made basic items.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty to look at, nice to use, and gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good wooden comb.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, though, it still ripped out a bunch of my hair - there&#x27;s a huge split in one of the teeth that I didn&#x27;t see while sanding.    </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this traditional neem wood comb.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 of them and they are great for calming down my frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Overall pretty smooth and love it in my hair!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Good oils for this purpose would be mineral oil, essential oils (any you like), or a drying/polymerizing oil (walnut oil or pure tung oil are two examples).</li>
      <li>This is a very well crafted, comfortable comb.</li>
      <li>This did a good job on my hair while it was wet, without snagging or breaking the hair.</li>
      <li>The comb smells good and works well for wet longer hair.</li>
      <li>comb smells very nice, and it&#x27;s been holding up well in the few weeks since I bought it.</li>
      <li>Just seems right.</li>
      <li>Both the design &amp; construction are just right.</li>
      <li>it is beautiful and works with with my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>Really easy on fine color treated long hair.  </li>
      <li>, it was very reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>After the first one, I purchased 3 more to put in different places -</li>
      <li>my hair is smooth and soft  after using it.</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised</li>
      <li>This one is well made and I can see that probably more purposeful for boys and men and women with short hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the description on this comb states that these wood combs are hand sanded so each comb will be bit different and some may be better than others.</li>
      <li>but I have a lot less, and my hair is very smooth!  </li>
      <li>, doesn&#x27;t add static(it won&#x27;t eliminate static that is already there, but it won&#x27;t make it worse) and is fairly nice to hold and use.</li>
      <li>I liked it at first, but one day I dropped the comb on the counter, and it snapped in half.</li>
      <li>I find I avoid using it unless I really have too.</li>
      <li>It really hurts when I try to use it.</li>
      <li>Really like this comb.  </li>
      <li>If I had known there would be this much work involved, I would have just made it all myself.    </li>
      <li>Like it so much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>thanks for helping me in my change offering me this comb.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice simple wooden comb.</li>
      <li>No more static!</li>
      <li>I hope that once I cut the split out of the one tooth and sand the entire comb completely, it will work fine.    </li>
      <li>However, I have noted that there is a separate strip of wood across the top of the comb and a slight separation at the end.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Be sure to protect this comb (or any wooden comb) by oiling it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to comb my long, fine and straight hair whether it is wet or dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like it so much.  Feel less hair breakage than my plastic comb. Wish i had bought it before!</li>
    <li> Excellent comb, I really like supporting hand made basic items.  This one is solid and smells great as well.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like wooden hair accessories &amp; tools &amp; this is nicer than I expected.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> This is comb is very beautiful and at just $7.95 it is priced reasonably so for the price I&#x27;d recommend it. However, my reasons for only rating it four stars are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the tines (teeth) on the comb that I received are a bit too sharp (this left my scalp a bit irritated especially after the first few uses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, between the tines there are some rougher areas (a bit more fine sanding could have remedied this). Having any rough, under-sanded areas on wood combs creates more potential to snag your hair, resulting in breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the description on this comb states that these wood combs are hand sanded so each comb will be bit different and some may be better than others. I do feel that even despite not being \\&quot;perfectly\\&quot; sanded and smoothed that this comb is still a better alternative to plastic combs and I noticed that it seems to claim less of my hair than my previous plastic comb did. If you decide to go with this comb I hope yours is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to protect this comb (or any wooden comb) by oiling it on a regular basis. Make sure you choose an oil that will not go rancid. Good oils for this purpose would be mineral oil, essential oils (any you like), or a drying/polymerizing oil (walnut oil or pure tung oil are two examples). Avoid cooking oils such as vegatable oil, olive oil, &amp; coconut oil since they will eventually go rancid leaving your comb with a terrible smell. If you plan on using you comb for wet hair I would also recommend a beeswax coat for an extra (water-resistant) protective layer. I got a little water on my comb the other day and despite drying it off immediately the wood grain swelled a bit making the comb a bit rougher than it was originally.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this traditional neem wood comb. Both the design &amp; construction are just right. It&#x27;s pretty to look at, nice to use, and gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> its fine. Have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This was a fairly good comb. If you have never used a wood hair tool, go ahead and buy this to try, but if you know you like wood/bamboo, then I would spend a little more on this one or this brand. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00KW6EYI6/ref&#x3D;pd_aw_sbs_bt_4?refRID&#x3D;18H5QAJZ80HBMPJW7CH0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb works, but it had a few imperfections, like a few of the tines had slivers that catch your hair and lint and stuff. It isn&#x27;t sanded perfectly. Stuff like that. But it combs well, doesn&#x27;t add static(it won&#x27;t eliminate static that is already there, but it won&#x27;t make it worse) and is fairly nice to hold and use.</li>
    <li> The comb smells good and works well for wet longer hair.</li>
    <li> Use it every day for my fine hair. It does it&#x27;s job well. My hair doesn&#x27;t get stat-icky anymore. No complaints about the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb I love how it makes my hair feel smooth. I have hair that is curly and also wavy and flat in some places this comb works wonders my hair is smooth and soft  after using it.</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome!  I have thick curly hair so its hard to find the right comb.  I definitely wanted a comb that was natural in all aspects.  It is a sturdy comb that I don&#x27;t see breaking easily.  Plus, I even use it in the shower and I never have any problems with it.  I think it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this comb it is light weight looks nice smells good and the benefits from neem are an added plus. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this. No more static!</li>
    <li> Really like this comb.  The teeth are wide enough to handle wet hair and close enough to work equally well on dry hair.  The surfaces are smooth, the wood is attractive and beneficial.  I&#x27;ve never liked most plastic combs, but do like this comb.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, and I love the comb. Its not sharp, well-built and no static cling in my hair anymore. After the first one, I purchased 3 more to put in different places - my bag, the car, the guest-room.</li>
    <li> Unlike my other wood combs, this one tears my hair. I find I avoid using it unless I really have too.</li>
    <li> I used the comb as soon as I got it. I am happy to say I love this comb. It makes your hair shiny, soft and beautiful. This is an excellent comb for curly hair, straight hair and naturally curly hair. Do you offer a hairbrush that I could use. Thank you for prompt delivery. My daughter told me about this comb and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this comb it is beautiful and works with with my thick hair.  I have had to sand between the teeth of the comb because it was not well sanded and would catch and break my hair.  It seems well made and sturdy.  Just wish they had sanded it better.</li>
    <li> I do like this comb and bought it because it was made of neem wood.  I love using it too.  However, I have noted that there is a separate strip of wood across the top of the comb and a slight separation at the end.  I hope it wlll not come apart.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> The comb is solidly made from beautiful wood and has a faintly spicy smell. However, there were splinters and rough wood between a few of the tines. I could have taken some time and sanded it down, but I ended up returning it, because it would probably go in the to-do pile and never actually get done.</li>
    <li> This is a very well crafted, comfortable comb. I couldn&#x27;t stand the way plastic combs ripped my hair out, and brushes, whether they had plastic or natural bristles, always hurt my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb isn&#x27;t quite non-static, but it&#x27;s much less than with any regular comb/brush I&#x27;ve used, so that mostly works, but I took a star off for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb smells very nice, and it&#x27;s been holding up well in the few weeks since I bought it. I keep it stored in its plastic packaging when not in use, and don&#x27;t use it when my hair is wet. My scalp likes it, as it feels nice with its rounded teeth going over my skin, and my hair looks very nice after use.</li>
    <li> I bought another one and then decided I needed one for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using this I never use even a brush.  Also helped with&lt;br /&gt;my electric hair in the winter.  Feels good to have real wood in&lt;br /&gt;my hand instead of plastic.  Just seems right.</li>
    <li> Wonderful comb, the order arrived quickly, the product in good condition, and consider a good price, I happy and satisfied that I have bought this comb.&lt;br /&gt;I stop using plastic comb because it is static and not healthy. and decided to use the wooden comb is healthy.&lt;br /&gt;so thanks for helping me in my change offering me this comb.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;a.namaste.&lt;br /&gt;yawi33</li>
    <li> This comb is perfect! It works great on my fine hair. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sharp, need to file off teeth a bit.</li>
    <li> We love this comb! I bought 2 of them and they are great for calming down my frizzy hair. My son has curly hair and this comb has been great for him too. He used to be so frustrated because his hair never looked like it was brushed or combed until he started using this comb. We are very pleased with the results and love that this comb is eco-friendly and beautifully handcrafted.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! Easier to get through tangled hair without damaging it, and I like not having to use plastic. It&#x27;s true that it eliminates static electricity in hair, too. I cannot imagine using any other comb. The seller was very courteous and even sent a follow-up email to make sure I was happy with the product! Terrific customer service.</li>
    <li> Broke after a week. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It developed a crack and some of the teeth started leaning to one side soon after I started using it (maybe two months ago or so). Why 5 stars then, you ask? Because I know better than to expect a piece of wood with these dimensions to be perfectly stable; this is not metal, or plastic, or &amp;#34;stabilized wood&amp;#34; (wood impregnated with plastic) - this is just normal wood. The comb does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb, the tines (teeth) of the comb are pretty wide, but not super wide. This did a good job on my hair while it was wet, without snagging or breaking the hair. The wood is smooth and has a pleasant smell. The teeth are not sharp and feel good on the scalp. The neem wood smells very good and spicy. I like that the neem has natural anti-microbial and anti-dandruff properties. Wood combs are also anti-static, and help to pull the natural conditioning oils in your scalp down your hair and into the roots where you need it. I will only use this wood comb from now on. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Using it the 1st time, there was a loud pop and the wood split at the base of 2 tines and on the handle. I got about 1/8 of my hair combed. I would have taken a replacement, but that option was unavailable.</li>
    <li> My comb arrived with some rough, unfinished spots at the base of the teeth. I used a circular file to smooth the wood and now it&#x27;s my all-time favorite comb.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair feels loads better since I started using it and I no longer feel like I&#x27;m ripping out huge chunks of hair in the morning!</li>
    <li> Such a great discovery to have made! I haven&#x27;t used long enough to determine long term effects but definitely no dandruff and no static! Overall pretty smooth and love it in my hair! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> is the enemy of my hair!  this comb hasn&#x27;t 100 percent eliminated it - but I have a lot less, and my hair is very smooth!  The comb is well made and sanded, it does not snag or pull.</li>
    <li> this comb is great, use it all the time.  Really easy on fine color treated long hair.  less breakage, and damage than normal combs. Yes. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the anti-static sandalwood comb with handle for curly hair (which I love the best). This one is well made and I can see that probably more purposeful for boys and men and women with short hair. i will give it to my man friend to replace his plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;I marked it with three stars only because it did not suit my needs with thick long naturally curly hair prone to knottiness.</li>
    <li> When I got it, it looked like nobody bothered to finish making it. I spent about 20 minutes sanding it down so I wouldn&#x27;t end up ripping my hair out. The first time I used it, though, it still ripped out a bunch of my hair - there&#x27;s a huge split in one of the teeth that I didn&#x27;t see while sanding.    I hope that once I cut the split out of the one tooth and sand the entire comb completely, it will work fine.    Definitely not worth the money, though. If I had known there would be this much work involved, I would have just made it all myself.    Edit: I&#x27;ve been using it for three days, and I absolutely HATE it. Every time I use it, I seem to find a new split/snag in the teeth, and it rips my hair out. I bought a different wooden comb, and I&#x27;ll be throwing this one away. I&#x27;d ask the seller for a refund or replacement, but I don&#x27;t even want to bother with it anymore.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this product.  It arrived cracked and then split again after a couple of weeks of use.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good wooden comb.</li>
    <li> Very nice comb. Comfortable handle. Doesn&#x27;t produce static and leaves my hair shiny</li>
    <li> I received the comb and very disappointed. First of all, it is cracked on the top where two pieces are glued together. Secondly, the teeth are so sharp. It really hurts when I try to use it. This comb tears off my hair due to the rough surface of the teeth. I&#x27;m going to return it.&lt;br /&gt;But I have to mention that Neem wood has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little comb that does the job perfectly!  It is very easy to comb my long, fine and straight hair whether it is wet or dry.  I have had it for ages now and the sandalwood scent is still there!</li>
    <li> I liked it at first, but one day I dropped the comb on the counter, and it snapped in half.</li>
    <li> Nice simple wooden comb.</li>
    <li> I have been buying combs from a French manufacturer that are very nice, but these are much more beautiful to look at as well as being ecological.  I don&#x27;t know yet if the Neem wood helps with dandruff, but it is non-static.  I have used Neem powder around the perimeter of the house to combat insects and it seems to work fine, without being toxic.</li>
    <li> Good , robust , easy to use and easy to clean. Love it !</li>
    <li> My husband and I are busy removing all the plastic possible from our home.  When we bought this comb we were thrilled with it.  Not only is it beautiful, it was very reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;No plastic just a product that works well and is lovely to look at!</li>
