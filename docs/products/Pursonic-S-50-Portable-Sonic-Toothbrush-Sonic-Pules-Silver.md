      <li>The best travel tooth brush ever.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>This is great for travel.  </li>
      <li>Great for college students and for travelers.  </li>
      <li>great to travel with ...</li>
      <li>But, a good toothbrush for my purse with the cap over the brush head.</li>
      <li>It is nice and compact, fits in a enclosed tube, great for travel.</li>
      <li>The result was surprising.  </li>
      <li>A good purchase.</li>
      <li>It seems to work well otherwise and is a good value.</li>
      <li>Love it!.  </li>
      <li>I would describe it as kind of vibrating.  </li>
      <li>It more than met my expectations.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love my 2 Sonic toothbrushes, one in each bathroom.  </li>
      <li>Two speed settings and really gives you a great sonic clean.</li>
      <li>Brushing between meals is conducive, elegant, and unique.</li>
      <li>It is light weight &amp; works like a sonic.  </li>
      <li>I have bought a number of the cheap portables, they all stink.  </li>
      <li>Been using this travel-sized vibrating toothbrush for several months (and trips) now and still working great.  </li>
      <li>A very nice alternative to the traditional toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect fit into my purse, takes up very little space.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations considering the inexpensive price but so far so good.</li>
      <li>The travel cover is a nice feature, but I will likely return both brushes if allowed to do so.  </li>
      <li>sonic is well worth the price</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up very much space.  </li>
      <li>Little kids probably would not like the sonic, but if they do, then its a good thing for them,  </li>
      <li>but works pretty well though.</li>
      <li>Save your money and buy a real toothbrush!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for travel in my opinion, if you were to throw it in a bigger bag or suitcase because it is well protected.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would very effectively clean my teeth, but I  was very surprised.</li>
      <li>good toothbrush for kids or adults with small teeth...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to get a sonic pulse toothbrush for home use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not really pulse much but does the job of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>I prop the brush part up on top of the case part to allow it to dry before putting it back into the case, otherwise it stays wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>It worked only for a little while and stoped, didn&#x27;t like it at all, wanted to buy this kind of product but don&#x27;t trust it will work anymore.</li>
      <li>When it arrived, the product appeared to be a toy designed for young children as a model to teach them how to brush.</li>
      <li>Decided to buy more and actually use it as an everyday toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too big to fit in a small cosmetic bag, and was not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long each brush head will last, but for occasional travel use it is fine.  </li>
      <li>I position the bristles so they are touching my teeth and sort of slowly move the brush up and down while moving around each tooth.</li>

<li> &lt;br /&gt;2.when done w/use--hang open brush over side of sink/table for few mins.</li>

<li> I have been using mine for a month now and picked up a few tips...</li>
<li> The toothbrush comes in a small plastic case with the additional brush heads included.</li>
<li> it takes just a bit longer to brush the teeth b/c the head is quite small.  </li>
<li> The brush head is way too small.</li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t accidentally press the lower speed button and forget that it has two speeds, and wonder how come the vibrations are so slow; oops.</li>
<li> The vibrating head was very subtle, making the tiny bristled head useless.  </li>
<li> Not good.  </li>
<li> The power of the vibration is weak.</li>
<li> Totally disappointed in this little product.</li>

    <li> I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  Neither lasted very long.</li>
    <li> This will not replace your $100 ultrasonic toothbrush, but for a compact solution to keep in your purse, it works.  it takes just a bit longer to brush the teeth b/c the head is quite small.  Just don&#x27;t accidentally press the lower speed button and forget that it has two speeds, and wonder how come the vibrations are so slow; oops.</li>
    <li> I have been using mine for a month now and picked up a few tips...&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t let water get into the battery case/handle&lt;br /&gt;2.when done w/use--hang open brush over side of sink/table for few mins. to dry prior to putting cover back on.&lt;br /&gt;3. I wipe unit down w/dry towel when done...just to prevent any water damage to battery/case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sonic is well worth the price..take care of it and it will take care of you!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> The brush head is way smaller than I thought it was going to be ... good toothbrush for kids or adults with small teeth...but works pretty well though.</li>
    <li> great to travel with ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for travel and have used it for 4 years.  Love it!.  Decided to buy more and actually use it as an everyday toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel.  Works well and is compact. A good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect fit into my purse, takes up very little space. Brushing between meals is conducive, elegant, and unique.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for travel in my opinion, if you were to throw it in a bigger bag or suitcase because it is well protected. However, it does not pulse, it simply vibrates which is pretty useless unless the brush head rotates or moves in some way. It&#x27;s too big to fit in a small cosmetic bag, and was not what I was expecting. Waste of my money having to return it and ship it back.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these brushes, one of my wife and one for me, for when we travel.  When it arrived, the product appeared to be a toy designed for young children as a model to teach them how to brush. The vibrating head was very subtle, making the tiny bristled head useless.  I was also fooled by the promise of 3 bonus brushes, when there are only two brushheads in addition to the head that comes with the toothbrush.  The travel cover is a nice feature, but I will likely return both brushes if allowed to do so.  Save your money and buy a real toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was purchased to take on a trip. It is nice and compact, fits in a enclosed tube, great for travel. Does not really pulse much but does the job of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> It did not fulfill my expectations.  I still use it at work but without the pulse option -I felt that the pulse/vibration would help with teeth cleaning-it did not.  I use it without the pulse.</li>
    <li> Been using this travel-sized vibrating toothbrush for several months (and trips) now and still working great.  A very nice alternative to the traditional toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Brush heads are children&#x27;s size.  Not good.  Little kids probably would not like the sonic, but if they do, then its a good thing for them,  It seems to work well otherwise and is a good value.</li>
    <li> I love my 2 Sonic toothbrushes, one in each bathroom.  However, I find myself going out of town often &amp; transporting one with the charger adds to my weight in my bag.  I have bought a number of the cheap portables, they all stink.  So when I saw the add for a portable Sonic I jumped @ the chance.  I love it.  It is light weight &amp; works like a sonic.  It more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Not quite what  I expected. But, a good toothbrush for my purse with the cap over the brush head. Just not not enough power.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for traveling. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> flimsy design...brush for a baby...pass</li>
    <li> The best travel tooth brush ever. Two speed settings and really gives you a great sonic clean.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; as opposed to \\&quot;brush\\&quot;.  I would describe it as kind of vibrating.  I didn&#x27;t think it would very effectively clean my teeth, but I  was very surprised. After using it on a ten day trip, my teeth felt smoother and cleaner.  I&#x27;m ready to get a sonic pulse toothbrush for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is very small and the bristles are very soft, so there is a learning curve to using it.  I position the bristles so they are touching my teeth and sort of slowly move the brush up and down while moving around each tooth. The result was surprising.  I&#x27;m not sure how long each brush head will last, but for occasional travel use it is fine.  Doesn&#x27;t take up very much space.  I prop the brush part up on top of the case part to allow it to dry before putting it back into the case, otherwise it stays wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, I thought the three bonus brush heads meant a total of four, but it came with three brush heads total.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations considering the inexpensive price but so far so good. The toothbrush comes in a small plastic case with the additional brush heads included. Set up is simple; untwist bottom portion, insert AAA battery, retwist and you are set. There is a low setting (which I prefer) and a high setting which I found to be a little harsh for my sensitive gums. The brush head is smaller than a traditional toothbrush but still gets the job done. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It worked only for a little while and stoped, didn&#x27;t like it at all, wanted to buy this kind of product but don&#x27;t trust it will work anymore.</li>
    <li> Great for college students and for travelers.  Recommend this brush for improving gum health and overall tooth appearance with the basic schedule of brushing twice per day.</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed in this little product. The brush head is way too small. The taper from brush to handle is too fat. The power of the vibration is weak. Not gonna work for this couple.</li>
