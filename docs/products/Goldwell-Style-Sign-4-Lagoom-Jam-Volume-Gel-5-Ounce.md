    <li> My husband is vain and picky about his hair and he can&#x27;t live without this gel. He&#x27;s tried everything but this is his one true love...when it comes to gel.</li>
    <li> This is a little too heavy for me even when I add a little water to it when in the palm of my hands.  I have to be careful not to use too much or it will weigh my hair down. My hair is fine and it does not add much volume.</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for your hair as it gives your hair a nice shine and is almost weightless. Leave it to the Germans to produce the best hair products today.</li>

    <li> I have been using this gel for about 5 years now and it is great for my needs.  It provides a strong hold with a very small amount.  I would highly recommend the product for anyone looking for a gel.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> My most favorite gel and have used for years.  I most definitely suggest giving it a try.  Please go online an buy.</li>
    <li> Smells good - not too overwhelming. Hold is great and the best thing, is that it does not flake. I work 12 hour shifts and people always compliment that my hair looks exactly the same when I leave as when I got there. It is good for spikes, faux hawk and comb overs...or just to better hold any haircut. Have been using this product exclusively now for about 3 1/2 years. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this jam for over 8 years. I like the fact that there is no alcohol and I still have hair on my head. I would never use anything else but this product.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have tried many products. Coupling this product with some leave in conditioner of your choice makes the perfect serum for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it&#x27;s the best gel that I have used. Not much is needed for a strong hold. Been using this product since 05&#x27; and it&#x27;s made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel on the market. Been using it for years. Have found nothing comparablw.</li>
    <li> Started buying this at my salon.  Was thrilled to find it here.  Great product for frizz and curl control.</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair product that is on the market but this product is the best so far. Not sticky, gives a natural look and easy to wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;great service from the seller for shipment.</li>
    <li> I loved this gel for years, then it was discontinued in stores. I started buying it through Amazon every once in a while. Recently, I purchased the lagoom #4 from the same seller as I always have, used it, and I noticed it wasn&#x27;t the same consistency I remembered it having previously. About an hour later.....SUPER FLAKES snowing down onto my forehead and face!!! Huh??! Looked like I sprayed snow in a can on my hair. I never experienced this Ever with this brand, that&#x27;s why I love it so much because it was strong non-flaky and easy to wash out. I&#x27;m very disappointed that the formula has changed for the worst..buyer beware! It isn&#x27;t the same as it used to be. My search for the perfect gel has no begun again... (sad face)</li>
    <li> I just discovered this product recently and it surpasses anything (including combinations of various products) I have tried over many years.  While it provides body for my fine hair, it does not weigh it down nor does it leave a lot of obvious residue in my hair.  Lovely light scent - this is a winner for me!</li>
    <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. No white flakes holds the hair in place perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  This product give me fulness and helps my hair stay looking good all day.</li>
    <li> It works well but I dont really see a difference between that and any other good hair product for 5 dollars</li>
    <li> keeps the hair spiky and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
    <li> not like most gels (e.g. Crew), this will add body and is not runny.  i have fine hair, and this is the best i have found.</li>
    <li> Great product...achieved the Flock of Seagulls look that I was going for.  Rock on Goldwell!</li>
    <li> Lagoom jam is a necessary item for me!!!  I love, love, love it!!  I use it daily to give a little body to my fine, wavy hair.....just airdry, and work a little into my hair to shape it.  Could not do without it.....not stiff or gluey and easily reworked later in the day!!</li>
    <li> Best product out there for men&#x27;s hair. Fantastic price and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Awesome gel, the best I have ever used!! Stays put and isn&#x27;t greasy!! Simply the best!!</li>
    <li> Great for my long hair and my husband&#x27;s morning go-to. Lasted us 10 months - a little goes a long way. Plus it smells incredible!</li>
    <li> Ever since Nolita Grit Gel was discontinued, I&#x27;d been searching for something as good to replace it (for months and months).  Then I found Lagoom Gel that was recommended by my stylist and I absolutely \\&quot;love\\&quot; it!  Even though I have thick hair, it is rather fine and I needed more \\&quot;body\\&quot;.  Lagoom Gel provides that.</li>
    <li> Great product, no alcohol</li>
    <li> I was on vacation is Seattle and went to the art museum.  There was a stunning woman touring with us.  Her hair was fairly short and spiky but had such style.  I asked her what she used and she told me Lagoom Jam.  When I got home I ordered it and love it.  My hair dresser has started using it too.  Gives great body.  I use it both wet and dry.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me! Love the weight, smell, and hold.</li>
    <li> Has great hold without being stiff and gunky!  Just a nickel size amount applied to damp hair before drying and my straight short hair has more lift and fullness that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for years.  I&#x27;ve found it to have a strong hold but doesn&#x27;t flake or turn white if your hair gets messed up.  At least for me, I used it for a more wet look.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product...just the right hold for his wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived as promised. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is not the first time that i have used this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;What i personally like about it is that after applied, it gives the appearance that the hair is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;Effect last all day.</li>
    <li> Great everthing good on time and great product</li>
    <li> Too greasy and leaves hair too heavy.</li>
    <li> Gel stays all day! Even at theme parks with minimal water splashes. And this is a great price</li>
    <li> Makes the hair look and feel clean all day.  Holds well against heat and humidity. Texture and thickness makes it very quick to style with.</li>
    <li> Better them any other product out there</li>
    <li> I use the gel to style the front part of my hair and it works great! It definitely adds volume! The only issue I have with it is that I tend to go through it fairly quickly, but it is a very good gel!</li>
    <li> A Little Gel and a Little Water and your Hair will be Perfect!! I Love this product and will be using it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> holds really good with a wet look effect..........Really glad i found it on line as it is had to find in stores</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years on the roots of my very straight, fine hair. It gives my hair body and lift without too much weight.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  Fast delivery as well.</li>
    <li> i constantly get comments when i wear this in my short hair - people asking me what it is. great price on amazon. i can put this in for days on the boat and my hair stays in place all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the same gel from some other distributors, and they seem a little old.  These are always the right consistency, like new.</li>
    <li> Originally my hair stylist recommended this gel for my heavy, short hair which I was trying to add spike up.  It worked very well.  I used just a small amount if the weather was cool and dry but if it was windy I used an additional amount.  It can be used on wet or dry hair.  It is much cheaper on Amazon than in the hair salon.</li>
    <li> This item gives a good hold and is easy to use. However, I found it to be a bit drying to my hair.</li>
    <li> Easy apply, quick dry.  Moisten hands for &#x27;wet look&#x27;. Washes out in the shower. Holds short hair in-place, no problem!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.  Messy....</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best gel ever. Love this stuff.</li>
</ol>
