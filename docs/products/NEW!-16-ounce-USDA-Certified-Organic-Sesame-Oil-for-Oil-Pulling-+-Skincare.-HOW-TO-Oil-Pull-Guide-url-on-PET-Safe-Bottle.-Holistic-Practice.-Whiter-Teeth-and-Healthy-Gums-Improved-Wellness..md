      <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>but I believe it was just more of wanting to spit out to see how my mouth felt.  </li>
      <li>and I just feel better in the morning.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Love the clean formula, soaks into skin immediately no greasy feel.</li>

      <li>Huge Bootle.</li>

      <li>My tongue can now glide over my teeth and they feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light nutty flavor.  </li>
      <li>All day I sort of had this gag feeling when I would think about the oil, but my teeth did feel nice all day and very clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but so far, it&#x27;s a good practice.</li>
      <li>They have never disappointed.</li>
      <li>I have always wanted to try pulling with sesame oil because that was the original oil used.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical honestly before trying this Sesame Oil /Oil pulling, but am thoroughly impressed!</li>
      <li>mouth feels so clean, my teeth seem to be whiter</li>
      <li>Again clean teeth all day and</li>
      <li>teeth always feel so clean and my mouth moist after oil pulling.</li>
      <li>OMG it&#x27;s now 4pm NO tooth ache, fresh breath, clean clean clean feeling teeth and</li>
      <li>and I find I cannot swish the full 15 minutes</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner, and I feel it works better than coconut oil I have been using.</li>
      <li>but really it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my skin yet, that will be next since I&#x27;m really believing in the healing and great benefits of oil.</li>
      <li>I have only used it for oil pulling and love it!</li>
      <li>But it is my go-to for oil pulling due to the pleasant taste and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the fresh breath alone.</li>
      <li>however I am surprised how better I feel.</li>
      <li>you’ve never pulled oil before, it might take some getting used to, but I promise it will be worth it.  </li>

      <li>before I go to sleep each night, my mouth feels amazingly clean and talk about germ free, WOW!  </li>
      <li>Be sure after you are done swishing it all around your mouth that you spit it into the trash bin and not down the drain.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t take care of your mouth and how the bacteria can get into your body, without getting too much into detail of my eye opening experience with the dentist, it has made me aware how important it is to take care of your mouth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird to have an oil in your mouth, but, it really would make sense, when you think of the foods we eat and the air we breath that our mouth is full of bacteria, this is also good for your teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I love that I got such a large size for the price!</li>
      <li>I do always have a sore top left tooth.</li>
      <li>It was my first time to try it</li>
      <li>At first try I could not go 10 mins swishing this in my mouth</li>
      <li>Not only does this oil leave my mouth and teeth feeling very clean, it also softens my lips.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this Certified Organic Pure Sesame Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, that is really how I feel about.</li>
      <li>(if you want to)&lt;br /&gt;Day 5, I am really still doing this</li>
      <li>and I think oil pulling is really helping me.</li>
      <li>I really like this USDA Certified Organic Sesame Oil for oil pulling.</li>
      <li>I got in the shower, washed and got out, the whole time swishing this oil in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I squirt this oil straight into my mouth for oil-pulling.  </li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t notice any differance.</li>
      <li>Most places say do it in the morning on a empty stomach</li>
      <li>I have a lot of issues with my gums, so I am really excited to try oil pulling and see what a difference there is at my next dentist appt!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil pulling is new to me. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products with sublime Beauty and trust their products. I put a half table spoon of the sesame oil in my mouth and swished it around for 10-20 mins. It&#x27;s kind of weird to have an oil in your mouth, but, it really would make sense, when you think of the foods we eat and the air we breath that our mouth is full of bacteria, this is also good for your teeth and gums. I&#x27;ve had a lot of dental work done and I was made very aware of how sick you can get if you don&#x27;t take care of your mouth and how the bacteria can get into your body, without getting too much into detail of my eye opening experience with the dentist, it has made me aware how important it is to take care of your mouth, I highly recommend this sesame oiI. I haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my skin yet, that will be next since I&#x27;m really believing in the healing and great benefits of oil.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is used for oil pulling and skin care.</li>
    <li> I started using the oil as a oil puller. I love the flavor of sesame oil so this tastes really good to me. I am hoping that with continuous use I will be able to have whiter teeth and healthier gums.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this oil. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure  about oil pulling however I was surprised how different I feel after using this product. My teeth are whiter and I feel better. I was trying to get my teeth color brighter however I am surprised how better I feel. I have been eliminating sugar and I think oil pulling is really helping me. I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> Great value for organic sesame oil. I wish it came with oil-pulling instructions, but they do give a link to check out. I also used this on my skin and nails and it&#x27;s really nice quality sesame oil.</li>
    <li> I dabble in oil pulling. I am afraid I am not consistent enough to judge the results, but people I know claim their oral and general health benefits from oil pulling. I have tried this sesame oil, coconut oil and MCT oil. Of the three, I think the sesame oil is my favorite for oil pulling (and if you read my other reviews you may know I am a big fan of coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth always feel so clean and my mouth moist after oil pulling. This sesame oil is pleasant tasting (if you like sesame seeds) and nice to use. I typically use oils as moisturizers or in my own DIY beauty and personal care products. This oil is nicely moisturizing, and has a nutty smell. The scent may limit the versatility of uses, but I like it. I feel it absorbs well into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my skin. Due to the scent, I probably won&#x27;t use it on my facial skin as often as I use rosehip, argan or coconut oil. But it is my go-to for oil pulling due to the pleasant taste and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted sample of this organic Sesame Oil to test and review. All opinions and experiences described are my own.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about using this for Oil Pulling purposes at first. I read all about it online and what the benefits are and decided to give it a try. Most places say do it in the morning on a empty stomach, I figured that was best since I was getting myself worked up about this anyways. Rather do it on a empty stomach in case I get sick.&lt;br /&gt;So this is how it went.. Morning one. I put a Tablespoon of the oil in my mouth as soon as I woke up, at first I was totally grossed out and wanted to spit it out but I just kept it in my mouth and swished it around. I got in the shower, washed and got out, the whole time swishing this oil in my mouth. About 10 minutes had passed and I was done I had to spit it out. I was pretty much totally grossed out by then. The Tablespoon of oil was now about 1/4 of a cup of yuck. I then finished my mouth and brushed my teeth. All day I sort of had this gag feeling when I would think about the oil, but my teeth did feel nice all day and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided I  had to continue to give it a try so Day 2. Same routine, added the oil to my mouth, swished it around and tried so hard to not think about it. (NOTE: don&#x27;t swish too hard in your mouth, 20 min is a long time you don&#x27;t want to tired out your jaw) day 2 I only had it about 15 minutes before spitting out. I was again grossed out. I have horrible gag reflexes and this was just too much for me. But I was determined to continue. At least till day 5. Again clean teeth all day and my breath smelled better. I do always have a sore top left tooth. It&#x27;s not the tooth that hurts it&#x27;s my horrible sinus issues that do this to my tooth.. but on day 2 I had no tooth pain all day. Was it the oil? I don&#x27;t know yet, It could just be a good sinus day &#x3D;). Doubt that though.&lt;br /&gt;Ok so let me stop and tell you, I wrote this daily, once I got to work I sat down and started this review. So I wouldn&#x27;t forget anything. It wasn&#x27;t a fluke that my tooth didn&#x27;t hurt. About 2 hours after writingmy day 2 review my sinus&#x27;s started acting up, by 3pm I was a mess, horrible headache,nose stuffy or running (annoying) and just felt like I was in a cloud.. This is how I usually feel daily.. But my tooth never hurt. ODD! It ALWAYS HURTS...&lt;br /&gt;Ok, Day 3... Oil in the mouth, swish, swish, swish.. actually did it for 20 minutes... WOOT WOOT! I didn&#x27;t even get grossed out. I just hummed to myself as I swished lol. It worked. OMG it&#x27;s now 4pm NO tooth ache, fresh breath, clean clean clean feeling teeth and when I smile I see my teeth shine and they are seeming to be whiter. I am hooked... Can I keep doing this daily, idk...&lt;br /&gt;Today is day 4. SO PROUD OF MYSELF. I have stuck with this.. so unlike me... Yeah it&#x27;s gross, I have oil in my mouth, swishing it around YUCK! but really it&#x27;s not bad. I am getting myself used to this routine. Do it like me (if you want to)&lt;br /&gt;Day 5, I am really still doing this and so amazed I didn&#x27;t stop after day 1.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels so clean, my teeth seem to be whiter and I just feel better in the morning. I think that is from the oil pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try. It&#x27;s worth it. For the fresh breath alone. I have horrible sinus issues, have had 2 sinus surgeries in the past 4 years and getting ready to have another in a few months. My mouth always seems to taste gross and my breath is horrible at the end of the day. Now my breath stays fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Something I have never tried before is oil pulling for maximizing oral hygiene . With Sublime Beauty Naturals introducing and offering this quality oil to be used for this purpose, I decided to try it. Since then, I now do this regularly. My tongue can now glide over my teeth and they feel smooth. No more roughness that is attributed to plaque build up. Usually, when I brush my teeth, afterward my mouth feels so dry. This is a moisturizer for the mouth that also helps pull away the hidden bacteria. Glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Just got my Sesame Oil a few days ago. Always used this for oil pulling, but didn&#x27;t buy more after my last bottle was gone, so I was very happy to get a great deal on this, and free shipping with Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> I really, really love this oil pulling thing.  I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t believe that there was a such a thing because frankly I had never heard of it!!  Well, I am thrilled that I tried this product.  I&#x27;m a huge fan and believer in Sublime Beauty so I thought I should be open minded.  The after results are so worth doing this oil pulling.  My mouth is a lot fresher in the mornings and before I go to sleep each night, my mouth feels amazingly clean and talk about germ free, WOW!  I am now going to be a oil pulling junky.  I love it!!  I bought a bottle for my daughter and delivered to her.  She loves it as well.  Who doesn&#x27;t love having a beautiful smile.  At first try I could not go 10 mins swishing this in my mouth but I believe it was just more of wanting to spit out to see how my mouth felt.  I have now been able to swish for a little under 20 mins.  My mouth and smile look simply beautiful.  I love it, that is really how I feel about. Love, love, love!!</li>
    <li> Thank you Sublime Beauty for introducing me to oil pulling! This product has really made a difference in my oral mouth care and after only using it for 3 weeks I know it will be part of my daily routine forever.</li>
    <li> I really like this USDA Certified Organic Sesame Oil for oil pulling. I had tried using coconut oil in the past for oil pulling and have wanted to try sesame oil, and personally I think I prefer the sesame oil over the coconut oil because it seems easier to swish in my mouth, but I really like the taste of the sesame oil better.  It&#x27;s a light nutty flavor.  I started oil pulling months ago because it was supposed to help make your teeth whiter and help to draw toxins out of your body.  Oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic dental technique that involves swishing a tablespoon of oil in your mouth on an empty stomach for around 20 minutes.  I used a teaspoon of Sesame oil and swished around in my mouth for 20 mins, then spit it out.  You may use it once or twice daily.  The health benefits of oil pulling can range from whiter smoother teeth, better breath, reduce plaque, reduce inflammation, and assist in healthier gums, etc.  My gums were bothering me on my upper right side near my back tooth and after using this for a couple days, the inflammation feels like it has gone down some.  This can also be used on your skin, however, I wanted it specifically for oil pulling, so I have not tried putting it on my skin yet.  My teeth have been feeling smoother after using it in a short amount of time, but haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet to see if it has helped my teeth become whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel really good about this product because it is certified organic sesame oil and that it is also food grade organic so that makes me feel really good about what I am putting into my body.  This is a very nice size bottle of 16oz.  I recommend this Certified Organic Pure Sesame Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. My opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I have never tried oil pulling so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!! Hoping it helps!!</li>
    <li> I have been doing the oil pulling technique for a couple of weeks and I really don&#x27;t notice any differance. The oil tastes fairly pleasant, they recommend that you swoosh it around your mouth for 20 minutes, that&#x27;s along time. I started at 10 minutes and now am up to 20 minutes. I am going to keep using it and see if it makes any differance.</li>
    <li> Huge Bootle. Love the clean formula, soaks into skin immediately no greasy feel. Great for mixing your yl oil Roller bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been oil pulling with coconut oil for about three years. I have always wanted to try pulling with sesame oil because that was the original oil used. Because the sesame oil is liquid form right from the bottle, it was easier to get used to compared to coconut oil that is solid and you have to chew for a bit in the beginning. This sesame oil has a sweet taste, and a definite sesame flavor. I really liked it. I found that I had to use much more than a tablespoon to feel as if I have enough to do some actual pulling.  I will definitely order again, as I now prefer sesame over coconut for oil pulling.</li>
    <li> I used to use coconut oil for oil pulling. I&#x27;ve switched to this product and I love it. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried actual oil pulling yet, I just finished a lot of research, and I am going start this weekend.... I did use it for my skin a little bit, and I LOVE it...  I have a lot of issues with my gums, so I am really excited to try oil pulling and see what a difference there is at my next dentist appt!!</li>
    <li> Love this product -- It lives up to it&#x27;s name. I will definitely use it again ~~ Thanks for the great deal too !</li>
    <li> I have used sesame oil products for about 10 years.  I’m so glad I was able to purchase this Sublime Beauty organic sesame oil at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased evaluation and review.  I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sesame oil is awesome.  I knew from the moment I opened the bottle and smelled that wonderful, familiar aroma that I was going to like it.  I squirt this oil straight into my mouth for oil-pulling.  I never have been able to get past 5 minutes or so, regardless of whether I’m using sesame oil or coconut oil.  But I figure that amount of time is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this sesame oil to coconut oil for oil-pulling (though I do use coconut oil as a base for my homemade toothpaste.)  Not only does this oil leave my mouth and teeth feeling very clean, it also softens my lips.  I tend to have dry lips, so this is a bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve never pulled oil before, it might take some getting used to, but I promise it will be worth it.  Be sure after you are done swishing it all around your mouth that you spit it into the trash bin and not down the drain.  If you want to know more about oil-pulling, you can visit Sublime’s site and click on the oil-pulling tab or just do an internet search.  There’s a lot of good info out there.  I’m a definite fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this organic sesame oil and will definitely buy more as needed so this product gets an easy 5-star rating from me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical honestly before trying this Sesame Oil /Oil pulling, but am thoroughly impressed! I have late stage Lyme Disease, Babesiosis, Mold Mycoses, and Staph Sinitis. This brought relief the 1st day of using to my Chronic pain , edema from infection &amp; myriad of other symptoms. Symptoms returned next AM, but am hopeful continued use will prolong healing effect (maybe cure? ). Lil difficult to get used to texture of oil, but result&#x27;s are 110% worth it! *Received product at discounted rate for review upon trying*</li>
    <li> Was not sure at first about doing this, but after I saw videos on oil pulling well I decided to give it a try. This sesame oil is the best and my teeth feel so good after I do it also my lips have become so soft.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Great product for oil pulling!</li>
    <li> I love that I got such a large size for the price! Great quality as well!</li>
    <li> This sesame oil is awesome.. I’m so glad I was able to purchase this Sublime Beauty organic sesame oil. got this at discounted price.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to try this for oil pulling as I expected it to have a gross taste, but I havent had that problem at all. I have only used it for oil pulling and love it! My teeth feel so much cleaner, and I feel it works better than coconut oil I have been using. Definitely recommend (:</li>
    <li> I tried this product and couldn&#x27;t use it because of the taste.  I will try to find something else I can use if for, just not for oil pulling.  It was my first time to try it and I was unsuccessful.  If all oils taste like this then my 2 star rating wouldn&#x27;t be fair.  I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this as I have come to trust SB. They have never disappointed. It&#x27;s an odd feeling and I find I cannot swish the full 15 minutes but so far, it&#x27;s a good practice. My mouth does feel cleaner and fresher. We will see if I can keep it going.</li>
