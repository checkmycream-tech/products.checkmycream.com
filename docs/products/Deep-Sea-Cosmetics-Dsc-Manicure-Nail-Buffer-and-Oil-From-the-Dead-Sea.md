      <li>Just what I ordered,I only wanted the buffer and oil so for the price I am happy with my product.</li>
      <li>The cuticle oil and hand cream (Dead Sea Hand and Body Lotion) are great!</li>

      <li>so I came home and looked them up on the computer and found these products, the same as his, for a much more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
      <li>This buffer didn&#x27;t make my nails as shiny as the same brand available at the mall kiosks.</li>
      <li>do like the way my nails look, but the oil doesn&#x27;t help my cuticles as much as I would hope.</li>

      <li>Does a better job than more expensive cuticle oils.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>

      <li>Bought this set for my daughter as she has seen it at a local retailer for much higher price and declined to purchase.  </li>
      <li>My 9 year old grandchildren have been asking for these for Christmas after buffing their nails with Gramma&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It must be used gently so as not to remove too much or to bruise the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>but doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse then</li>

    <li> My 9 year old grandchildren have been asking for these for Christmas after buffing their nails with Gramma&#x27;s. No more toxic finger nail polish for my babies!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for my Winter dry hands and the splitting that I always got around my nails. The cuticle oil and hand cream (Dead Sea Hand and Body Lotion) are great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the price is right.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price because this same product at the mall was listed almost double.  I&#x27;ll never let it run out before purchasing another set.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered,I only wanted the buffer and oil so for the price I am happy with my product.</li>
    <li> My mother uses this product and asked me to find it for her- she absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it myself and found it to be really amazing.</li>
    <li> This item comes with a buffer and nail oil. The buffer is fantastic, I have used it on both fingers and toes. It leaves nails feeling clean, buffed and shiny. The shine lasts for a really long time as well. It has three sides, blue, burgundy, and white. Blue and burgundy do not need to be used for very long before progressing to the next step, white, which I believe is the side that finishes and gives the final shine. The block also seems durable and well made, no peeling of the sides as of yet. Possibly the best nail block I have ever used. I am under the impression that using this nail block is making my toe nail polish last longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is great, it does a great job nourishing cuticles and nails. Does a better job than more expensive cuticle oils. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and so the oil will last a long time. It has a great application nozzle to apply to cuticles. I apply and rub in to both the cuticles and nails. The oil absorbs quick as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of these products have left my nails healthy and strong, (not that i had any significant nail issues before use) and with great shine. After use I also use a dead sea salt hand lotion (by a different company, ahava), which is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products do a great job, and the price is right. Why pay three times as much for good results and healthy, beautiful nails?</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my daughter as she has seen it at a local retailer for much higher price and declined to purchase.  I have the same set and have been very pleased.  The buffer and cuticle oil does a great job on my nails.  I never get mine done at a salon so appreciate that I can get great results with this line of products.  So happy to find them on Amazon for such a reasonable price and free shipping!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this item, I was ambushed by a sales representative at the mall. She tried her best to sell me this item by stating that she was giving me a deal by selling it to me for $25, when they originally sell it for $75. I was skeptical of the dramatic price although I really enjoyed the buffer&#x27;s effect. I came home and searched online for hours until I stumbled on this deal. Obviously, I bought the product and I like it. Actually, I had a comment made by a girl friend when she saw my freshly buffed nails. It lasts for about two weeks and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints. How will it effect my nails in the long term? I don&#x27;t know. So far, my nails seem to be stronger and less \\&quot;chippy\\&quot;. I consider it a success and it was better than spending an additional $50 for it. Would I recommend it to a friend or an enemy? Yes. Why? Because it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Good to use. Made a huge difference to the look of my nails. Looked like I&#x27;d just been to the salon.</li>
    <li> Ordered after having my nails polished by a kiosk in the mall. Same product but at a tenth of the price! The oil has really helped my dry chapped cuticles and looking forward to using it through a cold winter. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was approached at the mall to buy these products from a kiosk there.  I liked what he did with my nail with his product but the things he sold were very expensive so I came home and looked them up on the computer and found these products, the same as his, for a much more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and go very easy on the amount of buffing you give your nails as this can make them to&lt;br /&gt;thin and frail. I&#x27;ve been able to successfully grow my nails out using this oil and buffer. I highly recommend that you&lt;br /&gt;purchase the kit which includes the Dead Sea Hand and Body Lotion, the file, Dead Sea oil and nail buffer. As in&lt;br /&gt;everything you need to keep your hands out of soap. Use rubber gloves when using harsh cleansers and when&lt;br /&gt;doing dishes. Use the oil on nails then apply the hand lotion over it to help seal it in. Follow the directions and&lt;br /&gt;it works!!! I have been using successfully for several years.</li>
    <li> BEST BUFFER, ULTIMATE SHINE, AND LONG LASTLY!!</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, and came sooner than expected! Great service and cant wait to order more from you in the future!!!</li>
    <li> Good file but doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse then a file you buy at the store. Maybe save your money and buy a cheaper one. Good shape file</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t make your nails as shiney or as healthy as the people in the mall claim. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> still trying but works ok for now shine not as good as at mall but will continue to try items</li>
    <li> This buffer didn&#x27;t make my nails as shiny as the same brand available at the mall kiosks. Sorry but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> It must be used gently so as not to remove too much or to bruise the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased it there was two buffers shown and I expected to receive two.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way my nails look, but the oil doesn&#x27;t help my cuticles as much as I would hope.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and daughter after it was demonstrated to me at a mall.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Deep Sea Cosmetics Manicure nail buffer and oil from the dead see cosmetics.  OK but I would not reorder. That it.</li>
