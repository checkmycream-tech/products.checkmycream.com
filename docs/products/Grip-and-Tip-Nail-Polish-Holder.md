<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So glad I finally got one.  I use it all the time.  Only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the base is not weighted.  Base is a bit flimsy, but if you use it on a flat surface, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> I was a little leery of this product simply because of the low price and because I have a lot of polish bottles of different shapes and sizes. So, I was really concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t hold them if they weren&#x27;t a specific shape. I was wrong! I haven&#x27;t had one bottle that didn&#x27;t fit in this. Also, I was worried that the tiny rubber feet on the bottom weren&#x27;t enough to keep it from moving and falling over when I pull the brush from the bottle and again, I was wrong. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s very convenient for me because I do my nails all the time and it holds the nail polish bottle for me which leaves my hands free. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like it, except it doesn&#x27;t tip down far enough to get all the polish out. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> The grip and tip holds tight to polish bottle and is a big help!! The tip angle is perfect for reapplicating your brush when speeds a must!!!</li>
    <li> great product. does not tip over. wish it was more flexiable but not going to complain. great little tool and holds all types of bottle shapes. love this thing. shipping was fast and packaging was good</li>
    <li> I actually hold the handle and rest the bottle on it&#x27;s bottom because I am not really sure it will hold up a full bottle. I do know that without it my shaky hands will turn over a bottle.  I do know that with it I can use clear polish w/out dumping the bottle and can even tilt the bottle where I can get to the bottom.</li>
    <li> Love this, has a problem with odd shapes like opi&#x27;s nicole line but still functions good</li>
    <li> Does not hold a variety of bottles, does not bend at good angles.  Better of leaving the polish on the table or in my hand.  This is going out for the next yard sale in the free box.</li>
    <li> Fits every kind of bottle shape I own, which is a lot. Adjusts well so that it doesn&#x27;t tip over. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift - I know this person will love this</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for me.  I bought for my sister, once she tells me what she thinks I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal thought when I opened it, which I only opened because the box was so light, I thought there was nothing in it!  I was disappointed, that it was so cheaply made.  I know I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot for it, but, I did expect something different.  I am not sure how it will hold a glass bottle, when it is made out of cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Love this! Wouldn&#x27;t be without it when I do my nails!</li>
    <li> There are 2 rubber pieces in the holding part. 1 rubber piece fell off immediately upon opening. The base of the holder doesn&#x27;t sit securely on a flat surface. The polish is too heavy and tops over.</li>
    <li> I like it, it does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> The idea was good, but the device doesn&#x27;t work.  The grip does not hold the nail polish firmly, it moves and slips out.  Any odd shape bottle can&#x27;t be held at all.</li>
    <li> easy to use and it really helps you to polish your nails quickly.</li>
    <li> What of piece of crap! Thing was broken before it even held a bottle of nail polish. Not even worth a dollar worthless junk</li>
    <li> Works great for almost empty polish. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it needs more weight on the base. It something that can be fixed yourself.  I love the concept and it is functional.</li>
    <li> This is really nice. It is made of plastic but very durable. The grip that holds the nail polish is spring loaded and hold the nail polish in any direction you would want. I would recommend this nail polish holder.</li>
    <li> this holds and tips the bottles very well, and I am able to use it, but the clip is rather weak and if I don&#x27;t place the bottles just right, they come out.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy at all and needs more weight on the bottom</li>
    <li> My teenager loved it!</li>
    <li> cool little tool!  well made and does grip any size bottle.  Well balanced, doesn&#x27;t tip over as I was afraid it might</li>
    <li> I just received mine today and I&#x27;m loving it... I ordered it on the Jan 8th and it arrived on the 14th, quick shipping😍.. It holds ALL of my Polish, no matter the size and no matter how much is in the bottle.. Thank You !!</li>
    <li> This was terrible it broke the first time I used it and it wouldn&#x27;t hold my nail polish. Bottom line it was bad.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junky plastic! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Yippeee!!!!  Did not take long to get here.  And boy, is it handy!!  Easy to use, very nice!!!!</li>
    <li> Is not very  sturdy, it&#x27;s cheap it seems, doeant hold the polish like I was expecting. UN satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> Depends on the bottle shape and weight.&lt;br /&gt;Will not hold Essie square bottle. Will hold CND if put in sideways. I wanted it to hold my stamping bottles. It does work if you have a gentle touch but not sure how long it will last since it is plastic and not made to last in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Happy with seevice and product</li>
    <li> Not made to hold all bottle shapes. The base is not heavy enough to hold all bottles</li>
    <li> Got this for my boss and she LOVED it! It was well made, and a hit with everyone at our Secret Santa party!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim, but I am so glad I did!  It holds my bottle of polish securely and can be adjusted to many positions.  It is great for bottles of polish that are new, as well as ones that are almost empty... and all levels of fullness in between!  This is such a help when it comes to securing your nail polish while you do your nails!  I never have to worry about the bottle tipping over as I stroke the bottle rim to get off excess polish.  It is a tool I never knew I needed so much until I had it.</li>
    <li> The base needs some weight to prevent it form being easily knocked over/falling over. Very top heavy. But can&#x27;t hold bottles, so glad I purchased this nail polish holder. holds the bottles high enough to see a big drip coming to prevent it.</li>
    <li> What a great tool every one should have one. It holds a small to regular size polish. You will never tip your polish again.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Quick response to delivering</li>
    <li> The base should have sand in it or something so it doesn&#x27;t tip over. It doesn&#x27;t hold non-round bottles very well, and getting it to some bottles just right make me worried I&#x27;m going to break the clip. But it does help get more polish out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It holds your polish so you don&#x27;t have to and if your running low it will hold your polish at an angle so you can have both your hands free. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work at first because it&#x27;s made of light weight plastic, but I was wrong. It works great! Really worth the money. I love it!</li>
    <li> This item was not as sturdy as I had hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened the packaging since it is a gift, but the box is dented, and I may need to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, a little early actually.</li>
    <li> This is Perfect for holding the polish bottle when you need a 3rd hand. And it can be adjusted so that you can actually use the polish that is in the  bottom of the bottle. It tips it perfectly for use and not wasting good polish.</li>
    <li> This was one of those great ideas poorly executed. I couldn&#x27;t seem to set the movable parts tight enough to hold the bottle in place. There are better options out there.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied. It holds the bottle well at the right angle, especially when there is not much left in the bottle. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This works great! Easy to use, just clip a bottle in and adjust the tilt. Good for many sizes of bottles. It also folds down for storage. Really frees up your hands and allows you to use the last drop!</li>
    <li> Cheap material, but does the job!</li>
    <li> Holds any size polish. Make sure to open bottle before placing in to the product especially if you&#x27;re using the nail covers</li>
    <li> The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give this gadget five stars is because it won&#x27;t hold all bottle shapes (like square ones), but aside from that I love it. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is a manicurist or just someone like me who enjoys changing their nail color often. It&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it will help me use the very last drop of my nail polishes, but maybe I am not using it as it should because I end up the same as if I just grab the bottle. I haven&#x27;t been able to finish any of my polishes. I end up throwing them.</li>
    <li> Does not dry nails quick enough</li>
    <li> Grip didn&#x27;t work.  Tried different size polishes but they all kept slipping out.  Really disappointing especially because it was a gift.</li>
    <li> The stand cannot stay in one place and we do not want to glue it to the table.  It should be made with a suction bottom that holds to the table.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It worked just as it is soposed to and you are able to get to the bottom of the nail polish jar and you can move it up and down so you can angle it anyway you want and make it flatef for storage.  I would def recommend this to my friends or anyone thats sick of sticking the bottle between your legs or going back and forth between your nails and a table in an awkward way.. super pleased.</li>
    <li> Saves on mess of spilled nail polish and it&#x27;s tilted so that you can get to the bottom of the nail polish bottle to use up the polish. My 13 year old loved it...until it got lost in her messy room. lol.</li>
    <li> Great way to free up your hands while paining!</li>
    <li> Getting that last bit out from a favorite, irreplaceable polish!  Love this!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grip any bottle regardless of shape tight enough. Bottles keep falling out of product. Doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love to do my nails and I am always nervous that I will knock over the bottle. This made me nervous that it was going to fall over because the bottle was too heavy. It didn&#x27;t fall this time but I&#x27;m sure it will happen over time. The quality isn&#x27;t the best but I don&#x27;t think you can expect too much for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Very useful gadget to hold polish, keeping your hands free, can be tipped, so you can get the very last drop of polish.</li>
    <li> This is so flimsy and light weight it can&#x27;t hold up the polish and keeps tipping over. I used it with a bottle of OPI polish. Frankly it just sucked. I tossed it.</li>
    <li> Concept is good, but it&#x27;s a little flimsy - easily broken and seems as if it might tip.</li>
    <li> I love this!!  The only negative is that the base isn&#x27;t heavier so depending on the tilt angle, it might tip over.  I plan to add some weight to the base so this doesn&#x27;t happen while I paint my nails.  Love that the clips are rubber lined so they grip well and it easily held my square Essie bottles.</li>
    <li> The clip that holds polish tilts. It&#x27;s very handy especially when doing your own nails. I love the fact that it can clip different size/shapes of polish.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Plastic. Very lightweight and isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold bottles of polish at any position. Can&#x27;t expect too much since the price was so cheap.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, I use for when I am painting my toe nails. the base sits on the carpet surface well, make the process easier!</li>
    <li> this nail polish holder has many angle potentials to give you that last bit of polish.  light weight and handy.</li>
    <li> Not as I expected,&lt;br /&gt;Kinda cheap looking&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to be that way&lt;br /&gt;But not that much&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still useful though</li>
    <li> Just as described. My granddaughter is very pleased. No more spilt bottles - hands free!</li>
    <li> This is a cute gift for the one in your life that loves to paint their nails.  I was expecting one of the 2 I ordered to be black, but both were white.  Check the prices careful because there where different prices for the exact same item!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I love that it adjusts to many different positions. It allows me to use nail polish from a mostly empty bottle. It&#x27;s also awesome that it folds down flat for storage.</li>
    <li> This product comes in very handy when doing your own nails, the only problem I had with it is the shape of the nail polish bottle, if it&#x27;s not round it doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> Must be very careful with this because it will break very easily.  I love that it holds the bottle up and in place but the construction is so cheap!!!</li>
    <li> i am giving this product a 5 star. it is easy to use, and it can fit any size of nail polish bottle. If you have a little of polish in the bottle it can tilt it a little and it makes it easier to get it out. It hold the bottle so you don&#x27;t have to. It also doesn&#x27;t have those frequent spills.</li>
    <li> does the job. i use it all the time &amp; bought a few as Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> It works fine unless you adjust it low it quickly tips over.</li>
    <li> This product is literally a tiny stand with a woman&#x27;s hair clip at the top. The item came damaged with black marks on it and the product itself doesn&#x27;t even work! It falls over and does not hold up ANY nail polish bottles i have .. even the lightest ones! And the clip does not move up and down like it was suppose to it is stationary. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a birthday gift for my daughter, when she took it out of the box and adjusted it a screw popped out and hit her in the forehead, she was able the find the &amp;#34;offending screw&amp;#34; she put it back together,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a holder for my nail polish for a while now and this one seemed to fit the bill. Less than $4? what a great price to try it out. It adjusts well and the clasp opens wide enough to accomodate even larger bottles of polish. My only concern is that it won&#x27;t hold up but only time will tell. I bought two just in case.</li>
    <li> It works ok, it does get wobbly when using an odd shaped polish. Some polishes are a little heavier and the adjuster causes some spillage, if you are careful then it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It works great!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing!  I bought one for my daughters and a second for my mother-in-law.  The articulating joints are so useful and tilt the bottle to the perfect angle.  At first I was worried that it was to flimsy and would easily break...  It is and it could...  but it&#x27;s cheap.  You get what you pay for and that&#x27;s fine with me.  As long as you&#x27;re careful with it, it should last a while.  Even if it does break, I&#x27;d definitely repurchase because I&#x27;ve never seen anything else like it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works best if you wedge the base under something or load it up with play-doh/clay/etc to give it a little weight. Made of very lightweight plastic and has a range of movement for best placement To get the most from your bottle.</li>
    <li> Received on time as promised. Love it so far. Seems to work great with all of the brands of nail polish I carry at home.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Was perfect gift for daughter. Still using it after 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet. Shipping was quick</li>
    <li> These are so handy.  I have always had problems with the bottle sliding allover the place.  Now it doesn&#x27;t.  If your bottles of polish are not round be sure to move the bottle around until you find the best fit.  I bought one for me and one for each of my teenage polish loving granddaughters for their birthdays.  I know they will love them.</li>
    <li> Very clever design, just what I need for those favorite polishes about to run out!</li>
    <li> This holder has no weight to hold a bottle of nail polish on a tilted angle it would turn over.</li>
    <li> Certain bottles are too heavy for holder! Base needs to be heavier to keep from toppling over</li>
    <li> Needs wt on bottom or will topple over</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t hold every shape nail polish bottle out there, but the ones it holds it holds securely at a useful angle. The unit is very lightweight, but has a broad enough base to be secure. As light as it is, it seems sturdy enough to do its job, and has here so far. A keeper!</li>
    <li> I love it but it could be a little sturdier.. If it wasnt so lite it would hold the nail polish up better.</li>
    <li> this thing is so awesome! you can move it different ways and the clip is strong so it holds onto the polish bottles really good! thats the best littlest money i&#x27;ve ever spent haha!</li>
    <li> When you put a bottle of nail polish in the holder it tips over.</li>
    <li> Works well. Some polishes seem a touch to heavy for it and so tries to slide out.  Sometimes if a bottle starts to slide it will stop at a point where it is more secure.  Overall not a bad purchase, I would get it in addition to another bottle holder. Since I wasn&#x27;t too sure if it would &amp;#34;hold up&amp;#34; I got amazon.com/gp/product/B005PYWS60 as well, which works very well with most bottles -- striper bottles not so well, those work better with this guy.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to use on some of my older rarer polishes where I only have a 1/3 of a bottle left. while it held the bottle at the perfect angle when I went to wipe the brush on the bottle the bottle tipped! Thankfully all I had to do was tighten the screw a tiny bit and it was problem solved. Overall the product quality wasn&#x27;t amazing but for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. It serves its purpose well enough for the amount I plan to use it. If you need to get the last bit of polish from the bottle I recommend it, otherwise I would stick to the rubber polish holders since they&#x27;re more stable and take up less space.</li>
    <li> Grips bottle of polish but there is nothing to hold base still.  It is very nice that it hold your polish at an angle and grips the bottle.  It would be a better product if it wasn&#x27;t just slippery hollow plastic at the base.</li>
    <li> But not very sturdy. Have only used it like twice because I&#x27;m afraid it will tip over and spill everywhere. Bought one as a gift as well - haven&#x27;t seen her use it at all.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with this product is that it tends to be unstable when I put the polish arm at a bit of an angle to get more out.  I solved it by taping a quarter to the base, so I still use it and am thankful to have it, but wish the base was a bit more stable.</li>
    <li> This is a great way not to spill your polish. Holds any shape of polish bottle have had any problems great buy.</li>
    <li> This thing won&#x27;t hold 90% of the Polish bottles.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and compact so it will fit anywhere.  I use it all the time! Great gift for anyone who loves doing nails.</li>
    <li> It works great . Love hands free use .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! This avoids spills.</li>
    <li> This works but not sure it is really worth spending money on. It is just okay.  I end up just leaving the bottle on the counter as before and it works just as good.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use my nail polish to the last drop. This allows me to do it while also holding the bottle so I can&#x27;t knock it over.</li>
    <li> It is a good idea, but cheaply made.  It broke before I could use it more than once.  I had to hold it while using because it tilts over, otherwise.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this, so much easier than trying to hold the bottle of polish when it&#x27;s almost empty</li>
    <li> I like it.  A heavier base would make it perfect.</li>
    <li> I was amazed when I saw this item and had to have it since I am always doing my own nails.  It arrived quickly that was a plus! The reason I am giving this item only 4 stars is becaue the base part is not metal it is made of plastic which makes it very light and easy to tip over.  Apparently there is a &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; way to use it and it will not cause tipping over I guess I need to master it. Other than that its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Well to begin with I chose 3 stars because it is OK, I like that it is convenient and small, but I hate how crappy the plastic is ( excuse my French ) but I guess that what you get for $2 or whatever. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use well worth the money. My daughter and I both like using it. It keeps the polish at an angle for the brush to get it easier.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life???!!! I love this, it makes it so much easier to do my own nails when I don&#x27;t have to try and prop a bottle between my knees so that I can tilt it without having to hold it too! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t made of such cheap plastic and had some weight ( that reads stabilization!!) to the base so that I wasn&#x27;t afraid of it falling over, but with that said it&#x27;s still much easier than the knee trick!!! I have recommended to my sisters and girlfriends and if it broke I&#x27;d buy again...</li>
    <li> Works just as described.</li>
    <li> Love this gadget! Don&#x27;t force it to a different postion... use a philips screw driver to loosen then tighten back.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stand for something else. It works well for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> Works best with round bottles of polish.  It is adjustable, but a screwdriver is needed to tighten.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well.</li>
    <li> This works really well with all types of bottles</li>
    <li> its my third hand while painting my nails. It keeps my bottle tilted so if the polish is running low I dont have a hard time getting it out</li>
    <li> thought that it would be ok well its more then ok, how did I live with out it I will never know so handy and easy to use</li>
    <li> Needs to have far HEAVIER BASE to hold nail color steady and useable. It is very brittle plastic, too, but it will work - at least for a while. It also needs more tilting positions.</li>
    <li> Very handy when painting nails</li>
    <li> Very useful.  Great idea.  Only thing that would have made it better is if base had a little weight to it.</li>
    <li> Perfect purchase, it works well.</li>
    <li> Falls over. Only good if the bottle is almost empty. It was a gift and the person can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> A sturdy, well built product that was put to use almost immediately upon arrival WITHOUT any regrets!! It is quite a convenient product and folds neatly away when not in use which is not often.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, is to weak to hold a nail polish bottle</li>
    <li> It works okay for smaller bottles but for bottles that are a bit bigger or odd shaped they are too heavy for it and it falls over. This could cause a HUGE mess, which is the exact opposite of why you buy this product.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. helps get the most out of your favorite nail polishes! this product holds many different bottle shapes.</li>
    <li> This Grip an&#x27; Tip holds the nail polish like a third hand. It also allows you to tip the bottle at an angle so you can reach more of the polish.</li>
    <li> My girls and I do nails often, and this is a very handy little gadget. We could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this can be used a 3rd hand kind of thing but I&#x27;m a little scared to actually use it. The holder works fine and holds just about every bottle shape but the base is just plastic so it seems as if it might tip over when you&#x27;re using it. But I think it should be okay. I&#x27;ll try it out and update this for sure so stay tuned!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s mom and my mom. They thought it was really neat. They are both nailpolish fanatics.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, help when I am applying my polishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tool with several polish shapes and it works well, though it could use some more weight in the base, as if the polish bottle is a heavy one (like Seche Vite) it can tip over. I&#x27;ve fixed this by weighting down the base while I use it, and plan on gluing something heavy and small (coins? flat rocks? something!) in the base, which is hollowed out. This is why I give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The articulated holding arm softly clicks into specific positions, but there are a LOT of positions, so you can find one that works best with the shape, weight of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clamp that holds the bottle is strong enough for heavy full bottles and is fairly easy to use, making it pretty good for changing out colors while your nails are still drying without smudging them.</li>
    <li> THE ANGLE IS A HUGE HELP!!!!MY HANDS TREMOR AND THIS KEEPS THE BOTTLE STEADY FOR ME.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!WILL SAVE ME MONEY AVOIDING SPILLS!</li>
    <li> This is a nice little gadget for tilting your nail polish, cuticle bottles and any small bottle of paint.  I like the wide base because it balances the botles and keeps them from tipping over.  It adjusts so the angle and height are right in your reach no matter where you position it.  It is lightweight and easy to move. The grip opens and closes easily with the &amp;#34;barrette&amp;#34; clamp, and holds with just enough pressure that even plastic bottles, even small bottles of polish remover will not be crushed.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life? I love that I can put any size nail polish bottle into this holder and it will not spill or move around on me.</li>
    <li> Smart design and great to use hand free. It sure will make my life easier to put the nail polish on.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a smart idea.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to adjust it, one of the screws popped out. I reassembled it with the screw and spring and the same thing happens every time I adjust it. Without the spring, either the joint won&#x27;t hold up at all, or you have to tighten it down so it won&#x27;t move at all and is locked in one position.</li>
    <li> I love that I can put my nailpolish on any surface just about and it won&#x27;t tip over!</li>
    <li> It would be nice if it didn&#x27;t tip over so easily.  Probably needs a grip pad under the bottom.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my friend who does my nails. She said it &#x27;freed up&#x27; a hand so she could work more effectively;). Yeah!</li>
    <li> Great product, did not have any problem with the size/shape of bottle. Afraid it will not last, but if not was a good price I&#x27;ll just buy another one.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter and she loves it, works great! A lot of people said it tips easily but that&#x27;s just because they were using it wrong.</li>
    <li> I have needed one of these for years - only I didn&#x27;t know they existed.  This thing is really quite handy and I am sure I will be using it a lot.</li>
    <li> We got this for our teen-aged daughter for Christmas as part of a larger package of all kinds of makeup and such.  She is really into makeup.  She said it&#x27;s ok.  The biggest fault of it is that it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t want to hold the bottle firmly.  It is also a bit tipsy.  It&#x27;s cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This should be called the &amp;#34;Grip N&#x27; Tip Over&amp;#34;.  I found this product to be poorly manufactured, lopsided, cheap quality and a total waste of money. I bought this in hopes of getting a few more uses out of my favorite polish bottles.  I was so disappointed to open this product and realize after placing it on the table that it was incredibly lopsided, very cheaply made and wouldn&#x27;t stand upright on the table alone, much less with a bottle of polish in it.  It looks like the base was fused together incorrectly and at an angle, so there was no way for it to sit sturdy.  For the price I paid for it, it wasn&#x27;t worth going through the return process, but I did want to warn others to not waste their money on this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok in that the base doesn&#x27;t support all polishes it&#x27;s too heavy and tips it over. But for the ones it doesn&#x27;t tip over it works well.</li>
    <li> This item does not work. It came in broke (one of the holders was off). Even if it came in all together, it is not strong enough to hold a bottle of polish without fear it would fall over! I did not even bother to return, because it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This works great for your favorite nail polish that is partially empty.  It holds it at the perfect angle to reach the remaining polish.  You don&#x27;t have to continually tip the bottle to get enough on the brush.</li>
    <li> This works just as described.  It adjusts the angle in multiple ways allowing me to get the polish from way down in the bottle without needing both hands.</li>
    <li> Works great. So handy. No more juggling!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, I love it. It bends any way I want it to. no more holding the bottle and having it slip out of my hands to make a mess. I cant say enough about it. I love it</li>
    <li> Great product. Tilted just right, no struggling to hold bottle and paint nails, or bottles slidding when you are putting brush in and out of the bottle or worse yet, the bottle tipping over.  Adjusts for different angles, heights, and holds a variety of different bottle shapes. Easy butterfly clasp grips fairly well, be sure to grip at the widest part of bottle. Good for holding miniature goose neck lights when doinf filing and shaping or a small magnifier for close work, its a third hand for any small bottles, even paint and touch ups.</li>
    <li> This product gives me the extra hand I need when I&#x27;m trying to paint my own nails.  It&#x27;s adjustable and holds the bottle tight for easy application.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this only holds the round bottle of polish. Nice but looks like a 99cent store item. Not worth the price but does the job.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Doesn&#x27;t hold all polishes and grip is not that strong.</li>
    <li> I bought these for Christmas gifts for my nieces and daughters they loved them</li>
    <li> I really like this. It was a product I found by chance, and I&#x27;m happy I ordered it. I was afraid it would tip over while holding a bottle of polish because it is so lightweight, but it worked great. It was able to hold an almost empty bottle at the angle I needed and I painted my nails with ease. This was a great little find.</li>
    <li> (My wife)  I have been looking for an angled nail polish bottle holder forever and finally found this one on amazon.  It works so well for when you are getting down to the last 1/4 of the  bottle and have to tip it to get it on the brush.  It is stable and eliminates the hassle of  picking up and tipping the bottle for every finger.  Would definitely recommend buying</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it was plastic, a little light but worked well.</li>
    <li> Got it haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet. But it will hold odd shaped nail polish bottle. The square ones.</li>
    <li> Works great.  But you might have to tighten the screws so that it will stay in position.</li>
    <li> Does help the process but could use a tighter grip.</li>
    <li> This did not hold a regular size bottle of OPI polish which is the only polish I own so this product is useless to me!</li>
    <li> at first it works really great but now it&#x27;s kind of flips down when you put the bottle in I still like it</li>
    <li> Go this for my daughter and it broke the first night. very disappointed that it was so cheaply made. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
