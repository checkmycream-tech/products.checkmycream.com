### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>Great conditioner!!</li>
      <li>Very happy with  this purchase.</li>
      <li>Not the awesome conditioner that Naturtint sells with their hair color.  </li>
      <li>GREAT MOISTURIZER!  </li>
      <li>This is very good and formulated with the Naturtint coloring products.</li>
      <li>This is a very good conditioner for colored hair.  </li>
      <li>great, as it gives my hair life</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner for the price.</li>
      <li>It is a good conditioner and it is good for your hair.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Very pricey per ounce, but works great!</li>
      <li>I really like the Naturtint hair dye and as a result of that experience I decided to spend the money on purchasing the shampoo and conditioner as I thought the shampoo and conditioner packets included in the dye were great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to return my hair to the way it was years ago....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad they started marketing it separately from the hair color, because I need it more often than once per coloring.</li>
      <li>LOVE the product that comes in the hair color kit</li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy with this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a result, I had to use quite a bit more since most of it seeped through my fingers.</li>
      <li>I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel.</li>
      <li>, I have tried many it works really well.</li>
      <li>A $4 bottle of  color-care conditioner found in a drug store does a much better job, and you won&#x27;t spend as much money.</li>
      <li>I also bought the shampoo, which was about 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>kind so it was easy to get every little bit of the product out of it)</li>
      <li>First of all the bottle did not come full - yes it was heat sealed in shrink - but a good 1/4 of the bottle was missing.</li>
      <li>Allergies have consistently prevented me from using much more than Little Twig Detangler and Agadr Hair Oil, both great products but not the same as a rinse-out conditioner.</li>
      <li>bottle comes half full, it&#x27;s kind of pricey for about 1/2 cup of conditioner</li>
      <li>It looked like I was getting a lot more than was actually in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try this product for the first time as i received some samples.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!!</li>
      <li>I was able to condition my hair only 6 times, meaning it lasted about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Such a great product for such a low price.</li>
      <li>Love this - leaves my hair softer and less frizzy when I use it.  </li>
      <li>I love the hair conditioner and the hair dye and will continue to use those products, but I will use a different shampoo in the future.</li>
      <li>The option is to buy an extra bottle because it goes quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost as if water was added to the bottle considering the separation between what essentially should be more solid like and the liquid.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>She loves their natural hair color too!!</li>
      <li>glad they started selling it on Amazon because the sample in the hair color box is small.</li>
      <li>My hair is SOFT.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d almost given up on ever having soft hair again.</li>
      <li>As far as the quality of the product ...</li>
      <li>Mostly natural stuff.  </li>
      <li>This product works well with the hair coloring system and so far works well after when just shampooing and administering it to your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>This conditioner really makes my colored hair soft and smooth and repairs dry lifeless hair within a few uses.  </li>
      <li>Right now, when I look at this product on-line, the price went from the $13.82 that I paid and is now down to $8.99 -</li>
      <li>This is the only &#x27;natural&#x27; conditioner I like.  </li>
      <li>I like this product, but the bottle is small and it finishes too quickly.</li>
      <li>but this makes it even better: silky, manageable, without being heavy, sticky, gooey or stiff!</li>

<li> I had to purchase extra of this because I use the Naturtint hair coloring and although a small packet of this &amp;#34;Multiplier&amp;#34; is included in the hair coloring kit, it isn&#x27;t nearly enough to cover my long, thick hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this product, but the bottle is small and it finishes too quickly. I will continue to use it w/the dye it is included in.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel. The problem was that there was very little product in the bottle. I was able to condition my hair only 6 times, meaning it lasted about 2 weeks. I also bought the shampoo, which was about 3/4 full.</li>
    <li> This is a conditioner for colored hair, that helps to maintain the shine after every wash.  It comes in the package with the dye.  Now I have 7ozs so that I can use it after every wash, and keep my hair looking radiant.  Very happy with  this purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the Naturtint hair dye and as a result of that experience I decided to spend the money on purchasing the shampoo and conditioner as I thought the shampoo and conditioner packets included in the dye were great.  I was first disappointed with the fact that the upper quarter of the bottle was empty, so It looked like I was getting a lot more than was actually in the bottle.  Right now, when I look at this product on-line, the price went from the $13.82 that I paid and is now down to $8.99 - now I feel a little ripped off.  The shampoo in this bottle seemed thinner and less sudsy than the packet in the hair dye box.  I love the hair conditioner and the hair dye and will continue to use those products, but I will use a different shampoo in the future. I&#x27;m still totally sold on Naturtint, but for me, the shampoo did not hit the mark.</li>
    <li> Mostly natural stuff.  She tells me that it works.  Who am I to argue?  She loves their natural hair color too!!</li>
    <li> I have normal-oily hair. This is the only &#x27;natural&#x27; conditioner I like.  It moisturizes without being heavy- there&#x27;s never a build-up on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this - leaves my hair softer and less frizzy when I use it.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair looks shiny and healthy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;So glad they started selling it on Amazon because the sample in the hair color box is small.</li>
    <li> This product works as described. It is a good conditioner and it is good for your hair. The manufacterer needs to offer it in a larger container. The option is to buy an extra bottle because it goes quick.</li>
    <li> The Nutrideep product seems to work as expected. I used after shampoo. I wanted to try this product for the first time as i received some samples.</li>
    <li> Wish this was in brick and mortar stores but I know where to get it if I run out of it.</li>
    <li> GREAT MOISTURIZER!  GOES WITH THE NATURTINT SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product with that I acquired in the box with the hair product, what a shine, what a texture!! I highly recommend this, I have tried many it works really well. This product works well with the hair coloring system and so far works well after when just shampooing and administering it to your hair and scalp. Such a great product for such a low price. Five stars is what it deserves!!</li>
    <li> After using this, my long hair is dry and tangled. A $4 bottle of  color-care conditioner found in a drug store does a much better job, and you won&#x27;t spend as much money.</li>
    <li> This is very good and formulated with the Naturtint coloring products. It keeps my hair softer when it dries out with using coloring products.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really makes my colored hair soft and smooth and repairs dry lifeless hair within a few uses.  I&#x27;ve used this conditioner (included in Naturtint hair coloring also) for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t think of changing.  Other conditioners seem to coat the hair strand but this one never appears to lay heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> Allergies have consistently prevented me from using much more than Little Twig Detangler and Agadr Hair Oil, both great products but not the same as a rinse-out conditioner. I had dandruff even with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Naturtint shampoo and multiplier together have cured the dandruff without giving me an itchy scalp or a rash. My hair is SOFT. I&#x27;d almost given up on ever having soft hair again. For those who want volume, this combo will give it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes half full, it&#x27;s kind of pricey for about 1/2 cup of conditioner and I can&#x27;t find it locally if I run out. If it were a little cheaper (or if the bottle was the scoop-out kind so it was easy to get every little bit of the product out of it) it would get five stars.</li>
    <li> it works well when distributed well from roots to ends.</li>
    <li> Rather disappointed with the product.  LOVE the product that comes in the hair color kit but this product doesn&#x27;t come close. First of all the bottle did not come full - yes it was heat sealed in shrink - but a good 1/4 of the bottle was missing. As far as the quality of the product ... this is NOT the CREAM like the bottle advertises or what can be found in the hair color kit.  The product I received was separating - similar to how lotion separates when you add water.  The product itself was runny and came out of the bottle with the consistency of water.  As a result, I had to use quite a bit more since most of it seeped through my fingers. It&#x27;s almost as if water was added to the bottle considering the separation between what essentially should be more solid like and the liquid.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I use the Naturtint hair color and there is a sample of the shampoo and conditioner included.  This is a very good conditioner for colored hair.  My hair is softer and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade.  It is a very small size though for the price.</li>
    <li> Not the awesome conditioner that Naturtint sells with their hair color.  Could tell that its a different formula immediately when I put it on my hair.  Makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Very pricey per ounce, but works great!</li>
    <li> I thought this would give life to my hair but it was dull and dry - had to stop after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase extra of this because I use the Naturtint hair coloring and although a small packet of this &amp;#34;Multiplier&amp;#34; is included in the hair coloring kit, it isn&#x27;t nearly enough to cover my long, thick hair.  This actually works better than Nexxus Humectrus (sorry spelling) Great conditioner!! I recommend it highly!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;m so glad they started marketing it separately from the hair color, because I need it more often than once per coloring. I&#x27;ve tried many products to return my hair to the way it was years ago.... but this makes it even better: silky, manageable, without being heavy, sticky, gooey or stiff! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from the seller.  It helps extends the life of Naturtint color.  Leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> great, as it gives my hair life</li>
