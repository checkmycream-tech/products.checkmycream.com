      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love,  Love, Love.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better quality and color.</li>
      <li>SATISFIED WITH YOUR PURCHASE.</li>
      <li>so I ordered more.</li>
      <li>good mascara, but didn&#x27;t give as much length as I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I think they could have made that more clear.</li>
      <li>It has a really good brush that holds enough mascara to really coat the lashes but doesn&#x27;t clump them together.</li>
      <li>The packing was very good and came earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but these come in tiny containers</li>
      <li>Although not a stand-out mascara for me, I can definitely tell it&#x27;s of a higher quality than most.</li>
      <li>one large tube was drying out before I could use it all</li>
      <li>I prefer this mascara and the wand to others I&#x27;ve bought and this saved me a trip to the department store where I would have to purchase the large size.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you about this Clinique High Impact Mascara!</li>
      <li>very clotting.</li>
      <li>These came really fast.</li>
      <li>Love the little size since I don&#x27;t use mascara that often</li>
      <li>I use them for everyday application because the shorter length of the applicator allows for better control when applying.</li>
      <li>Love the small travel sizes.</li>
      <li>I always buy it in the small sizes though, because it goes on better for some reason.</li>
      <li>I have developed a sty after using this mascara.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I was ready to splurge on an expensive mascara if that&#x27;s what it took to get really beautiful lashes.</li>

<li> and these (hopefully) won&#x27;t dry out.</li>
<li> The small ones last quite a long time</li>
<li> It is glossy and very black.</li>
<li> purchased as I wanted a small mascara to take in my liquids bag.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a decade.</li>
<li> but they are thin.</li>
<li> This might have caused it and it is at the very least very irritating to my eyes.</li>
<li> With Clinique I can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
<li> I have very thin eyelashes</li>
<li> During that time I&#x27;ve forgotten to order and had to buy a store brand and hated it everytime.</li>
<li> So I 100% recommend this mascara you will not be disappointed!</li>

    <li> Love the little size since I don&#x27;t use mascara that often and these (hopefully) won&#x27;t dry out. I prefer this mascara and the wand to others I&#x27;ve bought and this saved me a trip to the department store where I would have to purchase the large size.</li>
    <li> Although not a stand-out mascara for me, I can definitely tell it&#x27;s of a higher quality than most.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara.  Been wearing it for years and was delighted to find it here on Amazon!  I will buy it again and again!  Does not flake and stays in place until I take it off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> very clotting. returned them</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you about this Clinique High Impact Mascara! I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a decade. During that time I&#x27;ve forgotten to order and had to buy a store brand and hated it everytime. So I 100% recommend this mascara you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love these mascaras! They work so well and are a great size to throw in your bag.</li>
    <li> So, so. The brush is short and too big to get my tiny lashes.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Would recommend this mascara to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is in my top 3 mascaras of all time! It is glossy and very black. I have very long lashes but they are thin. This formula can be layered and I never have clumps are flaking after time! I buy small tubes so they stay fresh and to make sure I have a germ free product, esp since I have horrible allergies and my eyes burn constantly.  This is the only mascara I have used that stays on me all day! Tell me how you like it or if you have any questions......https://www.facebook.com/ThaliaDoesMakeUp</li>
    <li> purchased as I wanted a small mascara to take in my liquids bag.  Didn&#x27;t need four of them, but a good price and quality.</li>
    <li> ...do I keep trying different mascaras when I always revert back to Maybelline!  Hope you have better luck ladies!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mascara. It has a really good brush that holds enough mascara to really coat the lashes but doesn&#x27;t clump them together. It defines and volumizes! The mascara is high-quality and is almost a &amp;#34;one-coat&amp;#34; mascara. Seriously, I was ready to splurge on an expensive mascara if that&#x27;s what it took to get really beautiful lashes. This is a great mascara, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase, shipped fast. one large tube was drying out before I could use it all so having these smaller ones is just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Love,  Love, Love.  With Clinique I can&#x27;t go wrong.  And what a deal!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I always buy it in the small sizes though, because it goes on better for some reason. Probably the size of the brush.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have found!! I have very thin eyelashes but with this mascara, you can&#x27;t tell.  :)</li>
    <li> Clinque has good mascara and this was a great deal. It really stays fresher by having the small multiple tubes, you can rotate.</li>
    <li> These came really fast. The mascara is the best I&#x27;ve used. Great value</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better quality and color. Love the small travel sizes. I use them for everyday application because the shorter length of the applicator allows for better control when applying.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price.  The small ones last quite a long time but, I am only doing my upper lashes so, it seems to last a bit longer.</li>
    <li> SATISFIED WITH YOUR PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this mascara and I liked it, so I ordered more. I also like it because it&#x27;s a travel size and fits in a purse. I would buy this product again. The packing was very good and came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I like that this mascara washes off easity with soap and water, but it holds up well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite mascara, works wonderful, looks great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> good product, applies well</li>
    <li> I love this product, but these come in tiny containers and I didn&#x27;t realize this when purchasing. I think they could have made that more clear.</li>
    <li> good mascara, but didn&#x27;t give as much length as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I have developed a sty after using this mascara. I used my mac mascara and it does not irritate the sty. This might have caused it and it is at the very least very irritating to my eyes.</li>
