      <li>The smell is divine, but I don&#x27;t think it helped prevent my hair from becoming overly dry.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>HIghly recommendation for over processed and colored air from my hair dresser.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants a natural shine look.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and gives your hair a lot of shine, just not much in the heat protection department.</li>
      <li>The lid was off of the orchid oil, but thankfully because of the new bottle with a pump, none of the oil had leaked out.  </li>

      <li>I live on the high desert in Arizona and my hair dries out and goes flat.  </li>
      <li>Very dry and hot there.  </li>
      <li>It really helps take the frizz out of my hair on those days when I let it air dry.</li>
      <li>The smell only lasts a few hours but my hair looks and feels smooth all day long.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; it tends to get unruly, and dry toward the ends.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I got a sample of it once and it worked so well on my hair.  I have very fine soft hair but a few drops of this would keep the little hairs from sticking up.  I got hair extensions and put the oil shine on them and they are now so soft and tangle free.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> Very satisfied by the control and shine this product gives me. Would recommend to anyone who wants a natural shine look.</li>
    <li> This product is doing wonders for my hair.  I live on the high desert in Arizona and my hair dries out and goes flat.  This oil gives it body.</li>
    <li> I will start off by stating I did not by this on amazon but from a salon.  All this product is, is a silicone smoother.  The issue I have with the product is that Clyclomethicone is actually not good for your hair because it creates build up.  There are healthier products for your hair on the market.</li>
    <li> product is very light weight which is great for fine hair</li>
    <li> Smells great. But when it came to me the pump was broken.</li>
    <li> This product is the best. If you have frizzy hair, this really works to get rid of the frizz and leaves your hair soft smooth shiny and leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
    <li> The pump on it was broken causing the oil to leak. Fortunately I had an old pump from a previous bottle to switch it out with.</li>
    <li> The smell is divine, but I don&#x27;t think it helped prevent my hair from becoming overly dry.  It is light weight and gives your hair a lot of shine, just not much in the heat protection department.</li>
    <li> My wife says that I like this product (she really does--I really do not what it does but, as instructed, I use it)</li>
    <li> Im sure this product works good for some people but it isn&#x27;t what i thought it was and its not what i wanted. i thought it was Orchid  oil but its not. the ingredients in this product are : Cyclomethicone, Dimethiconol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, (Bulbophyllum Sp.), Fragrance (orchids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as you can see the only &amp;#34;orchid&amp;#34; in it is to give it a fragrance. The so called moisturizers are just synthetic and they only coat your hair they don&#x27;t actually make your hair healthier or anything just gives it a fake appearance of looking healthy and for the amount of money this costs id much rather stick to my organic unrefined coconut oil now that really does heal and fix your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser sold me on this product last year. It&#x27;s great for taming fly aways but it much more expensive at her salon that Amazon. So, go ahead and indulge...it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to White Sands Orchids Oil &amp; shine while visiting friends in Las Vegas.  Very dry and hot there.  It worked wonders on my hair.  I loved the softness and the very nice scent of Orchid Oil.  One of my friends wanted more shine for her hair and said this didn&#x27;t give enough shine so she puts it on her skin after showering and absolutely loves it.  Hummm, food for thought.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it leaves your hair shiny, soft and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomment this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist told me about this, including that she likes to use it on her hands. That is what I use it for, and just a small squirt will coat my hands well and make them as soft as can be.</li>
    <li> I first discovered orchid oil in a small beauty shop. I was looking for a control frizz product that actually worked on my son&#x27;s ringlets. After I ran out of the oil, I attempted to find less pricy frizz-control oils. People have raved about Moroccan oil, and Bed Head products, so I tried them. I found them to be nowhere nearly as effective as Orchid oil.&lt;br /&gt; This is the first time I purchased the oil online. Still too pricey, but it is a few bucks cheaper than the salon price was. It is very effective and only requires a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best applied on wet, freshly conditioned hair.</li>
    <li> I was told it was as good if not better than Argan oil.  I am not that impressed with it.  I went back to Argan oil</li>
    <li> HIghly recommendation for over processed and colored air from my hair dresser.  It brings a shiny and soft look for your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a great product for hair, I will always use Orchid Oil and Shine by White Sands.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years! I love that they added a pump no spilling like before :O)</li>
    <li> Great product, made my hair shiny and frizz-less (especially after use with a flat iron). A little goes a long way and as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, your hair will not look greasy the next day. Very happy with this product, glad it is being sold on Amazon as the shipping is faster than dealing directly with the company.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair dresser used it on me and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since!  Makes my thick, course hair so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I got a sample at a salon and have been using it every since! Smells great, and makes my hair shine!</li>
    <li> Have been having a hard time finding a product that actually works well with my unruly curly hair. This serum is definitely a life saver. To top it off it smells amazing. A must buy!</li>
    <li> The product is great; however, the dispenser on this bottle is kinda junk.  When I depress the pump the product oozes out at the base of the plunger.  I make due since at least the product I like is coming out</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Works well and keeps hair shiney. Be careful not to use too much as it can look weighted down. With my hair type  I have to be careful with product like that.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how this makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and on time, and it is as described.  I have already used this product in the past, and it definitely meets it&#x27;s excellent expectations.  However, when it arrived, I feared that it may be broken since I could hear it rolling around inside the much too large box.  When I opened the packaging box, the box the oil was in had completely come apart.  The lid was off of the orchid oil, but thankfully because of the new bottle with a pump, none of the oil had leaked out.  There was absolutely no filler inside the box, so it was obvious the product had been rolling about back and forth inside the box.  It would not have taken much to at least stuff some newspaper inside the box to prevent this from happening.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product.  My stylist introduced me to it and I love it.  It does not make my hair heavy or oily.  Leaves it shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this! It leaves my hair soft and smells very nice. I definitely recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> This oil has revitalized my color treated dry hair!  I highly recommend it!  I use only once a week after washing my hair- made a big difference!</li>
    <li> The smell was too strong for me. The bottle also leaked easily.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, it smells great (I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes- this isn&#x27;t perfumy) and because I use so little it will last my forever!</li>
    <li> This oil smells and feels wonderful on my skin and hair.  It&#x27;s good for skin &amp; hair, so I put it on after taking a shower.  I also use it at night on my hands and hair because it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hair and decided to try this at the suggestion of my mother in law.  Can&#x27;t get enough!  Never makes my hair greasy but really tones down the frizz, looks shiny, and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this hair oil! It really helps take the frizz out of my hair on those days when I let it air dry. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the White Sands Orchids Oil. But, this does not have a pump as advertised and the large opening makes it difficult to manage.</li>
    <li> The White Sands Orchid oil is the best I have every used.  Does not weight down my hair (my hair is baby-fine), smells delicious and makes my hair very shiny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product now several times and I still love it. It smells really good and is very light weight so I can use it on my thin hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and fragrance as well as control of the frizzies</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells amazing, light and fresh! Leaves a great shine that&#x27;s not too &#x27;oily&#x27;.</li>
    <li> My husband always comments on how great my hair smells when I use a few drops before bed.  White Sands Oil never makes my hair looks greasy, even if I overdose.  I have bleached blonde hair and I use it daily after my shower.  The smell only lasts a few hours but my hair looks and feels smooth all day long.  They have recently changed from a pour spout to a pump which makes it even easier to use.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so soft! Also helps with frizz and manageability :)</li>
    <li> The beauty shop used this same orchid oil on my hair, made it soft and smell good.  I ordered it here, very pleased</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works well to tame my frizzy hair. I do have to apply to my wet hair before I use hairdryer and a bit after to tame my hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; it tends to get unruly, and dry toward the ends. Just a small amount controlls the frizz &amp; with regular use keeps the ends nice. I use my regular &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; product over it. Plus, it smells divine!</li>
