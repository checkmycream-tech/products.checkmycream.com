      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the lavender and the peppermint and love them both.</li>
      <li>I use this at work and love it.</li>
      <li>I mostly use this to spray on my feet after I shower at the gym.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
      <li>The product smells good, it rubs in quickly and easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hands like some hand sanitizers do.</li>
      <li>Fits easily into my pocketbook.  </li>

      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really want to use any of it since it&#x27;s not sealed and no longer a sterile product.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the peppermint over the lavender because the lavender is really pungent.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and that this is natural with essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend unless you want to pay for 6 and only get 5 full bottles</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous and does&#x27;nt dry your skin</li>
      <li>It has moisturizing ingredients that basically compensate for the drying effect of its main ingredient -- alchohol.</li>
      <li>The spray is convenient and not messy.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the hands soft.</li>
      <li>Unusable and apparently can&#x27;t be returned because it&#x27;s a &amp;#</li>
      <li>It would be even nicer if it came in a thin tube size or in flexible packaging, but I&#x27;m satisfied and will order it again.</li>

    <li> Great stuff! I use it at work and the scent is so wonderful I had to get my coworkers their own bottles. Seriously, it&#x27;s intoxicating and invigorating at the same time. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Perfect hand sanitizer.  Usually get it at Whole Foods</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is great - both the scent and the packaging.  I keep one in the car, my purse, and gym bag. The spray is convenient and not messy.  Never leaks.</li>
    <li> This is super easy to use and smells great.  I love that this is portable and now we have 6 so extras for everyone.  I really like Organic products that don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. This fits our needs well. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Everyone always says, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that, it smells good?&amp;#34; when I use this and the lavender scent.  They can&#x27;t believe it when I tell then it&#x27;s hand sanitizer.  I always gift it for xmas and I use it at work with kids.  All this and it is safe without any harsh, toxic chemicals as found in conventional hand sanitizer, which make me feel a bit ill...</li>
    <li> Hand sanitizer is a funny thing.  We spray it here, there, and everywhere, and I&#x27;m not sure that it does a lick of good.  So I don&#x27;t buy this stuff for my hands - I have soap and water.  But, I do use it on my feet before I put on sandals.  Keeps that sandal funk down.  That&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
    <li> The product smells good, it rubs in quickly and easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hands like some hand sanitizers do. I really like it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells very fresh and there&#x27;s no sticky residue.  Very handy to keep in my car, at my desk, in my purse, etc.</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged, leaking all over the packaging. Unusable and apparently can&#x27;t be returned because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hazardous material.&amp;#34; Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and use this product on my hands and to wipe down the face cradle of my massage chair when doing corporate massage. The scent is nice without being overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel sticky like some other hand sanitizers do. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic and It works!  I use this for my toddler when we&#x27;re at the playground, in stores or anywhere that may be germy.  She use to get sick ALL the time after being in public places but not anymore with this product.  I prefer the peppermint over the lavender because the lavender is really pungent.  I have to be cautious of spraying the lavender in tight spaces around in close proximity to others.  I am stocked up on this stuff now.  It&#x27;s in the kitchen, nursery, car, stroller....</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful on the skin, with a slight tingling sensation from the peppermint.  It has moisturizing ingredients that basically compensate for the drying effect of its main ingredient -- alchohol.</li>
    <li> Great hand sanitizer. Leaves my hands feeling moisturized and clean instead of dry and clean like most hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,  doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful; perfect purse size. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Strong peppermint scent after you first spray but quickly dissipates.  I also like that it&#x27;s organic.  Fits easily into my pocketbook.  Good price for six of these. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend unless you want to pay for 6 and only get 5 full bottles</li>
    <li> Nicely scented hand spray. It&#x27;s 62% Organic Ethanol. It would be even nicer if it came in a thin tube size or in flexible packaging, but I&#x27;m satisfied and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and that this is natural with essential oils.  It feels cleaner than a gel and the bottles I got have been stashed all over-</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  The peppermint scent is fresh, the ingredients organic, and it does the job without any viscous residue.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Handy size to keep in your purse.  Doesn&#x27;t have that strong alcohol smell that most other products have.</li>
    <li> It smells great and is easy on your hands</li>
    <li> The hand sanitizer spray is wonderful and has an amazingly pleasant smell, but each time I order, all bottles have leaked during transit and I am paying for 1/2 full bottles! This is my second order from Amazon with the same issue. PLEASE LEARN HOW TO PACKAGE THIS BETTER!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this at work and love it. Keeps the hands soft. Have to hide it as staff will use it all up!</li>
    <li> very nice scent.  easy to carry in purse.  no cancer causing chemicals</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the average person can test how well this works as a sanitizer, but I trust that it&#x27;s working! I&#x27;ve tried the lavender and the peppermint and love them both. The peppermint is not overpowering, yet it makes the area around you smell fresh after you&#x27;ve sprayed it. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with packaging and leaking either.</li>
    <li> Why buy alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you can get this? Accidentally get it in your mouth via finger? No problem. Accidentally get this in your eye via finger? Big problem. Easy spray; I keep one in the bathroom for lazy guests, 4 in the car (one on each door for after the grocery store), one in my desk and one in my purse. Great peppermint smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like this or not because all the bottles leaked in shipment and over 1/2 the product I paid for is gone.  I don&#x27;t really want to use any of it since it&#x27;s not sealed and no longer a sterile product.  And I&#x27;m not paying to return it.  Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this is one of the nicest products on the market. It smells fabulous and does&#x27;nt dry your skin</li>
    <li> I mostly use this to spray on my feet after I shower at the gym.  It just gives me piece of mind if nothing else.  It smells wonderful too.</li>
