      <li>It&#x27;s made with rose petals, rose extract and rose oil which give it the most delicious rose fragrance.</li>
      <li>When I went to re-order, I noticed the Rose.</li>
      <li>My daughter was thrilled to receive it.</li>
      <li>While this is an awesome brand, and the product itself is great, I will NEVER order through Amazon again, and certainly NEVER recommend any product through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my adult daughter who says it is wonderful for her  skin which is prone to allergic outbreaks of hives</li>
      <li>Lovely rose smell, very rich.</li>
      <li>It is a very light scent.  </li>
      <li>But if you mist your face first - I use rose water! -</li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s the real deal, so makes me happy every time I use it (using now for daytime moisturizer).</li>
      <li>And it smells lovely</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem any more.</li>
      <li>and I truly love the way my skin looks.</li>
      <li>and I just love how creamy it fills when you put it on</li>
      <li>I do use the Acai on my lower neck and chest, and it&#x27;s okay for me in that area.  </li>
      <li>what more could i ask for?</li>
      <li>smells lovely.  </li>
      <li>works great with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit thick,and doesn&#x27;t smooth out as easily as a lighter weight product.</li>
      <li>My skin looks healthy and I smell pretty!</li>
      <li>Eighty dollars for Prime, for the advantage of free shipping.</li>
      <li>stuff dries matte on your face like cheap drugstore brand body</li>
      <li>I love the eminence sweet red rose product line!</li>
      <li>I do like this cream, as it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  </li>
      <li>I think too many people are using Eminence full strength and irritated at the price or how fast it goes or too greasy</li>
      <li>the soft smell of rose is not over baring, it is subtle, my face feels refreshed and protects from the dryness of my work place, absolutely perfect for my skin!</li>
      <li>Sweet Rose always does the trick leaving my skin soft and smooth but not oily (unless I use too much).</li>
      <li>That way one jar will last the better part of a year!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money they charge for this product and am looking for an alternative.</li>
      <li>It has definitely made my skin firmer, more plump, and it has a dewy youthful look.</li>
      <li>Then I rub it into my hands and then go back and pat the face some more.  </li>
      <li>but these products are the first that have made a noticeable change in the way my skin looks.</li>
      <li>More trouble than it&#x27;s worth, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews of the regular rose whip moisturizer (orange),</li>
      <li>and then it gets absorbed by the skin entirely leaving you feeling light and velvety.  </li>
      <li>love how it feels, smells and the results I get every single</li>
      <li>this moisturizer is so nice, it works well on my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t helped much with hydrating my face and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Waste of money, just nice scent.</li>
      <li>I use the sweet red rose facial cleanser, stone crop hydrating mist and this moisturizer daily.</li>
      <li>this is the best face moisturizer ever,  It only takes a small amount as it goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I would have much rather spent it at work, doing something I enjoy, than what I just had to go through.</li>
      <li>Always a sucker for rose scented products</li>
      <li>and it last me 5-6 months, which makes it worth the money.</li>
      <li>It costs more than what I would typically spend, but it works for my skin!</li>
      <li>Amazon graciously sent me a new cream w/in two days.</li>
      <li>While I live close to the post office, I chose that route for return.</li>
      <li>My only issue with it is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy for daytime for me, though might be great for someone with very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Only to lose so much more of my time driving to the post office, calling Amazon numerous times to figure out what the actual plan for return was, and searching out and standing in line at the UPS store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When, really, I lost more than that amount in the hour and a half I spent driving in aimless circles to/from postal carriers.</li>
      <li>I have oily, sensitive, pissy skin that will break out if I don&#x27;t get all the cleanser (I use Eminence everything) off.</li>
      <li>However, they gave me the option to return the old one via the post office or UPS.</li>
      <li>The product makes her skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
      <li>It soaks in and leaves your skin with a soft dewy look and feel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of natural moisturizers, serums, oils, etc</li>
      <li>makes my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>if you&#x27;ve got dry skin or wrinkles, you&#x27;re not going to be a pretty sight.  </li>
      <li>Although, generally, I like Eminence products</li>
      <li>Apparently, on the jar, the directions do say to mix with water.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Sweet\\&quot; red rose whip is pink; not to be confused with the orange</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, that used to be dry and red.</li>

<li> \\&quot;Sweet\\&quot; red rose whip is pink; not to be confused with the orange</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin, that used to be dry and red.</li>
<li> not only will this, or any other face cream, blend on easily, but you&#x27;ll be able to spread it thinly, so use less of this pretty expensive stuff.</li>
<li> I live down the street from a spa that sells this product.</li>
<li> (not to be confused w/the pink \\&quot;Sweet\\&quot; red rose whip), maybe unbeknowst to the vendor, who I know is very reliable, the sample was a fake.  </li>
<li> I LOVE to use it on my hands (you dilute a TINY DAB OF THIS with cold water on your wet hands and then pat on the face and neck.  </li>
<li> I still have half the jar left</li>
<li> so a little goes a long way and consequently it lasts for at least 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin smooth and tight and is a little matte.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> so I only need to use a little</li>
<li> I did try the Eminence Firm Skin Acai moisturizer, and something in it made me break out (not pimples, but red bumps).  </li>
<li> Again, not much difference in wrinkles or firming my skin.  </li>
<li> I have slightly oily skin, but really dry in the winter and</li>
<li> Over the year&#x27;s, I&amp;#34;ve learned that many &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scented things are not really rose at all  - very fake, off, synthetic smelling.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick so a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I ordered a new cream, of which I received a used, or at least previously opened one,  w/ a broken seal, and what appeared to be a coffee/beverage ring on the package insert (of which was also wrinkled).&lt;br</li>
<li> I can use so little of it after a year</li>
<li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because of my age (55+), but I see little, if any, improvement in my skin.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
<li> Only, to get there and find out that they sent me the wrong label, which is in fact UPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have normal skin that sometimes breaks out if I&#x27;m stressed, hormones or my diet has been bad.</li>
<li> THAT&#x27;s crazy because the samples are tiny.  </li>
<li> It is really thick</li>
<li> Pointless, unnecessary stress.</li>
<li> You can also thin it out with a drop or 2 of water, which is what I do in the summer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m serious!</li>
<li> and I use it at least once a day!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a very light scent.  Makes your face feel like a baby&#x27;s skin.  I will definitely buy it again and again.  Totally impressed!</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year now and I just love how creamy it fills when you put it on and then it gets absorbed by the skin entirely leaving you feeling light and velvety.  Just awesome.</li>
    <li> Whipped dream - my skin glows and at 52, I can feel &amp;#34;good in my own skin.&amp;#34; I even go out without makeup! (Never felt like that before.  I want every product Emminence makes!  I&#x27;m serious!</li>
    <li> Got hooked onto this moisturiser 8 years ago when I had my son and my skin had become a disaster. Went for a facial and got this as a sample. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This used as a moisturier before bed in the summer or in the day during the winters is simply wonderful. It is really thick so a little goes a long way and consequently it lasts for at least 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin smooth and tight and is a little matte.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels, smells and the results I get every single day.&lt;br /&gt;p.s I have normal skin that sometimes breaks out if I&#x27;m stressed, hormones or my diet has been bad.</li>
    <li> the soft smell of rose is not over baring, it is subtle, my face feels refreshed and protects from the dryness of my work place, absolutely perfect for my skin!</li>
    <li> this is the best face moisturizer ever,  It only takes a small amount as it goes a long way.  Smells very good and makes your face feel wonderful</li>
    <li> My skin did  not  like  this</li>
    <li> While this is an awesome brand, and the product itself is great, I will NEVER order through Amazon again, and certainly NEVER recommend any product through Amazon. I ordered a new cream, of which I received a used, or at least previously opened one,  w/ a broken seal, and what appeared to be a coffee/beverage ring on the package insert (of which was also wrinkled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Amazon graciously sent me a new cream w/in two days. However, they gave me the option to return the old one via the post office or UPS. While I live close to the post office, I chose that route for return. Only, to get there and find out that they sent me the wrong label, which is in fact UPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is this: no communication. no correction. I live down the street from a spa that sells this product. I didn&#x27;t drive to the spa b/c I figured I&#x27;d save time with it coming to my door instead. Only to lose so much more of my time driving to the post office, calling Amazon numerous times to figure out what the actual plan for return was, and searching out and standing in line at the UPS store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Eminence is wonderful, Amazon is not. Eighty dollars for Prime, for the advantage of free shipping. When, really, I lost more than that amount in the hour and a half I spent driving in aimless circles to/from postal carriers. I would have much rather spent it at work, doing something I enjoy, than what I just had to go through. Pointless, unnecessary stress.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I have oily, sensitive, pissy skin that will break out if I don&#x27;t get all the cleanser (I use Eminence everything) off. I tried this at the suggestion of my esthetician at my birthday facial last year and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! I use it at night (it leaves me too oily by the end of the day but sometimes if I&#x27;m not going anywhere I use it during the day. I digress). and wake up to a beautiful, evenly toned and just moisturized skin!! I LOVE to use it on my hands (you dilute a TINY DAB OF THIS with cold water on your wet hands and then pat on the face and neck.  Then I rub it into my hands and then go back and pat the face some more.  I think too many people are using Eminence full strength and irritated at the price or how fast it goes or too greasy etc.  Experiment.  I can use so little of it after a year I still have half the jar left and I use it at least once a day!!</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers out there. Lovely rose smell, very rich.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. My daughter was thrilled to receive it. The product makes her skin soft &amp; supple. She gets a lot of compliments when she wears it. She reports people tell her that she looks beautiful every time that she wears the product. Shipping was prompt &amp; arrived in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> works great with my sensitive skin. smells lovely.  makes my skin soft.  with proper use i can make this last 6 months.  what more could i ask for?</li>
    <li> I have slightly oily skin, but really dry in the winter and Sweet Rose always does the trick leaving my skin soft and smooth but not oily (unless I use too much). It also helps with any red blotches. This is a thicker moisturizer so I only need to use a little and it last me 5-6 months, which makes it worth the money. You can also thin it out with a drop or 2 of water, which is what I do in the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used Eminence before - introduced by an aesthetician - so knew it was a great brand. I&#x27;d been using the coconut one as my nightime moisturizer. When I went to re-order, I noticed the Rose. Always a sucker for rose scented products, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Over the year&#x27;s, I&amp;#34;ve learned that many &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scented things are not really rose at all  - very fake, off, synthetic smelling. This one&#x27;s the real deal, so makes me happy every time I use it (using now for daytime moisturizer). My only issue with it is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy for daytime for me, though might be great for someone with very dry skin. It&#x27;s a bit thick,and doesn&#x27;t smooth out as easily as a lighter weight product. But if you mist your face first - I use rose water! - not only will this, or any other face cream, blend on easily, but you&#x27;ll be able to spread it thinly, so use less of this pretty expensive stuff. That way one jar will last the better part of a year!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s made with rose petals, rose extract and rose oil which give it the most delicious rose fragrance. You will feel like a princess every time you use it. It&#x27;s thick so a little goes a long way but it does not leave your skin feeling greasy at all. It soaks in and leaves your skin with a soft dewy look and feel. I&#x27;ve been using Eminence moisturizers and the bamboo fluid for about a year now and I truly love the way my skin looks. I sometimes glance at the mirror as I&#x27;m walking by and think &amp;#34;Wow, my skin looks lovely&amp;#34;. It has definitely made my skin firmer, more plump, and it has a dewy youthful look. I&#x27;ve tried alot of natural moisturizers, serums, oils, etc but these products are the first that have made a noticeable change in the way my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I love the eminence sweet red rose product line! It costs more than what I would typically spend, but it works for my skin! I have sensitive skin, that used to be dry and red. I don&#x27;t have that problem any more. I use the sweet red rose facial cleanser, stone crop hydrating mist and this moisturizer daily. My skin looks healthy and I smell pretty!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Sweet\\&quot; red rose whip is pink; not to be confused with the orange \\&quot;RoseHIP whip\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The sample was awful.&lt;br /&gt;An Amazon vendor messed up one of my orders and sent me a ton of Eminence samples.  Although, generally, I like Eminence products, this one s^cks bigtime.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this on my face three times and this product does NOT seem to moisturize.  It dries matte, so if you&#x27;ve got dry skin or wrinkles, you&#x27;re not going to be a pretty sight.  However, this was a sample.  Apparently, on the jar, the directions do say to mix with water.  Perhaps that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; comes in.  Frankly, why would I even want a moisturizer I have to mix with water?  More trouble than it&#x27;s worth, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews of the regular rose whip moisturizer (orange), (not to be confused w/the pink \\&quot;Sweet\\&quot; red rose whip), maybe unbeknowst to the vendor, who I know is very reliable, the sample was a fake.  THAT&#x27;s crazy because the samples are tiny.  Why bother.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff dries matte on your face like cheap drugstore brand body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything for me. Waste of money, just nice scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my adult daughter who says it is wonderful for her  skin which is prone to allergic outbreaks of hives</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for about a month.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because of my age (55+), but I see little, if any, improvement in my skin.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this again - too pricey for the results.</li>
    <li> I do like this cream, as it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  However, it hasn&#x27;t helped much with hydrating my face and wrinkles.  I did try the Eminence Firm Skin Acai moisturizer, and something in it made me break out (not pimples, but red bumps).  I do use the Acai on my lower neck and chest, and it&#x27;s okay for me in that area.  Again, not much difference in wrinkles or firming my skin.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money they charge for this product and am looking for an alternative.</li>
    <li> this moisturizer is so nice, it works well on my dry sensitive skin.  And it smells lovely</li>
