      <li>This powder is more of a finishing powder or something you&#x27;d use to get rid of oily spots during the day.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s just ok,  color isn&#x27;t closer to what it says.  </li>
      <li>I love this makeup.  </li>

      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>not buying it any more.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I purchase most of my face product from Physicians Formula.</li>
      <li>but this one is magical.</li>
      <li>It is lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
      <li>I also love the mini Kabuki that came along with it</li>
      <li>so I like more coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this powder -</li>
      <li>I love the brush~</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay $9.99 for more of this powder when I run out.</li>
      <li>The brush is goofy and the powder smell,  I don&#x27;t care for</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>and it smooths out my skin tones and feels pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cruelty free, great quality and very affordable for all budgets.</li>
      <li>then sometimes it makes the fine lines more defined.  </li>
      <li>It us for very fair skin with pinkish tones, if you have warm/yellow tones, it is definitely not for you.</li>
      <li>She was happy with it as far as we know.</li>
      <li>I love the light weight feel of this product...</li>
      <li>Lighter color than I expected, but it will be perfect for the winter time as my complexion lightens up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use powder very often but PF Organic is quite a good one.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m not one that&#x27;s easily sensitized to products.</li>
      <li>Easily hides pores and redness.</li>
      <li>I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>When I tapped the powder on the lid to swirl my brush on, I noticed the color seemed a bit dark, but then I applied it on my face and it was the perfect shade for me.</li>
      <li>Rather drying, but works fine.</li>
      <li>but this is half the price and works great as well!</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this powder, perfect color easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
      <li>, I love how healthy it makes my skin look, and I love that it is natural!</li>
      <li>I use only this powder and a bit of eye makeup and it works great.</li>
      <li>Bummer must be a cheap brush.</li>
      <li>and I ended up with a shade too light for me.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any odor and it feels light on my face.</li>
      <li>I found it light, not too drying, not orangey either, like some powders can be, after wearing for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Light as air.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it falls over 5 minutes after applying it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to any animal friendly makeup lover.</li>
      <li>First of all, the powder itself is ok....</li>
      <li>I have been using the original mineral powder from PF for years.</li>
      <li>The brush is perfect for applying the loose powder and even gently exfoliating the skin during application.</li>
      <li>When i first got this powder, i was very excited.</li>
      <li>But.. I love this way more than bare minerals!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice loose powder.</li>
      <li>Look, it works as a good powder, I like the coverage that it gives me, but the smell of the powder on my face is simply revolting.</li>
      <li>Not only do I look good</li>
      <li>I like the clean fresh feel of the lose powder.</li>
      <li>I saw this product at my local grocery outlet and saw the amazing price on it from it&#x27;s original price</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell, it last all day long, it covers imperfections, and its a great prize!</li>
      <li>I have dry skin so powders don&#x27;t always look good on me</li>
      <li>I use it in tropical climates and it last for more than 8 hours!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very thick powder, and has a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It covers perfectly and so easy to use with the brush.</li>
    <li> I use this with Physicians Formula Organic Wear 100% Natural Tinted Moisturizer (for my Oily, Dry Flakey &amp; Acne Prone skin) and have no complaints. I also have Bare Escentuals that I use off and on with the Tinted Moisturizer but this is half the price and works great as well! For that shimmery look I just apply Bare Escentuals Feather Light Mineral Veil over either.</li>
    <li> Will never go to another loose powder. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, however I think I like it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised! I am paying about 1/4 of what I used to pay and I am 4 times happier..  Great find!!</li>
    <li> I liked it very much.</li>
    <li> it was ok, better products out there, somewhat disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always wore quite a bit of makeup. This powder will take away shine but has no coverage. I have freckles so I like more coverage.</li>
    <li> First of all, the powder itself is ok....no smell. It looks darker in the container, but when my wife put it on, it made her look ghost white, so it&#x27;s not something she can use all over her face, just around her eyes. There was only 1 color available when she ordered it. The powder brush is tiny and quite stiff, and sometimes the container is hard to get opened.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using liquid foundation, and I currently only use a tinted moisturizer plus this on my face. With just the tinted moisturizer, my face gets shinier, and with my sensitive, combination skin it&#x27;s hard to find products that take away the shine without drying me out. When I add this powder over my shiny forehead and cheeks, they are mattified pretty well all day, and I also notice that my pores on my cheeks are minimized. It&#x27;s really the perfect finishing touch. I have previously used various combinations of pressed foundation powders, oil mattifiers, face primer, and liquid foundations, and none of them stood up to this with giving me a natural, almost shine-free look.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested physicians formula, and when I saw they had organic I went with it. I have been using bare minerals for years until I finally ran out and decided it&#x27;s crazy expensive. So when I got this I was expecting something with a lower quality. But.. I love this way more than bare minerals! It actually covers, and stays on all day long until I wash it off. I have extremely sensitive skin and when I DON&#x27;T put this on for a day my skin will start to get irritated again. Because it covers so well I use a small amount, and the container has WAY more powder than bare minerals did, so I foresee this lasting me a looong time.</li>
    <li> Love the consistency and being able to adjust the level of coverage,  Thanks for this great organic procduct!</li>
    <li> Very good quality powder. I purchase most of my face product from Physicians Formula. I love their Organic wear line. Color is perfect for my face tone and very good coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this product first because it is organic and second it really stays on and does not fill in the lines on your skin and also I feel like I am doing good for my skin with out dangerous chemicals in the product</li>
    <li> &#x27;organic&#x27; is just a sell point.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and I think it&#x27;s the worst one of the powders which I used.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the original mineral powder from PF for years. Saw this and decided I would check it out. Worst decision ever. After years of clean skin finally being an adult I started experiencing painful disgusting cystic acne. I had purchased a bunch of other makeup with it so assumed the liquid makeup was the culprit. Still was experiencing giant painful zits, they were like nothing I had ever had even when I was 13. Finally realized it was this and threw it in the garbage. Skin has been clear ever since.  Switched back to the original and been fine.</li>
    <li> Rather drying, but works fine. The brush is quite hard, though. I usually use my softer, better brush, but I like the compactness of this product otherwise.</li>
    <li> Fits me perfectly, I barely wore any make up because other products clogged my pores. This doesn&#x27;t. Will be buying again😊</li>
    <li> I saw this product at my local grocery outlet and saw the amazing price on it from it&#x27;s original price and I had to try it out.When I tapped the powder on the lid to swirl my brush on, I noticed the color seemed a bit dark, but then I applied it on my face and it was the perfect shade for me.It may have just been dark because of the lighting.I love the coverage.There is no smell to it.It isn&#x27;t shimmery.It&#x27;s perfect if you have porcelain/pale skin.I love this product. 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actively look for natural beauty products, but I&#x27;m not above using one, so when I saw this one and the price was good, I thought I&#x27;d try it out. It&#x27;s a very nice loose powder. It is very finely milled, so I feel like it covers very nicely. It also holds up well in 100+ degree weather.</li>
    <li> Light as air. Cant even tell im wearing it. I bought 1 for my friend and she loves it also. It is lovely. You can enjoy this product so much. We both have sensitive skin so we expect a lot, and it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the powder, but wish the brush bristles weren&#x27;t so course, things that you put on your face should be soft not feel like you are using a toothbrush to apply powder!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use powder very often but PF Organic is quite a good one. I found it light, not too drying, not orangey either, like some powders can be, after wearing for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container this powder comes in, is bad though. Not easy to get just a small amount of powder out, without making a mess and the brush is awful. Rough bristles that I wouldn&#x27;t use for anything, certainly not on my face. I&#x27;m wondering about the drastic reduction here in price, perhaps the company is rethinking the packaging and brush? They both need an overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been transitioning away from using any face powder in recent months,  as there are concerns about it&#x27;s effects on health, from long term inhalation. Something to consider and read about, before buying/using any of these types of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> The brush loses a lot of bristles every time I use it. The powder feels sticky and thick on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Bare Escentuals girl, but I&#x27;m always looking for a bargain.  This was a decent product. Coverage is average, but not terrific. This product has a matte finish; I prefer a little shimmer.  I have rosacea, so I always fight the red on my cheeks.  I don&#x27;t mind using this product for work, but for really good coverage and terrific light reflection, I&#x27;ll stick to my Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> Great powder and very light on the skin. Keeps the shine away. The only thing I am not crazy about is the brush. But I use my professional kabuki one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale all things considered and I&#x27;m always struggling to find a color that I think blends well but this blends flawlessly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or anything. It evens out my complexion and is great for those days when I just want to put a powder on my face and rush to class.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product it reminded me of flour. The texture was not smooth and it didn&#x27;t go on evenly. I don&#x27;t know if this product was tampered with some how but def not what I would expect from Physicians Formula!</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I have dry skin so powders don&#x27;t always look good on me but this one is magical. It has better coverage than any other &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; powder I have used and doesn&#x27;t cake up whatsoever. Easily hides pores and redness. This shade isn&#x27;t too orange or yellow, it is a true beige, and I feel it could fit a wide variety of light skintones. Brush it comes with isn&#x27;t any good but usually they aren&#x27;t haha.</li>
    <li> This might be a quality product but I DO wish they had included ingredients. I do NOT need or want Olive Oil on my face. Really? What&#x27;s with that?</li>
    <li> I love this makeup.  I am having trouble finding it locally anymore and wonder if it&#x27;s being discontinued.  Sad to see it go if so.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. I have combination skin and few blemishes. Evens out my skin tone very well, covers my imperfections, but doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and how it makes my skin feel. Not only do I look good but you can clearly tell it&#x27;s helping clear up my face!</li>
    <li> For starters, the texture is really really sticky, you can see that it clumps together very easily and doesn&#x27;t look natural at all. It&#x27;s really hard to work with and the brush doesn&#x27;t help much either. I didn&#x27;t  use it enough to see if it would break my skin out and I didn&#x27;t want to because it felt Luke a paste on top of my skin. I regret even thinking of buying this product. It us for very fair skin with pinkish tones, if you have warm/yellow tones, it is definitely not for you.</li>
    <li> I really like the powder.  It really is hypoallergenic and covers well enough I don&#x27;t have to wear make-up with a nice matte finish.  In addition, I have oily skin and it keeps me oil-free almost all day.  However, found it applied a lot better with my big Kabuki brush--the little brush included doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up or distribute it very well.  In addition, the packaging is very awkward and messy--you have to keep pulling up a little tab and replacing the brush in the lid all the time: it seems convenient, but its not.  Bottom line: great powder, packaging could use some work--I personally like the way Avon and Clinique package their mineral loose powders.</li>
    <li> I love the light weight feel of this product...it goes on after my base makeup, and doesn&#x27;t have a chalky or heavy feel to it.  Love the sheerness and silkiness too.</li>
    <li> This makeup is just what I was looking for. Lighter color than I expected, but it will be perfect for the winter time as my complexion lightens up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy that it&#x27;s organic, even if it does smell a little funky.</li>
    <li> Shipment came a day early. The packaging was a little damaged and just a little bit of powder had spilled but overall I like it. I have a light complexion and use the natural beige powder over my liquid foundation. It gives my makeup more of a natural look!</li>
    <li> im happy , good product thank you !</li>
    <li> terrible. don&#x27;t like it at all. :( powder doesn&#x27;t stay on skin and looks very artificial. not buying it any more.</li>
    <li> Nice powder and container, and a comfort to think it isn&#x27;t GMO based...</li>
    <li> Great product I assumed the beige color I got would have been little darker. I like the clean fresh feel of the lose powder. Only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is the brush bristles fall off al over my face and shirt! Bummer must be a cheap brush. I&#x27;ve only used the brush twice.</li>
    <li> This item has soy in it so I sent it back. I was using soy daily under the impression that soy was a healthy product. I was using organic soy.&lt;br /&gt;I developed hypothyroidism. I then discovered that soy has goitrogens  in it. This is a chemical that disrupts the way the thyroid metabolizes&lt;br /&gt;iodine. This information was obtained through reading science magazines. When I received this powder I did not know it contained soy. I was not willing to take another risk so although it cost me half the amount of what I paid for this item in postage to return this item. I returned this item.</li>
    <li> I tried to go darker, but This washed me out! It felt like paste on my Skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Although the brush is rather small (not fluffy), I really like the quality of the powder. having a small mirror on the plastic container was a nice  touch especially for travel.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I am having difficulty getting the powder out.  The directions was covered by a sticker.  I have yet to use it.  I tried to tap and shake but the will not come out.  I need advise.  Otherwise, I might just return it.</li>
    <li> This product is really good, since its organic it doesn&#x27;t contain any strong ingredients that might harm your skin or will irritate your skin. Although the brush is not that really good to use because its too hard, so i used my other powder brush and it works. But apparently i bought a wrong shade for my skin tone, this Beige color is a lil bit whiter for my skin complexion. This is a perfect powder for me i must say.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder!! it doesn&#x27;t smell, it last all day long, it covers imperfections, and its a great prize! I use it in tropical climates and it last for more than 8 hours!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Large size container that will last you a LONG time&lt;br /&gt;-Cruelty-free&lt;br /&gt;-Provides good coverage without looking cakey&lt;br /&gt;-Great loose powder for dryer skin types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Lighter shade than expected&lt;br /&gt;-Contains many different kinds of oil, so if you have acne prone skin, beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no foul smell as some of the other reviewers have stated. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it broke me out and I realized it was all the oils found in the ingredients. Once I stopped using this, my skin calmed down.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this powder, perfect color easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
    <li> My daughter took it with her.  I assume that means she loves it.</li>
    <li> My first time using Loose powder, the reason i gave it a 4 star is that the brush that comes with it is a little too stiff for application. But overall, the product itself is very light weight on skin and last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup because it makes my face feel gross like its covered in a layer of muck. So I decided to try this organic powder to see how it felt and it is AMAZING! I can put it on and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch or feel covered in muck. It feels like my skin can breathe and because it&#x27;s all organic there is no chemicals my skin can react to. It does have a little bit of a funky earthy smell, but I don&#x27;t mind and it disappears shortly after applying. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it. ^,.,^ I Will continue to purchase this product in the future, possibly even for life.</li>
    <li> Powder is very ragged. Not for Asian skin.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our niece. She was happy with it as far as we know.</li>
    <li> I love this powder - it&#x27;s light and goes great with my skin tone. The only suggestion is that Physicians Formula should either remove the applicator or get a better quality one. The bristles are really hard/harsh on my skin and I hate the feeling of when I put on the powder. I personally use my own kabuki brush because I hate using the one that the company provides. Otherwise I would give this product 5 stars for quality.</li>
    <li> This has really poor coverage. Pretty sure it falls over 5 minutes after applying it. It was a nice thought but was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you like looking your best while using natural products, this is the way to go.  After researching and seeing all the  toxins that were added to regular cosmetics, I had to make a change.  I researched and found Physician&#x27;s formula products.  They work great and I am sold!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and good cover.</li>
    <li> Covers well and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel.</li>
    <li> I love the brush~ And it is natural and organic. And it suits perfect for my oily nose and I like the tone of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible! Even at $6.49 it would be well worth the price, but I found it at Grocery Outlet yesterday for $2.99 and thought, \\&quot;Why not give it a try?\\&quot; I used to buy mineral foundation online, but that got expensive. When I stopped doing that, I used Rimmel liquid foundation, but got tired of that because it didn&#x27;t match my fair skin well enough, sunk into my smile lines and made me look old (I&#x27;m 20), and was impossible to touch up once I put powder on top of it. I was skeptical that Physicians Formula Organic Wear would offer enough coverage (I have acne and scars), but I just put it on for the first time over some concealer, and my skin looks flawless and glowing! Plus, it matches my skin tone--close enough, anyway. I like the smell, I love how healthy it makes my skin look, and I love that it is natural! Best value I&#x27;ve ever found for a foundation--highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got terrible acne from this!!! I wrote to the company to see if they&#x27;d  consider replacing it with something  different, but got no response. If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying this product at all!!</li>
    <li> Too white, doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
    <li> I really like this powder. It covers nicely and is as good as promoted. I use only this powder and a bit of eye makeup and it works great. I also received the product on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Terrific product for very little money and recommended by the cosmetics cop on Beautypedia.  I have combination skin. oily and dry and this stuff dusts right on and doesn&#x27;t seep into wrinkles.  Of course my ultimate beauty weapon is the final fine spray mist (Evian Brumisateur) I always finish off with completely sets your make-up and stays fresh for hours and this PF natural loose powder only contributes to the completely beautiful natural look I have!</li>
    <li> I like the powder but the brush is weird. It smells like a petting zoo.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s cruelty free, great quality and very affordable for all budgets. I recommend this to any animal friendly makeup lover.</li>
    <li> The color fits me perfectly! The only thing i dont like is the brush included, which may be to stiff and itchy, as well as the weird smell it has!</li>
    <li> After a couple uses, I noticed after being in the sun with this powder on my face, I would feel a burning sensation on my face! And I&#x27;m not one that&#x27;s easily sensitized to products. What pulled me into buying this was my search for &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; foundation. Then the organic part sold me. Not sure how I could be allergic to this?? The brush by the way, is useless! Very hard bristles and they fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> I think that Physicians Formula is a reliable brand so I went ahead and got this product without doing much research on it. Well that was a mistake. Look, it works as a good powder, I like the coverage that it gives me, but the smell of the powder on my face is simply revolting. Kind of like rotten eggs. So if you think your face should smell like eggs when you go out, get this product!</li>
    <li> I like the powder and it does brighten the skin.  However, it settled into lines so would not be suitable for those aged 40&#x27;s and over.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but the ones I do have popped out with the powder, especially under the eyes.</li>
    <li> the good, is its organic and feels great&lt;br /&gt;the bad is that it smells:( but when I add my other make up you cant smell it</li>
    <li> When i first got this powder, i was very excited. I opened it up and it looked kind of orange, but on my face it matched my skin tone. I went out shopping and realized that my face looked extremely dirty and powdery. I gave this product another try, but was still very disappointed. I would not recommend this product, although it did match my skin tone pretty well.</li>
    <li> I really like this powder but the Organic Wear Beige is too light for me and it is difficult to find the range of shades. I need a shade that is a little darker and can&#x27;t find for the life of me anywhere the range of shades from light to dark! Could someone please help me out? Is buff beige darker or lighter?</li>
    <li> First off let me say I actually bought this powder at Dollar Tree for $1. Occasionally Dollar Tree sells name brand products so anytime I see Physician&#x27;s Formula, Elf or Milani I grab it. I have to say, I absolutely love this powder! The brush is perfect for applying the loose powder and even gently exfoliating the skin during application. The key to applying loose powder is circular motions. Unlike Bare Minerals, this powder is TALC-FREE, CHEAPER, and YOU GET MORE PRODUCT FOR YOUR MONEY. Even though I only paid $1 for mine. I&#x27;d gladly pay $9.99 for more of this powder when I run out. This powder goes on smoothly and evenly and gives a very natural matte finish to my face at least.</li>
    <li> I bought the bronzer from this same company on Amazon and I&#x27;m not a fan of the packaging of this product either.  That&#x27;s why I gave it only 4 stars.  I am a fan of the compacts so using this is irritating.  The brush sucks, I use my bare minerals buki brushes instead.  This powder is more of a finishing powder or something you&#x27;d use to get rid of oily spots during the day.  I have been trying to slowly get away from using makeup in general, so this is awesome if you want a really light powder for everyday use too.  If you have really dry skin like me then sometimes it makes the fine lines more defined.  I just have to use more moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The overall quality of the product is good but the bristles of the brush really irritate my skin. I had to buy a separate brush to apply this product, other than that I like it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok,  color isn&#x27;t closer to what it says.  The brush is goofy and the powder smell,  I don&#x27;t care for</li>
    <li> covers up nicely didn&#x27;t break me out</li>
    <li> I really love how it lasts all day long and leaves my face look perfectly natural. It&#x27;s perfect for a no-make-up makeup look. I also love the mini Kabuki that came along with it but I sometimes prefer to use a powder puff itself. I like using the brush for my blush on. It&#x27;s soft and dense.</li>
    <li> I like this powder.  It doesn&#x27;t have any odor and it feels light on my face. It&#x27;s inexpensive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I had to guess which shade would work for my skin tone and I ended up with a shade too light for me.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with foundation but this brand  might run light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it anyway and it smooths out my skin tones and feels pretty good.</li>
