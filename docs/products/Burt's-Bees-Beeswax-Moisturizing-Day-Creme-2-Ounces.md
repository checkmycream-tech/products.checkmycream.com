      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand of product, very good, especially before use, it is easy to makeup, and don&#x27;t dry at all</li>
      <li>It has the perfect texture, thickness, level of moisture/oil, it absorbs beautifully without leaving a greasy look like a lot of other natural creams, it is thick but doesn&#x27;t leave a mask on the skin.</li>

      <li>These products are very good and will last you a long time!</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, but this is absorbed quickly by my skin and the cream has such a wonderful but subtle rose scent.</li>
      <li>She said it&#x27;s useful and really have effect.</li>

      <li>If you have sensitive skin and your skin isn&#x27;t where you want it to be at use this item!</li>

      <li>My skin is quite sensitive</li>
      <li>My only complaint is the rose smell.</li>
      <li>and this is thick and smells fantastic!  </li>
      <li>The smell almost put me off using it, but given how it totally eliminated the dry skin on my face overnight, is gentle (no ruddy red cheeks after applying) and quickly absorbs into my skin, I have to overlook the scent, which my husband actually likes -</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that much of my acne-proneness is due to dry skin, so this has pretty much fixed that for me.</li>

<li> Have been using it for years, and will continue to do so for as long as they keep making it.</li>

<li> This little jar also goes a long way.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s in a glass pot, so be careful not to drop it, as I did with my previous one.</li>
<li> It lasts all day, does not make you break out, and smells just slightly like honey.  </li>
<li> The skin on my face has always gotten very dry and sometimes even flaky during the colder months because eczema causes my skin to be drier than usual.</li>
<li> but a little dab will spread all over and absorb well.  </li>
<li> A little goes along way with this cream</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
<li> However my skin tends to be a bit oily during the summer months so it might be a little too heavy for the warmer months..</li>
<li> It keeps my skin from getting chapped and dried out.</li>
<li> One jar the lid was unscrewed and the product was a bit dried out.</li>
<li> and this is one of the few products I can use.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years</li>
<li> I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this moisturizer is yucky.</li>
<li> It is very heavy and does not absorb well.</li>
<li> (If you&#x27;ve got long hair, you will find stray hairs sticking to your face all day long -- really annoying.)</li>
<li> So sad that it is not available in Germany.</li>
<li> Keeps my face moisturized, even in the driest of times and is non irritating.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this caused my skin to breakout.  </li>
<li> and I never get tired of it!  </li>
<li> Rather disappointing.</li>
<li> The smell is cloying and so bad that my boyfriend complains when I wear it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s runny, smells bad and does nothing for my skin...</li>
<li> This is truly disgusting...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it on my face every morning. it takes about a year off my face. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for already oily skin. I found that throughout the day, my nose would be shining like Rudolph&#x27;s minus the red glow. But for the most part my skin&#x27;s dry, so I just eased up on the amount I&#x27;d put on my nose, so it was all good on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that much of my acne-proneness is due to dry skin, so this has pretty much fixed that for me. I was a tad bit suspicious of the small, not even full palm sized jar, but I&#x27;ve come to realize with Burt&#x27;s Bees, less is so much more. You do have to work out just how much you need (which has never been more than 2 fingertips full, neck and face,) but after you do you may cavalier about the town with moisturized, healthy looking, (though sometimes somewhat oil) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it as a mush lighter version of the Night Creme.</li>
    <li> Thank you Burt&#x27;s bees for moisturizing my face. A little goes along way with this cream and it&#x27;s safe for sensitive skin. My only complaint is the rose smell.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin and your skin isn&#x27;t where you want it to be at use this item! It worked for my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I agree, this is a great product and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a light cream to the touch but to me it feels a little heavy on my skin. So I just use it at night a few times a week and by day have soft skin without the sticky feeling. I also use the jelly eye cream and have the same regimen with that. These products are very good and will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It says it&#x27;s day cream, but it versatile, and actually makes a good lotion for anytime.   I have very very sensitive skin and this is one of the few products I can use. It&#x27;s not greasy, and smells like roses.This little jar also goes a long way. It&#x27;s in a glass pot, so be careful not to drop it, as I did with my previous one. It absorbs quickly and can be worn under makeup as well. I also like it, since your face is not left shiny or broken-out. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Very creamy.</li>
    <li> It is for my wife, good quality</li>
    <li> I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this moisturizer is yucky. It is very heavy and does not absorb well. (If you&#x27;ve got long hair, you will find stray hairs sticking to your face all day long -- really annoying.) Using it regularly for a few days caused my skin to break out, which is unusual for me. The smell is cloying and so bad that my boyfriend complains when I wear it. It is very moisturizing, so I&#x27;ve found a use for it as a hand cream (but still, the smell ...).</li>
    <li> Great! Just like all of the products from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Great moisturizer but leaves a bit of a residue on your skin.  This is find in the winter and I like the way it makes my skin feel.  However my skin tends to be a bit oily during the summer months so it might be a little too heavy for the warmer months..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many natural and eco-friendly face creams from the cheaper ones to the more expensive brands, and this one is still the best. It has the perfect texture, thickness, level of moisture/oil, it absorbs beautifully without leaving a greasy look like a lot of other natural creams, it is thick but doesn&#x27;t leave a mask on the skin. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they stopped producing it. I really don&#x27;t know which other cream would compare with the greatness of this one.</li>
    <li> This product is just awesome. Best day creme ever for me an d my wife. So sad that it is not available in Germany.</li>
    <li> it makes  me anaphylactic</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 jars.  One jar the lid was unscrewed and the product was a bit dried out. The lotion had actually pulled away from the side of the container. Rather disappointing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff - it&#x27;s a very rich, thick white cream and it sorted out the dry patches on my &#x27;winter weather cheeks&#x27; overnight. One think I do not like, however, is the smell. The scent is sort of musty, old and reminiscent of old ladies perfumes. The smell almost put me off using it, but given how it totally eliminated the dry skin on my face overnight, is gentle (no ruddy red cheeks after applying) and quickly absorbs into my skin, I have to overlook the scent, which my husband actually likes - so maybe that&#x27;s just me!</li>
    <li> Nice but use sparingly</li>
    <li> Keeps my face moisturized, even in the driest of times and is non irritating. My face is very picky when it comes to creams. It is hard to find the right one.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, but this is absorbed quickly by my skin and the cream has such a wonderful but subtle rose scent.</li>
    <li> This is very light and moisturizing and not greasy feeling. My skin feels soft and smooth all day long. Great!</li>
    <li> This is truly disgusting... It&#x27;s runny, smells bad and does nothing for my skin...I had to buy something cheaper to fill in whilst waiting being paid, I should have bought something from L&#x27;Oreal or Ulay....would have been cheaper too...can&#x27;t wait to get my Clarins back...this stuff is going in the bin.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin soft and hydrated, but it has an strange scent.</li>
    <li> Why do products have to be so over-scented?  The cream is ok, it&#x27;s a little heavy but a little dab will spread all over and absorb well.  I would buy it again but for the scent - way too strong and makes me want to sneeze.</li>
    <li> My skin is quite sensitive so I cannot use &#x27;just any product&#x27; on my skin. HOwever what I found with this product is that long after I applied it, it left a waxy feeling on the surface of my skin. I couldn&#x27;t help feeling that it was coating my skin not nourishing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and I never get tired of it!  I have very dry skin and this is thick and smells fantastic!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of product, very good, especially before use, it is easy to makeup, and don&#x27;t dry at all</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees make the best. Perfect feel, last a long time and a great value. We have tried so many different kinds and this is our family favorite. Buy it and your will like it.:)</li>
    <li> This moisturizing creme by Burt&#x27;s Bees is my go-to daily feel good creme. It is also gluten-free. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face and look forward to the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> The skin on my face has always gotten very dry and sometimes even flaky during the colder months because eczema causes my skin to be drier than usual. So I bought this stuff to keep my face moisturized during the day. I apply it every morning and it keeps my face nice throughout the entire day. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for winter.  I live in Massachusetts and switch to this product mid November, and use it through March.  The small tub gets me through daily use during the winter with left overs.  It keeps my skin from getting chapped and dried out.</li>
    <li> wonderful item.  I like it.  I am happy with the sender.  good business</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It lasts all day, does not make you break out, and smells just slightly like honey.  Have been using it for years, and will continue to do so for as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this caused my skin to breakout.  I love the smell, and it is a great cold weather moisturizer.  I use it for my hands and feet now.</li>
    <li> love this stuff...its nice to have a product without all the chemicals and junk in it.  leaves my skin feeling great</li>
    <li> I like him very much, moistening and beeswax, suitable for my skin</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a gift for my friend. She love this day creme very much. She said it&#x27;s useful and really have effect.</li>
