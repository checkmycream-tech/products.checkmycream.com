<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing smell to it, lasts a long time &amp; they&#x27;ve made a customer of me. I bought the same product at Macy&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s not the same. The smell doesn&#x27;t last as this one does.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow!  I&#x27;m so pleased I blind bought this because i wasn&#x27;t let down at all!  this is just as good as the first, although I love the other one alittle bit more!  The first spritz is just  omg delicious fresh sugar sweet berries, and it transforms into warm, vanilla, sugary woodsy berries and just smells gorgeous!!  I love that there is a freshness to this scent which keeps it from smelling syrupy.  It&#x27;s just an overall well done perfume and the bottle is lovely to match it.  Love the red and iridescent rainbow effect and the charms.  Lasting power is average about 4/6 hours and sillage is light to moderate.  I would highly recommend especially for anyone looking for a gift.  I would absolutely repurchase this!  P.S. This smells EXTREMELY similar to BS fantasy the naughty remix, but imo wonderstruck enchanted smells better!  I blind bought fantasy and was dissapointed because the overly powerful cloying note of orris root which made it smell completely of baby powder.  Had to give it away :(...but so glad I bought enchanted!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s a little stronger than I thought it would be but still smells great.</li>
    <li> My current favourite perfume.. sweet and floral.</li>
    <li> I am 60, and while at a store, I picked up this pretty bottle and sprayed it on.  I loved it and kept smelling my arm the rest of the day!  LOL  I just had to have it.  It costs a lot more at the store than it does here on Amazon.  I have not bought myself any cologne or perfume for years; I am not a big perfume user.  But I could not let this one go.  It is so fresh and sweet; beautiful.  I am sure the bottle will last me a long time and I cannot wait to start wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is aewsome and the serviceis great witha great price love it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this taylor swift fragrance. It lasts all day and the price was great for the size of bottle.</li>
    <li> Great price the perfume was fresh and smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents ever. I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
    <li> very wondery smell / berry- fairy dust sweetness .. too bad it does not last long</li>
    <li> perfect and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This was a gift and requested so the recipient really liked it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this smell! One of Taylor Swift&#x27;s best!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.  It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> This perfume came as said. On time. Smells perfect. Great price!</li>
    <li> Has kind of a baby powderish scent. Its strong enough but not as good as Paris Hiltons line in my mans opinion.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love this perfume</li>
    <li> Very light won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> didnt care for much i gave it tony 19 year old daughter and she liked it</li>
    <li> Love the perfume!!! Perfect versatility, can be worn casually or at night.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this in many stores and apparently they were out of stock, so I bought two of these! This is totally worth your money you will recieve many complements when using this. I love it !</li>
    <li> My girl loves this scent and so do I.</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume. Bought this one for my daughter because I used all of hers last time. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift to my wife and she loved it !! This smells awesome and pleasant , definitely lasts long and worth the money!!</li>
    <li> It smells really nice and the scent seems to last all day!i really like it.</li>
    <li> great smell she loves it thank you,</li>
    <li> My perfume came in a cute red velvet jewelry box with a purse sized roll on perfume as well! More then I was expecting!</li>
    <li> love it! great price!</li>
    <li> I meant to order plain wonderstruck- It was my fault for ordering the wrong one. And you can&#x27;t return it because of &amp;#34;hazardous liquid&amp;#34; policy. It smells ok...just not really what I preferred. The size for the price was GREAT.</li>
    <li> You can smell it when you spray it then its COMPLETELY GONE.  FAIL. FAIL FAIL product.</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t boxed perfume be sealed in plastic? This one wasn&#x27;t and the box was scratched &amp; dented. Not ideal for gift giving! Wondering if it is an authentic product? Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> its a nice sweet smell more of a fancier smell than causal</li>
    <li> wow this smells AMAZING!! I havent tried the original wonderstruck yet but i heard that this one is a lot sweeter and fruitier. I just cant stop smelling my wrists!!! It smells yummy but not exactly in a youthful way. Women in their 20-30s can deff wear this! The thing is that its very strong!!! So you need just one spray. I just sprayed myself (once) with it an hour ago and everyone could smell it, and they were in other rooms!  The lasting power is really great too. This smells like fruity/candy but also has a sophisticated touch to it. Just remember to only spray yourself with it just once!</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume when I was visiting a friend and bought it for myself as soon as I got home. The bottle is very pretty and the perfume itself is a nice mix between floral and musk.</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume and my girlfriend loves it&lt;br /&gt; Not too strong</li>
    <li> I just love this scent - PLAIN &amp; SIMPLE</li>
    <li> Big fan of Taylor, can&#x27;t wait to open it!!! Everything&#x27;s awesome, it smells sweet but not too strong. I even can feel the passion inside!!&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing they packaged the perfume using a  big box which still with some room in it. The delivery man throw it at the front of my door, and I can hear the sound inside my house when the box drop on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, The perfume is ok.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice flowery scent, it last a bit but I wont reorder. Price is reasonable, exotic bottle.</li>
    <li> I just had to buy this perfume. I have a friend that uses it, and I absolutely fell in love with it. I just had to ask what she was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve  been wearing this now for about 3 years and I receive endless compliments, including co-workers saying they know when I am at work because they smell my scent before they see me, or classmates seeing me and asking if I just walked down a particular hallway because they  smelled me, random people stopping me in the grocery store. This is a to die for perfume. My FAVORITE absolutely. No regrets!!!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! I have gotten several compliments when wearing it! I am so happy that I found this! Wonderstruch is wonderful</li>
    <li> The bottle is BEAUTIFUL! And the sent matches. It is mature and warm, but at the best price because you get a lot!</li>
    <li> Love this new scent! I have to spray a squirt or two more than I would Wonderstruck but it smells amazing. I spray it early in the morning and after work I still get compliments on how I smell! It lasts that long!</li>
    <li> Good shipping, arrived in ok packing. sealed box. Oooo the smell is the best! all I can say it great product! very good price, I wasn&#x27;t wanting to pay 50+ so I looked around. I would and will recommend this perfume to anyone and this seller!</li>
    <li> Exellent perfume and price!&lt;br /&gt;I first found this perfume in a dept. store around Xmastime. I searched and found it on Amazon for a super great price!</li>
    <li> This is the same product you can find animals, but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic with more of a fall, citrus and light vanilla flower smell.</li>
    <li> I use this perfume daily, usually every four to six months or so, I reorder it.  This perfume smells wonderful and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> One of the sexiest parfumes I own!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not impressive, i am not happy with the smell. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift.  It was what the receiver asked for.  I was pleasantly surprised when the order came with the extra purse/travel size and the bonus jewelry box!!</li>
    <li> I rated 5 stars for Wonderstruck Enchanted. I bought mine at Macys store for only $59.50 + tax totaling to $63.07. Why is Amazon&#x27;s price more expensive? I just noticed Amazon&#x27;s price and had to make a comment about it. I recommend if you can buy it at a Macys store to do so or to order it online at Macys. You save a couple of bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Now onto my review of Wonderstruck Enchanted. I have a youtube video reviewing the scent if you would like to check it out. Check it out at [...]&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Wonderstruck and its sister Wonderstruck Enchanted. I keep smelling raspberries in Wonderstruck Enchanted. I&#x27;m not good with smell so don&#x27;t quote me on that. I wonder if others smell raspberries too? That&#x27;s the only thing I smell when I first put it on. I can&#x27;t tell what I smell later throughout the day. But let me tell you, this perfume does last! It&#x27;s not a put it on your body and in 1 hour it&#x27;ll go away. For me, it last almost the whole entire day!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Wonderstruck and Wonderstruck Enchanted. Plus if you order through Macys.com or buy off their store, you get a free bag. Does Amazon do that?</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume at Macy&#x27;s right after it came out, it didn&#x27;t scream at me like other perfumes have. I got a sample of this perfume a few weeks later, and after I put it on my skin, and let it sit for awhile, then I smelled it, and it smelled way better than I remembered. This perfume can be hard to smell at times. This perfume is very light. This perfume is magical. This is one of my favorite new perfumes. I buy a lot of perfume. My favorites are the celebrity&#x27;s. I&#x27;m so glad she released another perfume. I did like Wonderstruck, but I prefer this one more. I think you could wear this all year long. This perfume I was really excited about after I received a sample in the mail. When I smell perfume sometimes in the store they don&#x27;t always catch me at hello, it might be because there is so many other perfumes there, so sometimes you can&#x27;t smell them. This perfume is defiantly different than the original Wonderstruck. I just can&#x27;t get enough of this smell. I do wish it was a bit stronger, because that&#x27;s the way I like it. In my opinion this perfume is unique, it doesn&#x27;t smell like any other perfume I have smelled before.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, and the sale couldn&#x27;t have gone better or more smoothly. Thanks so much for a carefree transaction!</li>
    <li> The person I bought it for, plus five other people all hated the smell of this Eau de Parfum.  Will try and&lt;br /&gt;give it to someone, but not sure how.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves  this cologne.  The gift was a real hit with her.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this fragrance</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend as a gift. She had some but paid much more than Amazon&#x27;s price so I ordered it for her and we both like it.</li>
    <li> smell so nice :) so cheap :) :) :)</li>
    <li> It has been over 1 year of me doing about 1-2 sprays a day and I still have about 1/2 a bottle.  I never liked perfumes because I thought they were overpowering and made me feel a bit older than I am.  I tried a tester of this and loved that the fragrance is a little sweet, not too young, yet does not make me think mature.  If that makes sense?  I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on it so it must be suitable on me, ya.  I would recommend if you are new to perfumes and in your late teens/early 20s.</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s smells like a berry candy or berry pie I enjoy it. Perfect sent for spring. It smells really strong in the beginning and but the sent kind of dies down after a couple minutes but it still visible I&#x27;ve gotten compliments when I hug people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this perfume! I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> Best purfume I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This perfume I bought for my daughter who wanted to try the new fragrance from one of your favorite artists. The product arrived at their destination very quickly. The presentation was fabulous, came with an additional jeweler. My daughter was delighted with her gift that exceeded their expectations.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this smell! It doesn&#x27;t last super long, but that&#x27;s ok. My boyfriend loves the smell too. The bottle is super pretty with a holographic shimmer.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought the original Wonderstruck at a department store. The Enchanted one is much nicer. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it since I started wearing it. I have two moderately expensive perfumes and I&#x27;ve never gotten compliments from strangers while wearing them. This one is much less expensive. I love it so much I sometimes wear it at home just because it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to a lot of fragrances, especially in perfumes, laundry detergent and air fresheners. This doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, itch or give me a headache at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally like musky perfumes, but this one is very lightly musky; bright, warm, kind of floral in the background but more like plumeria (the actual flower, not perfumes or oils) instead of a general flower smell. It&#x27;s also has a cocoa scent that&#x27;s stronger than the rest of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Gf loved it. Great price saved a lot</li>
    <li> This perfume has a really nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t seem to suffocate all those around me. It lasts only a few hours however so if you plan on being at campus all day (or whatever your life situation is) maybe bring it along with you or get a travel perfume sprayer. Overall it has a nice subtle floral scent.</li>
    <li> This makes the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve used.  The bottle  is so pretty with its charms.  The perfume smells wonderful and works with my chemistry.  The only problem I had was the tracking said due to inclement weather it might be delayed.  I followed the tracking of package and it set in Springdale, Arkansas for 2 days.  That&#x27;s only about 12 miles from my home.  Our weather temperature was 56.  I finally received it Wednesday.  There was no inclement weather in Springdale or at my home.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments from using this perfume. I am so pleased with it, I bought more for my sister and she loves it as well. It lasts a while too:D</li>
    <li> My 13 yr old daughter loves this perfume and so do I.  The price is great on Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> Love this Taylor Swift perfume!! Very classy and not overwhelming. Very happy to get such a great price on the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Really nice smell, not too strong but yet smells great.</li>
    <li> love it - wish it continued to smell all day, after about 4 hours or less the smell has gone away!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3.4 oz bottle recently as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to myself. When it arrived, it included a pretty red velvet box and a .33 oz purse spray. Lovely scent and great price! Merry Christmas to all.</li>
    <li> I tried in a sample and loved its sweet smell. Its smell as I expected but the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long!</li>
    <li> Bought my girls both scents. The bottles are adorable and they love the way the perfume smells. Great gift for teen girls.</li>
    <li> Originally I was given Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s fragrance, but I really did not like the lilac notes in it... it seemed very old lady-ish, so I took it back to the store and while I was there I picked up a gift set of Enchanted Wonderstruck perfume with shower gel and body lotion from a national retailer for less than $10 because of the after Christmas clearance.  I could not be more pleased.  It is a very sweet smelling scent, and one that I will probably give to my daughter when I have a chance to get the perfume I really want.  In all it smells nice, and I can still smell it on my skin after more than 24 hours.  Most celebrity fragrances are known for then relatively short scent life.  I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth with this one!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  I get so many complements when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume I always will get a compliment from at least 1 person.  I loved the price as well!  In the stores, it runs like $40.00 or more!  Will definitely order again when I need more!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She was surprised by its unique fragrance which it not strong or overpowering. She loves to wear it and often gets compliments from others on how much they like it. As an opinion from a man, I recommend buying it for your wife or girlfriend. If you are daring, you can buy it for someone else&#x27;s wife or girlfriend. They will like to wear it, too.</li>
    <li> I just took a stab in the dark about this scent.  It is really nice and a very pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle and fragrance is outstanding. The price was just right and arrived so quickly. This was a gift and was a hit.</li>
    <li> Perfect Christmas gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neice loved it. Whole process was simple and vendor was great.&lt;br /&gt;S&amp;H was very reasonable and arrivd on time.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scent for any teenage girl, tween, or even young woman! Arrives in a beautiful package, well sealed and unharmed. Lasts a nice long time and is delightfully mature. I would say that any young lady should settle for this lovely perfume. The buying, price, shipping, and product is all perfection! I would definitely suggest this perfume to any lady in need of a lovely scent, that lasts all day long. You will fall in love with this product if you haven&#x27;t already. People will comment on how good you smell. This is a great buy for a wonderful scent and price! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased as a xmas gift...I guess they like it and that is the parfum they use ..great price on this item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had SUCH a hard time finding a perfume I like. Whenever I&#x27;d go into the fragrance section, in wherever I was shopping, I would try everything, high and low, in effort to find something I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d spray something on, thinking I liked it, then start feeling nauseous 30 minutes later because the scent was so overpowering. But I so badly loved the idea of having that, &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;, that embodied my personality, that smelt like ME, that people associated with my persona.&lt;br /&gt;After much searching, I tried &amp;#34;Enchanted Wonderstruck&amp;#34;. I sprayed on, in a store one day, and could not stop smelling myself for hours. (I know. A girl walking around with her wrist to her nose is definitely not epitome of class, but it seriously smelt that good.) I could not get enough. It never made me nauseous. So I bought it, and this is MOST definitely MY signature fragrance. The scent just flits through the air, sweet with just enough depth and edge to prevent that sickening sugar-sugar sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I offered to let a friend use the fragrance a while ago, and when she smelt it, she lit up, laughed, and then squealed, &amp;#34;It smells like YOU.&amp;#34; Haha. ;)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d highly recommend this perfume. I&#x27;ve had such a great experience with it, and could not be possibly happier.&lt;br /&gt;But I WILL say, though, that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would have thought it would. Which may be great for people who get tired of smelling one thing for very long. It depends on how close you spray it to your skin, though. If you spray it 3 or 4 inches away from a certain spot, it&#x27;ll probably smell like that for days. ;) I usually spray around 10&#x27;&#x27; to 1&#x27; away from myself, and it lasts for around 24 hours. :)</li>
    <li> My favorite!! Everyone tells me I smell good when I wear it!! I strongly recommend it. If you like sweet scent buy this!</li>
    <li> I love the scent. My only complaint is that it wears off too fast. However, I find this that this happens with every perfume or cologne I try-including some very expensive ones  tIncludingthis</li>
    <li> Came on time. Happy about price.  And smells great</li>
    <li> My friend was looking for a new summer scent that wasn&#x27;t fruity or tropical. I decided that a spicy vanilla would be nice on her skin and ordered this perfume. It. Smells. Divine.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the packaging, the bottle itself, and has gotten quite a few compliments on her new scent :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally right reviews, but I just can&#x27;t get enough of this smell. My best friend got this for me as a gift for Christmas this year. It&#x27;s very nostalgic to me, but I can&#x27;t exactly put my finger on it. I&#x27;m constantly spraying this on myself, not because the scent doesn&#x27;t last, it does.. and it does BEAUTIFULLY! I just want to smell like this forever. If I could bathe in it, I would. Maybe this review is dramatic, but I think I&#x27;ve found my holy grail, signature scent for quite awhile, if not forever. I honestly feel bad for my other perfumes that are just collecting dust. If you like sweet, floral, clean scents, buy this. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> My signature scent is Fire and Ice by Revlon. I love it so much it is hard to branch out into other perfumes, but this one has captured my attention. It is a pretty scent with a strong vanilla base which I like a lot. It will not be my every day perfume, but something I chose when I want to change it up. My teenage daughters love it! It  runs through a variety of smells through out the day but it never is too much. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good. It was such a great prive I couldnt pass it up. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a scent that I could love after my old favorite (Bulgari Jaiper Saphir) was discontinued.  I&#x27;ve flopped around from scent to scent looking for a fit and think I may have found it in this. I avoided trying it for a long time because I&#x27;m not a fan of celebrity endorsed products.  It&#x27;s not really like Jaiper Saphir but there&#x27;s something about this heady, powdery scent that I love. The smaller bottle (0.5 oz) seems to be better - the scent clearer, longer lasting - but I don&#x27;t know why.  Either way, I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Smells great, especially for summer. I also didn&#x27;t realize it was such a big bottle, what a great deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and she loved it. We both love the fragrance, and it arrived on time. Overall very pleased with the purchase. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this after smelling in a store me and my coworker (male) absolutely feel in love with it but I couldn&#x27;t see spending $50 on it so I looked on here and it was half the cost! great Deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not In to Taylor Swift since I&#x27;m 37 years old but I received a free sample of this perfume and thought it smelled nice so I tried it out and my husband noticed and liked it.  It&#x27;s not real &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; which is what I normally gravitate towards but it is a good mix of fruit and floral/woodsy.  It has a good balance of a lot of different scents.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it seems like the smell fades fairly quickly.  Overall, I am happy that I bought it and it was a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I only wear sweet scented perfumes and this one is perfect!  The bottle is really nice too.  The price here is so much cheaper than any other store you would find it in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought both parfums from Taylor Swift (the purple one and this) and they both are exquisites and has beautiful bottles!!</li>
    <li> I loved her first scent and love this one even more. I especially love the small notes of Sandalwood that I pick up that I think it has. You don&#x27;t need to be a Taylor Swift fan to enjoy these scents, but since my favourite song of hers is Enchanted it just makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! The item comes in a decorative and protective box and also comes with what looked like a small sample bottle in addition to the perfume. The box is nice, in Christmas red, protective and a general nice addition. The perfume smells slightly sweat, but pleasantly so in my opinion. The wife is very happy with it so a good purchase and good value. Now I know what to buy her for her Brithday too!</li>
    <li> Pretty  bottle.....smells great.</li>
    <li> My perfume was delivered early and smells great. I paid less for the bigger bottle. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the fragrance while it can last for around eight hours or so before it needs another application, and that is with one or two initial sprays at the beginning of the day. It smells flowery, fruity, and even a bit spicy at times - somehow the smell reminds me of Christmas. It&#x27;s not exactly a smell for summer or spring, though it doesn&#x27;t really matter when you want to wear it, but it would be excellent for fall and winter.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly still in original packaging. All I can describe this scent as is powder and spice. The bottle is huge, I love it. It&#x27;s very different.</li>
    <li> Even though I don&#x27;t know any fancy perfume classifications, I can say that this perfume smells amazing. I have had people randomly approach me and say that I smell nice. It also seems to smell good almost universally. Many of my friends have tried it, and they all smell great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is not overly pungent, and it fades rather quickly, so I would recommend spraying this on clothing as well as skin if you want it to linger. When I take my clothing out of the wash to dry, I give each article one spritz of perfume. The result is that all my clothing has a very faint sweet smell. This Avenue is only advisable only if you&#x27;re in for a serious commitment, because if you want to get the smell completely out, you have reward your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I eventually run out, I do plan on purchasing this perfume again!</li>
    <li> smells amazing and the bottle is gorgeous. it is huge it will definitely last me awhile! what a great value.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal. I smelt it originally at a department store. I fell in love with the fragrance. Bought this from amazon smells great but a bit different.</li>
    <li> So, I may not be a taylor swift fan, but no wonder she goes through so many men...this scent is AMAZING! I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend after smelling it in store. I couldn&#x27;t really place words to explain the smell if you&#x27;ve never had it besides it&#x27;s warm. It&#x27;s not fruity or cheap. It&#x27;s a quailty perfum. The shipper did send it unboxed, but was very overly helpfull. After a shipping error, he offered to drive 45 minutes to make sure I got it on time! So over all I say it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I AM THRILLED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with this perfume since it came out so I already knew I loved the smell. It&#x27;s the perfect romantic, subtle but classy perfume. I ordered this on amazon bc I had a gift card here so I received this for free. I was apprehensive bc of the fact the 3.4 oz bottle (the biggest bottle normally 75) was only 33 dollars, but bc it was sold and shipped by amazon I bought it. I was only expecting the 3.4 oz bottle in he regular packaging, but instead it came in the beautiful red velvet jewelry box with a beautiful red bow and a pretty nice size travel perfume as well. I am beyond thrilled !!!! So happy. All my Perfumes are stored in one place now :) and I smell amazing</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; of sent for me. I don&#x27;t feel like a kid wearing roll on &amp;#34;art stuff&amp;#34; glitter from Bath and Body Works (remember that stuff?!) and at the same time, it&#x27;s not grandmother-y at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps that my husband is a huge fan of Taylor Swift-but he loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the top doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. I would hate to lose it too, it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife as a holiday gift. she loves it. The thank you she gave me was hair raising. so guys..get your lady some of this and she might just drop to her knees in thanks.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> 17 year old g.daughter loved the perfume...</li>
    <li> This perfume smells absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance and I love it on her. Awesome price for a large bottle. On time shipping (actually got here a day early)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter, She loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and I get so many compliments about this scent</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on how good I smell when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I do notice though that it trends to give me a little head ache for about ten minutes or so until I get used to it.  I don&#x27;t wear it every day and is not something I&#x27;m naturally drawn to but it had some really great reviews and people do seem to enjoy the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the price I found at Amazon was great.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! It smells heavenly! And you truly can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Great product! I really love the smell of this perfume and the packaging is so adorable. Also, this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found so kudos! Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> IT SMELL GOOD BUT I THINK THE BLUE SMELL BETTER TO ME THEY BOTH SMELL GOOD BUT I LIKE THE BLUE ONE BETTER</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present and she loved it, the bottle looks great, it smells great, and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Delightful fragrance, will be purchasing again in the future/</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> All three girls in my house love this perfume.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it! This perfume scent is composed of licorice and velvet with notes of wild berries, pink poppy and passion fruit. Heart notes include peony blossoms, sugar-glazed champaca petals and white freesia. White musk, hypnotic vanilla and blonde woods construct the perfume&#x27;s found. It&#x27;s a floral scent with an edge which makes it both great as a casual perfume and as an evening one. A rare and deadly combo, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever smelled anything so great! I get so many complimats on how good I smell! Thank you Taylor!</li>
    <li> This fragrance grew on me quite a bit. At first I was concerned it would be too heavy/fruity for me - very strong raspberry/sugar scent off the bat, much like Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy (anyone? I loved it when I was 16). It mellowed down a lot over the course of a few hours, leaving just a trace of vanilla and berry. I actually kept smelling my wrists and was disappointed when the scent dissipated around halfway through my work day. I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day since. Cute bottle. Good fragrance - not just for tweens and teens :)</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this perfume! The sweet scent is the perfect pick me up to start my day. In addition to the scent, the bottle is super cute as well. This would be the perfect gift for any female Taylor Swift fan!</li>
    <li> I personally love the smell of this, but I had a friend tell me once that it smells like a pipe.  It&#x27;s a reasonable price, stays on throughout the day, and I love the scent, but I can see where the pipe smell comment came from.  The packaging and bottle are both very pretty.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this perfume because I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell; boy was I wrong! It&#x27;s not overwhelming but a sweet scent that stays in the background and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brand!!</li>
    <li> My daughter being a big Taylor Swift fan I didn&#x27;t know what to expect for it.  It was one of the last presents she opened and she loved it.  As for a celebrity endorsed product it actually had a great sent to it.  Most importantly she loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and I find it wonderful on her.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! very smooth and I get compliments on this all the time from guys and girls!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and when it arrived with in days I was excited and then I started shaking it and thought it was broke. It was just the jewels on the top rattling and my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume,  love it.  And it is perfumed water not eau de toilet water spray.  Stays longer than regular perfume.</li>
    <li> This is such a great scent.  I was hesitant to buy online but my college age daughter wanted it for Christmas.  WOW!  It smells terrific.</li>
    <li> I just tried Taylor Swift&#x27;s enchanted and loved it!  The smell is refreshing yet sweet and the bottle is just perfect to leave dressing up a counter.  I think I&#x27;ll like it best in the warm weather, but I was so happy to add it to my collection.</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for my lovely wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Taylor Swift and I probably couldn&#x27;t sing one song of hers, but this perfume is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh after smell or a fruity/sweet smell. I actually love this perfume because it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;sweet.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s very becoming and I get a lot of compliments! I received this item as a birthday gift and I definitely recommend this perfume to anyone!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected it to be. My Granddaughter loved it. Would highly recommend this item for any young girl.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Quick shipping; not problems. Would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift. It is a pretty fragrance and she liked it too.</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on this scent. It came in a nice gift package and was actually better then expected. A really good buy for what you get, and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This is the first bottle of perfume I&#x27;ve purchased in years. I can&#x27;t even describe the scent but it is better than most of the designer perfumes out there, and my husband LOVES it! It&#x27;s not teeny-boppery at all, but surprisingly sophisticated. Just BUY it!</li>
    <li> Received extremely fast ,well before time stated, and looks really, really good, had lots of great compliments on product !</li>
    <li> My girls loved this gift for Christmas. Thanks so much for the quick service. Very pleased with this purchase. Thanks</li>
    <li> The fragance is sweet and wonderful, but I loved the bottle most... it shines and became an ornament to my room haha :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PERFUME EVER IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM ENCHANTED</li>
    <li> Daughter beg me for it and barely wears it. I think it is just okay</li>
    <li> I thought it might be too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells really nice thanks!</li>
    <li> I received in a good condition and smell is perfect. I got as expected.</li>
    <li> Es un perfume dulce. El envase del diseño es hermoso y es coherente con el diseño de los productos de Taylor Swift.</li>
    <li> This Delightful Enchanted Perfume actually smells very nice. I though that this would be a great holiday gift for a country girl because she would love it. After receiving this product i have to updated my previous statement because it is simply not the case. It is not just for a county girl. I would actually give this to any girl if i was not dating a country girl. Of course I will have to wait till after the winter months to give you a better assessment about if it work on other girls. jk</li>
    <li> OMG smells so good.  I had the knock off brand of this,  it smells great but the *real* stuff lasts longer.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, i was expecting only the 3.4 oz bottle. I was excited to see it was in a velvet case with the .33 oz spray too! Buy from FragranceNet if u want to be pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of Taylor Swift, but dannnng her perfume is amazing! When I first put it on I was sceptical because it smelled like a little girls perfume but after it settled on my clothes it smelled more adultish. It goes great with my chemistry, and I&#x27;m one of those types of people where if the perfume smells good in the bottle it usually won&#x27;t smell so good on me. This is the opposite. I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! My boyfriend won&#x27;t leave me alone! He says I smell like \\&quot;ice cold spring water\\&quot; even though that&#x27;s not what it smells like. He seems to think pheramones are in the perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good. It is very sweet which is what I love about it. I&#x27;m not a fan of Taylor Swift&#x27;s music but I am very much in to her perfume.</li>
    <li> You seriously just cant beat this price for the amount of perfume you are getting. This easily retails for a lot more! Very happy with this purchase and it came in the mail fast and was packaged well!</li>
    <li> The Taylor Swift Wonderstruck cologne went over big as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. The new fragrance was a nice change for many others on the market. She loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and I&#x27;m so glad I picked it up. Very elegant, and the fragrance lasts a good amount of time. I would say if you want to actually smell the fragrance all day that you&#x27;d need to reapply late in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  I wear it everyday so now I can&#x27;t even smell it on me I&#x27;m so used to it now, but in the beginning I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling myself!  My husband loves it and whenever I hug friends they pull away and say, \\&quot;Wow! You smell good!\\&quot;  That is always a nice thing to hear and a good compliment to receive.  For years I wore Bath and Body&#x27;s Fresh Vanilla spray and people loved that on me, but then they discontinued it and started making the Warm Vanilla Sugar smell instead which just wasn&#x27;t the same.  I tried to do their Exotic Coconut Spray, and that was great for summertime, but I was dying to find a perfume that met my needs.  I am the kind of girl who loves to smell nice all the time!  The first thing I do after I shower is spritz myself all over with a great perfume!  Well ladies, this fragrance does not disappoint.  I admit, I had my doubts because of the teeny bopper label a la Taylor Swift, but it&#x27;s a really nice smelling fragrance and brings to mind the words, secretive, magical, mysterious, and romantic whenever I wear it.  Just the way I like it.  It puts a big smile on my face and I love how it makes me feel and smell.  Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Taylor Swift and love the first wonderstruck perfume so much. But I was very disappointed by the smell of this perfume, it&#x27;s not soft at all, kind of aggressive. The bottle looks cute though, I guess I&#x27;ll just use it to decorate my bedroom.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Bought for Christmas gift and it was a hit! Way to go Taylor quality stuff keep it up.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves Taylor Swift and when she saw this perfume she wanted it. She had a sample from a magazine and was crazy about it. Bought it for her birthday and she is thrilled. Even my wife uses it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I get compliments everywhere I go.. this smells DELICIOUS..</li>
    <li> Happy I love this perfume</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift, arrived on time and she loves the scent!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this one. I liked the smell but it didn&#x27;t stay for very long whereas when i put it on in the department store it stayed on all day. But it was an amazing price.</li>
    <li> .very good,i bought this for my wife she loves it thank you very much.i  recommend that anybody who needs this to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Enchanted Wonderstruck since it came out, and Wonderstruck before that. I was using Enchanted Wonderstruck every single day so when November hit, I was nearly out. I automatically ordered and it came in perfect packaging two days later. It&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes and I was so thrilled to see Amazon had it.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and expected.Packaged like I just bought it from the mall off the shelf! No damage, and great shipping timing!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing, has beautiful packaging, and has a reasonable price in comparison to most celebrity perfumes. It lasts for a super long time as well. An all around great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always worn &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;white musk&amp;#34; scents.  I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of loud perfumes that project into a room since I have a very sensitive sense of smell.  Lately though, I&#x27;ve been drawn to vanilla-berryish scents.  Perhaps the winter season called for something warmer and more festive.  I bought this without sampling first because of the description of the scent and the reviews from other sites that gave a lot of detailed info and everyone seemed to have a favorable review.  I have to say that I am very pleased with my purchase.  The packaging is lovely and the bottle is simply gorgeous!  It looks like something out of a fairytale!  I&#x27;m happy with the scent.  It almost reminds me of a very soft Shalimar.  I have no idea how to go about describing the notes but I will do my best to describe.  It&#x27;s a very creamy scent with a bit of spice to it on my skin.  I don&#x27;t get any of the berry notes that I wanted but it&#x27;s still a nice fragrance that I can wear out or to work during cooler weather.  I don&#x27;t think I would be able to tolerate this during the hot summers down south.  When summer rolls back around, I will probably go back to wearing Philosophy Pure Grace which has been my signature for many years now.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas. Based my purchase solely on the reviews written on Amazon so I really went out on a limb. But i was not let down! I love the smell of the perfume and more importantly my wife loves it! Thanks everyone!</li>
    <li> This perfume is my favorite out of them all. &amp;#60;3 it just compliments everything so nicely, and smells AMAZING! I will never stop loving it. I just wish it came in much bigger bottles. I would definitely pay the money for a bigger bottle. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased it on the basis of reviews but it was not  of my taste.The smell persist for long,bottle is beautiful and was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite scents from TSwift. thanks for sendin so quickly.</li>
    <li> Half the price from what you find in stores.  I get complimented on this perfume constantly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME!! you smell like a garden of Taylor. its absolutely amazing perfume. put it on right after you get out of the shower and you&#x27;ll smell like  goddess all day long!!! Shout out to TAYLOR SWIFT.!!! Im ordering beyonce&#x27;s perfume next :D</li>
    <li> Perfect fragrance for my perfume addiction.</li>
    <li> grand  daughter requested and enjoyed</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with Taylor Swift enchanted fragrance. It smells amazing! I was very disappointed when it was discontinued in local stores and online. Finding it on Amazon was great. The only thing I would say is that compared to a small bottle (1.7 oz) that I already had, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to smell quite the same. It seems the original smells a little bit sweeter and lasts longer. However, for the most part I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who is in her 40&#x27;s and we both love it.  The scent is definitely sweet and the berries and passion fruit definitely stand out.  My wife describes it as a &amp;#34;young and fun&amp;#34; scent but also sophisticated enough that a woman of any age can wear it.  The scent lingers a nice long time as well, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing my wife had to say about the product was that the bottle was hard for her to handle.  Her hands are a bit on the small side and the bottle is fairly large and shaped a bit like a grenade.  She said she needs to use two hands to apply the perfume.  Not a big deal, but anyone buying this as a gift for a younger girl may want to keep it in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this is a nice smelling, long lasting perfume that I like better than some costing 2 or 3 times as much.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome! It has a light sweet scent to it. i think that this is worth the money. I just love the bottle and the little charms on this. However, Macy&#x27;s has this for $60.</li>
    <li> I have decided I absolutely love Wonderstruck Enchanted! It&#x27;s definitely a much more mature, sexy type of scent so I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend a teenager, or at least anyone under 16, wearing it. To me it seems a more appropriate scent for a night out rather than for a day-to-day basis. It has a very rich woodsy-berry kind of smell. Well done once again Taylor Swift!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle. Very good for price. Quick shipping. No damage to the item. It smells even better than the smaller bottles for some reason.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume. It&#x27;s surprisingly sophisticated. It smells best when you have JUST put it on, but after maybe 30 minutes, basically all you smell is vanilla. I really like vanilla, so the scent for me is enjoyable, but if you do not like vanilla, then I would definitely NOT get this perfume. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the packaging, but honestly, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me.</li>
    <li> But after a few hours, it had settled on me and I kept getting wiffs of what smelled totally delicious. I immediately bought a bottle on Amazon for my birthday and have worn it almost daily ever since. I have gotten ALL KINDS of compliments on it - from store girls in Lilly Pulitzer to guys I date. It smells so clean and great, I absolutely LOVE it. For reference: I&#x27;m a 24 yr old young professional.</li>
    <li> This  perfume has a  beautiful scent!  It&#x27;s not over  powering,  but perfectly  feminine and pretty.  Both my  teen  daughter and I  use it. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this scent and it comes in a nice bottle. One confusing thing I found is currently there are 2 Taylor Swift fragrances out with similar names, Wonderstruck and Wonderstruck Enchanted. I did not care for the plain Wonderstruck in the purple bottle; I bought it by mistake seeing it onsale at Sam&#x27;s Club, but only after the fact realized it was a different product, I had falsly assumed it was just a smaller different colored bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I would mention this incase you are shopping around as the similar names caught me off guard, make sure youget the red bottle :-)</li>
    <li> Wonderstruck Enchanted is a haunting fragrance! It possibly will become one of my great favorites, before long.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first day I am wearing it, so I cannot know yet.&lt;br /&gt;It was a recent gift from the holidays. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not follow celebrities when they create perfumes, and never have. Am I weird?&lt;br /&gt;This is the first \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrance I have ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;If someone would like to explain to me what the appeal of a celebrity&#x27;s name, vis a vis a design house which specializes in creating perfumes is, PLEASE help me out! I do not mean to be derogatory, but it honestly makes me want a scent less if it has some personality&#x27;s name on it. I must be REALLY OLD. That&#x27;s gotta be it!&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought this, choosing it myself, using a gift card.&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, it was not just because of the description of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it also because of the GREAT eighties \\&quot;retro look\\&quot; of the bottle, with the adorable charms. The staggeringly passionate magenta-pink color of the bottle really appealed to me as well. It looks enticing, like a pomegranate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging CAN be important, expecially in luxury items, like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all for naught however if you don&#x27;t like the fragrance, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no scent on before I sprayed it on. I sprayed it on my hand after I was freshly showered (good for you, jeannie!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then rubbed it briskly up my arm. I did this because my husband was IN THE WAY the whole time and I couldn&#x27;t get to the bottle in the regular manner!!! haha!!! It is not a new way of smelling scent, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate,&lt;br /&gt;I have had it on for four hours now and my husband has grabbed me twice, in a romantic fashion, out of the blue!!! He LOVES it. He has a very discerning sense of smell. He used to collect vintage men&#x27;s perfumes. He also gave me many of my favourites for years.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it four stars just for HIS reaction! Guy loves girl&#x3D;great! I am giving it my fifth star because the woody base notes really get to me -- I do not smell the top notes as much as the base notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the way this wears, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM enchanted with Wonderstruck Enchanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put my review in the \\&quot;Crazy for it!\\&quot; category!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best wishes, jeanfifth star because the woody base notes really get to me -- I do not smell the top notes as much as the base notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the way this wears, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM enchanted with Wonderstruck Enchanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put my review in the \\&quot;Crazy for it!\\&quot; category!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best wishes, jean</li>
    <li> Bought this as a little gift for the mrs, she really loves it and i love it on her. very nice scent. good on ya taylor</li>
    <li> This perfume has a very pretty scent. It&#x27;s has a pretty sweet undertone to it, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like candy. On me has a little more vanilla to it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since it is very light, it&#x27;s perfect for the daytime. It fades a little be throughout the day because it&#x27;s so light. But it&#x27;s a very nice smelling fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light. Girly. Sweet.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new fall/winter scent and this product was perfect. I would describe it as a little musky, woodsy yet has a sweet smelling overtone. I also like it because it stays on me most of the day, which some perfume goes away after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> PEOPLE ASK WHAT&#x27;S THAT LOVELY PERFUME YOU ARE WEARING. ITS PERFECT.</li>
    <li> Just received my order and it came early. My husband loves it. Very happy with my order. It came with No lid but that didn&#x27;t bother me. It was packaged great &amp; came with free samples &amp; free nail clippers. The smell is warm and musky. I recommend this perfume and company. Happy wife happy life!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, I liked it, she not so much.</li>
    <li> I find it to be difficult to find a fragrance that will last without using 1/3 of a bottle.  Not true with Enchanted Wonderstruck.  Everything Taylor does turns to gold and this applies to this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend and we loved it. This perfume has a rich and fresh scent, with a twist sweet and soft olor that provoke the sensation of eating the girl who is wearing it. Ideal for young women.</li>
    <li> This is an enchanted scent.like a clean fruity slight flowery scent.its going to smell a lil different on everyone but I get lots of compliments and have bought several bottles.I wear it often :-)</li>
    <li> Because the scent of perfume changes somewhat with your body chemistry after wearing for awhile, my criteria for evaluation is whether anyone else tells me how good I smell when I wear it.  I tried the original Wonderstruck and liked it, but no one told me I smelled good.  After trying Enchanted, however, I received many compliments on my fragrance.  In my opinion, it is not quite as heavy a fragrance as the blue bottle and isn&#x27;t overpowering, but lasts throughout the day well.  It is not too musky and not too floral, but a nice combination. The bottles of both fragrances are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love the Taylor Swift because is has a sweet and floweriest smell. That is why I alike Taylors Swift&#x27;s Parfume. Thanks you.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and quickly ran out because I fell in love and needed more.  I get many compliments whenever I where this scent.  The packaging is also very beautiful.  It&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering but long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Everyone compliments me on how good it smells!</li>
    <li> I ordered Enchanted, the 3.4 ounce bottle. Instead I got a 1.7 ounce Wonderstruck bottle. And on top of that, when I sprayed it to test the scent, I could not smell hardly anything. I own a 3.4 ounce bottle of Wonderstruck so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like and this wasn&#x27;t it. The bottle did not come with a box either, instead just some bubble wrap and cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a bottle of Enchanted that was about to run out so I was hoping to replace it... Instead I got this.</li>
    <li> Wife really enjoys this perfume.</li>
    <li> Just as it looks, I even received coupons on other purfume I love! I would definitely recommend this site to others!!</li>
    <li> This perfume &amp;#34;Enchanted&amp;#34; smells amazing ! I had been searching for a new perfume and came across Enchanted. This perfume is perfect for me because it&#x27;s not to&lt;br /&gt;strong!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. The scent compliments be beautifully. Although I am not a fan of Taylor Swift, I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and I sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future. Love love love.</li>
    <li> Just love it. Period. I&#x27;m in my forties and wear this running errands, going to church or just around the house :).  Seem to get the most compliments with this fragrance. Haven&#x27;t tried the other one (the purple one) but am tempted to try it-I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. Can&#x27;t beat the price for such a huge bottle either!</li>
    <li> My wife has been &amp;#34;hinting&amp;#34; at this since it came out. Now she has it and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> I love it. thank you ♥</li>
    <li> Wonderstruck Enchanted is an excellent product! I really love how it smells, though it is similar to Taylor Swift&#x27;s first perfume called Wonderstruck. Both of these perfumes have a floral scent, and they both make great gifts!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this smell at all, I bought without trying first, I smelled it in a magazine and like it, but then when I received it - I did not like it at all. I wonder if it even is the real thing as price was too good to be true. And if it is the real EDT - thumbs down Taylor Swift. Too sweet - smells like a bad air freshener. I emailed Amazon and questioned whether the product is authentic and they refunded my money no question asked.</li>
    <li> I got this as a christmas present for my 16 year old daughter and she loves it. It has become her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, to me it&#x27;s the best fragrance to be around.</li>
    <li> For those of you who remember the Britney Spears perfume \\&quot;in control curious\\&quot; you will definitely recognise this scent. It&#x27;s pretty much a repackage. I used to drown myself in it I absolutely loved it and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s now available again, although under a different celebrity name.</li>
    <li> I like this scent.  I am not a teenager, but I like it&#x27;s sweet sugary finish.  Some of her other perfumes are terrible, but this one is good.</li>
    <li> This smells warm and cozy with vanilla and musky undertones. Yet it&#x27;s fresh and fruity when you first put it on. You can smell berry tones that has an underlying warmness. I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends. It&#x27;s young, fresh and fruity, yet not overwhelming and too sweet. It&#x27;s still got some spiciness and boldness.</li>
    <li> I love it! When you spray it in the air or put your nose to the bottle, it smells really strong. The second I put it on my skin it smelled awesome. It&#x27;s musky and floral, but really subtle. Definitely an every day kind of fragrance. I highly recommend this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Smells so refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great perfume, great price on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> great and sent a bunch of free samples of lotion and perfumes.</li>
    <li> All of her perfumes are excellent</li>
    <li> my wife wanted this product. she says she loves it!!! It does smell good. She says it last all day!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!! I get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters (11) bday. She loved it and it smells really good. The price is perfect, the 1 oz bottle at Walgreens cost me almost 40.00 and this one is 3 times the size for almost $25!!!</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves it (11 years old). Actually a more pleasing scent than I would have guessed. Then again, I was used to what &amp;#34;pre-teen&amp;#34; perfumes smell like.</li>
    <li> Any product by Taylor swift is a good one. this perfume smells great. Just alittle disappointed with how it was shipped. It did not come with its box.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and loveeee the smell ♡</li>
    <li> Love this new fragrance. The price for the size was unbelievable. Never ordered gifts online before, will do it again.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and wear it well! the 1st time a tried was a sample at the store ULTA, thanks ULTA!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t like super strong perfumes and this one isn&#x27;t overpowering and is just right for my day-to-day. Lasts me all day</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of strong perfume, but this scent was just too much for me and it smelled really unnatural.</li>
    <li> My expectation on this product is absulotly good..</li>
    <li> I love this scent very nice not over powering at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of celebrity perfumes, but I love this one.  It smells so pretty!  It&#x27;s a floral smell and light-not overpowering and cheaper on Amazon than at the stores.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments at work how good I smell. Always get ask what perfume am I wearing. Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even a Taylor Swift fan, but this perfume is AMAZING! It&#x27;s the best smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever worn. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Love this scent and how quickly it shipped!</li>
    <li> Great everything I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never smelled it at a store and took a chance and bought it. I LOVE the smell!!! I wear it all the time. It&#x27;s a perfect blend of girlie without being strong or heavy</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews, I had never smelled it before. I LOVE IT!! It smells soo good! You will love it too! I&#x27;m gonna but another bottle!</li>
    <li> Smells great but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick at all.</li>
    <li> Long lasting &amp; love the smell!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, wife loved it.</li>
    <li> I love her first perfume but this one just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It&#x27;s very flowery and the wood scent just doesn&#x27;t mix. It gives me a huge headache and I wish I could love it but it doesn&#x27;t suit me. The bottle is very beautiful and if it weren&#x27;t for the migraine inducing scent, I would buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I would agree that the scent has a floral tone, which quiet frankly I have never really been a fan of. However, I really do like this perfume and would purchase it again for myself or for a friend. It smells delightful!</li>
    <li> This scent gets better and better every day. Perfect. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for my 14-yr-old granddaughter!  She loves it!  Would recommend it for any age!  Wonderful gift for my granddaughter!</li>
    <li> Smells very feminine and is not as overpowering as original Wonderstruck is.  My daughter loves to wear it everywhere she goes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful!  It smells great!!</li>
