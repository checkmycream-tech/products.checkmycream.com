      <li>Good lord, this attached to my hair immediately.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best to apply it, comb it through and leave it on for upwards to 25 minutes for full maximum deposit, condition and shine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I use this once every two weeks in conjunction with herbal essences color shampoo &amp; conditioner and it is AMAZING.</li>

      <li>But most importantly, this is by far the best conditioner I ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Most people&#x27;s colors fade within weeks</li>
      <li>For that i love it.</li>
      <li>Its more of a conditioner/color.  </li>
      <li>The way it tones hair is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this hair &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I used it when I used to dye my hair red, and it did bring a wonderful color to my hair.</li>
      <li>If you have red hair, this conditioner is awesome.</li>
      <li>, I just made sure it was not dripping as I stayed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>And the price on Amazon is so much better than the salon price.</li>
      <li>The product itself is a lot more dense in color.</li>
      <li>My hair is now redder then when I had originally dyed it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is STRONG.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re ready to get it everywhere because it&#x27;s kind of like hair dye itself.</li>
      <li>I think it would be great for red heads but as it said red-purple, I thought I could use it with my purple dye...</li>
      <li>She recommended this conditioner and it is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I have a very warm red color in my hair which fades drastically within 2 weeks after I visit the salon.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this conditioner, it keeps her red hair vibrant and beautiful in between coloring!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
      <li>arrived safely and fast !</li>
      <li>Worth the price to get an immediate boost!</li>
      <li>The color deposit is rich and pigmented but still conditions and rinses clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This pushed the warm red hair color I had dyed my hair into Fantastic territory!  </li>
      <li>Probably 5 stars if it came in more colors and didn&#x27;t stain so much.</li>
      <li>I have a cool complexion</li>
      <li>so Im a true fan of this product.</li>
      <li>The product does stain my towels, but comes off easily when I wash them in hot water.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s important to follow directions exactly to prevent over-conditioning and breakage but for full coverage</li>
      <li>It does wash out of towels and clothes in one shot but your bathroom grout may not be so lucky after an extended use.</li>
      <li>I love the vibrant color and the smell.</li>
      <li>More red than purple, but I love and get compliments on it all the time.</li>
      <li>It may not refresh your hair to the shade you originally colored exactly, but it will give it a bright red tone to it when you need it refreshed.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference the very first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>I have since discovered that is works perfectly if I shampoo as normal, and then mix one squirt of Evo Fabuloso and two squirts of regular conditioner in to my hand and condition my hair like I normally would.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a fragrance of it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>I mix it with my own deep conditioner (to make it last a bit longer) but it works well on its own also.</li>
      <li>It has really restored my fading with age natural red hair to a nice bright and natural looking color!</li>
      <li>It will stain the tub, but bleach gets it right off.</li>
      <li>Be sure to bleach them (there is really no other way).    </li>
      <li>However, for me, it was an intense red/purple (almost bright pink)</li>
      <li>I have bright red/magenta hair (my natural color is about a 2N) that I used to dye almost every three weeks with L&#x27;Oreal Hi-Color in magenta and red</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very silky and soft and it looks healthy.</li>
      <li>Welllll, I did not because I thought to myself &amp;#34;Self, how much could it really fad out?!!&amp;#34; And the answer is A LOT!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super vibrant and pretty.  </li>
      <li>Apply to the ends of your hair first, then twist it up on the head</li>
      <li>Just make sure its not enough to stain your hands or clothes and be out.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>See tip 4 and apply to ends first.</li>
      <li>This will probably keep me out of the salon for several more weeks</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>I had been using Aveda&#x27;s red conditioner before and the difference is stunning.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I did use a lot at a time (several pumps) and left it in over 5min.</li>
      <li>Since I have long Hair, I need to use more than the recommended amount of pumps.</li>
      <li>I really really like this product it works great, but my god when I first bought this product which was only less</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but really does the job.</li>
      <li>and it really does the job, but doesn&#x27;t stain anything.</li>
      <li>I use this in combination with a color depositing shampoo (mixed with sulfate free shampoo) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>It brings it back to the original color and has helped prolong the time between coloring.</li>
      <li>The color fades from a dark red/pink to a very light pink/orange color.</li>
      <li>The color was rich and deep and just cool enough.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for six years and this has really extended the life of the dye, especially since I don&#x27;t get into the salon as quickly as I might like.</li>
      <li>The color washed down to a lovely toned but still vibrant color.</li>
      <li>It will however wash out at the next shampoo, so I try to only wash 2-3 weeks at most, using a cleansing conditioner one of those times.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>It definitely keeps my color looking fresh and the only way you can tell that my hair isn&#x27;t freshly dyed is my visible roots.</li>
      <li>also recommend this to someone that wants a slight red/magenta tint to their hair as pastels are in now, and anyone who is a bright red auburn to as red as the packaging on the bottle.</li>
      <li>After doing a lot of research I decided to get this when dyeing my hair red for the first time.</li>
      <li>I have colored my hair many shades of red oover the last 11 years and if you&#x27;re a red head as well, you know that it is the fastest fading hair color to rock.</li>
      <li>Also it leaves my hair unbelievably soft!</li>
      <li>Will STAIN your SCALP for a DAY or two if you apply it directly to the roots!</li>
      <li>I am a natural red head and have tried many color depositing shampoos/conditioners in hopes of brightening my hair back to how it was when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>I can tell you right now that this conditioner is not only superior to every other conditioner for redheads for it&#x27;s color depositing but the ingredients are unbelievable!</li>
      <li>Only downside, it will stain your fingers and shower quite a bit, so you need to rinse very thoroughly.</li>
      <li>If I use this product as the directions say, it is very un-natural looking in my naturally red hair.  </li>
      <li>The bottle pump is actually very helpful and avoids getting red stains all over your shower.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually looks like real blood when you pump it on to your hands.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep the red color.</li>
      <li>The colors are however more red pink than purple pink.</li>
      <li>I have had red hair many times in the past and always give up after a couple months because the constant coloring/refreshening is a royal pain.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s reminiscent of other Evo products which smell very clean, but not like other brands that smell too shampooey or conditioney.</li>
      <li>But I am definitely buying the brown one now that I am back to my natural hair color!</li>
      <li>I dye it 6VV, which has a brilliant red purple color at first, but fades to an awful pinkish copper-gold color after about 2 weeks, esp on my highlights.</li>
      <li>NOT necessary to completely towel dry hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had been using Aveda&#x27;s red conditioner before and the difference is stunning. The product itself is a lot more dense in color. It actually looks like real blood when you pump it on to your hands. I noticed a difference the very first time I tried it. My hair was not only redder, but also softer and shinier. I use it every other time I wash my hair. I get better results when I only wash and rinse my hair in cold water, but it still has kept my color intact for over 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the bottle says to use gloves, but I find that by the time I&#x27;m done in the shower, the dye has come off my hands. The product does stain my towels, but comes off easily when I wash them in hot water. The bottle pump is actually very helpful and avoids getting red stains all over your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product. There is really no flaw in it.</li>
    <li> My hair looks amazing!!  I got lots of compliments and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> Stained my shower and was totally the wrong color but that was my fault for picking the wrong color...it worked well, color lasted and kept my hair red between washes (unfortunately for me!). Probably 5 stars if it came in more colors and didn&#x27;t stain so much.</li>
    <li> This saved my hair.  I have a cool complexion and I wanted red hair.  This pushed the warm red hair color I had dyed my hair into Fantastic territory!  The color was rich and deep and just cool enough.  I got tons of compliments, no lie, tons.</li>
    <li> arrived safely and fast ! recommended !</li>
    <li> I use this once every two weeks in conjunction with herbal essences color shampoo &amp; conditioner and it is AMAZING. It&#x27;s some of the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for six years and this has really extended the life of the dye, especially since I don&#x27;t get into the salon as quickly as I might like. Also it leaves my hair unbelievably soft!</li>
    <li> I dont use it to keep my red hair red because i dint have red hair. Rather i use it to turn bleached hair pink. For that i love it. I wash my hair every other day and i redye every week and a half to every 2 weeks. The color fades from a dark red/pink to a very light pink/orange color.</li>
    <li> If you have red hair, this conditioner is awesome. I have maroon highlights on dark hair and it keeps me vibrant for months. It comes out looking like blood and it really does the job, but doesn&#x27;t stain anything. I use in combination with Watercolors shampoos.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was cracked and broken.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t bought this product from THIS seller. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for almost 6 months and it is unbelievable. From someone who dyes her hair a lot I can tell you no shampoo or conditioner has worked like this for hair dye or even my red hair before. It will keep the same dye color for a month or two at least which is near impossible for red. I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep the red color. It&#x27;s well worth the price! Just make sure you&#x27;re ready to get it everywhere because it&#x27;s kind of like hair dye itself. It does wash out of towels and clothes in one shot but your bathroom grout may not be so lucky after an extended use. :/</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair is usually dyed some shade of red and I have used it twice now both times the color has lasted about a week each as I try to wash my hair every other day. I do leave it in longer then it says probably about 15-20 minutes long. I attached a before and after picture. This will probably keep me out of the salon for several more weeks</li>
    <li> Definitely helps fading red hair. I applied it in the shower before I shampood. I have chest length hair and 5 pumps did it for me. Be careful applying and rinsing. Be slow with it or it will get all over the tub. It did stain my grout, but bleach can take care of that no problem. It says to use gloves but I didn&#x27;t and it didn&#x27;t stain my hands. Someone here said the conditioner comes out pink. They must be color blind because mine was a deep purple red just like the package says. My hair is now redder then when I had originally dyed it! This is definitely a once a week use product. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This conditioner saved my red color job for months- yes, months. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. It really works!</li>
    <li> Works well, just follow the directions and wear gloves!</li>
    <li> Prepare for RED or PINk hair. This stuff is STRONG. Use sparingly. Mix with conditioner to tone down the pink. prepare to wash your hands immediately after application bc it will stain. Also, if you have a porous tub or shower tile, it can stain. Keep bleach and a rag on hang to rinse your tub immediately after rinsing out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES THE JOB! and fades beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> I used it when I used to dye my hair red, and it did bring a wonderful color to my hair. But most importantly, this is by far the best conditioner I ever used. My hair gets very dry when dyed, and it was so soft and shiny after rinsing this out. To be fair, I did use a lot at a time (several pumps) and left it in over 5min. Only downside, it will stain your fingers and shower quite a bit, so you need to rinse very thoroughly. But I am definitely buying the brown one now that I am back to my natural hair color!</li>
    <li> I have bright red/magenta hair (my natural color is about a 2N) that I used to dye almost every three weeks with L&#x27;Oreal Hi-Color in magenta and red (I&#x27;d mix the two). I can tell you right now that this conditioner is not only superior to every other conditioner for redheads for it&#x27;s color depositing but the ingredients are unbelievable! This stuff has argan and macadamia oil for moisturizing as well as panthenol for frizz/breakage/static things like that, and as with almost all Evo products, it&#x27;s got UVA/UVB protection which is crucial for redheads. I really can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair it&#x27;s very silky and soft and it looks healthy. The packaging says to apply for only 3 minutes and with any conditioner it&#x27;s important to follow directions exactly to prevent over-conditioning and breakage but for full coverage it&#x27;s best to apply it, comb it through and leave it on for upwards to 25 minutes for full maximum deposit, condition and shine.&lt;br /&gt;All this and I didn&#x27;t even talk about the fragrance. It&#x27;s wonderful, it&#x27;s reminiscent of other Evo products which smell very clean, but not like other brands that smell too shampooey or conditioney. It&#x27;s definitely a fragrance of it&#x27;s own that is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also recommend this to someone that wants a slight red/magenta tint to their hair as pastels are in now, and anyone who is a bright red auburn to as red as the packaging on the bottle. This stuff did not let me down. If you are a fake redhead, you NEED this product.</li>
    <li> I love the vibrant color and the smell. It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. Since I have long Hair, I need to use more than the recommended amount of pumps. I doesn&#x27;t cover my greys but it does boost the color of my hair. It has a slight purple tint on it that I like. It can stain your skin so be careful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I mix it with my own deep conditioner (to make it last a bit longer) but it works well on its own also. I have only colored my hair twice in the past 6 months, which is a miracle if you have red (or violet-red) hair! It definitely keeps my color looking fresh and the only way you can tell that my hair isn&#x27;t freshly dyed is my visible roots. I have had red hair many times in the past and always give up after a couple months because the constant coloring/refreshening is a royal pain. I use this in combination with a color depositing shampoo (mixed with sulfate free shampoo) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This product is a must-have for those wishing to prolong a salon color service.</li>
    <li> Its been 4 months since I got ruby pink balayage. With Evo Fabuloso, my colors are still intense and gorgeous! The colors are however more red pink than purple pink. Most people&#x27;s colors fade within weeks so Im a true fan of this product. It is also very moisturizing (even compare to some of the other conditioners I use) but like other users say, it does stain your white tiles and shower curtain. Be sure to bleach them (there is really no other way).    Tips: wash your hair with cold water, dont wash everyday, pet dry your hair thoroughly so its not dripping.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to have her hairdresser color her hair with pinkish red highlights. She recommended this conditioner and it is fabulous.  Its more of a conditioner/color.  It will stain the tub, but bleach gets it right off.</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair many shades of red oover the last 11 years and if you&#x27;re a red head as well, you know that it is the fastest fading hair color to rock. This product is amazing! It may not refresh your hair to the shade you originally colored exactly, but it will give it a bright red tone to it when you need it refreshed. I have recommended it to a friend and would continue to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.  If you have gray, you&#x27;ll still have to put a permanent color over your roots and then I wash that out and put this over the roots.  It&#x27;s super vibrant and pretty.  More red than purple, but I love and get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this conditioner, it keeps her red hair vibrant and beautiful in between coloring! And the price on Amazon is so much better than the salon price.</li>
    <li> After dying my hair a deep purple red, the stylist suggested Fabuloso and that I could buy it from her salon. Welllll, I did not because I thought to myself &amp;#34;Self, how much could it really fad out?!!&amp;#34; And the answer is A LOT!! I searched online and found it! Ordered, arrived, shampooed and then conditioned with Fabuloso. I was reading the bottle while I waited the 3 minutes. &amp;#34;Hey dull red... hair has the intensity of a pile of autumn leaves&amp;#34; Why yes mine did!!... DID being the operative word. The conditioner brought the color and richness back into my hair. It&#x27;s rather expensive so I only use it maybe every other wash and mix it with my color shield conditioner to help make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. YES, do wear gloves! Red will get under your nails.&lt;br /&gt;2. NOT necessary to completely towel dry hair, I just made sure it was not dripping as I stayed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;3. Red will run down the drain, waiting till it runs clear you will be there allll day and night. Just make sure its not enough to stain your hands or clothes and be out.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply to the ends of your hair first, then twist it up on the head (if you have long hair) to keep the red off your back and to help distribute the color closer to your roots.&lt;br /&gt;5. Will STAIN your SCALP for a DAY or two if you apply it directly to the roots! See tip 4 and apply to ends first.</li>
    <li> I think it would be great for red heads but as it said red-purple, I thought I could use it with my purple dye...No such luck. Nonetheless, I do like that it is helping maintain my color somewhat.</li>
    <li> The way it tones hair is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The color deposit is rich and pigmented but still conditions and rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend. Wear gloves in the shower!</li>
    <li> I have a very warm red color in my hair which fades drastically within 2 weeks after I visit the salon. I applied this morning in the shower and let sit for the 3 recommend  minutes to check results. Good lord, this attached to my hair immediately. Reviving my hair to the advertised red/purple which it promises. This project delivers what is promised. However, for me, it was an intense red/purple (almost bright pink) so I rewashed and conditioned with my usual products. The color washed down to a lovely toned but still vibrant color. Worth the price to get an immediate boost!</li>
    <li> I am a natural red head and have tried many color depositing shampoos/conditioners in hopes of brightening my hair back to how it was when I was younger.  If I use this product as the directions say, it is very un-natural looking in my naturally red hair.  It was pink/maroon and I had to shampoo a few times in order to lose the pink!  I have since discovered that is works perfectly if I shampoo as normal, and then mix one squirt of Evo Fabuloso and two squirts of regular conditioner in to my hand and condition my hair like I normally would.  It has really restored my fading with age natural red hair to a nice bright and natural looking color!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have dark brown hair that is seriously processed between highlighting, coloring, and waving it. I dye it 6VV, which has a brilliant red purple color at first, but fades to an awful pinkish copper-gold color after about 2 weeks, esp on my highlights. This product has saved my hair! It brings it back to the original color and has helped prolong the time between coloring. It will however wash out at the next shampoo, so I try to only wash 2-3 weeks at most, using a cleansing conditioner one of those times. Yes, it can be messy but I haven&#x27;t found it to permanently stain anything yet. Downside is the price - wish it was less expensive or came in a bigger bottle, but I will continue to buy because it is worth every cent!</li>
    <li> yay brought my color back to life.</li>
    <li> I really really like this product it works great, but my god when I first bought this product which was only less than a month ago I bought it for $17.85.  The price increased almost 50%. That is f-ing ridiculous. It might be time for me to look for something similar.</li>
    <li> I love it! After doing a lot of research I decided to get this when dyeing my hair red for the first time. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but really does the job. My hair comes out really nice every time! I get a kick out of the sassy packaging. The only downside, as others have said, is that it stains your hands, but with multiple hand-washing sessions it comes off by the next day.</li>
