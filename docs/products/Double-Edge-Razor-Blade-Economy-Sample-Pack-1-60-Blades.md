      <li>While these may not be the best blades or sampler on the market, they hit my the price point</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great combination!</li>
      <li>Astra&#x27;s were the best for my face, I got some feathers on the way to see if they will also work.</li>
      <li>I like the bic blades the best out of this pack, instead of lord blades</li>
      <li>so I know which combination works best.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t know which blades would work best with my face/skin.</li>
      <li>The Astra brand worked best for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best - would buy either as preferred blades.</li>
      <li>I found my perfect blade.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In rating any blade, one must consider the conditions of the shave. This rating is based on my face, a natural Caucasian brunette, thick hair distribution with medium hair size. Faces with less distribution, different hair type, or thicker/thinner hair size, or different razors, may very well experience differing results.&lt;br /&gt; I use a Gillette “Tec” most of the time, and occasionally a Gillette “New”, and on special occasions where I need a closer shave I use my old Schick Krona, (which I have used for at least 3 decades). For my technique; I hold the razors lightly, (do not press down), and move in straight strokes. I use Arko shaving stick (face applied), and whip with a shaving brush, (as this product is designed), which has worked great for years.&lt;br /&gt; I suspect, some of the blades, preforming poorly on myself, may produce better results on those who experience lots of irritation, bumps or frequent cuts. After all, these blade companies are keeping in business. Additionally, the opposite may also be true, in that Blades doing well with myself may not do well on some people.&lt;br /&gt;  These are my results:&lt;br /&gt;Sharp Durablade  C  (2- 3 shaves per blade) Irritation-Medium&lt;br /&gt;7AM  C  (2 - 3 shaves per blade) Irritation-Medium&lt;br /&gt;Derby  C  (2 - 3 shaves per blade) Irritation-Low&lt;br /&gt;Dorco 300  C  (2 to 3 shaves per blade) Irritation-Medium&lt;br /&gt;Lord  B  (3 shaves per blade) Irritation-Medium&lt;br /&gt;Shark  B  (3-4 shaves per blade) Irritation-Low&lt;br /&gt;Astra  B  (3-4 shaves per blade) Irritation-Medium&lt;br /&gt;Dorco 301  B  (3-4 shaves per blade) Irritation-Low&lt;br /&gt;BiC  F  (Lucky to get one shave per blade) Irritation-High</li>
    <li> This is a great sample pack for a newbie to safety razor shaving.  It gives me the opportunity to find the right razors for me without spending a fortune.</li>
    <li> I was new to wet shaving and all my research pointed to selecting a sampler of blades before committing to one particular blade. I used these blades with a Merkur 180 and settled on the Astra Premium Platinum as my favorite. I used 2-3 blades from each pack before moving on to the next. I have saved some to come back to after I have a little more experience shaving with a DE razor. There is a nice variety here and I would recommend this pack over one that gives you one or two blades of each type. You need to try a couple blades from each manufacturer. I had one bad blade from a pack that seemed to give me nicks on my first shave. I switched the blade and continued my shave and no more weepers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to be able to get a variety pack like this to sample the different blades available. Price is competitive and blades are all good quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast with a wide variety of blades. Definitely worth the money if you are a first time safety razor user.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a sample set of razors, then this is exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received enough blades for a year quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much would a year&#x27;s worth of gillette&#x27;s cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the shave would not be as luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this item</li>
    <li> I enjoyed testing the different brands of razor blade out. I like the Bics and the Astras the best so far, although this could be due to better shaving technique on my part. I would definitely recommend the package to anyone wishing to test the waters before buying a bigger package of one brand, which tend to be quite cost effective.</li>
    <li> Plenty of choices to figure out which are best for my skin.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I got this variety pack with my first razor and I&#x27;m glad I did. Not all blades are equal so it&#x27;s important to try different ones. And the price for this pack is great. At just under $0.30 a blade, you can afford to find your preferred brand before committing to a 100 pack.     So far I&#x27;m liking the Lord blades, but I still have to work my way through all of them. It&#x27;s kind of fun trying a new brand every week.</li>
    <li> I received this package in a very timely manner from amazon. I was excited to use the blade sampler pack, choosing this one over all the others on amazon because of the price for 60 blades (had found a pack of 45 better-known brands for the same price). I opened the package and was saddened after realizing that there were only 45 blades in this supposed 60-pack. I gave this product two stars because I think it is utterly disappointing to order a certain product for a certain price and then only receive 75% of the product. Two stars given for the quick time service. If you don&#x27;t care how many razors you get, order this pack. If you do care, order another or the 45-pack for the same price with nicer brands.</li>
    <li> I really liked the astras, sharks, and bic platinum blades.    They even sent me a sample of white tea shave cream, that stuff is great!</li>
    <li> this is good for those who want to sample whats out there other than the zero you find in walmart. I liked the idea of blades from all over the world - sorry to say none from good old USA! hope you find something you like- I did.</li>
    <li> This pack is a great way to see which razors you like. I gave a buddy of mine one of each and we have been comparing our own thoughts on which ones we like.  It is funny how different each one can be and how different our thoughts on each one were.  He is set on buying a 100 count pack of the big bens and I am still unsure.</li>
    <li> I received a Ziplock bag of five and ten packs of a variety of razors, including most of the brands represented in the product images.  It&#x27;s a great way to find your preferred brand.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t sampled the field of razor blades for your Doubled Edged beard crusher why not get this product? It has a little bit of everything to cheap razor blades to pricey ones. On a odd note my plastic bag smelled like some one rubbed a turd on the outside, but inside was nice and fresh. Don&#x27;t know maybe it crossed paths with a turd in transit. Anyway..buy it you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this sampler about two months ago and have thusly used every single blade in the pack at least twice. My sample pack came with the following: Lord, Sharp, Astra, Dorco, Shark, Big Ben, Bic, 7 Am, and Derby. So far, all the blades are good in their own right, but I have sorted out my favorites of the pack. Lord and Big Ben are the best razors in my opinion. A great razor for every day purposes. They aren&#x27;t so sharp that they cut your face up but just sharp enough to give you a smooth face for your woman. Astras are also very excellent, again in the same pool as Lord and Big Ben. 7 AM and Derbys are the most forgiving blades, great for beginners or if you are short on time. The last blades I (surprisingly) enjoyed were the Bics. For the crappy disposables they make, their chrome super blades are actually quite nice. As for Sharps, Dorcos, and Sharks, these blades are super sharp and should be handled by grizzled veterans. The Sharks are especially aggressive, and you should take a few extra minutes if you&#x27;re going to use these guys. The only thing I am upset about with this pack is that they sent me 20 Dorco blades, which I could have done without. Luckily, my buddy adores them and traded me a few Merkur Super&#x27;s for them. All in all, I would highly recommend this sampler pack for beginners all the way to razor geniuses. For 17 bucks, it rounds out to about .30 cents a blade so you really can&#x27;t go wrong. Comparatively, an 8 pack of Mach Fusion blades will run you about 35.00 dollars, or about 4.40 per blade. You&#x27;re going to save money, and you might find the razor that you will fall in love with and continue to use forever. I intend on ordering a different sample pack next year, when I run out of blades finally.</li>
    <li> The blades were good enough for me and cheap enough at about .25 cents each to be able to try out 9 different brands.  Planning on making a note of the top 3 that worked best for me and trying their other sample packs.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to try out the different blades to find the one that worked for me, I went with the Astra blades, great for my beard and skin but you might like something different.  Not going to say anything negative about the other blades because everybody&#x27;s beard is different.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades along with a double edged safety razor as a Christmas gift for my man. He has mentioned his appreciation of this gift several times. He has enjoyed trying the different blades and says there is a recognizable difference between the different blades. \\&quot;I have a new favorite blade\\&quot; is what he said the last time he shaved.</li>
    <li> As a new double edge safety razor user, I had no idea what blades to get. After looking around online, this sample pack seemed to offer the most of what I was looking for. The samples I got contained some good blades, and some blades weren&#x27;t quite as good. I know not all the sample packs are exactly the same, but here&#x27;s what I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Bic Chrome Platinum: Decent blades. Not the best, but also not the worst in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 7a.m. Platinum: Again, nothing special. A little more irriation with these.&lt;br /&gt;- 10 Dorco Platinum: These were good blades. Smooth shave and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Big Ben Super Stainless: Just like the Bics and 7 a.m.&#x27;s. Nothing spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Derby Extra: Bad blades. I was originally going to buy 50 of these prior to buying a sample pack. Glad I didn&#x27;t. Lots of nicks and cuts. Neck irritation as well.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Astra Superior Stainless: Some irriation and bleeding. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Astra Superior Platinum: Same as the Superior Stainless. Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in quality.&lt;br /&gt;- 10 Dorco Platinum: Appear to be the same blades at the Dorco&#x27;s above, but in different packaging. One pack is ST-300 and the other is ST-301. Shave quailty was the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Sharp Stainless: These were also bad blades, just like the Derby&#x27;s. Irriation, bleeding, no good.&lt;br /&gt;- Shark Super Chrome: My favorite blades in the pack. These guys offered the smoothest, easiest shave. No irritation, no bleeding! Will probably buy a bunch of these when I finish up with this sample pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this sample pack. As a newbie to wet shaving, I had no idea what to buy in terms of blades. This sample pack introduced me to a lot of different brands and blades. Recommended for any new shavers.</li>
    <li> This pack was my first blade purchase with my new safety razor. I was very pleased with my purchase, as I used these blades for a few months before deciding on which brand I liked best. I think in the end it helped me save money because if I would have just bought a hundred pack of whatever was cheapest I probably would not have liked them and ended up spending money again anyway. The problem is every single type of blade from every company shaves just a bit different. You have to find one you like. I recommend any DE shaving newbie get a pack like this to start.</li>
    <li> Being a noob in the DE safety razor game, I figured I would try out a few brands to see which I like the best. I know now that this will take a while since they last forever. Great price for a long time supply of blades</li>
    <li> This is a great selection of blades... To be honest, I can&#x27;t really tell much difference between any of them - they all do the job nicely.  Some of the packs don&#x27;t have that handy disposal slot built in, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use each blade (using a Merkur Long-Handle) for more than the recommended 5 shaves each.  In fact I feel that the blade gives me the best results after the 3rd or 4th shave compared to when they are brand new as the slightly dulled blade allows me to press down a bit harder to get closer to the root of the hairs without cutting my face off in the process.  I usually replace the blade after about 10-15 shaves or whenever it requires me to exceed my morning 3 step lather/shave ritual 1) with grain 2) against grain 3) touch-up.  Baby smooth every time!</li>
    <li> This really is a great sampler pack for DE shavers looking to experiment with other blades.  After using mostly Derbys and walmart wilkinsons since I started DE shaving, I figured it would be nice to expand my horizons with a sampler pack.  My typical routine involves a 3 pass shave (WTG, XTG, ATG) so my ideal blade would be one with a decent shelf life and one not too sharp.  So far, the only blade I have any real opinions on are the Astras.  Many razor blades have a dot of glue on them somewhere in order to keep the wax paper on.  The Astras, however, have 4.  While this doesnt bother me aesthetically, it is sometimes dangerously close to the blade itself.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy those again.  In the end, I&#x27;ve enjoyed sampling around with other blades, but in all honesty it looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to my old trusty Derbys once I&#x27;m finished with these.    Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> I ventured into the world of double edged shaving with a safety razor around a two months ago, and I&#x27;m NEVER EVER going back to shaving with clippers, foil/rotary razors, and multi-blade cartridge systems.    I purchased this to test which blades work for me, so, I would highly recommend that before buying a lot of 100 or 200 of one blade that may work for some but may not work for others.  Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different blades.     I gave this only 4 stars because the seller cannot guarantee that all of the blade packs you see on the picture description will be the actual blades you receive.  Other than that, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This starter pack of blades is just what a beginner like me needs. It has a large assortment of blade brand so one can figure out which one&#x27;s they like the best. Would recommend to anyone trying to find their \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of double edged razors.</li>
    <li> Since this is an economy pack, don&#x27;t expect all top-shelf blades in this pack.  This is a good sampler if you are trying to discover if your hair is compatible with some of the more affordable blades which are available.  If you are one of the lucky ones who can use these blades, you can save a whole lot of money over cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice assortment of blades for a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve not used ALL the blades in the assortment, but the ones I&#x27;ve used are fine. Nice way to sample.</li>
    <li> Good to find out what you like if you are entering the world of safety razor shaving. I thought there were a few stinkers in the package...but that&#x27;s just how they work with my razor and/or face. If you don&#x27;t like one, toss it and get another brand. This is how I settled on Shark as my everyday blade.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Company made only one substitution so I&#x27;m completely fine with that. It was the Trig for the Lord. Yes they do come in a baggie - but they are small packs so better that than loose in the box - plus I can reuse the baggie. See my photo for picture of blades. Dorco Platinum ST-301 10 count; Trig Silver Edge 10 count; Dorco Platinum ST-300 10 count; Sharp Stainless 5 count; Shark Super Chrome 5 count; BIC Chrome Platinum 5 count; Derby Extra 5 count; Astra Superior Platinum 5 count; 7a.m. Platinum 5 count</li>
    <li> Good sample with smattering of options to determine which blades work best since we are recent converts to safety razors. Package cheap enough that I didn&#x27;t care about tossing the blades that were no good. Recommend trying a sample package before investing in 100 blades of a single brand. For my beard (fairly thick and fast growing) as well as wife shaving her legs, we agreed on the rankings of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best - would buy either as preferred blades. Sharp, blades lasted well, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;7 am Platinum High Stainless Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (favorite blade for both of us, we use these now)&lt;br /&gt;Lord Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair - adequate, fair sharpness, would do the job but clearly not as good as best (in no particular order)&lt;br /&gt;Sharp Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Derby Extra Super Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible - One or two drags across skin and threw them all away. Frankly garbage and was SHOCKED how bad they were compared to the rest. Absolutely painful to use.&lt;br /&gt;Dorco ST300 Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Dorco ST301 Platinum Extra Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Bic Chrome Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades</li>
    <li> I got my husband and 21 year old son set up last Christmas with safety razor shaving after reading up on it on Amazon. My husband hated shaving and tried all different types of shavers in the past. My son now loves wet shaving and has adapted well but my husband still cuts the heck of himself.  I had bought them both Shark blades but after reading on here that Sharks are not for the novice, thought a variety pack would be a wise choice at restocking time.  Hopefully, he can find a blade suitable to his skin type.    Received package today.  Is as pictures with the exception that I also received a five pack of Treet blades for a total of 65 blades.  The Lord blades shown are Big Ben but are made by Lord.  I assume Lord makes different varieties??    Satisfied with purchase. Cannot report on blades.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to try different blades. I tried most of the blades in a couple razors using different techniques. I took notes so I know which combination works best.</li>
    <li> The sampler pack arrived as expected. On time &amp; proper product. While these may not be the best blades or sampler on the market, they hit my the price point I was looking to spend (had a gift card). Nice option to try some different blades.</li>
    <li> The only way to determine which shaving blades work best for you before you commit to any specific brand. Not only that, but you get almost a year&#x27;s supply!  I shave 3 days using the first edge and the next 3 using the 2nd edge.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this combo for value and variety!</li>
    <li> Anyone who is new to the safety razor should start with one of these sample packs. There is a big difference between the many brands and I have found only a few that work great for me. My wife on the other hand has found different brands work better for her....you just have to try  several and find what brand is the best for you (trust me....there is more to a blade than you think).</li>
    <li> Blade pack is as seen in the picture. Blades arrived in a ziploc bag inside a plain box. I have no problem with that for an economy pack of DE blades. I purchased them not too long ago, so thus far I&#x27;ve only used the Derby blades. I like them, they are sharp and cut much better than the Merkur blades I was using before. The price is fair for a sample pack.</li>
    <li> As a newbie i was told to buy a variety pack - so i went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the same blade brands as seen in the picture (Derby, Astra, Bic, Shark, Lord, 7 AM, and Donco)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and there were 60 blades as described - Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the Shark blades so far but really like them, however my face isn&#x27;t too sensitive and may not be very picky - but i like the options and the price seems very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment, at a great price.</li>
    <li> Good selection of razors. A lot easier to figure out which brand I really want to stock up on</li>
    <li> seems like a good assortment of razors</li>
    <li> Lots of blades in this pack, doubt I&#x27;ll need any more for quite a while! Kind of wishing I had just bought a bunch of merkur blades but oh well.</li>
    <li> My husband has found that there is a wide variety of differences in quality of blades in this sampler.  In his opinion, and in mine, too, it&#x27;s worth getting a more expensive sampler like he has in the past.  We wanted to see if money really equals quality, and for razor blades, it seems the answer is yes.  Some of these blades dull with just one use, while the higher quality ones he&#x27;s used in the past would offer up to 4 good quality, nick-free close shaves.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product is good for trying out different razors and finding the right one for you.  The Astra brand worked best for me.</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time as advertised. Plenty of brands to sample and the price is great. Not only will these blades last me for months but i will now know which brands I like and those that I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working my way through these alphabetically by name, tracking how many shaves I get with each.  I&#x27;m up to BIC, which gives about 7.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and received them very quickly after order. Not sure which one will be the best for my skin type and hair type. Just have to try each one at a time.</li>
    <li> mine came with sharp, shark, bic, astra, 7am, dorco x 2 and lord. its a good mix but i was hoping to get another set of blades instead of 2 types of dorco. the shipping was very fast.  it is a great way to find the blade to fit your face. great price too as some of these blades are a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> great deal on an assortment of blades Exactly as explained and precisely what I was looking for. A great place to start for the new DE razor</li>
    <li> Guys if you are new to DE shaving, buy a sample pack of blades and try them out before giving up and going back to cartridge razors.  There is not a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; option in DE shaving.  Your success will come from finding the blade that works for you.  Also I recommend getting the Feather Double Edge Razor.  As of June 2014 it&#x27;s around 14 bucks.  It&#x27;s part plastic, so it&#x27;s not gonna looks as cool as some of the all metal DE razors, but I and many others have found it to be as easy to use as a cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a classic razor and this is a great deal. It was a good investment by buying them in bulk because now i dont have to worry about buying razors for a long time. What made me buy them was imagining how much I&#x27;d save in a year compared to buying gillette blades. $$$</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re using a Merkur style razor, and this is your fist time, or you&#x27;re looking for different blades, then get this pack.  Not all blades are created the same.  I used one and I was eh!  I used another one and it was like the holy grail!  I found my perfect blade.  I am going to use all of them to see if there are any better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a funny world: go to a local store, and you find DE razor blades for around $6.00 for 10 blades. About $.60/blade. But on the web, you can find bulk packs of 100 blades for around $20 including shipping--about $.20/blade. The problem is: What if you don&#x27;t like the blades? You don&#x27;t want to be stuck with 90 blades you don&#x27;t want to use...    That&#x27;s where the sampler packs come in. A whole selection of blades that you can test, enjoy, or look at in contempt at a significantly lower price than $.60/blade. Better still, only one of the blades I&#x27;ve tried so far has been on par or worse than the locally acquired blades I&#x27;ve used.    Are they a little more expensive than just picking up bulk blades? Sure, the packs still have to be assembled. But at this point, I am able to make knowledgeable decisions about what I want to order based on the most accurate litmus I have: how effective the blade is when it&#x27;s placed against my face. I don&#x27;t have to rely on reviews and hope that the reviewer has the same type of skin/beard combination that I do.    This vendor delivered on time. They had to make a couple of substitutions (they mention this possibility up front), but both of the substitutions would be considered upgrades in shaving circles. I have no complaints.    I would definitely go with this company again.</li>
    <li> I am glad I tried this product with all the various blades. I have found they come from similar batches and perform as such. I do like the shark and the sharp. I did not care for any other brand. I&#x27;ve tried several from each container and they weren&#x27;t efficient razors.  Meaning those made nics often. True I was returning  to  the wet shave however I&#x27;ve tried each of these blades several times in past 5 months and still have found the Sharp and the Shark are the only ones suitable for my face.</li>
    <li> Okay so I am new to wet shaving which is the main reason I purchased this pack.  I have tried thus far and will rate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trig: 3/5 the first one I tried... realized I need a lot practice, but the blade did go dull rather quickly I will hang on to them because I am guaranteed at least one good shave&lt;br /&gt;Dorco ST 301: 0/5  Horrible! Cut me up real bad, blade went dull during the first shave, and I would rate my beard as thin not thick. Going in the trash if I can&#x27;t sell them&lt;br /&gt;Shark: 3/5 This blade on the first go cut me up pretty good but I chalked that up to technique... the second go around I received a much better shave but was left with some razor burn, I honestly believe this blade is for thicker beards.  I will hand on to them however because I am sure if I let my beard grow out this blade could then handle the job... but for my daily routine this blade is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;7 AM:  4/5 I know this blade gets some bad rep but thus far this blade is by far the best that I have tried. I highly recommend this blade to people who have a thin beard that grows in different directions such as mine.  So far this is my blade&lt;br /&gt;Sharp: as of right now this is a 5/5 best blade I have tried thus far! Absolutely no cuts or knicks, and NO RAZOR BURN.  This blade cut perfectly. I would highly recommend this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try and update my review as I try the other baldes that I received.</li>
    <li> Try this to find your brand. Found the Astra and now I&#x27;m getting my best shave ever at a fraction of what the TV stooges advertise.</li>
    <li> I have had a great experience getting acquainted with the different blades although some (Treet) didn&#x27;t work as well for me as others (Bic, Shark).</li>
    <li> This is a good pack of blades. i have very sensitive skin, so trying different blades like this can tell you if you are having issues because of your blade or your technique. In my case it was my technique because all of the blades gave me a razor rash on my neck. I like the bic blades the best out of this pack, instead of lord blades I got Trig blades which are still pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing each one of the blades, not just the pack as a whole. Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s face is different, so your experiences with these blades will be different than mine. I encourage you to buy this or any other multi-pack to find the right blade for you.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pack 9 months ago. Each time I used a blade, it was with the same shaving cream to give each one a fair shot. Below are my findings.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin with coarse hairs. I shave around a goatee and medium sized side burns. I have one rough patch on my face prone to nicks that I will refer to. I do not get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, so I would only have to shave every three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark Super Chrome: The Sharks were a good overall blade. The are among the most comfortable in the pack. When using them, it almost felt like I wasn&#x27;t shaving. That said, it was not a close shave. My stubble felt more pronounced when down and hairs longer when it was time to shave again. The tricky spot on my face would get nicked almost every time. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 since it was one of the more comfortable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby Extra Super Stainless: I have to admit that I was excited about these after previous reviews I had read before buying the pack. I was let down. There was very little comfort in using these. The shave itself was not very close. I only used them twice before I threw the last one away. Why was there only one left after two attempts? Each time I used one, it would only last for half of my face before it felt like my hairs were being ripped out of my flesh rather than being cut away. Two blades for one shaving session. The trouble spot on my face was bleeding every time. My wife bought an extra pack because she saw a deal on a website after seeing them on the vanity (she is very thoughtful). So I will sell those at a garage sale. 2 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 am Platinum High Stainless: These are the middle of the road. I have no complaints about them. But Ican not think of any accolades other than they did their job. I got nicked as little as I did with the Sharks, but the comfort was not there. The shave was not that close. But I was also not pulling hairs out. 3 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Platinum: These were the cream of the crop. When I shave with these (I am using present tense because I bought 100 after the multi-pack ran out) it does not feel like I am shaving with an actual blade. That is how comfortable they are on my skin. Nicks are very uncommon, even in the rough spot. One blade will last the whole face, which has become a bonus to me.The shave is close, not the closest shave, but close enough to where I want it. 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorco ST300 Platinum and Dorco ST301 Platinum Extra: If I had not pulled these out of separate containers, I would not have known they were different blades. I only shaved twice with each one. All four times was the same experience. My face would be nicked in multiple areas, my skin would be on fire and I would have thick stubble the next day. I was very disappointed in this because these two account for 20 blades in this set. 1 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bic Chrome Platinum: It took four blades to make it through one shave session on my face. The blades would dull so quickly. I am pretty sure this is the same cheap metal they use on the disposable shavers. My face stung for two hours following the shave (I also used the same amount of the same after shave balm to be fair to the rest of the blades). 0 out of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp Stainless: These are the sharpest blades out of the bunch. I was VERY aware that I was scraping my face with a razor blade when shaving with these. If I nicked myself, it was usually my fault because I was not use to shaving with such a sharp blade. Closest shave out of the bunch, I would not feel stubble until a day and a half later. 3 out of 5 stars, but only because I felt like a novice using a professional&#x27;s blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord: The Lord blades were very comfortable. I would put these below the Astra and above the Shark for ranking. It provided a closer shave than the Astra, but I would also get nicked more ofter with them. Not bad nicks, but enough to drop it below the Astra. Very comfortable blades as well.&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this multi-pack taught me a lot about my face and about shaving with this type of blade. My top three favorites would be:Astra then Lord followed by Shark. I recommend any beginner who needs to find the right blade get this pack. The right blade for you might not be in here, but you will learn a lot.</li>
    <li> I received a single blade safety razor for Christmas. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the blades that came with it and upon the advice of many I purchased this trial pack. I am not completely through it but have found at least two different brands that seem to agree the most with my face.  I strongly recommend using this product to determine what works for you.</li>
    <li> I received this package as pictured plus 5 extra blades. Good price and the blades work well so far. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband because he was afraid to buy it himself. He absolutely loves it!!!!! He said he wishes he would&#x27;ve bought it sooner!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great sampler pack for anyone new to safety razors.  Great prices and quality is great.  Good Gift</li>
    <li> Like others who have reviewed this, I think it is a great deal for a good number and variety of blades to try out in determining &amp;#34;your brand&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Good product in general, the only issue is that i did not get a package of 7am blades. And I really wanted to try those.</li>
    <li> This is a great selection of blades at a reasonable price. The only blades I was able to find locally were at the grocery store and they were store brand, not bad but nothing special. It was nice to be able to pick up a combo pack up for DH instead of just one type in bulk, considering he might not like the type I picked. This will give him a chance to try out many kinds. Additionally he likes to switch between different products and experiment. Will update as he uses more of them.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set and they were delivered on time.  I have only tried one lord from egypt so far and it did a great job.</li>
    <li> Before I started DE wet shaving, I saw a lot of posts saying that there was no \\&quot;one perfect blade\\&quot; for every face. I have found this to be very true. I purchased this variety set to find the \\&quot;optimal\\&quot; blade for my face. I gave each blade 3 tries before deciding the one that works best for me. This set contains some upper and lower brands. It doesn&#x27;t contain the \\&quot;really expensive brands\\&quot; such as merkur or feather, but does have a good variety. I would think that 85-90% of guys should be able to find the proper blade from this assortment. I highly recommend trying a variety to find the correct blade instead of blindly purchasing a 100ct of something you have never used. Blade brands do shave differently. If I had made my decision to wet shave on just the blade that came with my razor, I would have given it up all together (Shark just isn&#x27;t my brand). After finding the right blade, wet shaving has been a pure pleasure!!!!!!!!!  4-stars for not including at least one premium brand such as merkur or feather.</li>
    <li> Great way to find out which brand of razor suits you best</li>
    <li> I have only tried two or three brands out of this variety pack but they all seem to work well. The original blade that came in my DE Merkur gave me pretty bad razor bumps(maybe I wasn&#x27;t used to using the razor, I think it was the blade though). But after switching to one of these blades I haven&#x27;t had many problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hold their edge really well. I don&#x27;t shave every day so I don&#x27;t go through them real quick, but generally I replace the blades because I know I&#x27;ve been using them for a while, not because I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the way they shave. However though, once I pop a new blade in I do notice that it&#x27;s a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these blades to anybody who likes to use  DE razor. And to anybody using a multi blade cartridge type razor. You should switch! These blades are about 30 cents a piece and last just as long as a 5 dollar cartridge. The initial investment is a little more since you have to buy these blades and a DE razor. Gonna be about 50 bucks. The one I got works very well so far and is found here: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VBISXU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_34</li>
    <li> A buddy and I split this pack to try out some new blades. I had already tried Derby and Feather blades. Derby&#x27;s were decent, Feathers were crazy sharp and started out great than started to irritate my face. My friend and I have very different beards, he has that course, thick, black hair that has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 2:00, and I&#x27;m more fair skinned with blonde hair that really only needs to shave every other day. Feathers tore him up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway we both got mutilated by the horrific shave of the Shark blades, and I think the Donco was pretty rough too. We both had great success with the Astra&#x27;s and they became the favorite of everything either of us had tried so far so we bought a 100 pack of those and split them, and will leave the rest of the variety pack on the shelf for if we decide to gamble again.</li>
    <li> Some blades are good, some not so good. Every man&#x27;s face is different, and as such a blade that works great for one may not be as effective on another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter kit for someone new to Dual Edge shaving and I highly recommend it. Some of the razor blades gave me nicks and cuts, others shaved me effortlessly. You just have to try a whole bunch until you find the ones right for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great deal, I think it broke down to about $0.30 a blade. The ones I found gave me a good shave I used multiple times. This variety pack will last me a while and once I am done I will know what blades I will be getting next!</li>
    <li> Great way to figure out which lads work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid assortment of safety razor blades at a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why buy cartridges for razors which are both expensive and not environmentally friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply recycle.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get.  I wanted to know what razor to buy in 100 packs.  What one works best with my face &amp; shaver, time the blade stays honed, etc.  In this pack there are 6 brands that have 100 blades for under 10$.  So far I like the Derby.  If people call you Sasquach and you burn through blades like a blackjack dealer, then this is the perfect variety pack.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sample pack for my husband nearly a year ago so that he could decide which razors he liked best for his safety razor. I have to say that this pack has lasted a remarkably long time since he still has not used them all (he is in the military and has to shave daily). Some of the razors are good while others are just &#x27;useable&#x27;. Since each person has different opinions and needs to suit his or her skin type, this sample pack is a fantastic way to figure out personal preference.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Nice variety pack of double edge razor blades for those looking to find the right blade for their safety razor. Husband was able to find a few blades he liked so he could order more.</li>
    <li> Switching to a Safety razor was one of the smartest things I&#x27;ve done. Saves money and a better shave.</li>
    <li> Wish this one had Feather in it.</li>
    <li> I have now tried all of the brands included in the version that I received (it seems that there is some variation in what gets shipped each time) at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back, I was kind of mad that there are really only two that I liked–the Dorco T-301&#x27;s (not the T-300&#x27;s, that extra 1 makes a difference for some reason) and the Derby&#x27;s–but then I realized that it was probably a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only thanks to the crappy ones that I figured out what makes a good blade and that some actually are better than others.  The good ones don&#x27;t scrape, they nick less and they provide a close shave probably more than twice as long as the really bad ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be many here that you won&#x27;t like, but try them all at least once so that you&#x27;ll know which and why.</li>
    <li> I was in need of new razors and decided to give the \\&quot;variety pack\\&quot; a try. So far I have used the ASTRA brand (made in Russia) and it works great! I also got the Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood shaving cream and paired up with my Merkur it&#x27;s a great combination! Razors arrived within 3-5 days, in good condition; I got a total of 60 blades from 7-8 vendors. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This pack would have received 5 stars but there is no way I would give the BIC chrome a 5 star...Otherwise there are some great Astra and Merkur blades. - Combine that with the cost and you have VALUE! - Cartridge shaving is a crock! Blades are the BEST!</li>
    <li> I was a first time user to double edge razor blades, this was my first \\&quot;starter pack\\&quot;. I didnt know what was a good brand for double edge blades. This pack assisted me in deciding what i look for in my blades. As a woman using a reusable safety razor I enjoyed narrowing down the selection with this pack. So far my favorite is my razor brand which is Merkur.</li>
    <li> Great way to test out different blades for a good price. Still trying out the different blades but I&#x27;ve already found a brand that works well for me, never would have learned about these blades without the sample. However, the 4 stars comes in because I specifically wanted the Lord blades but they seem to have been swapped with Treet blades. Not the end of the world but now I have to order Lord blades  separately. Just be forewarned, the picture may not perfectly match your order.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me a Merkur razor for Christmas and I was not sure if I would like it or not.  All it took was a day and I was hooked.  I ordered this sampler to get some idea of the different blades that are out there and had no idea I would notice such a difference between the brands.  I&#x27;ll use one for a few days then try to &amp;#34;rate&amp;#34; the blades based on comparison with the previous.  I have then lined up in a drawer and I&#x27;ll place then in rank of how I like them.  Not too scientific but heck, shaving is boring enough as it is so at least this makes it a bit interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great way to play around and see what you like.</li>
    <li> Getting the sampler pack is the only way to go when trying out a variety of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until you settle-in on what you like, this is the most cost-effective way of exposing yourself to all of these brands.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades as I&#x27;m new to the world of Safety Razor shaving. I wanted to primarily reduce the shaving bumps I get from 4 or 5 blade razors and also save money while doing so, and these are definitely a way to do it! For a decent price you get a variety of blades to try out, and they all do definitely shave differently ... and at a cost that doesn&#x27;t make you feel bad if you use it once and then throw it away. If you use one blade a week, this pack will last more than 1 year! AWESOME for sure. I  have only tried a couple of the blades so far, and really enjoy them all. I think I actually got 75 blades in my pack, not just 60 like was being sold. I strongly recommend these and a safety razor if you are looking to save money and have fun doing it!</li>
    <li> Everyone should switch to this type of shaving as it is so cheap. I bought the stupid soap and it works and last and lasts...I am getting a weeks worth of shaving with these blades..some are better than others but if you go over (shave) twice it is very effective.</li>
    <li> This sample pack included a large assortment of blades. But it did not include all of the ones in the picture. The one that comes to mind that I really wanted to try were the Astra&#x27;s. There are many other good brands included, but I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews of the Astra&#x27;s I was really hoping they would be included in the pack as well. Either way it&#x27;s worth the money and I would highly advise it for anyone new to shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s face reacts differently to different blades.&lt;br /&gt;- Some blades in this pack are too sharp for my face and nick me occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;- Others aren&#x27;t sharp enough or wide enough so they don&#x27;t come close enough to my face on my Merkur 180 Safety razor and it takes more strokes to get the shave I want.&lt;br /&gt;- Other are absolutely amazing and shave me quick and clean giving my face an almost waxed appearance because of how close the shave and how healthy this method of shaving leaves my skin looking. Mostly the Derby&#x27;s at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried only half of the blades so far and that&#x27;s my experience. Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> This is a great sample pack.  Pretty much every major brand is represented here.&lt;br /&gt;I started using a DE razor about a year or so ago because I suck at sharpening my straight razors.&lt;br /&gt;So I use a DE when I send my straights out to get sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;None of these blades are as good as a nice, sharp straight razor, but they are a pretty close comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really enjoying the Astra blades.  I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but imagine I will not even try the BICs.&lt;br /&gt;If I come across a razor I really hate I will update.  I&#x27;ve already used Darbys, and enjoy them.  Will try the Feathers,&lt;br /&gt;and Sharps soon.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into using a DE safety razor, I highly recommend spending the money to get the variety pack. ...you never know what brand you&#x27;re going to like the best.</li>
    <li> My package (which is just a ziploc baggie with nine blade packages tossed in) contained three 10-packs and six 5-packs for a total of 60 blades, as advertised.  Brands were:  Bic, 7a.m., Dorco ST300, Dorco ST301, Treet, Durablade, Astra, Shark, and Derby.</li>
    <li> enough blades for a year and has something new to try every week  still haven&#x27;t tried all but so far the sharks my fav...</li>
    <li> Just getting back into DE use I had no idea what kinds of blades would work with my beard/skin so having access to lots of types has been nice.  I am finding that I will probably not use several of these blade types and will probably trade some with others.  The low-barrier cost to try a number of blades out is really nice.  Also found that some of these do not take hand stropping well, so that is good to know for those of us used to re-using blades more than a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought a pack of blades that only had one of each. Most of these blades I will never use, but it did allow me to find the ONE.</li>
    <li> For a variety pack, this is not bad. I have yet to complete sampling each. So far I have tried 4 and have mixed reviews. Some of the blades last 3 or 4 shaves, while others last a solid 2 weeks without a snag on my face. Still a savings over a Mach brand! Keep  DE shaving my friend</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving so I was not sure what kind of blades to try. This is a great variety pack to test several different brands. I actually can not tell much difference between brands, and have not found any that are poor quality.</li>
    <li> Great value. Haven&#x27;t decided which are my favorite blades. Would order again, even knowing brands may vary next order.</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive way to find out which blade suits your face the best. 20 months later and I&#x27;m still working on this pack. The Dorco and Astra I did not like, but they only cost me about a quarter each so its no big deal. The other seven in this pack ranged from great to good.</li>
    <li> Nice package, give you the opurtunity to try blades. If you change blades once a week this is more then a years supply of blades. Good deal</li>
    <li> Hubby wanted to see which blades he likes for his spiffy new razor.  He is pleased with this little starter pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Double-Edge shaver for a number of years, and up till now have always used the Merkur blades that my razor originally came with.  I tried some of the US-manufactured Persona blades when I ran out once, and cut my face to ribbons.  After reading up on Reddit&#x27;s Many Shaving board ([...]) about this packet of blades from around the world, I ordered a set.  The Derby (Turkish) and DORCO are my two favorites from the pack and I will be ordering more of them separately.  This is a great way for a DE shaver to evaluate new blades before investing in a lot of them.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this pack of blades because it was my first time with a double edge razor and I didn&#x27;t know which blades would work best with my face/skin. Packaging was odd, they just put the different packs of blades in a zip lock type bag.</li>
    <li> Got the blades within a week (used the super saver shipping). It&#x27;s my first sampler pack. I won&#x27;t comment on the blades,(since it will take me forever to use them and the reason I got the sampler pack is to find out what works with me and what doesn&#x27;t), other than I got Trig&#x27;s instead of Lord&#x27;s. Really not a big deal on this one as I was more interested in really all the other blades than the Lord&#x27;s, not sure why. Quick ship and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the blades out.</li>
    <li> Astra, Shark, and Derby are the really good ones you receive. Some of the other ones are okay, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Total of 10 different brands/blades - I am still to try some of them.</li>
    <li> There really is a big difference in blades. For example, the Bic and Sharp blades end up cutting me frequently, and the Shark blades don&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like. However, I fell in love with the Astra blades. Never once cut myself with them and it provided a smooth shave for me. Start with this and find what you like.</li>
    <li> Still testing the differences, but like them so far.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those who are new to safety razors and do not know what blades works best for them. From this sample pack I was able to find a brand that works best for me, and i did not have to order 100 pack of blades that I do not like and have them go to waste. It will take a while to go through all of them but so far this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I guess you get exactly what you see, so there really isnt much bad to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it had some of the most popular brands:  feather, bluebird, gillette, personna...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, quick shipping and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Gave me a chance to try many different blades at a great price - now I know which ones to get (and not get) for future reference.</li>
    <li> Best to worst&lt;br /&gt;1-Astra very smooth no irritation&lt;br /&gt;2-Lord smooth no irritation&lt;br /&gt;3-Sharp smooth no irritation&lt;br /&gt;4-Shark smooth but a little irritation around collar line&lt;br /&gt;5-Dorco Platnum fairly smooth&lt;br /&gt;6-Derby fairly smooth&lt;br /&gt;7-Dorco fairly smooth&lt;br /&gt;I threw away the Bic and 7am&#x27;s as they were garbage and felt like I was using a tweezer to shave</li>
    <li> My wife bought me my first double edges razor with this sample pack as well. For starters I won&#x27;t have to buy blades again for quite some time. When I do finally buy new blades, I know the brands that work best for me (I like the Astras and the Dorkos).</li>
    <li> Ordered for my boyfriend.  His feedback: Absolutely positively poor.  These razors couldn&#x27;t cut a tissue if you wanted them too.  I tried 4 different blades.  Thin and wobbly.  If I would guess, these are fakes.  I&#x27;ve had the derby&#x27;s before and they were no where near as thin and flexible as the sample pack I received.  Do not buy, go elsewhere.  I will be looking to send these back and get a refund.  I wasn&#x27;t even able to cut the papers that the blades were wrapped in they were that dull.  Oh and for shaving.. lol.... yeah, it did a remarkable job at removing the shaving cream from my face.  Don&#x27;t mind the fact that the hair was still well intact.</li>
    <li> Best sampler in my opinion. For me the Astra worked BEST. Derby was good too but for use only one time. I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet so I&#x27;ll update when I do. I basically stopped trying them out after I tried the Astra which is a great razor. Left me no razor burn and BB shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;Bic chrome platinum - was not too sharp although it did give me a nice clean shave but it seemed to take me twice as long but no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp- not too sharp and gave me razor burn. I won&#x27;t try that one again.&lt;br /&gt;Shark- sharp and nice shave. Did give me I little irritation.</li>
    <li> Fun way to try different blades.  My order came with two 10-packs of Dorco-301, no Dorco-300.  However, they are the same blade with different packaging, so, you get 20 Dorcos. Cost a star on that Amazon.  So far I have found I really like the Shark Chrome. Astra a little to harsh for me.</li>
    <li> Overall, a seemingly good intro to DE razor blades. Several reputable brands included. Worth the purchase to get a base level sense for what suited me best.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and a great way to try out different blades. I would recommend this especially to those are starting to use DE razors.</li>
    <li> There are a great deal many sample packs on Amazon, but this one strikes me as the best balance between variety and cost. There are five of each blades, so you can use each type for over a week to really see how well your skin and shave reacts to each blade. I do wish they included Gillette instead of the Derby though; many DE razors (such as mine) already include a packet of Derby blades.</li>
    <li> This was a great way for me to sample blades before settling on one (Derby).</li>
    <li> Astra&#x27;s were the best for my face, I got some feathers on the way to see if they will also work. Shipped fast and I&#x27;d say worth it just to see what would work for me.</li>
    <li> Everything came that was promised. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Just getting to use them they are very nice good quality</li>
    <li> I just got the blades in the mail and I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet! My only complaint is that Treet blades were in the sample pack instead of the Lord Platinums! I am actually glad though because a guy at the gym gave me 2 Lord platinums to try out and they were a bad shave and ripped up my face! So it worked out for the best in my sitaution!</li>
    <li> These cost quite a bit more than buying one brand in bulk, but they also cost less than buying disposable razors or cartridge replacements.  I&#x27;ve only used the Astras so far, but they are great.  This is my first DE razor blade purchase, so I wanted to see if I noticed much of a difference between the blades or if I had an obvious favorite among brands.  I&#x27;ll update this after trying several and then when I&#x27;ve finished all of them.</li>
    <li> Those razors are great...Because they are a variety, is easy to find out which are could be the favorite..I like them all..Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding a lot of differences in the different blades.  It&#x27;s a good way to start so you can find your favorite.</li>
    <li> 2 years later I&#x27;m still using this.</li>
    <li> I have to say the package I got so far has been less than stellar for my face.  I have the typical homer simpson face where I shave turn around and have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow again and I could do some rough sanding with how bristlely/coarse my beard is.  I am new to the double edged razor world and so I picked up the combo package of razors to find a brand I liked.  I shave 3-4 times a week and each blade I use 2-3 times to just get an idea of how each compares. My package contained: Dorco new platinum st-301 10 blades. tried 4 of them and the best I have tried so far. Treet classic 10 blades. UGH bad bad bad.  2nd one and the only thing it seems to cut is my face. Dorco new platinum st300 10 blades.  I did not like these nearly as much as the st-301.  I noticed that I had a lot more nicks and irritation. Sharp hi cromium durablade 10 blades. have not tried 7a.m. plus durablade 5 blades.  So, far this is one of the blades that caused the most irritation to my face.  The blade is very sharp and the first 2 times I shaved it was nicking me a lot, then I forgot to change it and tried a third time and it was dull and pulling the hair more.  Derby Extra 5 blades.  OUCH, this blade was not friendly to my skin. Shark super chrome unknown number of blades.  have not tried. Astra superior platinum 5 blades. have not tried. Bic chrome platinum 5 blades.  have not tried.  My comments might not match what others have experienced, but if you are thinking about buying a double edged razor, as I assume most of you are if you are reading this... here are some things to consider.  OUCH! Let me tell you it is different than shaving with a cartridge razor.  I used to shave in the shower with a little oil on my face and be done in 5 minutes with a smooth face and I would change my razor one every 1.5 months or so.  This process takes a LOT longer and is painful compared to cartridge razor shaving.  Admittedly I have been shaving with a cartridge razor for 30+ years now and a double edgedrazor for 30 days...  On the positive side, the razor has helped me to use my cartridge razor better.  I will shave with the double edge until I feel my face is getting raw then I will go over it with the cartridge and it has helped me to have a lighter touch and actually shave better.  Also, this process should be done with a mirror and I have not sat and actually stared at myself in the mirror for this long ever.  It has been somewhat cathartic to get to know myself in a new way.  Well, good luck on your journey!  Thank you for reading the whole post.  Also, I will update this post as I try out the other razors.</li>
    <li> This is a really good sample pack to get if you are just starting out with the double edge razor and aren&#x27;t sure whats good for you. Or if you know what your doing but just haven&#x27;t found that perfect blade.&lt;br /&gt;My husband got this pack for himself and he liked the Bic 5 and the Shark.</li>
    <li> This sample pack is a good way to try a variety of blades to see what works best for you.  I haven&#x27;t been through many, but I&#x27;ve already found some I like and some I don&#x27;t.</li>
