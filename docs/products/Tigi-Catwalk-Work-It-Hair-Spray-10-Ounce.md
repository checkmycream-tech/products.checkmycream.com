      <li>I have been using this product for years and would highly recommend to anyone with fine, hard to hold hair.</li>
      <li>The manufacture has remade the brand and the new spray isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
      <li>Be careful not to use too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used this for years, nothing compares!</li>
    <li> Light spray with lots of holding power to last all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair spray for someone who wants a firm hold!</li>
    <li> Very good hold and excellent price. Does not get sticky or build up in your hair, and I have fine hair that can easily become weighed down.  The nozzle clogs well before you get to the end of the can, so cleaning the nozzle should be done before you use it each time as the contents are used up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only hairspray that I can use on my fine hair.  The new version of catwalk, that they say is better is NOT.  This older version doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or get stiff.  Amazon is the only place that I can still find it to buy.  Amazon... please continue to sell it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray. Styles my hair in&lt;br /&gt;Seconds</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I am going to do when I can no longer find this online.  The manufacture has remade the brand and the new spray isn&#x27;t the same.  I have baby fine hair and this has great hold without being sticky.</li>
    <li> This spray is discontinued everywhere so i have to get it online its the very best its flexible not stiff or hard as a rock does not flake and smell amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it never leaves my hair frozen in place but it does retain the the shape.I can easily comb though my hair when I use this product!</li>
    <li> was so happy to find this as my sister and I both use this spray. It&#x27;s listed as 8 oz, but when it arrived it was in 10 oz can! Great.</li>
    <li> I have the finest hair, and I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s no longer in production, but through Amazon, I was able to get more.  I feel like I&#x27;m addicted, and Amazon is my source!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> It works really well, but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the black &amp;#34;studio edition&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls in place - with no frizz.</li>
    <li> First time to try this and I really like it. Be careful not to use too much.</li>
    <li> Have been using for probably 20 years. Workable, true HOLD. Low build-up. Light clean fragrance. Superbly effective for curls, waves, lift, volume, wave and texture definition. Never gunky. Never irritates my scalp (which is sensitive). I collect TOO many hair products. THIS is my ONLY hairspray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products but I keep coming back to this one. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it&#x27;s easy to style with.</li>
    <li> Favorite hairspray!  Can be &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; and does not feel stiff</li>
    <li> Love this product. Such a mistake that TIGI discontinued it. I just bought 24 cans in case they run out of &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:be447b4565665242b80e030fe4b60ba8]]I&#x27;ve tried every alternative and some even higher priced.&lt;br /&gt;There is simply NOTHING like this! I&#x27;m so frustrated I cannot find this in stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;GRRRRRRR!&lt;br /&gt;Other spays make your hair all sticky the next day- this does not and I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I usually use Big &amp; Sexy Hard to Play Spray but this is just as equal, but a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love that is workable. Fabulous hairspray for short hair. Funky or not.</li>
    <li> Wish I could find it in a travel size - LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  I used to be able to buy this in stores, but it is becoming more and more difficult to find.  I have ordered it through Amazon the past couple of times.  I order 4 bottles at a time.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> TIGI has recently changed the look of their product line and have renamed some of their products.  It has been difficult to find Catwalk Work It in the original formula / design.  I&#x27;ve tried the newer product and keep returning to this one but getting harder and harder to find - please keep stocking this.</li>
    <li> For some odd reason you can&#x27;t purchase this product in the stores any more. Thank God for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why the makers of TGI CATWALK would take it off the shelves. It is the best hairspray around.&lt;br /&gt;Sure do hope the Internet shoppe doesn&#x27;t run out!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product before I flat iron my hair and use also as a finishing spray.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;It is discontinued.  I of course don&#x27;t like the&lt;br /&gt;shipping costs, but I could not get out due to&lt;br /&gt;surgery.  Lots of stores still have this hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I would wait and purchase locally and&lt;br /&gt;avoid the shipping costs.Also Tigi has a great new&lt;br /&gt;hairspray which I discovered that I prefer to this discont&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;product.  Just took a while to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair. In order to keep my curls at bay I use many products. The TIGI Catwalk line is the best I have found in years, from the crème to the hairspray. I spray it on when my hair is wet and this offers my curls definition and keeps the frizz away.  I hope TIGI never stops making these products because my hair appreciates it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Nice hold but no helmet head feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and would highly recommend to anyone with fine, hard to hold hair. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it does not leave my hair feeling sticky. I&#x27;ve only been able to find it online and in my local Target store.</li>
    <li> This spray can be a little drying, but it does hold my style together very well, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Items arrived when expected. Very easy purchasing system. Tigi has recently changed the look and scent of their Catwalk products. Wish companies would leave a good thing alone. This hairspray is strong enough to hold all day, but not heavy.</li>
