<li> I used the Luminology serum on the &#x27;crows feet&#x27; around one eye as well as half of the deeper crease on my forehead.</li>
<li> At this point, my wrinkle was less noticeable.</li>
<li> And I don&#x27;t even think it does anything (except roll up into little balls and mess up your makeup).</li>
<li> It rolls into little balls and messes up your makeup.</li>
<li> i am 40 and needed a little help.</li>
<li> I felt my skin tightening immediately and my little wrinkles disappeared.</li>
<li> This product does firm and tighten, but it dries like a peel-off mask and flakes</li>
<li> and I hope over time it will help my eyelids recover from the effects of having been so heavy.  </li>
<li> It takes very little, and you can feel it start to tighten the skin soon after application.</li>
<li> Usually you should feel some type of tightening in beginning...</li>
<li> dont rub it in hard though.</li>
<li> This product doesnt work...at least not on me  </li>
<li> Having tried &#x27;wrinkle remover&#x27; type of products before with little or no noticeable improvement I was skeptical about the claim that I would feel and see a difference within 90-seconds.</li>
<li> I have this one annoying wrinkle that I have been wanting to erase for a while</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
    <li> Leaves a white film on my face if I use any other lotion along with it.</li>
    <li> 3 of us tried it- myself in my 30s, a friend in his 40s, and a friend who just turned 60. I saw no difference except a white film that appeared about 20 minutes after application. 40 something friend loved it and said he was told by 3 people that he looked wide awake that day. 60 year old friend said she could see a difference, but I never saw it on either one of them. I think it works as well as you really think it will.</li>
    <li> This product is totally misrepresented.  After application dries, it turns flaky and makes your skin look like you are peeling or suffering from a skin disease.  I tried 3 other products and they all work better.  Two were at the shops at Bally&#x27;s in Las Vegas and the third was from a friend who has a distributorship for a product.  I am not trying to sell any of these other products.  I just want you to know this one does not work.  It also made some area under my eye swell up causing me to look like I was recovering from a 10 day binge.</li>
    <li> Having tried &#x27;wrinkle remover&#x27; type of products before with little or no noticeable improvement I was skeptical about the claim that I would feel and see a difference within 90-seconds. When I was offered a chance to try it for free through a promotional give-away, I thought- What do I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser provided a tiny amount of product but it was plenty to use around both eyes. But I thought I&#x27;d try a mini-experiment.  I used the Luminology serum on the &#x27;crows feet&#x27; around one eye as well as half of the deeper crease on my forehead. I was surprised to immediately feel a tightening in the area and went to check moments later.  Although I noticed a difference, I wanted to be sure I wasn&#x27;t just &#x27;hoping&#x27; for result.  My 7 year old granddaughter came home from school and I asked her if she could tell &#x27;one side or the other had fewer wrinkles.  She correctly identified the side that I had applied the serum to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Nana here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using Luminology daily alone or under my moisturizer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product and am impressed with the very reasonable price especially when I paid much more for less effective products in the past!!!</li>
    <li> Left white chalky film...</li>
    <li> I got this product for free through a promotion and I am absolutely thrilled with this. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to look younger!</li>
    <li> I was very happy that I was offered this product for free through a promotion. I have this one annoying wrinkle that I have been wanting to erase for a while now I started out by making sure my face was completely skin and dry.

Then I allowed it to have a couple minutes to dry before applying my foundation. At this point, my wrinkle was less noticeable. I am sure over time it will completely disappear. I plan on continuing to use the product and see how it works.  I should also mention that I love the look of the bottle. It is really pretty. The serum also went into my skin quickly, without making it feel greasy and it didn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free and it is pretty good.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but it is helpful with the ones I do have.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You need to start with a clean face completely dry and free from any make up.  With your little fingers put a little bit on each finger tip start by lightly rubbing underneath inner eye to the outer eye. dont rub it in hard though. glide it on its important to use a light touch and just a little bit of the stuff. let it dry completely. even my husband after seeing the results tried it too.))) He loves it as well. Try this product you will be Amazed! i received this item for free to sample and review and couldnt be happier!</li>
    <li> i could not be happier with this wrinkle cream. i am 40 and needed a little help. this worked for me. it is so cool i got it free in a promotion.</li>
    <li> The Luminology 90 Second Wrinkle Eraser works great! I applied it to the area around my eyes after washing my face. It takes very little, and you can feel it start to tighten the skin soon after application. I have wrinkles and this product works well to help minimize them. I did notice that if I put too much of the Luminology 90 Second Wrinkle Eraser on, it peeled in spots - so definitely a little works better than a lot. So glad I was able to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> The 90 Second Wrinkle Eraser is awesome! Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitations, this is the one that feels so good and makes a difference! I had coworkers ask if I just got back from vacation! Wow! I&#x27;m sticking with what works!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times and only on my eyes.  When I lost a lot of weight, my eyelids began to sag and show a lot of wrinkling.  This really does do a nice job of picking my eyelids up and I hope over time it will help my eyelids recover from the effects of having been so heavy.  My eyelids and under are so soft after using this too.  It has also helped with my undereye circles.  They also have responded well and are firmer.</li>
    <li> Money wasted...do not purchase.  This is gunk..When you apply this product, it just crumbles off your skin. This product&lt;br /&gt;does not stay on like a serum would.</li>
    <li> This stuff almost instantly works and I feel like when I am sleep deprived like all of us sometimes are it really helps pull the bags under my eyes tight!  But I can also wear makeup over it!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free through a promotion and I have been happy with it.  I found that it was not slimy or sticky and my face felt great after using this. I felt my skin tightening immediately and my little wrinkles disappeared. The only thing I did not like about the product was that it does not have instructions on the bottle or even make suggestions of where to put it on your face.</li>
    <li> This product does firm and tighten, but it dries like a peel-off mask and flakes/peels all day like an old sunburn.</li>
    <li> Luminology 90 Second Wrinkle Eraser does not erase a single wrinkle in 90 seconds. It&#x27;s simply a moisturizer cream like so many others that claim it will do this or that. I wanted to return it but the cost of shipping and handling that I had to pay was not worth it. I&#x27;ve tried different products and this one is a total thumbs down.</li>
    <li> It rolls into little balls and messes up your makeup. I&#x27;ve tried applying this several different ways but always getting the same results. And I don&#x27;t even think it does anything (except roll up into little balls and mess up your makeup).</li>
    <li> I just started using this product two days ago and I noticed right away a difference in my face. I have never used any other wrinkle remover products and I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any other than this product. Very Very satisfied with this product and would gladly buy it again and will recommend it to my friends and family. Disclaimer: I received this product free through a promotion.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I have to say that I really liked it. I have been using it for over a week and can already tell a difference in my skin. It feels amazing when I put it on and leaves my face feeling nice and smooth. Also, I can already tell a difference in the skin around the corners of my eyes. The skin is firmer, and the fine lines are drastically diminished.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product at no cost through a promotion.  I have to say that I was quite impressed!!  The formula is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky.  You also only need a small amount, so the bottle will last quite a while.  I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of wrinkles to begin with, but I do have dark under eye circles.  I have noticed that the circles have been diminishing and my eyes look brighter and more awake!</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work...at least not on me  When put on there is no firming?? Usually you should feel some type of tightening in beginning...NOTHING!!! When I checkd on internet couldnt find inormation on Compay</li>
    <li> Cheap price...cheap product! Does not work. You might as well put lotion on your face. Tried to leave this product Starless  but the rating will not allow it.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well. I tested it first on my hand, then on one side of my face and compared to see if there was a difference, and there actually was. The only problem I have is there were no directions on how to use the product or how often, so I am just using it once a day.</li>
    <li> This product was part of a free promotion for me, and I&#x27;m SO GLAD to have gotten it.  It leaves my skin, smoother, and more firm and less wrinkled.  It also makes my skin more moisturized.  Love.</li>
    <li> Love this and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Will be ordering again.</li>
</ol>
