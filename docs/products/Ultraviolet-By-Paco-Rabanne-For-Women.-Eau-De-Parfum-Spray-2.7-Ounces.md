    <li> This is a very light/floral refreshing fragrance, Summer fragrance for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Remember reviews are done personally, every persons body chemistry will change the scent of the fragrance on each persons skin.]</li>
    <li> THIS COMPANY WILL RIP YOU OFF.  THEY SHIPPED THE WRONG ITEM AND REFUSED TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE UNTIL WE RETURNED THE ITEM BACK.  THEY STATED THAT THEY WOULD RE-FUND THE $9.40 POSTAGE AND THEY DID NOT.  THEY SAID THAT THE WERE GOING TO SEND US A $5.OO GIFT CARD AND THEY DID NOT.  THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO ANY E-MAILS OR PHONE CALLS.  AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAUGE.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>

    <li> One of my favorite scents. I think it smells great on both guys and girls without being to dominatiing to either gender</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t managed to get my hands on Ultraviolet in quite some time as I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any of the perfumeries where I live or in other states. That&#x27;s when I decided to check online and amazon. This is one of my most loved scents along with Coco Chanel Mademoiselle and CK One. I&#x27;m so happy I have it. If you haven&#x27;t had the chance to smell or wear this perfume, I urge you to give it a chance. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used Ultraviolet by Paco Rabanne for the last several years.  I just opened this box and was extremely disappointed - this particular bottle is not the original...the fragrance is slightly different you scent does not last for more than a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last year and had a great experience with this company.  The Perfume is wonderful, very light and clean feeling.  I love to put it on right before bedtime.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this fragrance.</li>

    <li> Great purchase, was as expected and will do bussines again</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it works well for everyday wear.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I am a guy, and I&#x27;m really not into perfumes.  To be honest, most perfumes are a big turnoff.  Several years ago, however, I smelled this fragrance on a woman, asked her what it was and now I buy a bottle for my wife every year.  I love the way it smells on her.  It is subtle and seductive.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance in the world :) Love it. Subtle elegant mesmerizing :) My husband loves this as well. It is not so strong that it gives you a head ache. It is just perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I received the product in excellent conditions and on time as expected. It was a really good service. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent since it came out and always get positive comments about it.  Use sparingly though!</li>
    <li> the address which was delivered my product was not specified and I need to know how it will solve the asusuto I wonder if I still have the product since it was deducted from my card</li>
    <li> I just love it for the summer!!! I have used that before!!! Its not strong, just perfect! I would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I started wearing this perfume in 2002. Immediately fell in love with it. Haven&#x27;t worn it since 2007. I found an empty bottle tucked away and the scent brought back sweet memories of happy moments. I had to have it!  Of course, as soon as I received it and put it on, I went back in time! So now I have the best of both: sweet, seductive  memories of from the past while I create them in the present! THANK YOU PACO!! Trina  Scott - TX</li>
    <li> This is the second time am buying this for wifey. .She very much in love with it</li>
    <li> Smells very nice.....but doesn&#x27;t stay on me long.  I purchased this because a friend of mine had it in one afternoon we met for lunch every time she moved or I walked by I loved the smell.. I still love the smell but just not on me...</li>
    <li> Hmm paco...my mom used this perfume for a while and I know why now...it is really convenient for young women who wanna make a statement without forcing attention</li>
