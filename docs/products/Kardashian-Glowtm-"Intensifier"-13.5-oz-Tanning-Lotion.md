<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This came in 2 days and smells amazing</li>
    <li> I love ALL  karsashians product.... They are the best ever</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did nothing for me. I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference after using this product. I recommend the Kardashian Glow Bronzer. It smells great and actually tans your skin .😎</li>
    <li> This product was slow tanning for me.  I had to find a faster product</li>
    <li> Smells good going on, but leaves a weird after-smell. But using it, I have gotten noticeably darker in a tanning bed. It says you can use it for outdoor purposes but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I love the intensifier tanning lotion. I really did not want to spend over $100 at the salon on this item, and this product makes my skin feel oh so pretty! The scent is a little lighter than I remember it from last time. My order came in before the estimated delivery date, and was packaged very neatly. This product helps me evenly tan my fair skin, and smell nice when I leave the salon. This product does not make me look like an orange, because it does NOT CONTAIN A BRONZER. If you are looking for a product to make you look like an orange street cone, this is not it. The lotion is silky, and applies so smooth. It does leave a light lotion film to your skin, but it is not oily. I usually just wash my hands after applying it. The product is &amp;#34;in date&amp;#34;, so for any of you who are wondering if this is an expired product, well it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I had a pleasant experience with this seller, and with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews, they claimed it had a nice citrus smell. It&#x27;s not really citrus to me. It&#x27;s not a bad smell or I would have returned it cause I get migraines. I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I seen color after a week of use. This stuff really gets you dark and keeps you that way.</li>
    <li> Says an intensifier meaning you don&#x27;t have to tan as often so I read (lie) I still have to tan every day to matin by color :/</li>
    <li> I worked at a tanning salon for years and wash skeptical buying tanning lotion online. I did a lot of review searching and the TanMan is the real deal. This lotion is as real as it gets and so much cheaper than any salon will sell it for</li>
    <li> This product not only was luxuriously smooth to apply but was absorbed quickly. My skin has never been so velvety. This product developed my base tan faster than any other. I burned with it in a level one on an 8 min session. Used a level 4 for 7 min the day before...however the burned skin turned into a rich deep honey tone tan that did not flake or peel off! I award that to this product. That tan faded fast in 2 weeks out of the salon so use the Kardashian After Tan product or your efforts will be a loss!</li>
    <li> Overall I enjoyed this product.  I loved the smell and its goes on nice.  I thought it might help me tan a bit more but overall good product</li>
    <li> The Kardashian Glow Intensifier is my all-time favorite tanning lotion.  This lotion by far gave me the best results out of all the intensifying lotions.  There are so many more perks of this lotion other than just my results.&lt;br /&gt;Within this product there is aloe vera and shea butter to make a soothing sensation in case if you accidently tan too long and get a little red, which I sometimes do, I’ll admit.  Not only that, but there is caffeine and vitamins in this lotion to help improve the appearance of your skin.  The caffeine in this lotion is designed to help firm up your skin which is perfect!  Let’s be honest here too.  After tanning you generally have an after tan odor.  With this lotion, there will be no after odor!  It takes care of that for you!  Which for me is perfect because I tan before work and I don’t want to smell when I get there.  I go to work smelling like a juicy apricot instead smelling like a gym sock.  This lotion is also silicone based which make your skin super smooth and the lotion will last a long time.  I love it when my skin is silky smooth and smelling nice,&lt;br /&gt; This lotion is especially good if you are looking for a more natural tan.  What this lotion does is stimulate your melanin to help give you that natural glow.  I prefer this intensifier than bronzing lotions because the bronzer “stains” your skin and it looks like you have an “orangey” appearance.  With this lotion you have a more natural, beautiful looking tan.&lt;br /&gt; I like to compare my lotions and I compared this lotion with the Phoenician lotion by Designer Skin.  Don’t get me wrong, Phoenician is a good lotion, but I like the Kardashian Glow a lot better.  The smell the Phoenician lotion didn’t smell too good in my opinion.  It was alright.  Both lotions are supposed to do the same thing, but I saw more clear results with the Kardashian lotion and was a lot happier in a shorter time frame.&lt;br /&gt; Tanning lotions are expensive and I don’t like to spenda lot.  That is why I needed to do a little work to see what lotion will benefit me the most.  Well I did my research.  The Kardashian Glow Intensifier is the best of the best.  The bottle itself is only $99 and the price per use is only $3.66.  That is a killer deal especially with the results you will get.  The lotion itself can last three to four months!&lt;br /&gt; This lotion is a must have.  If you want to have better results and looking for a great price, this is the lotion to have!</li>
    <li> thank you so much! i love and will be back for more! perfect gift for anyone! im definitely obsessed w this</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I paid a lot more at the salon for it. But now I will buy it on here. It has an amazing smell and it works great, I like intensifiers. It brings out your natural color instead of bronzers that make you look more orange. Love my tan!</li>
    <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t give me a fake tint to my skin. It does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This product provides a nice subtle bronzing effect. Looks natural and smells great. Price is extremely cheaper than salon price.</li>
    <li> this lotion is awesome if you want healthier skin, NOT if your trying to get a quick dark tan. This lotion is WHITE and does not contain bronzers--don&#x27;t be fooled!! it&#x27;s more of a vitamin boost for skin.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and it works well.  Doesn&#x27;t stain your hands like lotions with bronzers do.  We have purchased this before and will purchase again when we run out.</li>
    <li> Saved over 75% by purchasing through Amazon, rather than the Tanning Salon. Excellent lotion, even for the more fare skinned, like myself.</li>
    <li> The lotion is supposed to be white but its not  it isntvas dark as my bronzers but its not pure white like my other intensifier. Im going to compair it to the lotion at the salon but im afraid it might be a fake</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! It smells sooooo good! It is also very moisturizing. I, however, do not think it&#x27;s worth the salon price (as I don&#x27;t think any lotion is worth $100) TheeTanman on Amazon has this lotion at an unbeatable price, and yes, is the real deal! I&#x27;ve used packets at my salon and the smell, color, texture, results.. all the same. This lotion is not a bronzing lotion and does not stain your skin, it&#x27;s an intensifier and brings out your natural tan. Which is why I love it! I&#x27;m tan and sometimes when I don&#x27;t go for a couple days I burn when using this lotion ..that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working! Would highly recommend this lotion to any one. Also very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon that stopped carrying this lotion. I was so glad to find it online for cheaper. I&#x27;m sure plenty of you have heard the rumor that the lotion online isn&#x27;t the real thing. I PROMISE you this is!</li>
    <li> It was OK, the smell was not too strong so that is good. Gave decent results if you are looking for something with out and intensifier and without bronzer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the lotion. It felt like I was putting water on. It smells ok. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an intensifier so it&#x27;s not meant to have cosmetic bronzers. I work at a tanning salon and am also smart tan certified so I&#x27;m very familiar with types or lotions and how they work. Intensifiers are meant to give you a more natural looking tan and darken the natural melanin your skin produces instead of \\&quot;staining\\&quot; your skin. I&#x27;ve used this lotion and it&#x27;s alright. It does what it is intended to do, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. To the other reviewer of this product the lotion is meant to be white, and you can achieve a dark tan without the use of bronzers.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, much cheaper than the price they were asking at my tanning salon. And this really gives me a great tan.</li>
    <li> JUST AS DESCRIBED!! it&#x27;s the real lotion. Gets me super dark in the bed and since it&#x27;s an intensifier(which means it doesn&#x27;t have any bronzers in it) I can take it outside and you can too! I rotate it with Kardashian black bronzer for my amazing dark color. Highly recommend buying the pair.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice! Wish the sent was more like pina colada!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this smells - and it has silicone as a base, so it leaves your skin nice and smooth too. This is not a bronzer, and basically does nothing unless I&#x27;m at the salon, so definitely don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for a sunless tanner. I do notice that if I leave it on for more than a few hours the tops of my legs start to break out, so I&#x27;ve been making sure to shower no longer than an hour or so after tanning. Great product! So happy I found this online so I don&#x27;t have to pay the $99 salon charge!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this! It is the real thing! 100% Genuine. After my amazon points i ended up getting this for $20! I saved $80 over the salon, why pay more when you can get it here for a fraction of the price? Designer Skin really stepped up with this product line, in my opinion. Switch between this and a bronzer for great color!</li>
    <li> The smell is Great!!! Definitely helps with the smell you usually get when you&#x27;re done tanning with this all you smell is the lotion... n its awesome!! Great price on here too rather than at the salon. I&#x27;d def buy more!!</li>
    <li> I love the product. It just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other two kardashian lotions. It also has no bronzer in it which I like</li>
    <li> I tried this tanning lotion at my local tanning salon and I LOVED IT! However, the price was quite high in the salon, so I decided to order it from here (it&#x27;s a pretty good price here)...everything looks up to par except I looked at the bottle at the salon and compared it to the one I had - and while everything pretty much looks the same - the bottle at the salon has an irradescent look and the one I got from here doesn&#x27;t - also I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m paranoid because of the bottle but I don&#x27;t feel like it did as well as when I tried it first in the salon...</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, it&#x27;s the true product, and brand new.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t get a tan with this. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. And the smell was that good either.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well. It doesn&#x27;t get you super dark, super fast. I have pale skin and I saw results after about a week. The color it gives is nice/natural. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good.  Happy to have less toxins in this.</li>
    <li> product was as it was described.  and i will by again.  i was very pleased with this product. thank you</li>
    <li> Salon priced @ $110.00 ! I 💖 this lotion and it smells Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This does not have DHA or cosmetic bronzers, its a fabulous Intensifier/ Maximizer</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend that loves to tan, and i must say, this makes her tan 3x as fast on the tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is actually pretty good for a tanning lotion thingy...</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a couple of years using the same bronser and not seeing much of a change.  After switching to Kardashian Glow Intensifier I have noticed a much deeper richer color.  I love my new Kardashian Glow</li>
    <li> This is an average lotion. Other than a great smell , I have not noticed any change in my color or hydration- I will not buy again perhaps. I just have  a hard time to believe that people buy stuff just because they are a line of  somebody that is out there-&lt;br /&gt;Seller did a great job shipping and handling -offering  a great deal on this item- I would have never paid full price for this at the salon and never should you- no matter how much the people at the salon want to trick you into buying from them- just say NO- and buy somewhere else if you care for saving-</li>
    <li> This lotion works great and it even smells great too. It gives you a nice pretty glow instead of making you look orange.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. The minute I applied this I felt more stylish and amazing. I came out looking exotic, like I had starred in a porno before. Then as I was getting dressed I noticed it actually increased the size of my butt!!! Now Im not saying I&#x27;m a gold digger but I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My order was as described worked great was happy with lotion compared it to same one at salon no difference</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, makes my skin silky smooth and defiantly great for people who do not like bronzers not to mention way less money than the tan salon charges. GREAT DEAL. I will be buying the other ones!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used TONS of tanning lotions and this wasn&#x27;t anything to write home about.... Totally made me break out like CRAZY with an oily feel DAYS after despite washing my face several, several times over the course of days!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Thanks ! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love the way this helps my tan! I get brown so quickly with no orangey color</li>
    <li> Smells great, not too oily, love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay . I like some other lotions better.I might like one of the others in the line better.Just not what i expected  it to be.I thought it would work better . Not saying I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again .</li>
    <li> This is very good, just mix it with you&#x27;re bronze lotion and it will work..Smell&#x27;s great😀</li>
    <li> It does OK as a bronzer lotion, just like any other bronzer, but it has the yuck sticky feeling after tanning. It smells like oranges which I don&#x27;t like. I would not purchase again and I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t pay high dollar. I would be demanding money back.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Feels great on skin, no after smell that you sometimes get with other lotions.  Of al the lotions I&#x27;ve purchased this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> It takes a lol while to work though but it is okay! It has an amazing smell to it!!! I wear it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this once at the salon and then came home to buy it here off of Amazon. This lotion is pretty thick I thought, not watery like another reviewer said and goes on your skin nicely. It smells GREAT and my skin was sooo soft afterwards. It is not a bronzer, which I like as bronzers always seem to rub right off after tanning. I am getting a nice natural golden color with it.I know it has L tyrosine in it which helps your body produce melanin that helps you tan.</li>
    <li> I do not normally like an intensifier but I love this one. I really didn&#x27;t want to buy it because if the name but I happened to try their after tan lotion and it felt and smelled amazing so I decided to give this a try as well and I am so happy I did. I absolutely do not see me using any other lotions.  I noticed tan immediately. Very natural. I will try their bronzers next.</li>
    <li> My salon was trying to sell me this lotion for $120.00!!  I decided to check Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This lotion smells great and seems to work well.  It absorbs fairly easily.  It&#x27;s a nice all around tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> smells pretty good, i&#x27;d say it does make me tan faster. as a red head it definitely doesn&#x27;t turn my skin a weird color or anything. perfect for fair skin.</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations ! I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; had been tanning for 8 months using only bronzes, so some of the gals at the salon recommended this so I could go past my plateau ....well it works and now I rotate this w/ my bronzes!! I give it 5 stars as I immediately noticed a big difference after 1x of use!&lt;br /&gt;Wendy SF SD 😎</li>
    <li> The tan with this lotion is a slow process but it does give a more natural looking tan with this product... However it made my face break out like CRAZY, so badly that people were asking me what the deal was with my face breaking out so badly (my skin is usually clear, 1-2 blemishes, but these blemishes where huge, deep and painful) Use it on the body, but not on the face. I realized it was this lotion causing my facial skin issues and I stopped putting it on my face about a week and a half ago and everything&#x27;s starting to clear up. Not the worst but Im not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought it smelled to citrus-y, I really had to use a lot to get some results but was very annoyed because I broke out. I have very normal skin and it was very oily and gave me a unwanted oompa-loompa-ish glow.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little different than I was expecting, it doesn&#x27;t smell as great after you tan either, but the product works well and I&#x27;ve noticed myself getting darker faster. I&#x27;m super pale and extremely new to tanning and already have lines and a nice glow after three times with the product. I don&#x27;t tan well and I have freckles :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but my daughter stole it. It works great! I&#x27;m going to order another bottle for myself. Smells good too!</li>
