      <li>I thought this would be a great product to use</li>
      <li>The fragrance of this product is pleasant and not flowery; IMO, it is a manly fragrance.</li>
      <li>Once aluminum enters your body , it cannot be eliminated, which can&#x27;t be good.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t take antiperspirants, this is a good option</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good deodorant that has no aluminum.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend said it smells nice too.</li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant i have ever used after trying dove secrets etc &amp; constantly getting a perspiration from them after a yrs use i decided to use this</li>
      <li>If you do not want an invisible solid (anti-perspirant), this is the best deodorant you can buy.</li>
      <li>Best of all it doesn&#x27;t stain your white shirts!</li>
      <li>Like everyone else, my husband, the marine, needs something strong.  </li>
      <li>What a relief to find that this is available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>However I bought this because a reviewer said it was \\&quot;unisex.\\&quot; It smells exactly like Men&#x27;s cologne, and a strong smell at that!</li>
      <li>I got lucky and found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For my son and a great 6pk since he never tells me till last second he is out of deodorant and needs more.</li>
      <li>If you love this deodorant, it&#x27;s a great deal but there should be a single or double pack for sale for those who are not sold on it.    </li>
      <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like anti-perspirants, so we are always limited to the kind of deodorant we can buy.  </li>
      <li>Never failed me.</li>
      <li>You know, the funny thing about people is...</li>
      <li>and it works great long lasting scent on no odors</li>
      <li>Be sure to order plenty; this will not likely be around for much longer.</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to experiment.</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing to mask it.  </li>
      <li>And Amazon sells it at a very competitive price.</li>
      <li>It actually stops you from smelling, rather than covering up the smell with strong fragrances like Old Spice.</li>
      <li>Not to mention there are studies (please google) that suggest that Alzheimer&#x27;s patients have a high level of aluminum in their brain.</li>
      <li>I think the slight fragrance to it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some other products, and it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I give this product my highest recommendations but don&#x27;t get mad at me if it&#x27;s not as ideal for you as it is for</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I have not been successful in finding the product again.</li>
      <li>It has become increasingly hard to find a deodorant that does not have the aluminum that most antiperspirants have.  </li>
      <li>so I have to depend on on-line retailers for my deodorant and the natural action of this product</li>
      <li>FYI,  Every antiperspirant contains aluminum which enters your body directly through your armpits .</li>
      <li>/&gt;LOL, yes I shower daily, sometimes even twice daily during the summer if it&#x27;s really hot and humid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>That being said, he does say that if you&#x27;re having a particularly stressful day, it can lose its effectiveness after several hours.  </li>
      <li>Sadly, Arm &amp; Hammer is mostly discontinuing the sale of this particular deodorant in stores.  </li>

<li> Some smell terrible, some give him a rash (!), but this one has both a clean, masculine scent and is gentle on his skin.  </li>
<li> First, the pricing is frustrating.  </li>
<li> just out of curiosity I tried Arm and Hammer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rank this one right up there with the \\&quot;clinical strengh\\&quot; varieties on the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;Except</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t mess  with Aluminum</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not that expensive and lasts quite a while even with daily use.&lt;br</li>
<li> Surprise unpleasant, deodorants are invisible solid but does not say abroad; i.e. we could be talking about an uneven article, it is regrettable.</li>
<li> works for me (at least I have not received complaints of offensive odors emanating from my body).</li>
<li> but I was wrong.    </li>
<li> This is an extremely difficult product to find; perhaps it is discontinued.  </li>
<li> I have had some really bad experiences trying antiperspirants the often lead to irritation and some very serious rashes under my arms.  </li>
<li> When using the product, my body odor was really bad.  </li>
<li> hate stinking and will NOT tolerate</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best deodorant on the market. It actually stops you from smelling, rather than covering up the smell with strong fragrances like Old Spice. I was buying this product at Walgreens because they were the only retail store that sold the deodorant only. All the retail outlets only carry Arm &amp; Hammer invisible solid (anti-perspirant). I got lucky and found it on Amazon. If you do not want an invisible solid (anti-perspirant), this is the best deodorant you can buy. And Amazon sells it at a very competitive price. Same or less than Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 years now. FYI,  Every antiperspirant contains aluminum which enters your body directly through your armpits . Once aluminum enters your body , it cannot be eliminated, which can&#x27;t be good. Not to mention there are studies (please google) that suggest that Alzheimer&#x27;s patients have a high level of aluminum in their brain. Why take the chance. Baking soda is a natural way to destroy odor. Don&#x27;t mess  with Aluminum....use this product</li>
    <li> Simply, I lied. I tried to buy an Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant than invisible solid and as it does not have the write what I bought. Surprise unpleasant, deodorants are invisible solid but does not say abroad; i.e. we could be talking about an uneven article, it is regrettable.</li>
    <li> It has become increasingly hard to find a deodorant that does not have the aluminum that most antiperspirants have.  I have had some really bad experiences trying antiperspirants the often lead to irritation and some very serious rashes under my arms.  Sadly, Arm &amp; Hammer is mostly discontinuing the sale of this particular deodorant in stores.  I had to order it online because all stores were discontinued in their stock.  Be sure to order plenty; this will not likely be around for much longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant i have ever used after trying dove secrets etc &amp; constantly getting a perspiration from them after a yrs use i decided to use this and it works great long lasting scent on no odors what so ever.</li>
    <li> For my son and a great 6pk since he never tells me till last second he is out of deodorant and needs more. With having to have 1 at home, and 1 at school for gym and sports great having it always on hand.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like anti-perspirants, so we are always limited to the kind of deodorant we can buy.  We have been through several kinds.  Some smell terrible, some give him a rash (!), but this one has both a clean, masculine scent and is gentle on his skin.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> What a relief to find that this is available through Amazon.  Our local drugstores and grocery stores no longer stock this deodorant.  As others have said, we don&#x27;t want a product with aluminum in it for health reasons.  Like everyone else, my husband, the marine, needs something strong.  That being said, he does say that if you&#x27;re having a particularly stressful day, it can lose its effectiveness after several hours.  It is, afterall, a deodorant and not an anti-perspirant.    My husband has said the consistency of this is preferable as well.  The anti-perspirants go on \\&quot;chalky\\&quot;, in his opinion.    I think the slight fragrance to it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some other products, and it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a great deoderant. However I bought this because a reviewer said it was \\&quot;unisex.\\&quot; It smells exactly like Men&#x27;s cologne, and a strong smell at that! It&#x27;s wonderful, if you&#x27;re a man or if you like smelling like a man. I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m posting this for other women who workout a lot and are looking for a stronger, natural deoderant. I believe A&amp;H has a non-scented version of this.</li>
    <li> You know, the funny thing about people is...just because something works for someone doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for the next person.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;You name it.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I give this product my highest recommendations but don&#x27;t get mad at me if it&#x27;s not as ideal for you as it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to experiment. Especially with deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;And experiment I did.&lt;br /&gt;Speed Stick.&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;Degree.&lt;br /&gt;You name it I&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I hate stinking and will NOT tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;Then just out of curiosity I tried Arm and Hammer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rank this one right up there with the \\&quot;clinical strengh\\&quot; varieties on the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;Except Arm is a lot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on, it stays on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that expensive and lasts quite a while even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an issue with BO while using this.&lt;br /&gt;LOL, yes I shower daily, sometimes even twice daily during the summer if it&#x27;s really hot and humid.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say really.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Effective.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the stinky away.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have discovered that if I use a product containing an antiperspirant, my skin gets irritated and sometimes cracks and bleeds. So, I don&#x27;t purchase any product that says \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; on the label. I have seen deodorant products without antiperspirant only once in a brick and mortar store so I have to depend on on-line retailers for my deodorant and the natural action of this product works for me (at least I have not received complaints of offensive odors emanating from my body). The fragrance of this product is pleasant and not flowery; IMO, it is a manly fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that I have tried that does not irritate my skin.    My girlfriend said it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This smells great! Best of all it doesn&#x27;t stain your white shirts! I have been using it for years. 3 of my sons use it as well and they don&#x27;t reek! Ages 13-20.</li>
    <li> Best deororant for those of use allergic to antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good deodorant that has no aluminum.  I&#x27;ve also suffered from that embarrassing \\&quot;canary yellow\\&quot; on my t shirts.  I thought this would be a great product to use but I was wrong.    First, the pricing is frustrating.  Having to pay nearly $20 for a six pack is ridiculous if you just want to try something.  If you love this deodorant, it&#x27;s a great deal but there should be a single or double pack for sale for those who are not sold on it.    When using the product, my body odor was really bad.  It did absolutely nothing to mask it.  So now, I have six sticks of deodorant that I need to throw out.    If you have that \\&quot;canary  yellow\\&quot; problem and want a non-aluminum deodorant, look at Crystal.  I recommend the roll on version as it works to mask odors (it replaced the Arm and Hammer in a hurry) and has not stained any of my shirts.</li>
    <li> For those who don&#x27;t want the aluminum from anti-perspirant&#x27;s, this is an excellent alternative, very good deodorant. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in retail stores anymore. Have used this product for years. Never failed me.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely difficult product to find; perhaps it is discontinued.  There are almost no possibilities for deodorant without the additional (and not always desirable) antiperspirant.  Unfortunately, I have not been successful in finding the product again.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t take antiperspirants, this is a good option</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, and won&#x27;t turn your brain to mush when you hit your 50&#x27;s. Aluminum, which is the active ingredient in antiperspirant, has shown in studies to cause Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. You don&#x27;t want that.</li>
