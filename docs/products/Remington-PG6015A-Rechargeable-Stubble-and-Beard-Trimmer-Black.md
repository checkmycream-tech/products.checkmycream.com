      <li>, it&#x27;s best to charge them overnight before first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Great product for cheap price.</li>
      <li>works amazing.</li>

      <li>And the new is perfect Very satisfied.</li>

      <li>This is a great item easy to use at home and on the go I would definitely recommend great buy</li>
      <li>I will start off by saying there are many units on the market that are much better than this unit.</li>
      <li>Performance is perfect for trimming facial har.</li>
      <li>I love the idea that it can be charged and doesn&#x27;t need batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But at a sub $20 price, none of those better units can compare.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really disapointing razor form a brand name that should know better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have about 5 of these and love it</li>
      <li>For those who gave this trimmer 3 stars or more some weeks or months ago, I&#x27;d love to hear from them now</li>
      <li>so I must think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Happy New Year, and God Bless,  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re ok with that, this trimmer works just fine and at $10 is a steal.</li>
      <li>This one has also been great so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not built as well as my Groomsman - I really liked the stainless steel sturdiness - but this one is light, feels nice in my hand and cuts really smoothly</li>
      <li>Easy to order.</li>
      <li>I bought it, and it works very well, the battery is great, also, before the first time to use it, you must charge it for 16 hours.</li>
      <li>It worked fine for 2-3 months, then the battery just gave out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say if you get a good unit the first time, it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that most bathrooms in which someone would groom themselves has an outlet in which they can plug in the trimmer.</li>
      <li>it is working, it does work fine.  </li>
      <li>drawback is the quality of the item is slightly cheap.</li>
      <li>Would be better if it had a stand, but for the money, it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice...</li>
      <li>Light weight.</li>
      <li>The attachments seemed cheap.  </li>
      <li>Light sound.</li>
      <li>They seemed as if they were genuinely concerned about my satisfaction.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>but my opinion is this is exactly what you pay for, a very cheap trimmer.</li>
      <li>not the original box.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Remington Customer Services replied to my original review.</li>
      <li>(I apologize to all of you who are familiar with electronics and are laughing now.)</li>
      <li>Full Disclosure:  </li>
      <li>Overall I am much more pleased with my replacement item than my original.</li>
      <li>The new shaver works 10x better than the original one purchased.</li>
      <li>Runs out battary really quick after a day of charging</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be lucky if you could get 30 seconds out of it.</li>
      <li>To say the least, I am no longer impressed by Remington products and will most likely be sticking with Norelco from now on, even with their cheap plastic guards..</li>
      <li>So for two bucks more, I got a new trimmer.</li>
      <li>It holds a charge and is pretty powerful!</li>
      <li>The new one holds a great charge and gets through my entire shave no problems.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole new kit but was able to get just the razor for a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>little trimmer is GREAT, after I found out how to \\&quot;charge it\\&quot; correctly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price, however, the blades have trouble moving when you don&#x27;t have the plastic piece on the end.</li>
      <li>To top it off, mine completely died - it will not hold a charge at all anymore.  </li>
      <li>So far the battery is ok, just charge as directed so it doesn&#x27;t die.  </li>
      <li>I had an older Remington trimmer for several years and loved it.</li>
      <li>For a cheap and older model, this thing gets the job done, i don&#x27;t even need an hour to trim.</li>
      <li>Now i have it, without having to pay the Full Price for the Whole Kit.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be lucky if you could get that much out of it.</li>
      <li>but they all seem to have more then their fair share of poor reviews.</li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s a cheap trimmer, but other manufacturers are making cheap trimmers that aren&#x27;t complete pieces of garbage.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, this new charger works on that one too!</li>
      <li>Needs more and more time to hold a smaller and smaller charge.  </li>
      <li>..wish to have bought a higher end version, though</li>
      <li>Broke within the first week.</li>
      <li>Maybe people aren&#x27;t aware that they&#x27;re supposed to fully charge all electronics first before they use them??</li>
      <li>The shaver worked well for the first month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky about everything I buy</li>
      <li>- you&#x27;ll need to wait for it to charge first.  </li>
      <li>I think if they could fix this it would get higher marks, but as it stands I would not recommend this unit to others.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and they were kind enough to send me a new one and this one does work as advertised.  </li>
      <li>No, really: you&#x27;d be lucky if it runs more than 30 SECONDS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Not like other Remington products. Disappointed with the low quality and engineering.</li>
    <li> As expected. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Puh-lease. What does it cut?  Sorry, after experimenting with this Product, i found out that it was good as a Body Groomsman  It cuts hair on the Arms, Legs, Groin Area, and The Chest, and does it Very Well. I had been wanting a Body Groomsman Kit for quite some time. Now i have it, without having to pay the Full Price for the Whole Kit.  So I retract what I wrote at First, and Apologize for what I previously said about this Product. I am Truly Sorry  for being so harsh. Happy New Year, and God Bless,  Laurence Norris  Washington, D.c.</li>
    <li> For the price ,quite a good trimmer. Doesn&#x27;t give me the best trim,but its not a bad trim,The plus side,is this type of clip guard saves a lot of time,done trimmer in less than half the time as other trimmers. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of s**t. It worked fine for 2-3 months, then the battery just gave out. Now i charge it for three hours, only to get about 10 seconds of battery life. DO NOT BUY THIS!!</li>
    <li> As another reviewer already noted, this thing works great! For the 2 days that it works before kicking the bucket. I&#x27;ve had two and they&#x27;ve both done this. Go with something a little more costly. It will save you in the long run.</li>
    <li> Broke within the first week.</li>
    <li> What can I say.... You get what you pay for. Does not hold a charge unless it is always plugged in. If it is dead, will not run off of the charger.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t think this trimmer cut very well and i don&#x27;t have a very thick or heavy beard; and, i followed the instructions. i can&#x27;t comment on run-time since it didn&#x27;t cut well i didn&#x27;t run it very long. i did purchase a similar norelco trimmer and it trims like a hot knife thru butter - night and day.</li>
    <li> This is O K ..wish to have bought a higher end version, though</li>
    <li> The guard is a little awkward, but it works great and is very quiet and compact. Would be better if it had a stand, but for the money, it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice...</li>
    <li> I totally agree with the other reviewer.  30 to 60 seconds tops and this piece of junk dies.  Charge for an hour or two, get another minute of run time out of it.  Totally ridiculous. To beat all, when it runs out of juice, it will not even run when plugged into the wall.  Never again will I buy a rechargeable battery style trimmer.  I will gladly spend the few extra bucks on some AAs if it give me enough power to do the job the device was meant to do.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the AC adapter. It was half the cost and I get a spare trimmer.</li>
    <li> Even after charging all night, the revolutions on this trimmer are very slow. The blades seem fine and sharp, the unit itself seems well made; it has a nice feel to it. I love the idea that it can be charged and doesn&#x27;t need batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the fact that it trims so slowly is a disappointment. It takes about twice as long to trim my beard with this trimmer than my previous Remington unit did. I think if they could fix this it would get higher marks, but as it stands I would not recommend this unit to others. There are just far superior units for only a few dollars more. Pony up the extra 3 bucks and don&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Remington Customer Services replied to my original review. They seemed as if they were genuinely concerned about my satisfaction. A few quick emails later with me sending them some information and they sent me a new item. The new shaver works 10x better than the original one purchased. I did notice on the new packing order slip that there was a comment to &amp;#34;double check for quality&amp;#34;. This was a little disheartening, I would think that every item ordered would have been double checked for quality. Overall I am much more pleased with my replacement item than my original. I&#x27;d say if you get a good unit the first time, it is worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a week now and no issues. The new one holds a great charge and gets through my entire shave no problems. Kudos to the customer service department for catching my negative review and rectifying the issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer for my son.He uses it frequently.This was a replacement for previous owned trimmer. Happy with product. Easy to order.</li>
    <li> Runs out battary really quick after a day of charging</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 7yo son to just do mini shape ups in between taking him to the barber shop. works amazing.</li>
    <li> Works well.  What we expected.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Does the job well at lining my hair in the back &amp; general grooming. Satisified</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it as my dog groomer. Light sound. My dog isn&#x27;t scare. It only stay charge for 30 min after half day charging. Have to groom my dog fast. Lol</li>
    <li> doesnt hold a charge for to long maybe 5 - 10 minutes</li>
    <li> Battery died and would not charge after second use.</li>
    <li> really keeps my beard in check. Just wish had longer battery life, constantly charging it.</li>
    <li> The charge lasts a long time and the razor cuts well. I had to buy a second one because I used a charger for a similar device that apparently burned it up inside. (I apologize to all of you who are familiar with electronics and are laughing now.)</li>
    <li> Great product for cheap price. Works great, love not to have to buy batteries. Performance is perfect for trimming facial har.</li>
    <li> I decided to write a review after owning this trimmer for a few months and being really disappointed with it.  As the other reviews point out -- it costs $10, what do I expect?  Well, I guess I&#x27;d expect it to do what the package says it will do, which is to be a rechargeable trimmer.  After a few uses it stopped keeping a charge for more than an hour or so of all-night charging.  So when I want to use it, I have to plan ahead and plug it in the day before.  And it does not work unless it&#x27;s charged -- i.e. if it has no charge, it won&#x27;t work even if plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is working, it does work fine.  It just doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 25, 2014 update:  Continues to degrade.  Needs more and more time to hold a smaller and smaller charge.  Changed my review from 2 stars to 1 star.  For those who gave this trimmer 3 stars or more some weeks or months ago, I&#x27;d love to hear from them now -- I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re all less satisfied with it just a short time later.</li>
    <li> wrong charger. doesn&#x27;t charge! REFUND?</li>
    <li> On the box it says that it has a 30 minute run time. You&#x27;d be lucky if you could get 30 seconds out of it. And I&#x27;m not exaggerating, I&#x27;m being literal. No, really: you&#x27;d be lucky if it runs more than 30 SECONDS. Of course I fully charged it after I first bought it, and that was the only time it worked well. After the first use the battery life is pathetic, i.e. you&#x27;d be lucky if you get more than 30 seconds out of it. Why am I saying this over and over? Well if I don&#x27;t, there will be people that think I&#x27;m joking or exaggerating. I&#x27;m not. 30 seconds. You&#x27;d be lucky if you could get that much out of it. Now, it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, and doesn&#x27;t say how long to charge it for. But I&#x27;d safely assume that charging it for a couple hours would warrant at least 10 minutes of runtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well for the first 5 to 10 seconds of its 30 second battery life, then it goes on a serious decline, running very slowly, barely able to trim anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, even though the battery life is only 30 seconds, I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it if you were able to turn it on and use it while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall \\&quot;charging\\&quot; (I put \\&quot;charging\\&quot; in quotes, for reasons stated earlier). But, surprise surprise, this piece of junk won&#x27;t even let you use it while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worse than this beard trimmer--if you can even call it that--is one that doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a video review but the file size was too large to upload. In the video I timed it&#x27;s battery life and showed that when plugged into the wall it doesn&#x27;t run. I just let it sit there and run until it literally stopped running. It completely ran out of juice after 1 min 40 secs. That was with it just sitting there. If you were actually trying to shave with the blasted thing you&#x27;d be lucky to get 30 seconds out of it before it started to run so slow you couldn&#x27;t trim a single hair with it.</li>
    <li> As a trimmer it worked well. Here is the problem: as you will see in many other post, the battery is terrible. My battery stopped holding a charge after a few months and now it won&#x27;t even run and of course you can&#x27;t replace the battery.</li>
    <li> Trims my beard like a trimmer should.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who said battery is a joke.  I did not purchase this here but from a different retailer for more money, and it is just a terrible product.  It takes too long to charge and it does not hold a charge.  I am currently looking for a different one but they all seem to have more then their fair share of poor reviews.</li>
    <li> Good for all body trimming. Liked it. Light weight.</li>
    <li> It is better than I expected</li>
    <li> This is a great item easy to use at home and on the go I would definitely recommend great buy</li>
    <li> If you leave it sit for a couple days, the battery drains itself if it&#x27;s not plugged in, so you need to keep it plugged in all the time. To add to this problem, the trimmer only will run off of battery power, so when it does die, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and go - you&#x27;ll need to wait for it to charge first.  To top it off, mine completely died - it will not hold a charge at all anymore.  Sure it&#x27;s a cheap trimmer, but other manufacturers are making cheap trimmers that aren&#x27;t complete pieces of garbage.  I will not buy a Remington product again.  If they can engineer and sell this pile of crap, I do not trust that any of their high end products are any good either.</li>
    <li> I am giving this one star because when I read \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; I always read the worst ones 1st,,,Why I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s just me,,,,&lt;br /&gt;this little trimmer is GREAT, after I found out how to \\&quot;charge it\\&quot; correctly.&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge these for 16 hours!&lt;br /&gt;2. They will discharge after being in the drawer for over a week or so, One review said his would hold a charge for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can charge it  when the unit is one half discharged, because of use.&lt;br /&gt;4. I like the way it feels and it trims my beard just as good, if not better, as when my barber trims it&lt;br /&gt;I would like to post this info. with a 5 Star rating; because that is what it is to me! but I can only post one review. So you won&#x27;t see this on a 5 Star review.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer from a well known brand. Very nice and recommended. It would get 5 stars if a charge lasted a bit longer but, this is my second one (son managed to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; my first) so I must think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Workhorse of a trimmer. Get&#x27;s the job done, actually better than other, more complex trimmers that I have had.</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure:  I purchased this shaver a Walmart, however, the product is the product, regardless of where purchased.  The shaver worked well for the first month. But, after that, it will not hold a charge, work while plugged in and it takes all night long to even start the shaver....then it only lasts for about 15 seconds.  Not sure if I simply have a lemon of a product or they&#x27;re all like this. But, for $10, live and learn.  UPDATE:  I did contact the company and they were kind enough to send me a new one and this one does work as advertised.  I&#x27;ve had no problems and so I am happy with it and I would give the company 5 stars for their prompt customer service.  NEW UPDATE:  Well, I mentioned in my last update that the company was kind enough to send me a new one and for a while it did work.  However, I&#x27;ve run into the same problem again....it simply will not hold a charge.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  As before, I&#x27;d give them 5 stars for customer service, but zero stars for product quality.  So, this one is going in the trash and I will get another model and brand.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon but from Big Lots at the same price. I have not read any other reviews but my opinion is this is exactly what you pay for, a very cheap trimmer. It&#x27;s main problem is it has to be totally charged up before it will even turn on. If you are like me, you use this thing about once every two weeks. If you keep it unplugged you cannot just plug it in and have it work. The damn thing has to charge all the way before it will even turn on. In all fairness, when it does work it does a respectable job although a little weak on power. It sometimes will pull a hair instead of cutting it. OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 9 bucks I figure if it lasts a year I&#x27;ve got my money back</li>
    <li> I have a Persian cat that I cannot keep un-matted, no matter how much brushing.  This worked great at cutting out the mats.  Trimming right down to the skin without ever nicking him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge will last 25-30 min. continually cutting fine cat hair.  By that time his patience and my patience are gone, and it is time for a break anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10 compared to groomers fees you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This would have been a really good trimmer, but it is made with a faulty NiCd battery. It was fully charged before use, per instructions. As I was using it the power completely dropped out only to surge back to full power again but two minutes later. If this would have been made with a quality battery/plug in option, it would have made a good trimmer, as it does a good job cutting closely and this is coming from the viewpoint of a professional cosmetologist.To say the least, I am no longer impressed by Remington products and will most likely be sticking with Norelco from now on, even with their cheap plastic guards..</li>
    <li> I love it! Best trimmer for the money!</li>
    <li> I had an older Remington trimmer for several years and loved it. This one has also been great so far. After reading the reviews about poor battery life, the first thing I did was charge it overnight and then turned it on the next morning and just let it run for about 25 minutes to make sure it would keep going - it did. It&#x27;s been working great for me and the attachments are much more functional than those I tried on a Philips trimmer. The Philips would not lift the hairs up to cut them. It would probably have worked if my facial hair grew straight out, but it tends to lay down on my skin and needs something to pick it up in order to cut it. The Remington attachments work great and seem to be made of a high quality plastic with a little flexibility, not hard and brittle.  They also have rounded tips so they won&#x27;t poke you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that this one will last me several years just like the last one. I hope others also get ones with good batteries.</li>
    <li> Great price, however, the blades have trouble moving when you don&#x27;t have the plastic piece on the end. It also doesn&#x27;t come with oil which I&#x27;m assuming would help.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver at walmart about a year ago.  Waste of money.  Little to no battery life.  The attachments seemed cheap.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews about this trimmer around the internet so I&#x27;m here to give my take on it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what all the complaints and bad reviews are about...I think people&#x27;s expectations might be too high for a $10 beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for two weeks now (using it every other day to trim up my neck line and cheeks) and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since day one. Maybe people aren&#x27;t aware that they&#x27;re supposed to fully charge all electronics first before they use them?? I&#x27;ve read that with beard trimmers, it&#x27;s best to charge them overnight before first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with 4 separate attachments for different lengths of trimming (not that flimsy looking all-in-one clicker) and that&#x27;s about it it...no stand/charging station, no oil, no brush, no bag, not even a blade cover. This thing is no frills. Trimmer, charger, attachments. I would have liked to see a couple more accessories but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically bought it to replace the my Wahl Groomsman 9918 when the charger broke. Luckily, this new charger works on that one too! Wahl was going to charge me about $9 to send me a new charger anyway. So for two bucks more, I got a new trimmer. Score. It&#x27;s not built as well as my Groomsman - I really liked the stainless steel sturdiness - but this one is light, feels nice in my hand and cuts really smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky about everything I buy and I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, especially for the price. Had I read all the bad reviews, I probably would have gone with something else. Seriously people, it&#x27;s a $10 beard trimmer. If you don&#x27;t like it or you got a defective one, take advantage of that 60-day money back guarantee that&#x27;s written on the box in large print.</li>
    <li> number one it came in a cardboard box. not the original box. number two it doesn&#x27;t even work well. it looks used</li>
    <li> For a cheap and older model, this thing gets the job done, i don&#x27;t even need an hour to trim.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does all I need it to do for a great price. It&#x27;s small size and attachments allow you to trim all areas in need.</li>
    <li> It holds a charge and is pretty powerful!</li>
    <li> Battery drains fast. Even if you keep it full charged and dont use it for a month or so the battery is dead. Takes long time to charge.</li>
    <li> The Only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the price. The battery is horrible, doesnt hold a charge long enough to do much of anything, and the worst part is you cant just plug it in and use it, you have to wait forever for it to charge the battery.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and mine works great and keeps a charge.</li>
    <li> Stays charged and trims very well.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Just needed a replacement razor after our old one died (same one died due to battery).  Didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole new kit but was able to get just the razor for a cheap price.  So far the battery is ok, just charge as directed so it doesn&#x27;t die.  Only had a couple months but thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Good reliable product at great price</li>
    <li> I bought it, and it works very well, the battery is great, also, before the first time to use it, you must charge it for 16 hours.</li>
    <li> Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Just as good as more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is the quality of the item is slightly cheap.</li>
    <li> For $10 this thing works just fine, however its limitation can be a deal breaker despite the low price.  Short and sweet, it does not hold a charge for very long.  So you have to keep this thing plugged in all the time or know 24 hours in advance when you will be using it.  Additionally, you can&#x27;t just plug a dead battery in and hope to use it on the cord.  It needs to charge.  If you&#x27;re ok with that, this trimmer works just fine and at $10 is a steal.</li>
    <li> The comb design is awesome. Unlike other adjustable combs, it doesn&#x27;t collapse easily casuing a &amp;#34;mistake&amp;#34;. And it&#x27;s washable unlike a WAHL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the engineer that designed the comb clearly didn&#x27;t design the battery system. It holds a charge for a minute or two. You have to leave it plugged in all the tim if you plan to use it. It loses charge almost completely if left in a drawaer over night. It doesn&#x27;t work to plug it in while running!!!! You have to chare for a couple hours, use for a couple minutes, then repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disapointing razor form a brand name that should know better.</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying there are many units on the market that are much better than this unit. But at a sub $20 price, none of those better units can compare. The charge holds for many days of use, it cuts clean and feels good in your hand. Bottom line, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Another great product from Remington.</li>
    <li> Trims well and seems to have a good charge-life.&lt;br /&gt;I like the rechargeable feature rather than replacing batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also light making it good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  Even plugged into the wall the thing feels like it is running out of battery.  Avoid.</li>
    <li> The cut is perfect.....however, it does not hold a charge.</li>
    <li> Review updated. Customer service people were very helpful. They even had my trimmer replaced. And the new is perfect Very satisfied. My only complain was that on the description it says: Cord/Cordless operation with 30 minute runtime.... But in fact if the device is not fully charged it will not work even if it is plugged in.</li>
    <li> I have to keep it plugged in and even then use it sparingly or the battery dies out within a couple minutes and I have to recharge it</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I rated it one star for those of you who are looking at why others rated this one star. Everyone rating this one star is complaining that the battery takes a long time to charge and they would have to plug it in the night before using it, and that that&#x27;s a hassle. I&#x27;m pretty sure that most bathrooms in which someone would groom themselves has an outlet in which they can plug in the trimmer. Maybe you can just, oh I don&#x27;t know, leave it plugged in as you would a radio or lamp. It would always have juice in the battery and give you a nice groom whenever you need. Seriously, don&#x27;t not buy this because some idiots couldn&#x27;t think to leave it plugged in before and after every use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the seller is very efficient.</li>
    <li> The reason it will not run on the cord is it only has a 50ma charger.  If you plug in a 500ma to 1 amp charger it will buzz away nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The charger should be 3 volts.  I&#x27;m not sure if this has an internal regulator so don&#x27;t leave the high amp charger on very long or you will fry the batteries.</li>
    <li> charger do not working!</li>
    <li> Only bought it for thee charger I have about 5 of these and love it but the chargers suck.</li>
