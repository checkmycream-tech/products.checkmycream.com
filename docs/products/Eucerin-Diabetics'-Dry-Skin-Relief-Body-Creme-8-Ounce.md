### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>, my cuticles look great!</li>
      <li>very good lotion!</li>
      <li>This is great!</li>
      <li>works great!</li>
      <li>boy, did it ever work great!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is the best moisturizer I have t ever run across!  </li>
      <li>And the best part was that the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>They suggest that you apply it immediately after bathing or showering for best results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just very good at calming your skin.</li>
      <li>(which is a great bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doing a great job there as well.  </li>
      <li>Happily, this Eurcerin skin cream likewise contains no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>great stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eurcerin is a great moisturizing skin cream, whether you&#x27;re diabetic or not.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Think that&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>This works great as a body lotion</li>
      <li>but this has been best at making them look and feel better.</li>
      <li>It will soften your skin without irritation, and then scent is pleasant.</li>
      <li>on the packaging does it say what makes this a good match for diabetics.</li>
      <li>but this is so good</li>
      <li>We love this!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After a week of using the Diabetic cream, my skin is still symptom free and feels great.</li>
      <li>Goes on great, leaves your skin feeling fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Foot files and pumice stones can be kind of ackward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found that I liked this product best when used on my arms and legs and body, but not so much on my hands.  </li>
      <li>I liked how it felt like a protective layer as soon as it was applied.  </li>
      <li>He says this cream is the best he&#x27;s tried -- his feet are looking and feeling much better after just this first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s mainly a matter of price and the \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; factor -- one must shop around for the best choices.</li>
      <li>It goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>The ones most effective at dispelling the dryness all seemed to leave a greasy residue</li>
      <li>I used another product, but this one works better and is more effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is the best hand creme I&#x27;ve tried so far, and definitely the best one made by Eucerin.</li>
      <li>This cream is very light.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This cream is great - it really leaves your skin feeling refreshed</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be exposed to the sun much more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>sure hope they improve the shipping packaging, though.  </li>
      <li>It needs the protection of a box or a lot more protective padding inside the envelope.  </li>
      <li>Since this Eucerine was in a squeeze bottle, I was sure it would be more liquid and thus easier to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I had too many questions and concerns to recommend it.    </li>
      <li>Okay, no.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Note most (all?)</li>
      <li>I am so glad I got this cream.  </li>
      <li>so I felt confident ordering this cream.  </li>
      <li>Cuticles are much better now.</li>
      <li>it’s been more than three-days, and I haven’t heard anything.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It felt more like a lotion than a creme to me.  </li>
      <li>His fingers and hands now looks much better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The lotion does leave your hands fairly oily for a while, and it can take quite a while until it&#x27;s fully absorbed and they stop feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>More than one person here has commented on that.</li>
      <li>I had been washing the lotion off my hands after using it because I didn&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love Eucerin products.  </li>
      <li>This cream is the best for dry skin that I have every used</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re suffering with dry and cracked skin, this body cream is an excellent choice.  </li>
      <li>, another downside, alpha hydroxy makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn, so if you are a shun-the-sun freckly freak like me, its best to use this in spots that are sun protected, in other words, covered by clothing or a mutli spectum</li>
      <li>I have tried many other lotions but this one seems to be the best for my condition.  </li>
      <li>Also, another downside, alpha hydroxy makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn, so if you are a shun-the-sun freckly freak like me, its best to use this in spots that are sun protected, in other words, covered by clothing or a mutli spectum sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams and lotions over the years and while I&#x27;ve liked some, none has really stood out as a favorite.  </li>
      <li>This is a fairly non-greasy, creamy lotion at a reasonable price as these things go.</li>
      <li>I think they wanted to make it easy to absorb into the skin</li>
      <li>This body crème is nice, but it&#x27;s not as good as a competing brand, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.</li>
      <li>so I really like the tube, it fits nicely into my purse to carry to work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is fragrance free, meaning no pronounced scent, but there is a scent per say.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The creme goes on smooth and is cooling.</li>
      <li>but it made it easier to smooth and rub into my skin.</li>
      <li>Not totally gone but greatly improved.</li>
      <li>I use it every night and my body feels so smooth</li>
      <li>and she said it was to lighten and smooth the skin of the elbow, something to do with citric acid.  </li>
      <li>and she said it was to lighten and smooth the skin of the elbow, something to do with citric acid.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions and creams, they all feel good going on but don&#x27;t seem to work any deeper.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and smooth without being sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does absorb fairly quickly, and it has a very mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>But I HIGHLY recommend that you do your own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is easy and smooth to apply and is easily absorbed.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin products have a rating on a 5 point scale from 1&#x3D;light to 5-rich and the Original Healing rates a 5.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Though I wrote to the company asking exactly why this product is supposed to be better for diabetics. . .</li>
      <li>This is a remarkable product that will totally improve the feel of your skin.</li>
      <li>My hands got much better, even after the first application.  </li>
      <li>Great source of moisture for diabetics with severe dry skin.</li>
      <li>I would rate this one good on greasiness (there is some, but less than most) and OK on price (a bit higher than some).  </li>
      <li>8 ounce tube is good amount, will last through the winter and then some.</li>
      <li>For me a creme is much thicker and has to have more effort to work it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that would suit me better but in fact I found it to be very greasy.</li>
      <li>Good news, also, that you can purchase via Subscribe and Save which will get you 15% off the regular</li>
      <li>There is some mild, non-offensive scent to it but nothing that lingers or is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it does absorb quickly.</li>
      <li>Will most likely be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I am looking for a good body lotion because I am old and winter REALLY takes it out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cannot really comment yet, on how effective it is, but will update as I have more time to see how it works, but it appears to be a good moisturizing cream with, perhaps, a boost from some of the other ingredients as far as softening and smoothing the skin.  </li>
      <li>-No unpleasant odor.    </li>
      <li>It comes in a large tube with a flip-top cap and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It moisturized well, and absorbed fairly quickly on my body but did not seem to absorb as quickly on my hands</li>
      <li>but it good for any dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soothing and creamy textrue.</li>
    <li> I have found this crème to be extremely useful in reducing and at times eliminating itching and aching on my legs due to diabetes and sores from wearing compression stockings on a daily basis.  I have tried many other lotions but this one seems to be the best for my condition.  A little more expensive than some others but for me it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This provides moisture to protect against winter or any time you need it.  I liked how it felt like a protective layer as soon as it was applied.  My hands stopped hurting and were calmed once it was rubbed in.  Cracks or other sensitive areas do get an initial reaction of &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; but no more than washing hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me though, it has a slight medicine like smell.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell so you may not even notice it.  You will have to have it by your nose to smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt more like a lotion than a creme to me.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the greasiest feeling I&#x27;ve tried but it still felt slimey to me for a creme.  For me a creme is much thicker and has to have more effort to work it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product but I would prefer it to be a little thicker.  I think they wanted to make it easy to absorb into the skin but it also made it too  liquid for me.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief body creme is a topical lotion. Testing blood glucose multiple times a day is hard on skin and Eucerin provides moisture and is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;The creme goes on smooth and is cooling. However, it takes a long time to be absorbed and, despite claims, feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;There is a warning on the label about using sunscreen when using this product because of alpha hydroxy acids.&lt;br /&gt;Using the term &amp;#34;diabetic&amp;#34; on the label is meaningless  because there is no indication that this creme does anything to aid diabetic skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;This creme is no better than competing products but IS more expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best moisturizer I have t ever run across!  Very slight odor, not at all unpleasant.  Silky feel, not oily.  8 ounce tube is good amount, will last through the winter and then some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry skin cremes over the years, many of them by Eucerin, and I gotta say this is my favorite so far. I don&#x27;t have diabetes or anything like that, but since my hands get pretty dry during the winter season I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m glad I did. I usually use this before bed because I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling these cremes usually leave me with, but this one wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. It dried pretty quickly but it left my hands feeling moisturized. And the best part was that the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I didn&#x27;t even notice much of an odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best hand creme I&#x27;ve tried so far, and definitely the best one made by Eucerin. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Great source of moisture for diabetics with severe dry skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted. Works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes but I do have dry skin, especially in winter. I thought this would be a richer cream than what it is but it is pretty moisturizing. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it does absorb quickly. While there isn&#x27;t any fragrance added, I don&#x27;t quite like the smell. This works great as a body lotion but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:I am changing this to 5 stars. I had been washing the lotion off my hands after using it because I didn&#x27;t love the smell. But I stopped and after a few days I really do notice a difference, my cuticles look great! I am fully sold on this product.</li>
    <li> Remains sticky after applied. Hubby won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This body crème is nice, but it&#x27;s not as good as a competing brand, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. First of all, it is too expensive. $11 for one tube?? I&#x27;ve been using a better lotion that costs half the price of this one. Secondly, it just doesn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth and soft I as I was expecting. If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I might purchase it again in the future, because it is a nice lotion.</li>
    <li> Love it. All day moisturizing.</li>
    <li> very good lotion! works great!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st cream that has relieved my dry skin in the way I would hope a cream would work.  I used it daily for a month and then was able to reduce used to alternate days.  Think that&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m now using it every 3rd day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My husband has eczema.  His skin is so dry on his legs it looks like fish scales.  I have been looking for a moisturizer that would work for longer than a few hours and this is it!  His skin looks smooth, and even the bumps due to the severe dryness on his feet have gone away.  We love this!  It is amazing.  I wish I had taken a before and after picture.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best for dry skin that I have every used</li>
    <li> Eucerin Original Healing (B001FB5IIC) is Eucerin&#x27;s flagship product, and if you have troublesome dry skin it is tough to beat.  Note most (all?) Eucerin products have a rating on a 5 point scale from 1&#x3D;light to 5-rich and the Original Healing rates a 5.  While it does work it is a pain to apply.  It is a thick paste and does not easily spread over wide areas of skin.  What I really like about Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Body Cr&amp;egrave;me us that you get nearly the benefit of the Original Healing formula, yet it is easy and smooth to apply and is easily absorbed.  It rates a 4 on the rich-o-meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are NOT a diabetic and wondering if this will work for you, the answer is &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;, as neither am I a diabetic, but I did appreciate the smoothness and moisturizing of this produc</li>
    <li> works well.  I used another product, but this one works better and is more effective.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product - in the past I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the quality of Eucerin products - they do make some very high-quality (and not necessarily cheap) skin care products.  I&#x27;m not sure what makes this particular product marketable to diabetics - to me this just seems to be a marketing gimmick to boost sales.  I am not a diabetic but didn&#x27;t hesitate to give this creme a try - winter has left my skin in serious need of moisture on a daily basis, particularly my hands which tend to crack if I don&#x27;t moisturize often.  I found that I liked this product best when used on my arms and legs and body, but not so much on my hands.  It moisturized well, and absorbed fairly quickly on my body but did not seem to absorb as quickly on my hands so I don&#x27;t think I would use it as a hand moisturizer.  It helped relive the dry skin and itch that is a result of the dry winter air - even later in the day my skin did not feel dry and itchy like it normally does a few hours after applying a body creme. While the label does say &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t have any scent at all, it just means they have not added anything to enhance the scent.  There is some mild, non-offensive scent to it but nothing that lingers or is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a concern about the inclusion of alpha-hydroxy in the ingredients.  While this is included to help remove dead skin and soften, it does also make you more sensitive to the sun.  While this isn&#x27;t a concern for me in the winter-time where I don&#x27;t spend much time outdoors, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I will be using much after winter is over and I&#x27;ll be exposed to the sun much more.  If I were a big outdoors person this would be an important factor to consider before purchasing this creme.</li>
    <li> Works well on dry skin. Cuticles are much better now.</li>
    <li> I usually like Eucerin brand of creams so I felt confident ordering this cream.  I am so glad I got this cream.  It has a very different feel than other creams and I have tried lots of creams.  This cream is very light.  It is not heavy or greasy.  I don&#x27;t really know why it is named as Diabetes Dry Skin Relief but it good for any dry skin.  And I also like the fact that it fragrance free since I use it frequently.</li>
    <li> My legs are in terrible shape and I don&#x27;t think any cream will cure my problem but this has been best at making them look and feel better. I&#x27;ll buy this regularly. After my second purchase though, I&#x27;m concerned about pricing.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how much this &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; cost but when I first bought this, it cost half the current price for 2 tubes.  When I bought recently, the price had doubled..... from 6something to 13 something.  I thought that I would still get 2 tubes but received only one.  Thirteen bucks for one tube seems way to high!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a product containing alpha hydroxy, I guess I thought it was just a gimmicky add in, like saying something has real marigold powder (okay, I&#x27;ve never seen anything with marigold powder, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time looking at lotions).  But you know what I mean, an extract or tincture that doesn&#x27;t really add anything to the lotion but wishful thinking and fairydust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my hopes for this product were pretty moderate.  I have a jar of Eucerine and for many years it has been a part of my daily beauty regimen.  Regular eucerine is very thick and not easily absorbed, I mostly use it on my feet and occasionally on my hands during the dry parts of the year.  Since this Eucerine was in a squeeze bottle, I was sure it would be more liquid and thus easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this lotion is more liquidy than regular eucerine and has a small amount of fragrance.  Fragrance isn&#x27;t listed in the ingredients, but it is present and was a bit offputting for me since I carefully (obsessively) avoid all fragrances.  I was pretty disappointed with the smell, regular jars of Eucerine are fragrance free.  But the odor quickly dissipated and since I didn&#x27;t plan to use it on my face, I didn&#x27;t experience any negative fragrance effects (i.e., migraines, sore throats or rashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use I put the lotion on my left arm only.  On my right I used Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion like I always do when I get out of the shower.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference until the next morning during my shower.  My left elbow and arm felt slippery smooth.  It was a little weird at first, I felt like I needed to rinse the area again to clear the slippery sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and my dry, pink elbows really stand out in contrast.  With just one use, my left elbow was noticeably smoother and less pink than the right one, the bumpy dry parts on my upper arms were smoother too.  Years ago I saw a movie with Barbara Streisand, I think it was Funny Girl, anyway, she put a cut lemon on her elbow.  It was so bizarre and random a thing to do that I thought to myself, &#x27;Babs, what the hell are you doing!&#x27;.  I asked my mother about it and she said it was to lighten and smooth the skin of the elbow, something to do with citric acid.  I was pretty amazed and never got around to trying it, probably because whenever I have lemons I make salad dressing with them and use the rinds for flavored salts, anyways, I guess I just never have a spare one to use for a cosmetic purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, back to this lotion, it is pretty amazing, I think the small amount of alpha hydroxy (which is an acid, but stronger than citric) is the miracle worker here, just enough to make a difference, but not enough to require a trip to the dermatologist and script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side is the fragrance, which I previously mentioned and that it can be a bit irritating.  After how well it worked on my arm, I gave the lotion a try on my face.  Honestly, I must have been sleep deprived and operating on less than full charge, because my face is super duper crazy-making sensitive and I usually don&#x27;t try anything new on it.  Like usual, my skin felt burned and turned blotchy and radishy after just one application, so ugly.  I had to use cold compresses and coconut oil to soothe my irritated skin.  After around two days my skin looked normal again, but for that first day, yowza.  So for me this is a no face creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another downside, alpha hydroxy makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn, so if you are a shun-the-sun freckly freak like me, its best to use this in spots that are sun protected, in other words, covered by clothing or a mutli spectum sunscreen.n her elbow.

    <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes but it runs in my family and I know that skin care is important because cracked dry skin can be the entry way for germs and serious health problems for diabetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am looking for a good body lotion because I am old and winter REALLY takes it out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this Eucerin (diabetics) Body lotion has that other products in their lines don&#x27;t have is Urea and synthetic lipids called &amp;#34;pseudo-ceramides&amp;#34;. My mom-sleuthing and the internetz turned up the fact that Urea binds with water and helps skin by providing moisture and creating a protective barrier. The pseudo-ceramides, which are apparently derived from wheat, do much the same thing. And both are found naturally as part of healthy skin --although not derived from wheat obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, as we get older or as we develop illnesses our skin isn&#x27;t able to provide them in the same quantities. Lotions like this one are supposed to fill in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY OBSERVATIONS&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy. I just got through using Eucerin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Professional Repair Body Lotion&amp;#34; which is supposed to be more &#x27;heavy weight&#x27;. You&#x27;d think that would suit me better but in fact I found it to be very greasy. So that unless you need that sort of coverage I suspect like me that you&#x27;d like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dry Skin Relief is not greasy. It&#x27;s a mid-weight white lotion that goes on easy and which vanishes in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed immediately --because I have been washing a lot of dishes lately-- is that my hands not only felt better, they were less wrinkled! I was surprised at the results. My hands had really been looking weathered and wrinkly when I extended my fingers. All the wrinkles aren&#x27;t gone but the small ones are, and my skin looks more flexible/resilient and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;**This product can make you sensitive to the sun, so heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised at the results. There was a dramatic change in the appearance of my hands. And my elbows actually do not feel like elephant skin.was a dramatic change in the appearance of my hands. And my elbows actually do not feel like elephant skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure how they make their product &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; differently than others since almost all have the same ingredients; mainly water/mineral oil but this stuff is heavnly for my skin. I would suggest it to anyone looking to help take care of dry skin problems; this stuff works head to toes!</li>
    <li> Hooray! My legs aren&#x27;t itchy anymore! I was afraid this might be greasy or too thick, but it&#x27;s not. It goes on very easily. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this to my feet every morning and do see a slight improvement in regards to the dry, cracked skin there. I hope it keeps helping through this rugged winter.</li>
    <li> What a difference this has made on my diabetic skin issues on my legs.  Not totally gone but greatly improved.</li>
    <li> I am not a diabetic, but I do have really dry skin, particularly in these winter months, so I figured that if there was a really effective cream that I could try, it was certainly worth a shot.  This cream is great - it really leaves your skin feeling refreshed and it&#x27;s not overly oily feeling like some creams can be.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, it seems to work quite well to soothe itchy and dry skin. I use mine as a hand lotion so I really like the tube, it fits nicely into my purse to carry to work. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent of this lotion, it smells like the other Eucerin lotions so if you like the scent of the other&#x27;s this one won&#x27;t bother you. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish this Eucerin Diabetic&#x27;s Dry Skin Relief Body Cr&amp;egrave;me were a little thicker, because Iam using it on my feet, where the heels of my feet get very dry due to not wearing shoes in my house.  I only either wear socks or slipper socks, or occasionally I do go barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alpha hydroxy in this body cr&amp;egrave;me does help get rid of the tough dry skin, but I kind of do it in layers, which if this body cr&amp;egrave;me were thicker it would make it easier to get rid of the rough dry skin the first time you apply it.  Instead I apply it then scrap off the dead skin, then apply more, then put on socks to seal it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have found that works better is petroleum jelly, which is thicker, so it seems to last longer.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions and creams, they all feel good going on but don&#x27;t seem to work any deeper.  At least this Eucerin Diabetes Dry Skin Relief Body Cr&amp;egrave;me does.  I like to slather it on in a thick layer, then put on socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know from my dad who was a diabetic that you really need to pay attention to your feet.  Foot files and pumice stones can be kind of ackward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fragrance free, meaning no pronounced scent, but there is a scent per say.  They say it provides 24 hour moisture, as do many other products.  I never find that to be so.  They suggest that you apply it immediately after bathing or showering for best results.  Safe for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am not a diabetic, but I do have dry skin, especially during the winter. This cream is a wonder. It is not greasy or oily, but it does help heal dry, rough skin. Since it is a body cream I apply it to my legs and arms right after bathing, daily to protect the dry skin. I recommend this body cream to anyone diabetic or not who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> Although I am not a diabetic, I got this product because my skin has been so dry because of the weather. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It made my skin feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it softened my skin without making it feel greasy. It&#x27;s rich and smooth without being sticky or greasy. I highly recommend this cream for anyone who has dry skin, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s your feet, hands or the rest of your body. It will soften your skin without irritation, and then scent is pleasant. It&#x27;s just very good at calming your skin.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz and ordered it for my diabetic mother. Before purchasing, I read the ingredients at a retail store and saw that it does not have methylparaben or other harmful ingredients. Other Eucerin products do have these harmful ingredients. After buying this for Mom because it was cheaper than the store, I will order another one for me because I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Does help to relieve dry skin but didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this product and any of the other Eucerin skin creme products I use on a daily basis.  As with all but the really, really thick Eucerin creme in a jar, this one too goes on non-greasy and soaks right in leaving skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> great stuff--my mom uses this for her legs and arms</li>
    <li> There is so much “wrong” with this product, I almost don’t know where to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the ingredients listed on Amazon are incorrect.  The correct list, and in the correct order, is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclomethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Sodium Lactate, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Pentylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shows it is “alpha hydroxy enriched”.  Alpha hydroxy acids are a group of natural acids found in food.  The particular alpha hydroxy acid in this product is Lactic Acid.  Alpha hydroxy acids are commonly found in products to treat acne.  They work to help remove the outer layer of dry / dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I wrote to the company asking exactly why this product is supposed to be better for diabetics. . . and was sent an auto-email that I should hear something within three-days. . . it’s been more than three-days, and I haven’t heard anything.  So I can only assume that they don’t really know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO idea why this product is supposed to be better for diabetics than any of their other products.  They make several different types of moisturizing creams / lotions and after searching the internet, I find no reason to use this product as a diabetic.  But I HIGHLY recommend that you do your own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shows that this cream is supposed to be non-greasy and fast-absorbing.  I do not find that to be the case at all.  I find it to be quite greasy and not fast-absorbing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally. . . . It does not state this on Amazon. . . but should. . . . On the bottle it states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This product contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which may increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  Use a sunscreen, war protective clothing and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.”re while using this product and for a week afterwards.”</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands and continuing problems with eczema, and it&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t broadcast its presence with cloying odor.  The Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Body Cream meets all of my criteria.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for a week now, and my hands are noticeably smoother and softer.  They aren&#x27;t itching as much, either (which is a great bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is advertised for diabetics, so I had my husband try it for a week as well.  He has had diabetes for about 15 years now, and he&#x27;s tried a number of products for help with his dry, cracked feet and legs.  He says this cream is the best he&#x27;s tried -- his feet are looking and feeling much better after just this first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re suffering with dry and cracked skin, this body cream is an excellent choice.  I&#x27;ll certainly be buying it from here on out.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pros:  -It did make my hands softer/smoother.  -No unpleasant odor.    However, I had too many questions and concerns to recommend it.    Concerns:  -Nowhere on the packaging does it say what makes this a good match for diabetics.This seems like a huge marketing fail.Is this the regular Eucerin with a \\&quot;Diabetic\\&quot; stamp? There&#x27;s no way to tell.  -It says that the alpha hydroxy ingredient makes your skin sensitive to sun, even a week after using the product. It recommends using sunscreen. I don&#x27;t want to layer product after product and chemical after chemical on my skin.  -It took a long time to absorb. I put it on my hands in the bathroom and then I couldn&#x27;t touch the doorknob because my hands were so greasy.  -My hands stung for a long time.  -Hours later, when I washed my hands, the water seemed to repel and my hands felt really slimy.    For all of these reasons, I would not purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Heating and air conditioning tend to lower the humidity and really dry out the air in a room, wreaking havoc on dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many creams and lotions over the years and while I&#x27;ve liked some, none has really stood out as a favorite.  The ones most effective at dispelling the dryness all seemed to leave a greasy residue so I was loathe to touch anything until all the lotion was finally absorbed or wiped off.  Although it moisturizes very well, Eucerin doesn&#x27;t present that problem.  Immediately after applying it to my hands, I can pick up a book or my knitting without worrying about leaving stains behind.  Of course, it&#x27;s not just for hand care.  I slather it all over after a shower and my skin stays soft and moisturized for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it really works and it&#x27;s fragrance-free, my husband likes it and has started using it too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes. But during winter, I get dry, chapped skin. On the hands, arms, and legs. This is because, even in winter, I wear a T-shirt and shorts. (It only gets into the 50s at night, here in Southern California, but the wind from November till Spring is usually very dry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use [[ASIN:B001FV5XA0 Beta-Ginseng Hydrating Day Creme]], because it contains no fragrance. Happily, this Eurcerin skin cream likewise contains no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Eurcerin overnight, on my hands, arms, and legs. It worked well, softening my dry skin. Eurcerin feels a bit thinner and sticker than [[ASIN:B001FV5XA0 Beta-Ginseng]], which in turn feels thicker and oilier. Which is not to say that Eurcerin is sticky. Both skin creams dry well enough, soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eurcerin is a great moisturizing skin cream, whether you&#x27;re diabetic or not.</li>
    <li> I am a lotion junkie and I use several different brands for hands, body and feet while always on the lookout for a new variety. While I prefer a scented lotion this one passed my high standards for helping to moisturize and soften my skin while repairing it due to the added bonus of it including lpha hydroxy to assist in gently exfoliating my cells. I was surprised that is wasn&#x27;t as thick as I expected but it made it easier to smooth and rub into my skin. I loved the smooth silky feeling I had after using it for several days as it truly helped turn over dead skin leaving a refreshed version that was soft to the touch. It&#x27;s worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> I really like this Eucerin cream.  It feels almost greasy as it goes on, but it quickly absorbs and leaves a dry, silky feeling.  I’ve always had very dry skin, and in the winter it seems as if I go through gallons of moisturizers, not just after my shower but all day long.  Eucerin’s moisturizing effects are long lasting, and it adds virtually no fragrance of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope they improve the shipping packaging, though.  It arrived in a padded envelope – an envelope full of Eucerin cream, since the cap had been twisted off and broken in shipping.  It needs the protection of a box or a lot more protective padding inside the envelope.  Even a plastic-wrap seal around the cap would have helped keep it from being twisted off.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly non-greasy, creamy lotion at a reasonable price as these things go. It has ingredients similar to other creams as well as the AHA (Lactic Acid) and, also, I note, Urea (both help remove dead skin cells).  It comes in a large tube with a flip-top cap and is easy to use. I cannot really comment yet, on how effective it is, but will update as I have more time to see how it works, but it appears to be a good moisturizing cream with, perhaps, a boost from some of the other ingredients as far as softening and smoothing the skin.  Good news, also, that you can purchase via Subscribe and Save which will get you 15% off the regular price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does absorb fairly quickly, and it has a very mild fragrance. I am not a diabetic, but use this for itchy, dry skin (during low humidity winter months) on my legs and feet. It seems similar in effect to other Eczema and topical creams I&#x27;ve tried and less greasy than many. I have used other products with Urea and they are usually good at removing dead, dry skin cells and leave your heels, legs, and so on much smoother and nicer feeling. I would expect this cream to work the same based on the ingredients. So, it&#x27;s mainly a matter of price and the \\&quot;greasiness\\&quot; factor -- one must shop around for the best choices. I would rate this one good on greasiness (there is some, but less than most) and OK on price (a bit higher than some).  (It feels somewhat greasy on your hands during application, but much less so after it is absorbed by your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving four stars based on my initial impressions, but will update if that changes.</li>
    <li> The back of hands always dry out in the winter, but this year they got _really_ bad, so bad it was painful.  At that point I realized I needed some lotion.  My main problem was nearly all lotion has a very strong scent, and I just can&#x27;t stand to use it.  After looking over the selection at the store, I settled on this product because it was the only one I could find that certified itself as fragrance free.  I also figured it being designed for diabetics meant it would work really well on dry skin, even though I&#x27;m not diabetic myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And boy, did it ever work great!  My hands got much better, even after the first application.  Now, after about two weeks, they&#x27;re soft and supple, more so than I ever remember them being.  It works so well, I&#x27;ve started using it on my feet too, especially above my heel which gets really dry.  It&#x27;s doing a great job there as well.  While it does have a small scent to it, the scent dissipates very quickly and is not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does leave your hands fairly oily for a while, and it can take quite a while until it&#x27;s fully absorbed and they stop feeling oily.  (I tried to use my smartphone shortly after applying it he first time and ended up leaving a mess on the screen.) So I just wash my hands carefully, palms only, to avoid this problem if I use the lotion during the day.  I also use it right before bed and don&#x27;t wash it off to make sure the palms of my hands won&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have seriously dry skin, this lotion WILL solve the problem, and do so without overwhelming you with scent.</li>
    <li> Works very well for dry chapped skin. Relief is almost immediate. More than one person here has commented on that. Will most likely be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> My husband is a diabetic, and has dry hands and fingers.  This is the only crème that exfoliate (without excessive dryness) and moisturize at the same time.  His fingers and hands now looks much better.  Would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased Eucerin Diabetic&#x27;s Dry Skin Relief Body Creme as a stocking-stuffer for someone with diabetes. My first clue is that I had to drive around to several stores looking for it. Everyone was sold out! I finally found one bottle left on a shelf in a local store and snagged it immediately. We soon discovered why it was sold-out all over town. This stuff is great. And, I purchased it for a guy who thinks that all \\&quot;goop\\&quot; is the same, but suffered with itchy dry skin in the winter. Today, he confesses that \\&quot;this stuff feels great!\\&quot; Mission accomplished...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sitting on the fence about purchasing this item, go ahead and buy it because you will not be disappointed. This is a remarkable product that will totally improve the feel of your skin.</li>
    <li> Another great Eucerin product, this cream is slightly thicker than what you find in the pump bottle, but is essentially the same. I somewhat prefer the pump bottle of lotion over this tube of cream, but both work very well - better than any other brand of dry skin repair product. I still can&#x27;t figure out the &amp;#34;diabetic&#x27;s&amp;#34; part of the product name, though. If you have dry skin and you need some lotion to soothe it, it really shouldn&#x27;t matter if you are diabetic or not. As long as it works on EVERYBODY, I don&#x27;t see how the name of this product would do anything but limit the number of potential buyers.</li>
    <li> First of all, I think I like everything about Eucerin - we use their products all the time.  This new dry skin relief body crème is fantastic.  Usually these crèmes are so oily, but this one is better.  Goes on great, leaves your skin feeling fantastic.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Eucerin lotions. I have several kinds on hand at all times and keep a tube of the Intensive Hand Cream at my desk at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Diabetic Dry Skin Relief might just be my new favorite. While I do not have diabetes, I do have some issues with dry skin that require moisturization or I get an itchy rash. Up until now, I have used Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion during the winter months. This lotion has triple acting formula that moisturizes, exfoliates and conditions. The one negative to it is that is doesn’t soak in as well as I would like and can leave a greasy film on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Diabetic Dry Skin Relief Body Cream works just as well as the Intensive Repair Lotion, but it does not leave a greasy residue! It’s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using the Diabetic cream, my skin is still symptom free and feels great. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but I have extremely dry winter skin. I&#x27;ve been using this on my feet this week and there has not been a noticeable improvement over my regular lotions I use on the same areas. I use Eucerin Calming Cream at times but have mostly given it up for Aveeno in the past year because I get tired of the tubes and didn&#x27;t see a big difference. The consistency is closer to lotion that creme. My first thought when I squeezed this out of the tube was, &amp;#34;This is a creme?&amp;#34; Not in my book. It is moisturizing and its a fine lotion with little odor but I am knocking it for labeling that implies it is extra special for special needs. So when I don&#x27;t see something to justify fancy labeling and price, I am less than impressed and mark down a review accordingly. Finally, the following warning is really concerning: &amp;#34;This product contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which may increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.&amp;#34; Okay, no. I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need help being even more sun sensitive. No thanks.</li>
    <li> This is great! I use it every night and my body feels so smooth even my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Eucerin before but this is so good I&#x27;m going to be ordering it.</li>
    <li> I have horrible dry skin.  My hands and feet crack due to day to day wear.  I love Eucerin products.  This body creme is thick and absorbs right into the skin.  My feet don&#x27;t crack after applying this lotion.  Overall I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  I highly recommend it</li>
</ol>
