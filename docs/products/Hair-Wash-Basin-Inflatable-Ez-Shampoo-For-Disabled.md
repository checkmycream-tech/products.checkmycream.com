<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item I buy regularly for my homebound patients. It&#x27;s awesome invention.</li>
    <li> We were happy with this product and it worked better than we expected once we got the hang of it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to friend who is bedridden.  She told me today how nice it was to have her hair washed.  The Basin was a success.</li>
    <li> We were so excited to get this product for my bedridden mother and overall have been very pleased with the results.  However, the hose material needs to be improved as the kinks have never come out and it has impeded drainage.  Takes a little extra work, but worth it in the long run as alternatives are lacking.</li>
    <li> not as expected, sent back</li>
    <li> This was an absolutely amazing tool for my grandma to use when she was in hospice. 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> The drainin hose goes to the left of bed and does not drain  while washing hair. the area where the neck goes is to little and the hard plastic rubs against neck.</li>
    <li> You will love this basin, so perfect for my patient who is bedridden, she loves to have her hair done since getting this!!</li>
    <li> bowl is fine  but  hose is pinched  &amp; stops water from coming out, use many times and still won&#x27;t straigthen out.</li>
    <li> A marvelous tool for someone who cannot get out of bed.  So glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> very good product, makes a big difference when you do not have help in taking care of your sick love ones</li>
    <li> I havent had the chance to use it yet but through experience, I know it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone who is a care giver.  I have purchased this product 5 times for myself and other who are care givers.  Good quality, low price.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this basin, and I love the comfort that it provides for my 15 year old son and the ease that it provides for me. The first one lasted for almost 4 years! We recently got a home health aid to help give my son his baths, and he absolutely loved it and is currently trying to get the home hospice company that he works with to order them for the patients that would greatly benefit from it.</li>
    <li> poor rating from caregiver; not worth the trouble</li>
    <li> Wonderful invention.  My 78 year old mother who recently sufferred a stroke, and who is bedridden loves it.  We have comfortably and easily used this in her own bed and it is the easiest thing in the world. 100% effective and satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This basin is great.  When your loved one can&#x27;t get into the shower, it&#x27;s hard to get their hair really clean, especially long hair.  The drain can be a little tricky, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  Very nice design with the small pillow inside to support the head while you&#x27;re washing their hair.  The size is just right also.  It got here faster than expected which is always nice!!</li>
    <li> I needed this for my bedridden mother.  I was sceptical at first, the plastic seam on the head rest is protruding far out enough to be annoying.  I put a wash cloth over the area, and all turned out really well. The hose makes this convenient to empty,</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo basin for my elderly Grandmother who wanted me to wash her hair.  There are other ways to wash a bed-ridden person&#x27;s hair; however I found those techniques to be quite hard and somewhat frustrating. Why not buy a shampoo basin that allows less strain on the washer&#x27;s back and more comfort for the person having their hair washed?  I searched for days for a shampoo basin in stores which only resulted in my purchasing it on Amazon.  So glad I did, because I also purchased the water hose.  The material is durable and very easy to inflate + deflate.  YOU WILL NEED A PUMP TO INFLATE (it does NOT come with one).  I used my fitness ball pump to inflate it and that did the job well.</li>
    <li> I did not work well at all. The whole bed ended up getting wet. I would NOT recommend .</li>
    <li> My mother is in bed after a stroke. She can not take a shower. This is a great alternative!</li>
    <li> This makes washing my mother&#x27;s hair a lost easier since we have to do it while she isin the bed.</li>
    <li> Good ideal, but very messy</li>
    <li> This did the trick..made by bedridden Mom feel like she was in a hair salon.  I found it unnecessary to use the draining function..that was a little tricky and it is just as easy to empty it into a sink</li>
    <li> This basin is perfect to use on a bedridden patient.  Very confortable, easy to place under patient holds plenty of water, easy to drain.  Seal around neck is good no leakage.  Overall very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aid for washing hair of bedridden person.  I bought it for my mother and she said it was comfortable on her neck.  I did have to put a soft cloth where the plastic touched the sides of her face because the edge of the plastic seam was sharp.  The only other issue was that we had to constantly work with the drain hose so the water would drain out of the basin.  All in all -- it is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Finally an easy and comfortable way to wash my son&#x27;s hair. The product required a pump to inflate, but it went together great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent  product; performs beautifully. This is for my wife who has Alzheimer&#x27;s and it has made washing her hair very comfortable for her.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hairwashing tub after considering the purchase for some time. I decided to do so since a washcloth doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job in the summer.  I should not have waited - this really made it convenient to wash my son&#x27;s hair (he&#x27;s ill and can&#x27;t always get out of bed) easily and quickly.  The only drawback is that the drain hose is on the right side of the device, so it takes a while to empty if you are accessing a person&#x27;s hair from your right.     Don&#x27;t be intimidated by this tub - it is a lot easier to use than it looks and keeps the bed dry (use towels underneath as well).  Simply inflate, have your patient roll onto it, pour water gently and start washing.  It drains into a bucket as you wash so you&#x27;re not left with a big tub of water to empty when you&#x27;re done.      I ordered this and had it delivered local express.  So glad I did!</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I bought.  The first one I bought at the medical supply store and it seemed like it was made out of a thinner plastic.  It held up for 2 years and we use it all of the time.  I did have to patch the first one once because of my stupidity but the patch kit that comes with it works great.  This one is very nice also.  I clean and dry it after each use but after a couple of years they seem to get a bit gunky.  I would suggest this for anyone who cannot get in the shower because you get a better wash than with one of the thin trays that are out there.  They used the thin tray for my mom when she was in bed and it seemed to splash everywhere and did not seem to get her hair as clean.</li>
    <li> This makes life so much easier.  I&#x27;m fulltime caregiver for my mom who can no longer stand at a sink or get into and out of the shower.  I wish I had thought of it.</li>
    <li> great tried one bought two more for back up</li>
    <li> Hair wash basin works well with one exception, the hose is on the left side! The only way to reach me is on the right side of the bed and the hose crimps if tucked under the basin. So, we had to flip it over so the hose could drain correctly.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for my mother in Hospice.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> i wash my handicap sister&#x27;s hair in bed and this basin work&#x27;s great !! no spill&#x27;s or water all over,she stay&#x27;s dry and so does the bed,love it !!!</li>
    <li> the no-wash out shampoos just weren&#x27;t enough for very particular elderly-- home health aide suggested the inflatable EZ shampoo basin &amp; it&#x27;s a great idea, especially for those non- &amp; semi-ambulatory folks that must have a bed bath-- we also purchased an inexpensive a/c air pump for this that is great with other inflatables, ie mattresses, children&#x27;s toys, etc, too--we even do hair coloring in this basin &amp; it rinses easily &amp; quickly.  we leave it inflated &amp; store it in a shower (that is no longer used), along with other items now necessary for hygiene outside of a tub/shower-- it dries quickly &amp; thoroughly as long as you follow the easy care instructions.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the inflating hair basins like these don&#x27;t work well. They are uncomfortable to lay in, draining is difficult, and they don&#x27;t hold water well. Using a trash bag draped across the side of the bed is a better choice.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully for my mother when she needed it!</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;nt read the instructions carefully.There is a plug in the bottom of the basin. You really should open it before you start the shampoo.Boy is my face red.My brother forgave me an let me wash his hair again. Great product! Thanks again, Shirley W. Denver,Colorado</li>
    <li> Was never really able to wash my sister&#x27;s hair without getting the water in her eyes and ears.  Then, when I purchased this product, what a difference for her and for me.  She has cerebral palsy and lives with us in our home.  I am her full-time caregiver and she has a hard time bending her head backwards to get her hair washed.  With the great pillow in the center of the well, just where her head rests and the ledge, her head is cradled perfectly and washing her hair has never been easier.  The best $20 I have ever spent!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;A &amp;#34; for the shape &amp; quality. But an &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for the tiny drain hose.With such a small drain &amp; skinny hose, it takes forever to drain.  If they address that issue, the perfect product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product we love using it</li>
    <li> With my bed ridden patient is kinda hard. Hole in the hose should be placed in the other opposite side, what happen the hose flatten in bed while in used water stock doesnt flow. I have to discharge the soiled water from shampooing manually so i can throughly rinse again the hair with clean water</li>
    <li> This has helped so much in the care of my bed ridden husband. Made it so much easier to keep his hear washed without so much mess. I advise everyone who has a person in their home that is bed ridden to get this.</li>
    <li> Do not know what We would do without it taking care of a bedridden patient is not easy but this makes my day a little easier.</li>
    <li> hard plastic and head cannot fit in there i would not reccomned it. the drain is no good either very hard to drain the water and catches on the hair</li>
    <li> Conventient, and comfortable for the patient. Easy to empty out too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Aunt who is in a nursing home, she was able to get her hair colored as she wanted with this !  A little trouble with the drain hose, but other than that, it worked out great for her.</li>
    <li> I love it. I had bought one about 2 years ago that was a different brand from our local medical store and it wasn&#x27;t have as good as this one that I bought from amazon. Thank you amazon my husband loves it. The material is more softer but yet more comfortable for my husband.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t what I had envisioned. The plastic has rough edges around where the head goes, the hose to drain the water didn&#x27;t work. It kinked constantly. It is large and cumbersome, does not work for someone that is truly bedridden.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention for washing someone who is bed bound or on bed rest. Highly recommended for anyone that needs something like this.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my Grandmother&#x27;s hair, and it does the job pretty well. There are two things I don&#x27;t like about it, which is why it lost a star. First, when completely inflated, your ears get pinched in the neck support. However, this problem is easily solved by either putting towels between the ears and wash basin, or slightly deflating the basin itself. Second, the drainage hose comes folded up and is nearly impossible to straighten because of the folds. I fixed this by replacing the hose with a segment purchased at the hardware store. However, the hose that came attached to the basin was glued on and had to be very carefully cut off. Its probably more of a three-star item for people who are unwilling or unable to modify the items they buy.</li>
    <li> This product is more disabled than the user it is intended for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said .....the drain does NOT work which defeats the entire purpose of this basin.&lt;br /&gt;Also.....the \\&quot; cutout \\&quot; area for the neck is too small for most necks also defeating the purpose of this basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully this product  does deflate which will make it easier to dispose of  in the trash</li>
    <li> Q:  Is this product as advertised?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Would you purchase again?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: What purpose do you use?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Shampooing hair of bed-bound patient recovering from injury&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Is it easy to use and clean afterwards?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Yes.  We found it easier and quicker to not use the drain.  No drips or spills on floor or bed.  We use a metal-heavy-duty-utility cart.  Place the Hair Wash Basin (full of liquid) on the cart and roll to the sink to empty, rinse, and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Does the tub hold copious amounts of water?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Yes.  We utilize a 1 gal plastic container.  We fill with hot water (because it cools quickly).  It barely fills the Hair Wash Basin (full of liquid) on the cart and roll to the sink to empty, rinse, and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Is the Hair Wash Basin comfortable for the patient?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Patient says yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  To avoid water everywhere, take a bath towel and fold in half length-wise, 3-to-4 times and then place against the front of the Hair Wash Basin as you place tub under patient&#x27;s head.  The cotton towel is more comfortable against the patient&#x27;s neck and shoulders.  The towel also serves a vital function of absorbing spills and splashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience:  The Hair Wash Basin provides an enjoyable experience for the patient.  Gently pouring the very warm water over the head (hair area) is comforting and soothing. That on top of having their head massaged (shampooing) makes it a treat for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses:  The professional that comes once a month to groom/message feet plus cut toenails, utilizes the basin, too.  We put a throw rug on the floor, then 12 mil plastic over it, and thick cotton towels and then the basin over that.  We then put 2-3 gallons of warm water to soak his feet.  Being a big-bone-tall man, the tub provides ample space for his feet.</li>
    <li> My father broke his knee cap and couldn&#x27;t walk, so he needed to be given bed baths.  This inflatable hair wash basin worked really well.  There was no water leakage on the bed, and my dad felt his head and neck fit comfortably in the basin.  The only down side was having to blow it up because we didn&#x27;t have a pump.</li>
    <li> I chose the inflatable basin for shampooing my handicapped husband,I had tried other kinds, but the were very of a very had material which hurt him.  I use this on him every week in bed so that there is no strain on his neck.  The only problem with this basin is that the tube that releases the water, is plastic and the bend folds do not come out so it is hard to release the water.  All in All the basin is teriffic.  Thanks for making my life and my husbands much easier.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom who is in a nursing home while recovering from a stroke. The hospital had one of these wash basins that they used to wash Mom&#x27;s hair, and it worked great. When she didn&#x27;t seem to be getting her hair washed at the nursing home, I went online to see the reviews and although there were a few that were not good, the majority of them were. I tried washing Mom&#x27;s hair with it when I received it (very quickly), it worked great. It is big enough to wash and rinse her hair and we haven&#x27;t had to use the drain, we just lift Mom&#x27;s head up a bit and pull it out from under and empty it in the shower. We don&#x27;t need the small \\&quot;pillow\\&quot; that is in the basin, so we just don&#x27;t blow it up. The opening for the neck is snug but helps stop the water from leaking and keep water out of the ears. We used a small air pump to blow up, and it made it very easy to inflate.  I would recommend this for any one that is bed ridden, it makes washing hair easy.</li>
    <li> My mom had an emergency surgery a few weeks ago and now we&#x27;ve got an extended period of careful care for her wound. While she can shower carefully I don&#x27;t feel at all comfortable with her trying to wash her hair in there. Knowing there must be tons of others in our situation, I figured there was something for it. A quick browse on Amazon showed there are loads of options and I chose this one based on reviews and most likely fitting our needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly and well packaged, of course. Like others have commented, it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump. I tried to use my yoga ball pump with it but that didn&#x27;t work at all because it is one of those nozzles that needs to be squeezed for the air to go in. On the flip side, that also means that the air doesn&#x27;t leak back out in between breaths. It only took a couple of minutes to blow up but that might be an issue for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basin itself reminds me of a pool float made of really heavy plastic. It has a hose that comes out of the bottom in order to drain the water but it also had a nice well fitting plug so that you don&#x27;t have to use the hose if you don&#x27;t want to. The hose is a stiffer plastic and wasn&#x27;t coiled in the package, but rather bent and folded so it had very stiff kinks in it. You&#x27;ll have to work those out a bit before using it to drain things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used it a little differently. I filled up the basin with some water and washed her hair using that water. I could easily carry the basin to the bed and easily wash her hair. My Mom thought it felt wonderful and was quite comfortable in the basin and it was nice for her to be able to easily have nice clean hair without too much fuss. I really like this unit and highly recommend it. I&#x27;ll update with time if needed.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works well. Highly recommend this for any care giver that has to shampoo someone in bed.</li>
    <li> I am thankful to have a way to wash my Mom&#x27;s hair but with her being bed bound I have to say this leaks incessantly around the drain and where the hose connects to the drain. This makes this a tedious experience where we end up having her get wet all down her neck and back which creates another issue with wet sheets. It seems like they could find a way to have this not leak so horribly bad and the hose really needs to be much longer. My Mom is in a hospital bed and the hose doesnt reach down long enough to the bucket so someone has to hold it in place to keep it from spilling all over the floor. I think they need to rethink several things with this product before it is worthy of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My mom is totally bed-ridden.  We used the basin for about a year and a half and never had a problem with it.  As her dementia progressed it because difficult to keep her head in the basin so we no long use it.</li>
    <li> When my mom got sick, home health would sponge bathe her and &amp;#34;kinda&amp;#34; wash her hair. My mom was pleased when this came in...she got to get a real hair wash!! Said it felt great :) I would definitely recommend this for anyone bed ridden!!</li>
    <li> We use this to wash my grandmother&#x27;s hair and its amazing.  My grandmother feels comfortable and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother.  I thought I read it can be inflated by mouth. Wasn&#x27;t able to do so. I inflated with an air compressor. So far it has stayed inflated and is working well. The tube came a little scrunched so the water comes out slower than I would like. I find that I could use another person to help giggle the host to get the water to flow out. It is very helpful and I highly recommend it. Without it I don&#x27;t know how I would get my mother&#x27;s hair washed.</li>
    <li> It is easy on the caregiver and the patient found it to be very comfortable.  The only things you need to add are a pitcher for pouring water and a bucket to put the drain hose in for runoff.</li>
    <li> Great! it does the job, only thing i don&#x27;t rated as five stars is because upon shipping the hose was folded and since is a hard plastic had to make sure it would drain the water with no interruptions. Shipping deptartment should take that it mind, either change the pvc hose or be more carefull and do not bend so much the hose. Other than that, very happy about it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother who was a semi invalid - took a little getting used to but once we did it worked just great.</li>
    <li> basin was a little big but it was does a good job, easy to use and comfortable. My Mom is 93 and bed bound and this product works very well for her. do need to be careful of the drawn in the bottom that it doesn&#x27;t get accidently pulled.</li>
    <li> Works great for washing my clients hair while she is in bed.  The only problem I had with it was the kink in the drainage tube.  It was preventing the water from draining out.  I tried to heat the tube to get rid of the kink and it&#x27;s still there.</li>
    <li> It did work very well.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention that could have been made.  Inflating it with my vacuum was a challenge, but I had a hand pump that worked out great for the large part of the basin.  The vacuum worked great for the head rest that inflates separately.  I purchased this for my bed-ridden mother that cannot get in the shower or stand at the sink to get her hair washed.  It works perfectly.  I had to straighten out the hose that was shipped to drain the basin, and I accomplished that by putting the hose itself in a tub/sink of hot water, it unkinked it just fine.  Be sure to place the basin and hose, when not in use, where the hose stretches out and not kinked.  It drains out a lot better without kinks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> the product is not what it appears to be. I used it once and then went to the trash because the water leaked out and made a mess. You are very limited to whyat you can do with it. It did not work for me . It was a waste of money</li>
    <li> One of the aids at the hospital used this on me and I knew I had to have one. If you&#x27;ve ever had to have a bed bath then you know how impossible it is to wash your hair correctly. This makes it simple and does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I wore a CTLSO brace and used this every day for 3 months. Did not exceed my 30° limit</li>
    <li> The hose that is supposed to drain the water out of the basin doesn&#x27;t work; It constantly has a kink in it.  The manufacturer needs to rework that area.</li>
    <li> Very good for a disabled person. Easy to use in a bed lying down. Used the drain hose to expel into a bucket.</li>
    <li> This was suggested by my Occupational Therapist after I got out of the hospital from surgery and it was really difficult for me to wash my hair.  I got it on amazon so that with my prime membership I was able to get it the next day.  It worked great!  I was so happy to start to feel normal again.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Received a salad bowl!! Ordered a hair washing basin</li>
    <li> Hair Wash Basin worked great for family member who is bedridden.  Drain tube was great for easy cleanup.  Would be helpful if it came with a pump to inflate but was still a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product since the middle of the head is rested on the center piece and would not have to bend the head all the way back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Mom after the nurses aid got water all over the bed trying to wash her hair. This works great. It has a little plug in the bottom to drain out the water but we haven&#x27;t needed to use is since we don&#x27;t use all that much water; we just carry the whole thing to the bathroom and dump the water into the bath tub. When I first took it out of the bag I was worried it would be a bear to blow up but it was easy, I just had to squeeze a bit on the thingy you blow into to make sure it was open so air could get through.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded expectations and the picture shown is exactly what was received. I highly recommend this product for use with the elderly.</li>
    <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t over inflate keep clean works nicely.</li>
    <li> this basin was perfect for the person who is unable to get out of bed and get into the shower. you must blow it up yourself, so I am going yo find some kind of pump for it in the future so I don&#x27;t get light headed. all in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it...right price for something really needed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product and WORTH the Purchase! Would HIGHLY Recommend to Anyone who is unable to wash hair in the shower or lean over sink!</li>
    <li> This product worked perfectly for us.  Very comfortable for the patient and very convenient for the caregiver to use, empty, and clean.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love it and recommend it for anyone who is handicapped and needs a good bath aid.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly! Yes, the hose is kinked, as other reviewers noted, but that doesn&#x27;t keep it from working. I *do* recommend putting a bed pad/rubber sheet/whatever you want to call it under the basin AND the person but not because of any flaws in the design of the gadget but because it&#x27;s just hard to wash someone&#x27;s hair without spilling some water. Maybe I&#x27;ll get better with practice :-)</li>
    <li> Not bad.. Nice size.  Some water did leak out around the neck area when rinsing... But I think it was my technique.. Lol... Will do better next time.. But for bed bound loved ones it is nice to give them a good shampooing.  My 82 yrs old grandmother who is paralyzed loves it!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how handy this gadget truly is!  Ever gone without washing your hair too long?  Then you will appreciate the ease with which you can wash a bedridden person&#x27;s hair in this wonderful product.  Amen!</li>
    <li> This works so well for anyone who cannot get out of bed. Very comfortable and easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> The first time we used it, it leaked, due to us not putting the flap down under her head.  Otherwise, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what we wanted it to do.  Would highly recommend it to anyone who is bed ridden or can&#x27;t get to the sink.</li>
    <li> my wife used this for our son who has a disability  and it worked well.  real back saver!! shipped on time</li>
    <li> I have very much enjoyed this for washing my mother&#x27;s hair since she is bedridden.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much:&lt;br /&gt;Darlene</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother who had a stroke.  I deflated the small tube that is in the wash basin and deflated the base tube quite a bit to make it a little softer to lay her head on.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to wash my moms hair in bed for about ten years now. It is always difficult but this is the best tub yet. The pieces by her face are rounded so they don&#x27;t hurt her and the tub is deep. The plug is on the right I wish it was on the left but we make it work. Very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product, my bed bound mother was finally able to have her hair washed properly! Took a little getting used to and the drain could be in a better spot, but for what I paid it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> These can&#x27;t be beat for those patients that can&#x27;t get out of bed. Gives them a real shampoo and makes them feel so good.</li>
    <li> Sorry got it to use for another purpose and it just didn&#x27;t work out.  It was worth the try.  Was the least expensive place i could find it.</li>
    <li> Patient&#x27;s short neck does not allow 50% of head to be inside wash basin &#x3D;  Useless!</li>
    <li> We love this product.  My nephew is bedridden and this is great for washing his hair.  There is no mess on the bed and the smaller pillow inside keeps his head level.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver for me. My daughter is special needs and doing her hair can be somewhat difficult. It&#x27;s a great product so easy to use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My mother in law is bedridden, but needs to have her hair washed every other day. Her nurses have been using this for the last 6 months and LOVE it.  No problems, and extremely useful for this type of situation.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 85 year old mother who is bedridden after a stroke.  It is easier to use than it looks.  The inflated vinyl around the neck helps keep the water from leaking out too much.  I warm the water in the microwave using a plastic coffee can before putting it on her hair, then shampoo and do a rinse.  We just carry the tub outside and dump, don&#x27;t use the drain system.  I can&#x27;t believe the rehab and cna&#x27;s we&#x27;ve had don&#x27;t have this and don&#x27;t have a clue.  You definitely have to be your own advocate.</li>
    <li> This hairwash basin is large and a bit awkward to use.  The water does not drain out without some intentional assist.  It would work better if the drain were located more to the side rather than on the bottom where the weight of the person&#x27;s head on the   basin interferes with it&#x27;s drainage.  It also takes up a lot of space and requires the person to scoot down in the bed to use it.   We&#x27;ve had to change the bedding after each use even with use of water-proof  pad as water tends to run out the neck opening.  It probably leaks less if washing short hair as one would need to use less water.  I&#x27;d like to think there is a better system out there somewhere but I was unable to find one!</li>
    <li> Works well after a few added steps before use.  You should put a pad on the bed under the basin area, because the basin will tip up towards the patients shoulders when their head is placed on it.  You should put the drain hose into a bucket and leave the drain cap open so the water doesn&#x27;t build up and soak the neck area. You will have to add a little air to the basin before use every time. It works fairly well for the price and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was fabulous!  I bought this for my 98 year old grandmother who is bedridden. After blowing it up with a hand pump, the entire shampoo took about 10 minutes (washing and conditioner with rinses in between).  My grandmother was very comfortable during the process. I put small cotton balls in her ears as a precaution, but in the end it really wasn&#x27;t necessary. I also placed a rolled-up face cloth over her forehead, and a towel over her neck and chest to be sure of keeping her dry. After emptying the water into a small bucket (not included with the basin) through the attached tube, I rinsed the basin in the bath tub and left it there to dry. My grandmother said she felt like she was in a salon. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this basin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the functionality.  When I attempted to use it I found it to be too large to fit on the bed and the bed got very wet even with chux under the basin.  Maybe a smaller version would work better.</li>
    <li> Bought at deep discount &amp; performs as described by previous reviewers.</li>
    <li> This worked exactly as it should.  It was so easy to use.  My Mother was comfortable the whole time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000JQMHME Portable Shower Bedside Hanging EZ Shower 2.5 Gallon Water Supply]]This shampoo basin is very easy to use and is just what we needed.  Delivery was quick and the hardest part of the entire purchase was inflating the basin. A challenge for your lung power if you don&#x27;t have a pump!  But it does not leak so once you have it inflated it is ready to use.  My son is disabled and needs to get his shampoo while lying in the hospital bed.  This makes it very easy for his caregiver to shampoo his hair without getting him or the bed wet.  We also have a bag that hangs on his IV pole to fill with rinse water and this basin has a hose that drains all the water into a bucket on the floor.  Makes for a great shampoo and is easy to wipe dry and store.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This basin is easy to use and stores away well. There is something refreshing in haveing your hair washed with warm water. This basin makes it very easy to do and with the ability to drain the water into the bucket makes clean up easy. I have used it once a week since i got and it brings relaxation to my husband.</li>
    <li> Really like this, sturdy and easy to use.  There was kinks in the hose, which was caused by bending during packing.  My son heated the hose with a blow dryer and got the kinks out.  Very affordable, the last two I had purchased was only one tier high and cost $35.00, also not as sturdy as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hospice comes in and the lady that takes care of my Mother requested her Administrator to purchase them for their clients.  I used to have to help her with the old one we were using, I would have to hold her head up and out of the water.  This one has the extra support for her neck so she doesn&#x27;t need my assistance anymore when washing my Mothers hair.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to sit down and enjoy watching someone else do all the work!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Hair Wash Basin Inflatable Ez Shampoo For disabled for a relative of mine who is disabled and he really like it ,he said it was very easy to use and he had no problems with it. amazon keep bringing us more unique products for lower prices.</li>
    <li> We have used this brand basin in the past and it worked well for us.  This is the reason that we purchased another when the one we had developed a large leak.  Unfortunetly the new one that we purchased has a slow leak in it that I am unable to find and looses air pressure inbetween uses.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use item.  Purchased this for My 92 year old Mom. She is now able to have her hair washed easily without the stress of bending over a sink or getting in a shower.  It is very durable we purchased it in February and it has remained inflated since then and is used weekly.  It has a solid plug with a long drain hose that allows you to drain the water easily into a  pail.  It can be deflated for smaller storage but we just store it in a plastic bag fully inflated in a closet. This is a reasonable solution for hair washing for anyone who may have difficulty with traditional methods</li>
    <li> Works well and made washing my dad&#x27;s hair pretty easy in bed.  Great idea!</li>
    <li> Tough to inflate, and the drain tube was stuck together, i.e. it wouldn&#x27;t drain. I was able to cut and re-attach the drain tube, and now it works as designed, so if you&#x27;ve got tools and glue and like fixing things, this product is fine once I fixed it.</li>
    <li> Great product, convenient and light weight.  Two downside though, one is the strong plastic smell when you first take it out of the box...I literally had to let it air for 3 days!!! Two: if you try to pump it up by blowing it like a balloon-----NO!!! Try it with the pump that pumps bike wheels.....hard to do also. But once you overcome all that---Great!!</li>
    <li> Very helpful for those confined to bed. Improves quality of life for bed confined. The inflatable basin was a little hard to blow up. I would suggest leaving it inflated after the first use.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully. Only got to use it once on my mother before she became too weak even for it, but she really enjoyed having her hair washed and said her head fit in the basin comfortably. This is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> this is a good product.  the bed does not event get wet.  the whole is a little tight where the head fits but that is all.</li>
    <li> Works just like I expected.  Her head sometimes was not at the perfect angle, so had to adjust,&lt;br /&gt;but what a difference! Nice!  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a woman who is bedridden. I saw it on amazon website where I was looking for something that I could wash her hair, and this was perfect. It arrived very quickly and we opened it and blew it up and used it. We had been unable to wash her hair for 3 weeks (only with a washcloth ) which was unacceptable. We were delighted with it. I will tell everyone I know how great it is. It is very good for the bedridden and paralyzed patients or just for the elderly. The person who invented it was a genius. Needless to say I am very happy with it and will use Amazon for all my purchased from now on!!!  Sincerely yours&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Harrington</li>
    <li> When you want to wash you hair and can&#x27;t get to sink or shower works great I know I&#x27;ve been there</li>
    <li> The basin I bought is brilliant. I&#x27;ve bought them before through a different source, but they&#x27;ve been rather flimsy and have developed a leak after very little usage. This one is made of thicker materials and seems much stronger. The only gripe I have is that the drainage hose is at the side, rather then a corner.&lt;br /&gt;My son is bed ridden. The basin is used in his bed so his hair can be shampooed.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as pictured and easy to use.  The inner pillow was perfectly placed and supported the head well.  I would definitely purchase again and recommend to all home health care caregivers.</li>
    <li> Awesome! My husband is on bedrest for 6 weeks and what a great find. Comfortable and doesnt leak. Put a towel under it so when you remove the basin the towel is in place. Drains slow at first but no big deal. You cen tip it easily to facilitate the draining. We are using it twice a week. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product has an excellent design for full care patients. Our patient was comfortable during the entire shampoo. Very easy to drain after usage.</li>
    <li> This is great for someone who is sick in bed. It works well and is easy to use because it has the drain hose.</li>
    <li> This was very helpful for washing my mother&#x27;s hair while she was bed ridden.  She seem to be fairly comfortable during the process, although we did place a towel where the neck goes as others had suggested.  Her gown did get a little wet in the back, but the bedding stayed dried.  The drain worked well.</li>
    <li> My mother was ill and this product helped to keep her in shape and looking good during a difficult time</li>
    <li> As a disabled female at home,washing hair is impossible for my caretakers but this wash basin has made it possible. I am truly grateful for products like these so I&#x27;d like to thank the company as well. Keep making more products/improving them/and for low costs. Most of us disabled folks have limited income so the low prices help tremendously.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair wash basin for a disabled parent and we love it! The basin provides a comfortable and relaxing hair washing experience for those not able to get to a salon.</li>
    <li> This is great for my bedridden mother we coupled it with the hanging shower. These items make bathing my mother an easy task. I would highly recommend for senior care.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be great for my almost bedridden son. When you blow up the basin the ledge the neck goes on is too puffy and is hard to keep his head in the leaning back postion. Had to hold his head back and carefully poor the water over his head to wash off the shampoo.  I liked that there is a drain and the water just drains out.  Will still use and try not to fill so much with air and see if that helps the head postitioning.</li>
    <li> My expectations was met. Amazon.com always has been reliable. I&#x27;m customer for wild and it&#x27;s service and time are together.</li>
    <li> worked out great. very good product. i would recomend to everybody, very very easy to use. for the money for sure</li>
    <li> I had no trouble with setting up the Basin. The problem was the drain tube. There was/is a kink in it that we can not get out. The basin is not as deep as I expected it to be. We ended up making a huge mess due to the basin not being able to properly drain. That was the only problem I had with it.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but the neck opening is a bit small and causes my mother some anxiety. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, though.</li>
    <li> this product has a great drain system. the head opening is way to tight, the seams in the plastic are at the opening to cut your ears and being so tight you cannot hear anything being said to you. if it is tight to keep the water from leaking then you shouldn&#x27;t have that much water in it to begin with. i had to buy another wash basin that is open tray with a whole in the end that works much better. also the drain is a thin walled tubing that kinks and bends and wont allow draining. i will not recommend this product to any body.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Makes washing a disabled person&#x27;s hair in bed much easier for the caregiver.</li>
    <li> Works great! I usually leave the plug out and let it drain into a bucket while I am washing the hair. It totally beats using those disposable shampoo caps (those definitely have a use and I do appreciate them). This allows you to use your own shampoo and conditioner and have water the temperature you want it. The person we use it on has short hair so I cannot speak for long hair. It did help us get all the hair off of him after a haircut. Worked perfect out of the box. I do sometimes have to make sure the hose is lower than the basin to ensure drainage, but not that big of an issue- you just have to watch it.</li>
    <li> Water leaks out at the person&#x27;s neck. We had to place a towel there to keep the bed from getting soaked.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a really good idea and it seemed to work well for a while, but after a year of use it sprung a leak on a seam that could not be repaired.  Unfortunately the leak got progressively worse which rendered the basin useless.  If it was made out of better quality material I believe that would not have happened.</li>
    <li> I returned this as the valve was defective</li>
    <li> I Love this Basin, I am disabled and this is the only way I can wash my hair, Thank you!</li>
    <li> This really is great to wash hair for a bedridden person, the plug is sturdy and it drains well, if you need something like this, for the price, it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> My mother has been a coma since 2005 and this wash basin is perfect for washing her hair. I would recommend it to anyone who knows or has a family member in a disabled state.</li>
    <li> I work with a hospice organization and use this product to wash the hair of bedbound people I care for. I am able to sanitize it between each person. They have told me that it is the &#x27;best hair wash they have received&#x27;, other than what they&#x27;ve received from a salon. Being bathed can make almost anyone feel better but when they receive a bath AND have their hair washed, they seem to become a whole new person. I&#x27;m on my 3rd or 4th basin so far. Amazon makes my job easy by appearing to always having these available when I need to purchase a new one.</li>
    <li> This product will not stay fully inflated.. about half the air leaks out so that you have to keep blowing it up over and over.. not satisfied at all.. the shape and concept is great for bedridden patients however.</li>
    <li> My brother disabled and can not move and realy the item help my brother and the item its is&lt;br /&gt; havy dute  and worth it to buy thanks seller.</li>
    <li> It is just what I needed to wash my Mother&#x27;s hair, lying down. She is 93 yrs old, and it is hard for her to stand up at the sink&lt;br /&gt;while i wash her hair. So glad I got it.</li>
    <li> My mother in law was bed ridden and we used it to wash her hair once before she passed away. It worked fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Very clever design.  Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the tubing attached to allow drainage is kinked in several places and makes it more difficult than necessary to drain. Easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> need hose attachment for sink to work.  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was so easy to wash my bedriden mothers hair!!!!!!!!  I will be telling others about this!!!  Who ever invented this needs a gold star!!</li>
    <li> Well it very bulky the hose gets smashed and water gets stuck. Water comes out very slow. Does not hold water to good</li>
    <li> I would give this five stars if not for the plastic drainage hose.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the hose design and construction but it arrives damaged by the packaging.  Rather than wrapping the hose, it is folded it in five different places.  The result is that it ends up with permanent kinks that actually block the water from going through the hose.  I tried soaking the hose in extremely hot water and then trying to &amp;#34;unkink&amp;#34; the kinks.  It helped but didn&#x27;t resolve the problem.</li>
    <li> This basin is so easy to use.  It was once next to impossible to wash my mothers hair now I can wash it in her bed or in her chair.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for anyone caring for the elderly</li>
    <li> Best thing ever!! Made life much easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the few soft plastic hair wash basins, but it gets holes in the seams easily. We have to buy several to be ready when this happens now, but this is the cheapest and easiest option.</li>
    <li> 2 thumbs up for this product. It ended up working out very well for a stubborn Mom who can&#x27;t get around too well. It held the water pretty well; around the neck area a little escaped, but that was probably more my fault then the product as I wanted to do a thorough shampoo job; I put a couple of towels underneath to fix that problem. Its well built, and the drain valve is pretty cool! It&#x27;s not really easy to take the basin and dump it with the water in it, so the drain into the bucket works really well. Its a quality product, and really solves an issue when you have an elderly parent who can&#x27;t get around very well. Btw, as far as the pump issue, if you are a slacker like me and really didn&#x27;t feel like getting an extra pump, you dont have to. If you have a healthy set of lungs, you can fill it by mouth with no problem, and just leave it filled after that for next time. To summarize, a comfortable, decently built solution for a big problem under 20 beans. She found it comfortable as well, and the little head support inside the basin is a big plus.</li>
    <li> This basin has lots of room, pillow under head, and no leaking or threat of One. Patient really liked it.</li>
    <li> Because I am not able to be washed in a shower or bathtub,I am bathed in bed.  I have used these basins for years.  They are fairly easy to use although some drain better than others.  My major complaint is that they are not very durable.  In my experience, they develop leaks along the seam line.  The company sends a patch and sealant, but they don&#x27;t work on the split seams.  Therefore, although the basin is very useful, it&#x27;s not as sturdy as I think it should be.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my cousin who was bedridden after surgery and hadn&#x27;t been able to wash her hair for two months.  Was using dry shampoo and wash cloths but that only works for so long.  She found it comfortable to use, did use a towel at the neckline just to catch any spills.  Does take a bit of maneuvering to get the water out of the drain, but once you&#x27;ve got most of it out, you can easily wipe up the rest.  Great product and was easy to use the EZ Shower.</li>
    <li> Great for home bound patients.  Only drawback drain hose flat and kinked during shipment, so had to purchase another hose.  Would recommend to any one bed bound.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews and have elderly mom and she is comfortable as I was hair can drain to bucket or just lift then to sink to drain. We used her pump from air mattress to blow up! For this price a great find and no wet bed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bedridden mother who also had dementia.  Shampooing her hair was a chore but with this basin, it makes washing her hair much easier.  It does take 2 of us, sometimes even 3, but we can give her a great shampoo &amp; rinse in no time with this.  A little water does get out around he neck area, but since she is unable to move freely, we are happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to use for my mother who is unable to use the bath tub any more  so we thought this would be good for washing her hair.  It is quite awkward to use and often we  end up with more water on the floor than in the plastic wash basin.  I&#x27;ve finally purchased &#x27;no rinse&#x27; shampoo and &#x27;no rinse&#x27; conditioner.</li>
    <li> This was available in drug stores near my home priced $35.00 and up. I used this every other day to wash my dads hair (age 88 scalp &amp; with neck issues). It was very easy to reach behind his head and the base of his neck. The built in pillow was great for a little support. I believe this is a quality product made very durable. This product was recommended by my dads daily Health Aid and I would recommend for home use.</li>
    <li> the basin works well but the outlet tubing for the dirty water continually kinks.</li>
    <li> Exactly as descibed. easy to setup and use. Comfortable for the person whose hair is being washed. Much better than a hardplastic tray that is also used. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This has clearly been the BEST purchase I have made for my partner while he has been in the hospital. Because of an amputation, he is unable to use a tub/shower and wash his hair. The &amp;#34;no-rinse&amp;#34; shampoo caps are fine, but not as good as washing, and once he had his hair washed, he did feel better. Inflation was easy, and he was comfortable. For him, it didn&#x27;t take a lot of water to wet and rinse - but I didn&#x27;t realize this the first time and some water did leak out onto the bed. Second time worked much better, but I still had the problem with the drain not working. I tried adjusting the basin, lifting, etc, but it did not work well for someone lying in a bed because of the mattress and the fact that when they lay on it, it closes off the drain.  My hose is also kinked, and I think I will try heating it up to remove those so hopefully it will work better. It is not perfect, but it is SO much better than a shampoo cap for your loved one.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves it, it&#x27;s nice, the only problem I have with it, is the water drains out slow, and it have to bend over &amp; hold the basin up with one hand, and hold tube with other to make sure it drains in bucket and not all over floor. Plus when half of water drained, and I&#x27;m able to pick up basin without spilling water, I dump rest of water in drain bucket, otherwise it takes too long to drain.</li>
    <li> Good thing this came with a repair kit, because it also came with a hole.  Doesn&#x27;t hold air very long.  I have to reinflate between uses, it won&#x27;t stay inflated that long.  It probably has another hole that I can&#x27;t find, somewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need to wash somebody&#x27;s hair while they are in bed, it fits very snugly around the neck which causes a nice seal and cuts down on water seeping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drains very easily but please note the drainage tube comes out underneath on the left-hand side (Right-hand side f you are looking down at it) which can be a little inconvenient if that side of the bed is pushed up against a wall or if you sleep on the right-hand side of a larger bed but at the same time it is very comfortable and can hold quite a bit of water which is great for rinsing or having a good soak.I would recommend placing a large chuck/bed pad underneath to catch any splashes&lt;br /&gt;Also I would like to add this is also very useful to wash somebody&#x27;s feet in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is quite a sturdy product considering it is inflatable and a very reasonable price, I would recommend to anybody who might be in the kind of  situation that would such a product</li>
    <li> My mom loves that I can wash her hair in bed since she isn&#x27;t able to shower right now. The only thing you have to remember is not to fill it up too much otherwise where her head rests...the water will start to pour out. LOL</li>
    <li> My mother is bedridden and dislikes having her hair washed with dry chemical.  This inflatable basin performs exactly as advertised, and is easy to use.  Highly recommend it for the bedridden.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product if you care for someone who is not mobile enough for a standard shampoo.  Everyone has a right to clean hair and the powder products are just horrible.  A good bed shampoo is not an easy thing to accomplish and this inexpensive device makes it easy.  The inflatable basin is very comfortable and easy to use.  At the neck opening, I place a folded finger tip towel to absorb any drips.  Note next to it the little inflatable head support cushion that prevents neck strain and helps the patient feel safe and comfortable.  Not shown is the plastic tubing that allows the basin to drain into your bucket below. Do not attempt to carry the basin when filled with water.  Water is heavy and will be too much for the seams.  Use the drain.  We have found this to be the easiest method: (1) lay a towel and optional underlying plastic under the inflated device. (2) add the neck towel. (3) using safest method for your patient, lift or roll patient in place, cradling neck over the towel at the neck opening. (4) Use plastic bottles, a quart is good, to hold warm water, leaving one for rinse water and adding the shampoo to the other to dilute.  (5) Shampoo well, pull out the drain plug, rinse and let the water run out the tubing.  Repeat with the creme rinse.  Refill quart bottles and use plenty of water for a great result that will make your patient feel very good.</li>
    <li> This basin works great, though it can feel slightly claustrophobic for certain persons, especially children, since it comes up high around the chin. But a great idea for the right person.</li>
    <li> Needed for our son who has special needs for when he can&#x27;t make his hair appointment to get a shampoo.  Seems to work fine for someone who can&#x27;t bend over a sink. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Wonderful assist for washing hair for someone in bed.  Wish the basin area was a bit deeper</li>
    <li> You need a hand/bicycle pump to inflate it, since we do not have one we can&#x27;t inflate it properly. And when it&#x27;s not inflated properly, not only do you pass out from trying to blow it up all the way, the water goes out the neck hole when you use it. The other problem is our bed is soft and not completely level - it would work better for someone with a hospital bed and air pump.</li>
    <li> Does not empty properly.  Causes a lot of water around patient&#x27;s head and difficult to use.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> GOOD IDEA, BUT WATER GOING AROUND</li>
    <li> This inflatable sink is definitely handy when you&#x27;re confined to a chair or bed - HOWEVER - they need to come up with a hose that doesn&#x27;t come with kinks sort of built in - a hose that can coil into a circle without getting permanent bends in it...makes it very hard to drain. Or it should be removable. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Other than the drain hose having kinks in it .............It works good....... but would be better if you didn&#x27;t have to keep unkinking the hose to make it work and drain.....</li>
    <li> I actually like the cheaper ones better even though they wear out a bit faster. This one is so tight around the patients neck and face. It rubs their cheeks. Also too deep for our needs and harder to drain than the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute lifesaver for anyone who is caring for a bed-bound loved one!!!! I cannot convey how much I love this product. It is so easy to use, keeps the bed and sheets totally dry, allows for a nice thorough hair washing without a huge mess.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my 13 yo daughters hair.  I am really not happy with it.  The drain is on the wrong side and the drain hose is too short. Also because of the way it was packaged the drain hose has about 6 kinks that keep the water from draining. When my daughters head is in this inflatable basin the sides are pressed up against her lower cheeks and it looks uncomfortable. I very much prefer the Duro Med Plastic Molded Hair Rinser..</li>
    <li> Works fine except for hose that has crimps in it from being folded during packing.  I have not been able to straighten it out so I  have to stop and squeeze them to get water flow from the basin.</li>
    <li> The basin was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> I do home-health care and this basin works great!  the lady i take care of loves it and even though she&#x27;s bed ridden, she loves having her hair washed, it&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> it took a few minutes to solve minor issues, such as positioning to let it drain. the tubing did come a little cramped but it has drained once it was left free. a towel under the neck helped keep the bed dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m laid up after an accident and can&#x27;t get to the shower upstairs. My daughter has used this twice now to wash my hair on the couch.  Even with a neck brace on the couch did not get wet in the process.</li>
    <li> Worked with no problems.</li>
    <li> Needs a pump to blow up properly.  Tried it and it works well.  Would be nice if the drainage hose was able to be turned to adjust for different locations of the receiving bucket.</li>
    <li> The caregivers who are helping to take care of my elderly relative, who would be difficult to transfer to the shower, say that this is a winner -- they&#x27;re able to effectively and relatively easily shampoo this person&#x27;s hair with it.</li>
    <li> It works great for my disabled son.  Very easy to use, would highly recommend it for any disabled person.  Does wear-out quick this is my 4th one, but it works well.</li>
    <li> The opening should be a little wider, it scratches your face and beard with the seams. Overall, it is very good to use for bed bound patients</li>
    <li> Good product, I have recom to others to care for anothers cleanliness material is quality also  it does what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> My husband was not happy with this at all.  He has a short neck and fitting it in the slot so that the water runs into the basin was almost impossible.  Perhaps a longer neck would do better.  Large and cumbersome and the drain tube never straightened out and had a permanent kink in it.  Extremely difficult to deflate to pack away flat.  Would not recommend.  Using a chux with a large towel under the head shoulders worked just as well without the hassel.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The first time i used it, the bed got all wet.</li>
    <li> I really like the basin it is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who has a bedridden loved  one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for helping wash a person&#x27;s hair in a hospital. Especially if they are partially paralyzed. Put towels under it in case they turn their head and it leaks a little. Better than the shampoo caps for long term care.</li>
    <li> My mom is housebound and it helps to make washing her hair much easier</li>
    <li> My friend who is bedridden said she had the best hair wash with this basin she had since  her accident 6 years ago.</li>
    <li> It worked great for the Hospice bath person. My husband enjoyed it and wasn&#x27;t as messy as the usual way his hair was washed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and sturdy.  An excellent buy.  I highly recommend this item for disabled or elderly.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute must for a bed-bound person.  Comfortable and easy to wash hair in.</li>
    <li> Concept is great, but item only lasted through one hair wash before splitting.</li>
    <li> We were desperate to wash our daughters hair three weeks after surgery. She was unable to get out of bed without brace and could not shower or bathe in brace. It worked great and such a relief for her to have clean hair after using the dry shampoo. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Got this to give my wife, who is currently ill and bedridden, a shampoo. I ordered it several weeks ago and when she got out of the hospital this week, I opened the package to give her a shampoo, which she was looking forward to.  This item was very difficult to inflate as the air port would not open to allow air to enter.  Finally had to take an ink pen and force the flap inside the inflation hole open. While inflating, I noticed a hole in the bottom of the basin part of the item.  This was apparently caused by the item being severely creased when it was packaged at the factory.  It did come with a patch and glue which I used to, hopefully, repair the hole. I am now trying to decide whether to try to give my wife a shampoo using this item, as the last thing she or I need is for this thing to start leaking in her bed. I am very unhappy with this item and would gladly have paid more for a better quality product.  I would not recommend this item to anyone, unless you are &amp;#34;feeling lucky&amp;#34; and might get a better one that what I received.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and an excellent value.</li>
</ol>
