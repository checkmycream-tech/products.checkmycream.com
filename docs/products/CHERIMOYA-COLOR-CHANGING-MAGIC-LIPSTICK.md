      <li>Very happy with product..and color last for hours.</li>
      <li>I love magic lipstick :)</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay with me</li>
      <li>Most of them broke.  </li>
      <li>These mood lipsticks break quite easily.....</li>
      <li>price is most definitely right!</li>
      <li>Nice fuchsia stain, but they literally all broke off after first application.</li>
      <li>Fine...</li>
      <li>The plastic lid looks cheap and easily breakable.</li>
      <li>just wish there were more vibrant colors, as these are mostly pastel.</li>
      <li>Very moist &amp; they have pretty good staying power.</li>
      <li>Instead of a rose color, it&#x27;s more a bright pink on me - not what I was really looking for.</li>
      <li>these could be really fun!</li>
      <li>They smell ok, pretty wax-y.</li>
      <li>Good colors, I just dont really like lip color as much as I thought I would.</li>
      <li>Fun to wear.</li>
      <li>Overall, I really liked these.</li>
      <li>Price is right.  </li>
      <li>They smell great, the shade of pink they turn on my lips is gorgeous, and their lasting power is unbeatable (especially for the price).</li>
      <li>Fast shippingg and lovee themm!</li>
      <li>Mostly pink colors but nice.</li>
      <li>NOT as good as the cheaper ones I have purchased in the past......</li>
      <li>They are all scented differently, which is fun, but I would&#x27;ve liked it to be six slightly different shades.</li>
      <li>Very person gets a diferent color depending on their ph.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much nextime again</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The seller sent it fast ..</li>
      <li>I live them!</li>
      <li>half the tubes had some issue that caused the lipstick to be pushed into the lid without you touching it.</li>
      <li>great moisturizer,like baby lips,but a very weak lip stain,virtually  no color</li>
      <li>they are OK but don&#x27;t last all that long.....</li>
      <li>They are pretty small and cheap.</li>
      <li>It was for my 6 yr old niece, she enjoyed them and kept asking &#x27;What mood am I in?&amp;#34;… All I could tell her she was crazy happy even when she was crying.</li>
      <li>My young sister likes it though</li>
      <li>Cool colors only tried one blue turned my lips red</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are false advertising because I didnt recive any earrings with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;Thier good moisturizers but other</li>
      <li>The colors were not as bright as I thought they would be but it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received them broken.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved them. Fun to wear.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like playing with mood rings? Well this is just like that but with lipstick lol</li>
    <li> They are pretty small and cheap. They also advertise the product with pictures that make it seem like babylips brand and it isn&#x27;t. They do give your lips color and if you are looking for a small gift for younger girls these could be really fun!</li>
    <li> Good colors, I just dont really like lip color as much as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> Cool colors only tried one blue turned my lips red I think they all might be red have not tried it</li>
    <li> Nice fuchsia stain, but they literally all broke off after first application.</li>
    <li> This is better than the high-end (expensive) lip stains. It lasts unless you drink a lot of water/tea coffee, the inside comes off if you do but if you don&#x27;t the product lasts for hours. I agree with another reviewer that they&#x27;re all the same color. All you need is a gloss on top.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no color except red/pink&lt;br /&gt;They are false advertising because I didnt recive any earrings with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;Thier good moisturizers but other then that they are horrible the lipstick looks plastic</li>

It may need to be refreshed after meals or long hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than the expensive brands which dry out my lips and cause cracked lips and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish there were more vibrant colors, as these are mostly pastel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like at all , I thought the lipstick the same color as it looks all are red !</li>
    <li> Great color for my lips!! I live them! Very person gets a diferent color depending on their ph.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much nextime again</li>
    <li> The colors were not as bright as I thought they would be but it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
    <li> Hate it, i bought this for my wife and she was really disappointed, all lipsticks gave her the same color, a horrible fuchsia tone. I will definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful creamy feel...color lasts for hours...price is most definitely right! Tones basically are all the same despite different color packaging.</li>
    <li> Fast shippingg and lovee themm!</li>
    <li> makes my lips soft and only has to be reapplied a few times a day</li>
    <li> My girlfriends absolutely loved this product!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product..and color last for hours.</li>
    <li> All of the tubes are the SAME color no matter what mood you&#x27;re in… It lasts all day and the next if you know what I mean. It was for my 6 yr old niece, she enjoyed them and kept asking &#x27;What mood am I in?&amp;#34;… All I could tell her she was crazy happy even when she was crying.</li>
    <li> The seller sent it fast .. And they are lasting .. They are as described ... I eeally love them all . Thanks</li>
    <li> They all come out the same awful color</li>
    <li> half the tubes had some issue that caused the lipstick to be pushed into the lid without you touching it. I gave these out as presents and at least 3 of the tubes fell out, broke or completely mashed the lipstick.</li>
    <li> No free earrings came with this purchase. Scented not really. Also not a great moisturizer either. I have to apply a moisturizer before applying the mood lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love magic lipstick :)excellent thank you amazon :)</li>
    <li> These are wondeful.  I&#x27;ve bought them before and I love how they stay put.  The colors all go on pink but that&#x27;s okay with me - they last forever and I like the stain on my lips.</li>
    <li> Lower - mid quality. You get what you pay for. Color does not last that long.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer,like baby lips,but a very weak lip stain,virtually  no color</li>
    <li> These mood lipsticks break quite easily.....NOT as good as the cheaper ones I have purchased in the past......they are OK but don&#x27;t last all that long.....</li>
    <li> The colour lasts, but its not as deep as I expected. My young sister likes it though, she&#x27;s 22. The plastic lid looks cheap and easily breakable. I intend to give them as gifts to teens.</li>
    <li> I was really not happy. Also they didn&#x27;t give me the pair of earrings so it made it two negatives</li>
    <li> Changes to beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> I bought these Bc of the colors and styling, and the fact that they were going to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;3 of the sticks were melted by the time they arrived. They smell ok, pretty wax-y. Instead of a rose color, it&#x27;s more a bright pink on me - not what I was really looking for.</li>
