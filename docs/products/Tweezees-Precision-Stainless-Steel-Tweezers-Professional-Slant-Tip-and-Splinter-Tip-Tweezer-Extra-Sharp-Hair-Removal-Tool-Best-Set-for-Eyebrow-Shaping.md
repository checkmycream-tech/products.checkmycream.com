<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can get brows I couldn&#x27;t get before.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find a good set of tweezers. These do the job without having to grab those pesky hairs over and over again like cheap dollar store tweezers. I cried when i lost my good pair years ago and these are the closest i have found that are as good as my long lost one.</li>
    <li> super precise!! I love these!</li>
    <li> Immediate satisfaction once you realize these tweezers grab every little, tiny hair your bad eyes can possibly see. All around, a great made pair of tweezers for my man brow hedging.</li>
    <li> These tweezers grab the hairs that others just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers, and having the 2 styles is great.  Very precise and sturdy.  Also, GREAT customer service!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on rating. Purpose is for shaping eye brows and one hard white hair that is hard to pluck. The slant tip was able to grab and hold it better then my tweet man ones that I misplaced. The pointed ones did not work as well but then I had never used that type.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good tweezes just a little flimsy or my hairs are really tough! LOL</li>
    <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. The sharp pair is almost needle sharp, and they really are perfectly aligned and grab hairs so easily.  Wish I had gotten these sooner.</li>
    <li> I had been using a pair of crummy old tweezers before for an occasional eyebrow pull, and now having used the Tweezee - wow, what a difference! I can accurately get to a hair and easily grasp and pull it, without repeated attempts.  Just what a tweezers should do!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. These seem to be very well made. The sharp tweezer is VERY sharp, indeed, and both tweezers appear to be have been well milled as they are smooth and nicely finished. The little cloth storage bag is not much but it does contain the pair and keep them handy.</li>
    <li> I love  these tweezers. They are easy to use and trimming your eye brows are much easier then with the other kind and less painful. You do have to go slow though and be carefull. I would highly recommend. The sellers are wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Good quality! As soon as you pick them up you know that they are made well. They are perfect for fine work</li>
    <li> I have used tweezerman for years and I like these better, the grip and precision are great. Arrived in a timely way and great customer service, would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fantastic tweezers!  Just what I was looking for and super fast shipping!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow tweezers. Nothing more to add!</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers very easy to use and can get the tiniest of hairs.  Shipping was quick and will purchase again from the seller.</li>
    <li> For that price, $24, I expected more precision. But they are okay.</li>
    <li> very professional tweezers, used the straight ones to remove a splinter, the precision tips made the job simple, they are like surgical instruments...</li>
    <li> Just received these and have used both.  These are definitely the best tweezers I have ever owned.  They are precise and get each hair.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Thought they would be better but ok for money spent.</li>
    <li> Quick service...great follow up to insure I was satisfied...great price...I do facials and eyebrows, and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers. Carry pouch is helpful for storage. Solid construction. Good weight to them.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality, like that you get 2 pair, and the carrying case / pouch is a nice touch! Works well!</li>
    <li> Fantastic tweezers. I have been using them for assembling tiny parts in electronics, which I know won&#x27;t be the usual use-case, but they are made very solidly, and have not dulled or become crooked yet, which is what happened to my last pair.</li>
    <li> Received order on time and am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Both of the pairs tweezers in this set are excellent - very precise and with a good level of springiness. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> very nice and good workman ship</li>
    <li> both tweezers work really well.  I got tired of buying them in stores, only to bring them home and find out they don&#x27;t work (they&#x27;d break the hair off instead of actually removing it).  THese actually remove the hair.  thanks</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love the wide grip tweezers</li>
    <li> These are great I have used them to pluck an ingrown hair on my face, and they seem quite well made. The pointed tweezer does come with a plastic safety tip that you can easily remove and reapply once done using them. I purchased these tweezers for the precision aspect of them and they meet that demand quite well.</li>
    <li> best tweezers out there that I&#x27;ve found thus far! Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Tweezers with precision. There is not a whole lot than can be said about tweezers but these are pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many tweezers, including the highly lauded Tweezermans, but this set of Tweezees is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve just tried them out on my husband and myself and could not be more pleased. They do easily grip and remove the tiniest hairs!  I made my purchasing decision based on the many positive reviews I found on Amazon and am so glad I did.  They also arrived right on time and the seller sent me a follow up email to confirm their arrival time and ensure that I was satisfied with my purchase. Great customer service that will encourage me to look to this business for other products! And the price was right, too!</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I was reluctant because I saw some bad reviews on this but once again, amazon never fails me. I received really nice set of tweezers in the cutest pouch. I grabbed and smoothly pulled out a piece of hair on the first try. I actually did not know that ingrown hair tweezers ever existed but I am so glad I found out because I will definitely need it later on. These tweezers are a great investment. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you because you will be purchasing great products. It&#x27;s so precise and nicely made that it&#x27;s great for small pieces of hair and even tiny splinters. I definitely will recommend it to you all.</li>
    <li> These are my absolute favorite tweezer set! The slanted tip tweezers are sharp and perfect for those hard-to-grab hair. The pointy tip are great for in-grown hairs! I use these in between threading my eyebrows and bikini waxes. I love that they come in a little pouch to keep them away from bacteria and such. I love these so much better than the other set I bought at Ulta for over $16 each! Definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Quality product. Works great. The little pouch that it comes with is crappy but whatever.</li>
    <li> Your search is over ...Both tweezers are fantastic...Slanted tweezers are on point....select the hair you want to pull and you are on to the next... that is how quick it is and totally  precise and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality &amp; affordable &amp; shop with confidence  with AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, it works wonderfully. I couldn&#x27;t find the right pair before, they just don&#x27;t pluck the unwanted hair when I want to. But this one takes the cake! It comes with two, and gets the job done. It&#x27;s perfect! Thank you.</li>
    <li> The perfect Set of tweezers!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers i ever had!!!  they are sharp, precise, and get every little hair.  love the little canvas bag to keep them safe and to  know exactly where they are.  Total winner!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Extra long for more control, fits in hand properly.  Accurate!!</li>
    <li> Overall great tweezers. Feel heavy duty and well made. They line up perfectly and feel nice and strong. I only have one small complaint and that is that the small pouch they come with is actually too small for the fine tipped tweezers. I ended up just using the plastic pouch that they came in, which is actually pretty tough feeling plastic.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the quality of these tweezers. I have bought many and continue to try to find a good pair. I thought  that the reviews, nearly all outstanding, were a good guide for purchasing these tweezers. I find the quality of the stainless steel poor: too light-weight and insufficient tension. My very old $5 pair of &amp;#34;Revlon Expert&amp;#34; works much better (slant tweezer). The &amp;#34;Precision&amp;#34; tweezer is too long; here, too, the stainless steel is very lightweight and without sufficient tension.</li>
    <li> Tweezers that actually tweeze!!! Will be throwing away my collection of name brand tweezers that do not work well Will order another set to have as a spare.</li>
    <li> I actually hated them.  They would not remove a single hair &amp; I ended up having to buy another set. I only gave one star because I had to give s star rating in order to submit.</li>
    <li> Just received these so haven&#x27;t had too much of a chance to use them but so far so good.  A very noticable improvement over the drug store, Sally Hansen tweezers I was using.  Definitely better at gripping the hairs so less damage to the surrounding skin as you try repeatedly to get the hair out.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the best tweezers ever.  I only thought I had good tweezers before.  I am exceptionally happy with these two tweezers. I have on one eye where one or two eyelashes  grow on the inside of my eyelid. Well about every 3rd month it starts to bother and touch my eye.  It is a time tasking event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with my 20x powered mirror and these tweezers it actually grabs a hold of the eyelash easily and pulls with no pain. I also like that on the sharp skinny end it has a plastic cover and the other one can be put and stored safely in the enclosed case. It is a simple task now to keep my brows looking their best. I can tweeze my eyebrows in seconds and it does not even hurt. 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing!! The splinter tip tweezers are great for getting ingrown hairs and tiny splinters out. I was so amazed by the precision I&#x27;ve recommended them to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve used custom-tweaked Swiss tweezers working in the microelectronics industry (Rubis and Aquarius), which cost $15-40 per pair.  These are cheap, a little light, a bit flexible and not terribly accurate, but definitely a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating these tweezers three that doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t work. However, I didn&#x27;t expect them to not last long. Of course if you drop them they are done. Not sturdy. They are pretty long and big. These tweezers brake hair like other tweezers. They aren&#x27;t magical or anything crazy to brag about. They do work to a certain point. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It was worth a try though!</li>
    <li> 4 stars only because I have not had a chance to use the sliver tool yet.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers I have ever owned.  I have been meaning to upgrade my tweezers for a long time, now that I have these I am able to take care of any unwanted hair, skin or splinter with ease.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any splinters, so can&#x27;t speak for that particular use. But they are plenty narrow to grab a splinter deep in the skin, so I suspect they&#x27;ll work well for that. And are sharp enough to lance ingrowns or however else you might find a way to use them. As for the slanted tweezers, they do a better job of grabbing small, thin hairs than my previous, pointy-tipped pair did. Very happy with the set. Little bag seems to be handy, too. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Both tweezers are just what I was looking for and the best I have used. Grabs the thin hairs other tweezers can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very nice build quality and the pouch is a great addition.</li>
    <li> I am very fussy about tweezers, and, although I have yet to find the perfect tweezers, these are among the best I have bought. They are on a par with Tweezerman, which I also like, but are a better value. I also appreciate the attention the seller gives to customers. If only Amazon allowed 4.5 star ratings... These are better than very good, but less than perfect. Based on tweezers I have tried (and that is a goodly number), I highly recommend these and would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever had.  I bought some for my boyfriend then liked them so much, I had to get some for myself!</li>
    <li> These are the WORST tweezers, do not waste your money. They don&#x27;t even close tight enough to pluck hair.</li>
    <li> great product, fast arrival</li>
    <li> my wife says they are the best she has ever used.</li>
    <li> My daughter put these in her Amazon wish list for a stocking stuffer. She doesn&#x27;t listen to me, so she opted for these rather than Rubis tweezers. It&#x27;s been 7 months and she just asked for her own Rubis tweezers since she kept borrowing min instead of using these. So I take it these were just  ok, while my Rubis are AMAZING.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome! They come in a 2 bags--a plastic outer bag with a zip seal similar to one for food but more heavy duty. Inside that bag is a cute and small canvas-style bag that holds both pairs just right. I love this because I always lose tweezers. I think keeping them in their bag will help. The quality of the fabric bag isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27; not sure it needs to be. I actually used these the first day I got them for both tweezing my eyebrows and removing a splinter. Both pairs worked perfectly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever done my eyebrows without pinching my skin and cutting off some hairs partially until I used these. They are comfortable in your hands and perfectly designed. I didn&#x27;t even know that &amp;#34;splinter tweezers&amp;#34; existed but I&#x27;m so glad I have them now! After hours working in the yard, I often end up with a splinter that I can never seem to remove. These tweezers removed a splinter flawlessly without tearing my hand to shreds. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers. I have PCOS and have gotten blacks hairs on my neck since I was a teen. It used to just be a few, but as I have gotten older, they have gotten worse. I have tried everything from waxing, to cream hair removal and have just ended up twee-zing the hairs away anyways. I have probably went through 100 pairs of tweezers, and by far these are the best. They grab the hairs other tweezers miss. I used to spend like 30 min trying to get all of the hairs, with these I only spend maybe 10 min. They are so sharp and perfect for removing ingrown hairs that you can&#x27;t get with regular tweezers. They also do not break the hair, they remove the root and all which is great!  I definitely recommend Tweezees! The bonus is the little bag they come in. No more digging around my purse.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are absolutely amazing. There are two units which can be used for different things. Very precise tips that are sharp help to guide each unit along. It is very well packaged and lightweight but incredibly sturdy.</li>
    <li> Good quality tweezers; the bag is a bit too small for the fine pair. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and as described</li>
    <li> waste of money :(  My $7 revlon tweezers work much better.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. Hair comes out on first try. So glad I found these!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice tweezers. They are sturdy, sharp, and precise. The added canvas carrying bag is a nice touch, though I felt it was too small when I first received the tweezers. These work well for pulling out tiny hairs and setting coils in my e-cig. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Worth the price, I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing. Ingrown hairs are a cinch, comes in a little storage bag too &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift, but my sister says that they are very high quality, and she liked the little bag they came with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting a good pair of tweezers. These were exactly what I was looking for. Very precise and easy to use for hair removal.</li>
    <li> Tweezers man tweezers have great products over all. I use these for those hard to get pimples I know I&#x27;m not suppose to burst but can&#x27;t help it . be careful because they are sharp</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers - searched for a pair for a long time and kept being disappointed.  These are great and I&#x27;m very happy w/my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE these tweezers. They can pull the tiniest splinter or hair. If you can see it, these tweezers will grab it.</li>
    <li> Received mine yesterday.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet for anything practical.  But, they feel kind of cheap.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best tweezers I’ve ever had. Highly recommended.    Update 4/19/16. Just bought a second set so now I have one set at work and one at home. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these tweezers. They make all the other tweezers I&#x27;ve used seem like they came from the stone age.</li>
    <li> The 300+ reviews were accurate.  Excellent duo and great price.</li>
    <li> Love this set! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love them!!!  Use them to help my hubby with his hard to reach ear hairs and they didn&#x27;t hurt him as I plucked!!!  Love the packaging and the handy case they came in.</li>
    <li> I do not know how I lived without these things.  The needle headed tweezers are the best, they can grab and hold onto any of those small stubborn hairs with ease!</li>
    <li> I have only had these tweezers a week, but the slant tweezers are terrific! They are a bit pricey, but worth it. Buy them, you will love them. Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t tried the splinter tweezers yet, but they could be deadly! I stored them out of reach so that my little people won&#x27;t stumble across them and put an eye out.</li>
    <li> My wife and I absolutely LOVE this product.  Great durable product that we can count on.  I did not expect the packaging to be great, but it blew me away.  The quality was over the top great and I love now that I don&#x27;t have to search at the bottom of my toiletries bag for tweezers and stab myself because the small little bag is right there. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> High quality. Sharp. Doesn&#x27;t the trick. However, dinging one star because the bag is too small for the sharp tweezer. You have to jam it in the pouch. They should have just added an extra 1/8&amp;#34; - 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very high in quality. The splinter tops are extremely sharp and thus perfect to penetrate skin to get out ingrown hair. I will be recommending this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> best tweezers ever!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say these are the best tweezers Ive owned since my revlon tweezers broke</li>
    <li> I haven¹t tried the pointy ones yet, but love the other pair.  For years I used Griffon tweezers made in the USA and they were awesome.  When they broke and I went to replace them, it looks like the pair I had was from the 1940¹s!  I was afraid I could not find any decent tweezers, but these work just as well as my old Griffon tweezers.  Don&#x27;t know if they will last 70 years, but they seem pretty sturdy..</li>
    <li> I decided to give these a try based on the excellent percentage of five-star reviews. Great decision! This tweezer set does not disappoint. They are made in Pakistan, beautifully engineered and perfectly aligned. I had no trouble selecting and tweezing the finest hair in a single try. The needle nose pair come with a small plastic &amp;#34;protector&amp;#34; to keep the blades closed against each other and to protect the pointy ends from damage--or you from damaging yourself, as they are very sharp. The slant edged design is equally finely made, and again work first time on the finest hair. Taken proper care of, for cosmetic/grooming purposes, this set should last for years. The little zippered bag is a nice addition, keeps both pairs protected, together, and makes them much harder to lose or mislay. I paid the same price for one pair of Tweezerman branded tweezers a few years ago. These are every bit as high quality, maybe slightly better and like getting two pairs for the price of one, with the &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34; thrown in for free.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers.  Have no doubts about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers!  These tweezers grab the hair and out it comes with very little effort - no slipping, sliding or twisting.  They are sturdy and well built.  I am very happy with this set.</li>
    <li> I had misplaced a favorite pair of tweezers and purchased a cheap pair from a local drug store which did not do the trick for my needs.  I have had the Tweezees tweezers for a few days now and they work GREAT!</li>
    <li> Really love the the tweezers they are great!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many tweezersbut these are phenomenal. just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality !&lt;br /&gt;Better than what I&#x27;ve expected .</li>
    <li> These tweezers grab even the tiniest eyebrow hair. I have used them non stop on myself and daughters since they arrived almost two weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair as well as I thought it would...end up with small scabs on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers EVER! I received a pair as a gift, and when my mother saw them she also wanted a set. They are extremely sharp and really grip all hairs. Nothing else like them on the market.</li>
    <li> Worth the price!  These tweezers do the best job for shaping eyebrows.  Effortless ease, and precise.  I love the 2-pack, 2 size that it comes in.</li>
    <li> Just received these and, wow!  What a difference really good tweezers make!  All those little hairs I just could not grab with my drug store tweezers I got immediately.  No more pinching my skin.  These really are great tweezers.</li>
    <li> I need to scream this from the rooftops. These are the best tweezers that I have ever owned in my 51 years of life! I don&#x27;t care what you have tried in the past or how much money you have spent. These are truly the top, most excellently rated tweezers that I could ever describe. I am amazed.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers! Best ones I have ever used! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are a dream come true! I&#x27;ve been looking for fine tipped tweezers that work on fine hairs and also for splinter removal. These fit the bill. A bonus is the second pair of tweezers and very nice case that these come in. The case provides storage but also protects. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am VERY picky with my tweezers. These tweezers grabbed all the little and stubborn hairs, I usually struggle with without pain. They also don&#x27;t break my hair, so I don&#x27;t get ingrown hair. Its amazing! It is very sharp, so be careful you don&#x27;t pinch yourself getting those stubborn hair.  I&#x27;m glad I got to try this in exchanged for a review. I would definitely recommend these to my girlfriends</li>
    <li> The stubby tweezers work great. However, the sharp pointed tweezers are actually too sharp and narrow, so narrow that the tips are prone to bending on virtually anything. And once they&#x27;re bent, they&#x27;re pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> These work like a dream! I love these, personally I ways end up buying less than good tweezers but not with these. They are sharp and precise, close well and come with a nice little carry case</li>
    <li> Great tweezees! Worked great on my ebrows.</li>
    <li> Once in a month I wax my eyebrows in a salon and then once or twice a week I usually use  tweezer to pluck my eyebrows but I always manage to pinche myself and it really hurts I tried these as soon as i got them and they are fantastic. I was very happy to get these tweezers. I had never used pointed tweezers, but the pointed tweezers help get the stubborn hair that are hard to get the one that are slightly cut from one side. It was very easy to use. I pluck the hair from the root and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much.  the material is very light but also very sturdy definitely worth buying again. I recevied this for free or a discounted price for an honest reveiw.</li>
    <li> I love my Tweezees!  Best tweezers I have ever owned and very reasonable price. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and worked great. I feel like I got surgical quality at a great price. I got it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really quality material. Decent price. Totally acceptable shipping speed. I&#x27;m saying 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;H</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great Precision! These tweezees (I love that name!) are high quality and very precise. So easy to use. I make jewelry and use high quality precision tools and that makes things a lot easier. Same with these, now tweezing is easy and painless. I keep these nearby when making jewelry now as well because they&#x27;re great for any detail work! Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are really great tweezers! They work really well and I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Amazing - these tweezers are like magnets for my hair! My eyebrows looked professionally waxed after just a few minutes. I&#x27;m never going back to my old cheapo ones again!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing.  I am pretty picky because I don&#x27;t like to wax or thread my brows, but I have lots of very fine, light colored hairs.  These tweezers grab the hairs painlessly and I am able to remove on the first try.  It&#x27;s not fun when you have to try over and over again--ouch.  I was also pleasantly surprised to get the splinter tip tweezers in the same order, I hadn&#x27;t realized I would get both. Overall, this is a great product at a great price, look no further.</li>
    <li> These are an awesome set of tweezers!!!! I used them instantly and in seconds I got rid of all my unwanted hairs! I&#x27;m so happy to have found my new favorite tweezers. Try them you will most certainly not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This pair of tweezers arrived very promptly and the quality was as advertised, excellent.  Looking forward to putting them to use.</li>
    <li> Perfectly aligned tweezers that work great! They are also much easier to hold and use because of their larger size, not like those tiny ones that can be bought at a drug store.</li>
    <li> A quality product. They will last a lifetime</li>
    <li> Both the tweezers worked very well, much better than my more expensive one.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, ample surface area to prevent slipping or cutting the hair being used on.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers!  I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers for eyebrows! Very precise! Works miracles for grabbing my thin little hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tweezees!</li>
    <li> The tweezers are absolutely wonderful - very high quality.  I took off a star as the pouch is slightly too small for the longer tweezer.  Getting the larger tweezer in the bag requires quite a bit of force.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This pair will do just about anything you need tweezers for and does it well.  I love both of these and for the price good value and great product.</li>
    <li> These are very nice, professional quality tweezers!  Great tips, weight, and length!</li>
    <li> Plenty of grabbing power on the slant tweezers, and the spliter ones are extremely sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are incredible! They get the fine hairs! Love!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful pair of both the slant tipped and pointed tweezers. My husband got a splinter out lickety split and the slant tipped removes single unwanted hairs without any slipping, first try!!  I love the pair of each!!</li>
    <li> These Tweezees are AMAZING! They really get deep in the skin and work very well. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I must tweeze my eyebrows daily and have yet find a pair of tweezers that work well. First off, love the little zipper bag to keep them in. You can grip the hair so tight that it is almost painless and your successful on the first try. No more yanking off eyelid skin either. I am beyond impressed with this set of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I love this tweezer set. I have very course hairs and it really took them out with very little effort. They felt extremely sturdy and I am so happy that I purchased them!!!! Love them :)</li>
    <li> This set comes in a thick plastic bag, but also includes a canvas bag for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers themselves are very sturdy and have a good weight in your hand. Both sets are very well aligned and I had no issue grasping or pulling my very thin eyebrow hair. Before these, I had one pair of tweezers I looked out of the ten or so I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I found both to be of a longer length than most other tweezers and this made them easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used these to pull unwanted hair so far, but I have no doubt the very thin pair will be my go to to remove my next splinter. With that said, that pair is quite sharp and requires great care to not stab yourself with them. They come capped with a plastic tip, but they easier perforated both it and the canvas bag. I would recommend keeping these away from children and storing in a hard case.</li>
    <li> These were great! They work perfectly and I like that I got two instead of just one. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> These are perfect tweezers.  I love them!</li>
    <li> Love my Tweezees!!!  The slanted tip sure makes it easier to tweeze.  Also love the quality.</li>
    <li> These are probably the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned!  Great for plucking eyebrows and the sharper pair great for very delicate things like pulling out splinters.  They&#x27;re very high quality :)</li>
    <li> I usually buy my tweezers from Tweezerman but decided to try these based on other reviews. They are sharp enough to get the smallest hairs but won&#x27;t pierce your skin and make you bleed like Tweezerman&#x27;s. I wish I had known about these sooner! Also, I love the little pouch because I can throw it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I give the Tweezees five stars--they are great!</li>
    <li> These simply work.  Nothing else to say!!  I have had so many pairs that did not!  I may order more to keep in each bathroom, my car, etc.....</li>
    <li> good as the store bought kind</li>
    <li> Solidly built, sharp and clean.  I wanted quality; I paid for quality; I got quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. The little bag is going to be great for my makeup bag! Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are RAD! I was sceptical, I&#x27;ll admit. Then I tried them and was amazed...Even my hubby loves &#x27;em. Lol.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers! You can tell they are high quality and are meant to last!</li>
    <li> I ordered these tweezers as a gift for my mom because she has had such a hard time finding a decent pair.  The package came in last night and they are excellent!  I even tried them out and they work fabulous there is no effort to try to grab the same hair over and over with no luck!  You grab it the first time every time!  They are like industrial tweezers and would be good for many uses not just eye brow plucking haha</li>
    <li> After receiving these tweezers, they were almost immediately put to use.  They are weighted well and make usage easy.  Hight quality product!</li>
    <li> Love these!! They are SO precise and work on the first try…no more accidental pokes trying to get to that one hard-to-grab hair!!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!  Very precise which makes it super easy to shape the eyebrows.  I haven&#x27;t yet used the thin ones for splinters but as they are the same product I can assume they are just as great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend these and buy them again.</li>
    <li> Just got and used these. They are super high quality. I use tweezers almost daily and these are super fine at the edge, great for short fine hairs. I haven&#x27;t used the splinter ones yet but they are very sharp - which is perfect.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Tweezers. Very precise and easy to get splinters out of fingers. Great quality</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tweezers! Both work great. It&#x27;s supper easy to get rid of an ingrown hair. Also tweezing doesn&#x27;t even hurt with these!!</li>
    <li> I love these and would recommend them for anyone! The seller was fast and gave me exactly what I ordered!</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with my purchase! I&#x27;ve owned quite a few tweezers and have mostly found them to be lacking in one way or another, but not these! The grip is wonderful, they don&#x27;t slip at all, and they grasp even the finest hairs precisely and easily. So easily in fact that I save time and get much better results doing my eyebrows. Really happy with them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, shipping was incredibly fast! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!  Would buy again, which it were five bucks cheaper, but that&#x27;s okay.  Look no further, buy these, they will last much longer.</li>
    <li> These work better than my super expensive tweezers, very happy, love them, great quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different types of tweezers, cheap and expensive, for shaping and maintaining my eyebrows. I had gotten used to having to go over an area several times due to all the hairs that get missed each time. I tried out the Tweezees slant tip tweezer as soon as it arrived, and WOW! No hairs were left behind! It even got the really fine hairs that I normally could never get without pinching my skin a couple times trying to get them. This is a great product and I look forward to using the Splinter tip tweezer, it looks like they will really do the job as well.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great! I used the slant tip and it made cleaning up my brow line a breeze! It grabbed all the hairs I wanted it to, and I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area again and again. Best tweezers ever!</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday and opened the package right away. I could not wait to try them out. It is so hard to find a good pair of tweezers and I have tried. These work great. I was off and running right away and just got carried away in the moment of tweezing. Love them and recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love them. They feel great to hold and get all the tiny hairs that my other tweezers miss. Professional quality and nice to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tweezers including tweezerman and these work the best. Thick or thin hair no problem. Great bargain since you get both tweezers you need.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work well. They get the fine hairs and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect,removing awkward splinters.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever! they dont cut the hair and holds even the thinnest hair!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Amazing product! I received these yesterday and already my eyebrows look amazing! These tweezers are wonderful.</li>
    <li> By far the best tweezers out there!!! I have tried several different tweezers and none have compared!!! This a great product.</li>
    <li> Gets the baby fine hairs with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some tweezers you have to go over and over the area and even scrape and pinch your skin to get those really fine hairs BUT not with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hairs between my brows and used to scrape the skin red in an effort to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers got them and got them the FIRST time. I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> I have some very tough hairs on my chin which required repeated attempts to pull out with my name brand tweezers.  I then tried the slant edge Tweezees and I no longer have problems.  I love them</li>
    <li> I have owned and used many tweezers-theses are the best!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing! Makes shaping my eyebrows easy and painless ... Love them! I might buy a second set as a gift for my mom. :-)</li>
    <li> Very nice set.  Well made.  Really like and appreciate the travel pouches.</li>
    <li> so far these are friggin fantastic! I would TOTALLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! The edges of this set are very sharp and precise. I already had a better quality tweezer and thought that I had the best but these definitely are better. I love that the handle is long, making it easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST tweezers I have ever used! Great grabbing power! Will definitely recommend to friends!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, works well and very sturdy - should last forever! Thanks for providing it!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used!! Thank you for such an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  High quality</li>
    <li> Absolutely exactly what I needed.  They are the BEST!!  And the ordering experience was terrific too!!!</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews for different brands of tweezers before ordering this pair.  I am pleased to say that this pair of tweezers lives up to my greatest expectation. It grabs my fine facial hair on my first attempt making plucking the undesirable hair easy and quick!</li>
    <li> I love this set of Tweezees. They work very well on the first try. Great product and I got them very quickly too.</li>
    <li> The slant tip tweezers work really well at getting short, fine hairs. I&#x27;ve bought tons of cheap tweezers and none are nearly as well aligned as these. Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Finally a good pair of tweezers.  I must have 15 pairs of tweezers in my home because I keep buying them to replace ones that don&#x27;t grip.  These have the right amount of give and well made heads to get at my tiniest splinter and hold onto it when pulling it out.  I am a glove-less gardener that has a tendency to buy plants with thorns.  This set has been a golden find.  I have used them multiple times without having to get out a needle to dig the sucker out.  Now I am ordering a second set for my eyebrows and a third for my dog&#x27;s first aid kit. Thank you Tweezees for getting it right. Now I just have to gather the others and pitch em.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers!!! First time in my life I have ones that work the way they are supposed to!</li>
    <li> Going from cheap dollar store tweezers to these were like night and day. If you grab something, you have it, it will not slip out. Definitely worth the money for that alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the needle tipped tweezers to be awesome for removing glass from my bike tires, which I do weekly to avoid flats. They are thin enough to get into the small slices of rubber, and pull out any glass in there without causing any damage. Who knows how many flats I&#x27;ve avoided because of these tweezers.</li>
    <li> Well made product. Better than most!</li>
    <li> This is one gorgeous, quality set of tweezers. I set the fine-tips to work performing dodgy self-surgery on the sole of my foot where a particularly annoying little splinter had been hiding and taunting me all week. I&#x27;d tried to root it out with standard splinter-tweezers and it just snickered at me. Well, it didn&#x27;t stand a chance against the laser-sights of these tweezers, and came out whimpering in surrender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slanted set are excellent precision eyebrow tweezers. You might want a more rough-and-tumble set for the first whack through the brush, but once you have the shape in, these are exactly what you need to edge the lawn to perfection. The precision and finish quality is awesome on these - a mile better than Tweezerman, which seem like blunt little kid&#x27;s toys by comparison. The black cord in my photos is one of those tiny little thin things used to attach cell phone charms - the photos are highly magnified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp tweezer set in a convenient case.  Easy to grab those hard to get hairs.</li>
    <li> Love these. I use them in my salon and spa to do brow shaping. I use them all day long. There great and well priced.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I use them mainly for plucking the hair on my ears. They grab the hair and pull it out effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! I&#x27;ve been looking for some high quality tweezers for a while now and I&#x27;m really glad I found these. I&#x27;ve been using Revlon and used to have a Tweezerman one and these are very comparable to both. The slant one is great quality, is strong, and is lined up perfectly, so it&#x27;s really easy to grab and pluck hairs without them snapping. The ingrown tweezers are nice because the point helps to break the skin, but it&#x27;s a little hard to hold onto hairs with those. Overall, if you use them both together, they compliment each other well and are a great set of tweezers. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> The product was promptly delivered, and arrived on the estimated date. They seem to be high quality, and come in a nice bag. I purchased these to be used in a medical setting, and I am pleased! I did receive a discount on this item to provide my honest opinion/review, fyi.</li>
    <li> Tweezers work great, zippered pouch is junk.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers. I have been looking for a good pair of tweezers for a long time now and am so happy with this pair. They are worth every penny and would definitely recommend anyone to get them. Love the fact they are a little bigger then those cheap pairs you would get at the local drug store, it mmakes it easier to handle them.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with ingrown hair. These tweezers work quite well for extracting these hair (rather than near the surface or buried deeper). The pointer ones work super well for pulling the hair out once I&#x27;ve unburied it, and the flatter ones work well for getting to it. Love them, high recommend if you have ingrown hairs too</li>
    <li> The pair of tweezers came on time and promptly on Amazon Prime.  They came with a  convenient canvas zipper bag.  Fit and finish were good as expected given the price.  Using it to take gray hair that have been coming out of the woodworks for some time.  Smooth action, grip hair precisely.  No more trying to take one strand of gray hair and plucking several natural color hair with it.  I gave it to my secretary to use (try) and she said that it was the bomb ( she used it on her eyebrows ) and said it&#x27;s probably the best tweezers that she has had the pleasure to use.  I have not use the tweezer that was made for removing ingrown hair or to take out splinters so I can&#x27;t comment on how effective it was.&lt;br /&gt;I love to use high quality, precision product and I would say this is the case with the Tweezees Precision Stainless Steel Tweezers.  Pay once and be happy.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Neither one work as promised, so disappointed. I had great hopes after reading the reviews, wonder if the quality went down on merchandise at some point. The storage case is nice but if they don&#x27;t work, why bother??  Make a better quality and ship in brown bag!!!  My cheap pair works lots better and that isn&#x27;t saying much!  Save your money and hopes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find good tweezers and often you get what you pay for. These tweezers are great. The pick up very tiny hairs without cutting them. The are bigger then your average tweezer which is good when you are like me and can&#x27;t find them when you need to. This is a really good buy. Shipping was extremely fast. I think it took one day?!!</li>
    <li> Very high quality tweezers. Better than any I have ever bought in a store. I no longer need to be frustrated by bad tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was fast and it was hassle-free.</li>
    <li> These are good quality tweezers and it&#x27;s great that you get both kinds in the package. The pointed ones are perfect for getting splinters out. The other ones work great for plucking eyebrows. Once you squeeze, they gold well and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> these made it easy to handle unwanted hair, first they fit in you hand easy.  Second they are perfect for getting the job done. I am so happy that I decided to purchase these.  I recommend them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Fantastic tweezers! Love them and they&#x27;re perfect for getting splitters out of the kiddos!</li>
    <li> I have the same tweezers for over 30 years! I tried to replace them but couldn&#x27;t find any that worked as well - UNTIL NOW! I have the most use for the slant tip which work great, and are easy to hold. They&#x27;re perfect! The splinter tip are extremely sharp!</li>
    <li> I was referred to these tweezers by a friend and love them. They fit my hands perfectly with no slip. They are larger then your typical tweezers, making it easier to hold them. Overall these are of higher quality then your normal ones and I have a feeling these will perform flawlessly over time, which I am sure will be forever!</li>
    <li> These are my fave tweezers! I have several sets of tweezers that are various sizes, and they just don&#x27;t work as well as these do!! No frustration over trying a million times to get that &amp;#34;one stray eyebrow hair!&amp;#34; I have 5 kids, so having a good pair of tweezers that work fast and effectively in removing splinters from a screaming kids foot/hand is priceless! I love Tweezees!!!</li>
    <li> Love the tweezers they work great! I didn&#x27;t realize a splinter tweezer was included in the order so that was an added bonus!!</li>
    <li> I can easily pluck excess hair in my chin easily by using this amazing tweezers! the biodegradable case is pretty cool too!</li>
    <li> Worked ok, but my small tweezers out of the swiss army pocketknife seemed to work better</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Any hair I want removed is taken care of. The process is quick with this product. No more trying to grab hold of a tiny hair for 5 minutes. This just takes Seconds. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> The regular tweezers are good. But the skinny tweezers are AWESOME! They can pull out my hairs before they even surface! I pick them right out of my skin! (For thicker hairs like eyebrow hairs) The skinny ones can cut fine hairs if you pull on them wrong, so I use the regular ones for that. They grip great.&lt;br /&gt;Best set of tweezers I ever bought. Better than Tweezerman by FAR</li>
    <li> Hands down the absolutely positively best tweezers out there.  That&#x27;s all I need to say!</li>
    <li> This is a great tweezer set.  I love that it comes with a carrying case as well.  They have a great grip and decent weight to them. These are perfect for brow shaping!</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers!  The pointy tweezers are awesome for getting splinters or anything very small.  They are very pointed and accurate.  The other one is awesome and flatter for more of a grab...They are a great set!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Tweezees are fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Tweezees tweezers because they are made of stainless steel and because of the good reviews. Although I was not originally looking for tweezers to remove splinters, it seemed like a good idea just in case. In fact, it did come in handy when I got a splinter one day. I use the other tweezers for my brows. They are good, but not the best ones I&#x27;ve owned. But at least these should last without rusting over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also come in a zippered bag which is a nice touch and helps prevent misplacing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;- Useful for splinters&lt;br /&gt;- Handy storage case&lt;br /&gt;- Works reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Not the very best in tweezing brows.</li>
    <li> I bought these solely on reviews and how most raved about these tweezers. I was so excited to receive my new miracle Tweezees. I thought I was eliminating all the frustration these very contrary, unwanted, nasty black chin hairs were causing me. Young girls may be laughing. Some middle-aged women may not have this problem, but the majority fight with it like me. Even though the tweezees grab the hair, they will not hold onto it. Just like my old faithfuls, I have to slowly work with the hair to pull it out, and even then at times that doesn&#x27;t work! Errrrrr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in my purchase. The Tweezees are no better for me than any inexpensive pair I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store. I did try the pointed tweezers. The only thing they might be good for is removing splinters. Personally, I DO NOT RECOMMEND spending the extra money for this set. For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A good pair of tweezers are SO HARD to find....!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many have died and now live at the bottom of my beauty &amp;#34;junk drawer.&amp;#34;  Too many.  When I got this set it was love at first sight.  The larger pair was perfect and it really did get some tiny, tiny hairs, however, the tip is very easily damaged and within a week it had already lost the precision I am so frequently on the hunt for...</li>
    <li> Very sharp and work great!</li>
    <li> Really happy with them even came in a cute bag 😁</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Tried them out the same day I got them.  These are some serious tweezers!  Effortless in grabbing and removing hair.  Got each hair out on the first attempt!  Gone are the days of re-grabbing a hair over and over again in an effort to get rid of it.  I&#x27;ve tried many tweezers over the years.  This one ROCKS!</li>
    <li> This is the last pair of tweezers I will ever own as they grasp perfectly every time for whatever I need them for!</li>
    <li> Tweezees are exactly what I wanted. The slant tip grips nicely and plucks more than 1 hair at a time. A time saver. The splinter tip is perfect for many things. Great for removing one particular hair or any small object. Thank you.</li>
    <li> There are some things that quality makes all the difference... and when you have a difficult splinter or that whisker that &amp;#34;must go&amp;#34;, even average name brand tweezers perform like garbage.  I don&#x27;t know why, but simple tweezers vary widely.  My wife had some tweezers that were very good, but she didn&#x27;t want me using them for my &amp;#34;splinter triage kit&amp;#34;.  Yes... I routinely get firewood or lumber piercings because I am careless... I decided I needed &amp;#34;really good tweezers&amp;#34; because the ones I was using were worthless.  I thought.. Amazon reviewers will be brutally honest... so the reviews led me to these and I am not disappointed... the pointy tweezers removed a tiny splinter I had been unable to remove for a week, and for normal hair removal the slant end tweezers grab like super-glue for easy removal.  The brushed stainless finish looks professional, durable, and manly-enough for me... (I didn&#x27;t really wants &amp;#34;flowered&amp;#34; or pink tweezers if I had my choice.)  My recommendation?  If &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; 5 dollar tweezers have ever frustrated you, these will show you that all tweezers are not created equal and the extra cost is worth it.  Quality tools make all the difference.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great quality. It really does get those stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever had -- even better than those I have paid more for.</li>
    <li> The BEST Tweezers ever!. I tried them out as soon as I received them and them work great, they pulled out the hair in one try. No more broken short hairs to try to re-pull. I also love the little bag and the name.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is wonderful. They actually reached out to me to see if I received the tweezers!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re wonderful - everyone should buy a pair.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! I had a pair of tweezers that I loved, but after 10 years- they didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job anymore. I was on a quest to find a pair just as good- after much money down the drain, I was afraid that I would never find any. I found these on Amazon and after reading the positive reviews- thought I would give my quest one more shot! Boy am I glad I did! They work even better than my favorite pair did in the beginning! Very easy to get close to the skin and grabs the hair. No slipping and doesn&#x27;t cut the hair off where it grabs. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> Better than any I have bought in a store.</li>
