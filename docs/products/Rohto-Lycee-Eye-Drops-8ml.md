      <li>I wear contacts and it feels good!</li>
      <li>I always bring this when I fly because it makes my eyes feel so good after a flight.  </li>
      <li>It is soothing and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>and I am good to go all day.</li>
      <li>I love these rohtos for contacts!</li>
      <li>packaging was great and the item arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m providing 4 stars because I love the cute bottle, the applicator has no problem, and it feels amazing when I fly.</li>
      <li>Arrived in a nice package and the product worked as instructed.</li>
      <li>they leave your eyes feeling nice and hydrated.</li>
      <li>They have a very nice cooling sensation and they work just fine</li>
      <li>They are perfect and my new favorite eye drop.</li>
      <li>The product itself is very cute and easy to carry around with you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Cute packaging and love the refreshing feeling after using these eye drops!</li>
      <li>It is a very smooth feeling, and you feel more awake than you did before using them.</li>
      <li>Better than most red-eye relief drops because this has vitamins.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would like to order more and would recommend others to order it.</li>
      <li>I find the more</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
      <li>The bottle says it is ok to use with contacts which is an exception for most Rohtos.</li>
      <li>in all, this is perfect for people who sometimes have some eye issues (sitting at the computer too long, wind, etc)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product - it is refreshing and minty.  </li>
      <li>bought this because it&#x27;s super cute</li>
      <li>It has super cute packaging.  </li>
      <li>Very girly but the quality of the drops, AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>and he said it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
      <li>This eye drop is very mild with a mild flower-like fragrance.</li>
      <li>My eyes feel SOOO much better and my vision is more clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;People always ask me about it, the cute shape, and how eyedrops can be &amp;#34;lychee&amp;#34; flavored (which I still don&#x27;t really get myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,</li>
      <li>And true to Rohto formula, they eliminate redness from irritation and allergies INSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The stinging sensation goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Used for few years already, still the top 3 eyedrops in my list.&lt;br /&gt;Not too cooling, but refreshing and relaxing the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>The moment I put the first drop, it stings.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great rohto product, and the drops are actually tinted pink too!</li>
      <li>I have tried alot of drops and most of them I would have to reapply all day long</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t help with dryness for the long run - gel drops are still much better than using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These were very interesting when I got them, I can actually taste the lyc&amp;eacute;e in them at the back of my throat.</li>
      <li>and so my eye has more blood veins than typically because they were trying to deliver oxygen to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Adorable and effective- dont be fooled by the pink sparkly packaging, there is some serious punch to these drops.</li>
      <li>I use the regular ones religiously and not being able to use those with contacts was always a bit</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these eye drops to everyone.</li>
      <li>My eyes get pretty red when I smoke, but these make my sclera crystal clear!</li>
      <li>I have no usual dryness or allergies and bought this because I wanted a milder drop for my eyes.</li>
      <li>This is partly due to my own eye&#x27;s health caused by my previous habits, but I was still hoping for a miracle anyway.  </li>
      <li>It makes my eyes feel soft and awake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about the same burn as the green rohtos, so a slight refreshing cool since I usually use the ice ones.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve tried the Rohto V ICE drops, you know they may have a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation that might be a little harsh for most.</li>
      <li>Sure, they give a little tingle, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>

<li> can relieve the minor itchiness and redness.</li>
<li> He has dry eyes.</li>
<li> I have dry eyes</li>
<li> It gives me a relief when my eyes are dry or itchy.</li>
<li> I have dry eye</li>
<li> Afterwards, there is this cooling effect that last less than a minute.</li>
<li> and my eyes are typically a bit red.  </li>
<li> These are about 70% less &amp;#34;Frosty&amp;#34; than the regular icy Rohtos.</li>
<li> It will keep your eyes wet, it does not burn much so it is not very effective for dry eyes and has to be used often, though not as often as common eye drops.</li>
<li> and I was curious about the mint drops.  </li>
<li> I have only used it for a little now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed an extreme change in the redness of my eyes</li>
<li> I have never tried the other types of drops.</li>
<li> I read the reviews that said these drops had less of a menthol sting then the other Rohto drops.</li>
<li> I ordered it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Ordinary eye drops were useless but this one really helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The drop itself has a cool menthol feel but not in a bad way but a relieving way...</li>
<li> I used it a few times and it cools my eyes</li>
<li> I think it make dry eyes worse.</li>
<li> I am not sure if i will continue to use this product.</li>
<li> so any eye drops usually sting...</li>
<li> I am not sure how to rate this product.</li>
<li> When you first add the drops to your eyes, you feel a small burn, nothing horrible and it lasts a very short time span, maybe two seconds.</li>
<li> I think Rohto created this in response to all the women who complained about the overly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; mentholated sting.</li>
<li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think these drops sting THAT BAD.</li>
<li> I blink the worse it gets.</li>
<li> These drops do have the cooling, but not as bad.</li>
<li> Seriously, this eye drop is the bomb!!!!  </li>

    <li> Used for few years already, still the top 3 eyedrops in my list.&lt;br /&gt;Not too cooling, but refreshing and relaxing the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also can relieve the minor itchiness and redness.</li>
    <li> I love these rohtos for contacts! I use the regular ones religiously and not being able to use those with contacts was always a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;People always ask me about it, the cute shape, and how eyedrops can be &amp;#34;lychee&amp;#34; flavored (which I still don&#x27;t really get myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s a great rohto product, and the drops are actually tinted pink too! It&#x27;s about the same burn as the green rohtos, so a slight refreshing cool since I usually use the ice ones.</li>
    <li> Adorable and effective- dont be fooled by the pink sparkly packaging, there is some serious punch to these drops. Like ice for your eyes, in a great way!</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes and my eyes are typically a bit red.  Also, when I used to wear contacts before I got LASIK several years ago, I would never take my contacts out and so my eye has more blood veins than typically because they were trying to deliver oxygen to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it&#x27;s super cute and I was curious about the mint drops.  I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product - it is refreshing and minty.  I always bring this when I fly because it makes my eyes feel so good after a flight.  But it doesn&#x27;t necessarily whiten my eyes the way I wished it did.  This is partly due to my own eye&#x27;s health caused by my previous habits, but I was still hoping for a miracle anyway.  It also doesn&#x27;t help with dryness for the long run - gel drops are still much better than using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m providing 4 stars because I love the cute bottle, the applicator has no problem, and it feels amazing when I fly.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how to rate this product. I used it a few times and it cools my eyes but i have noticed the following morning, my eyes get itchy. I am not sure if i will continue to use this product. I think it make dry eyes worse.</li>
    <li> It will keep your eyes wet, it does not burn much so it is not very effective for dry eyes and has to be used often, though not as often as common eye drops. The bottle says it is ok to use with contacts which is an exception for most Rohtos. This is understandable, the product is marketed towards women and women in Japan don&#x27;t like wearing glasses.</li>
    <li> I have no usual dryness or allergies and bought this because I wanted a milder drop for my eyes. My eyes get pretty red when I smoke, but these make my sclera crystal clear! Better than most red-eye relief drops because this has vitamins. It makes my eyes feel soft and awake. No blurry vision after using like with gel drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is perfect for people who sometimes have some eye issues (sitting at the computer too long, wind, etc) but I don&#x27;t think it helps with chronic eye issues. Go to a doctor for that.</li>
    <li> I think Rohto created this in response to all the women who complained about the overly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; mentholated sting. These are about 70% less &amp;#34;Frosty&amp;#34; than the regular icy Rohtos. Sure, they give a little tingle, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. And true to Rohto formula, they eliminate redness from irritation and allergies INSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like regular Rohto, you will like Lycee.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that said these drops had less of a menthol sting then the other Rohto drops. I have never tried the other types of drops. Personally, I don&#x27;t think these drops sting THAT BAD. I have dry eye so any eye drops usually sting...on a scale of 1-10, these drops sting around a 4. The stinging sensation goes away quickly. I find the more I blink the worse it gets. I just put the drops in and close my eyes for a minute. THEY DO WORK. My eyes feel SOOO much better and my vision is more clear. Its like someone took a rag and wiped all the funk from my eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Ordinary eye drops were useless but this one really helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to order more and would recommend others to order it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched everywhere for these in my local stores, but had no luck. If you&#x27;ve tried the Rohto V ICE drops, you know they may have a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation that might be a little harsh for most. I didn&#x27;t mind it, but it was making my eyes water when I&#x27;d put on makeup. These drops do have the cooling, but not as bad. They are perfect and my new favorite eye drop.</li>
    <li> These are the only eyedrops that give me immediate relief, whether I&#x27;m wearing contacts or not. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> This eye drop is very mild with a mild flower-like fragrance. It is soothing and lasts a good amount of time. I wear contacts and it feels good!</li>
    <li> I have always used this eye drop. It gives me a relief when my eyes are dry or itchy. It has a hint of floral smell which I also like. Definitely will recommend for those who have dry eyes because of contacts. I apply it before and after I wear contacts.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging and love the refreshing feeling after using these eye drops! Can be used while you have contacts on!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend. He has dry eyes. So I bought it for him and he said it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a nice package and the product worked as instructed. I highly recommend these eye drops to everyone. they leave your eyes feeling nice and hydrated.</li>
    <li> These were very interesting when I got them, I can actually taste the lyc&amp;eacute;e in them at the back of my throat. They have a very nice cooling sensation and they work just fine</li>
    <li> The moment I put the first drop, it stings. Afterwards, there is this cooling effect that last less than a minute. My eyes feel refreshed. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this eye drop is the bomb!!!!  Love, love, love.  It has super cute packaging.  Very girly but the quality of the drops, AMAZING.  I go through seasonal allergies every year and this eye drop lasts all day and not have to reapply or burn.  I came across this eye drop recommendation through a blog and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  The drop itself has a cool menthol feel but not in a bad way but a relieving way...one that makes you say, ahhhh.  I have tried alot of drops and most of them I would have to reapply all day long or it would irritate my eyes.  These, I apply once and I am good to go all day.</li>
    <li> como toda marca japonesa es muy suave para ojos sensibles como es mi caso quita la rojez rapidamente y no es muy fuerte lo puedes usa incluso maquillada</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! When you first add the drops to your eyes, you feel a small burn, nothing horrible and it lasts a very short time span, maybe two seconds. You almost immediately feel relief. It is a very smooth feeling, and you feel more awake than you did before using them. I have only used it for a little now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed an extreme change in the redness of my eyes but I will continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great and the item arrived quickly! The product itself is very cute and easy to carry around with you.&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this to friends!</li>
