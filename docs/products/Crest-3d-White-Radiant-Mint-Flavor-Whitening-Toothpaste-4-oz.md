### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>I was so impressed.</li>

      <li>I know I will have happy results within the two weeks!</li>
      <li>Great price for 6 tubes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally maybe this toothpaste might be best used in conjunction with the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good toothpaste, noticed just a bit of improvement in the tooth color after a month, but nothing too noticeable.</li>
      <li>I began to use it about 3-4 months after my whitening treatment, and based on results, it has done a very good job.</li>
      <li>The flavor is good, brushy brushy brushy!.  </li>
      <li>My teeth look great and my breath smells good too!  </li>
      <li>Excellent value with Amazon price and very stylish and confortable</li>
      <li>We both have great teeth</li>

      <li>I do not notice a great whitening effect, however I am a coffee drinker</li>
      <li>This product is great, it whitens my teeth in 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I was convinced it was a great product</li>
      <li>but i am really happy with these unintentional results.</li>
      <li>and if you like the results, then buying here in bulk may be a great idea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not looking for freakishly blue-white teeth or anything, but a couple of shades lighter would look great.</li>
      <li>This is a pleasant tasting paste.</li>
      <li>Could be a good deal if you can find coupons or buy it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
      <li>Good for whitening and health of teeth.</li>
      <li>It tastes good, the mint isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
      <li>It makes your teeth feel good and look good too.</li>
      <li>My wife &amp; I both loved this toothpaste &amp; began using it exclusively.  </li>
      <li>Good toothpaste.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how good that is.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying I have good dental hygiene.</li>
      <li>I like the taste - very pleasant and not too strong.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I had been an avid user of crest whitestrips supreme which is the best whitening kit money can buy and wanted something to keep up the whiteness of my teeth when i</li>
      <li>I just LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I think this toothpaste would be good at maintaining whiteness, but nothing magical will happen if you use it by itself.</li>
      <li>Kind of grainy.</li>
      <li>I continued using Crest 3D while rinsing with warm salt water and baking soda once or twice a day.</li>
      <li>It does what it says it does, and is a good toothpaste on top of that.  </li>
      <li>He liked it because unlike products with peroxcide, didnot irritate his gums,etc.  </li>
      <li>As mentioned, the taste is very pleasant to me and it really freshens my breath.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone in the family liked this toothpaste, a rarity for our group to be sure.</li>
      <li>The consistency and flavor of this toothpaste is excellent (and I&#x27;m not typically a fan of Crest products).  </li>
      <li>After using this for 2 days and 2 nights:  First thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that food tasted great</li>
      <li>I LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>If I up the frequency of my brushing from 1 - 2 to 3 times a day, I imagine I would get better results still.</li>
      <li>&quot; Anti plaque&amp;whitening does a much better job</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just one of many choices.  </li>
      <li>This is better than a dentist&#x27;s office whitener.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the top of the line Crest 3-D whitening strips, have been using this tooth paste and the Crest 3-D whitening mouth wash for months</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a good product and worth trying if you are like so many of us caffeine-loaded.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>One of my favorite whitening systems I have used and believe me, I have used a lot.</li>
      <li>and I had to insert a knife to get more toothpaste out.  </li>
      <li>and I like the flip top tube design.</li>
      <li>Now, they are sort of static.</li>
      <li>My teeth were whiter within just one use, I already felt more confident of them.</li>
      <li>so the toothpaste I put on and leave standing for awhile has fallen off many times when I leave it standing.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I would notice more whitening over an extended period of use.</li>
      <li>It will take more than this to whiten people&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and hopefully it gets better over time.</li>
      <li>top tube made for ease of use and</li>
      <li>tues was a follow up with my dentist just to make sure he found 6 area also effeted.  </li>
      <li>but, it can&#x27;t be safe.</li>
      <li>While the manufacturer emphasizes the whitening potential of this product, I found its all around properties as a toothpaste quite excellent.  </li>
      <li>it took a lot just to be able to tolerate it.  </li>
      <li>I love to drink coffee and eat sweets.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the result would be more substantial with longer use than one tube.</li>
      <li>The thing I dislike about this toothpaste is the mint flavor is SO overwhelming...</li>
      <li>and i fell in love with it ever since.</li>
      <li>(I have to admit, though, that I attribute most of this to my Sonicare toothbrush).  </li>
      <li>And, many years ago, I tried another whitening toothpaste, and it also worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are getting whiter and look much better.</li>
      <li>I was able to go to work that night but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s taken off more than 80%.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a week now, and I can tell right after a good brushing that my teeth are a tint whiter.  </li>
      <li>Everything was good for the first week or two.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The &#x60;radiant mint&#x27; taste is refreshing and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth extremely clean and really does a great job whitening.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s even great for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be totally fair, I don&#x27;t drink coffee much, and don&#x27;t have seroiusly stained teeth.  </li>
      <li>It makes my teeth feel very smooth and clean</li>
      <li>This is truly an easy and inexpensive way to brighten your teeth.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>So while it&#x27;s a fine toothpaste</li>
      <li>stuff works fine, and that&#x27;s coming from a guy who has used the Colgate toothpaste bundles from Wal-Mart for years.</li>
      <li>Tastes fine, didn&#x27;t see any change in tooth color.    </li>
      <li>I would think that if you use them to whiten your teeth first, that the toothpaste might be the best at keeping them white.</li>
      <li>The taste of the toothpaste is marvelous and it doesnt have that famous overpowering mint taste to it that is just unbelievably hard to keep in your mouth.</li>
      <li>toothpaste has a minty and maybe even a light burning sensation after you brush.  </li>
      <li>I really liked how much cleaner my teeth and mouth felt after using it.</li>
      <li>I bought the toothpaste, used it everyday, and was so happy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing you need fairly even mix of the paste and gel, and clearly I wasn&#x27;t getting that through the goopy opening.  </li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s very fresh and pleasant-tasting.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that it was advertised as having whiter teeth in 2 weeks but after using it, there was no noticeable difference.    </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m brushing day in and out, not noticing any significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Now my teeth are a good shade or two lighter, and new stains come right off.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Crest toothpaste is a mixture feel of gel and paste combined.  The color is light blue and as you brush you will build up some foam.  As far as whitening the teeth, I doubt it will go that far, simply because toothpastes need to boast in something all the time, and this \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; product is the claim to whiten in 15 days.  The fluoride formula is believed to polish away surface stains.  It will take more than this to whiten people&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is the flip lid.  No more losing it and nobody complaining...... put the damn cap back on the toothpaste por favor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great feature.  As far as the tube, I used my toothpaste in my gym bag and weeks later, noticed that there is a crack in the tube.  This could have been a gooey mess if I had not spotted the split/crack in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste has a minty and maybe even a light burning sensation after you brush.  The flavor is good, brushy brushy brushy!.  Rizzo</li>
    <li> After trying this out for a month, I have to smile and say this toothpaste does brighten teeth, well.  Taste decent too, and I like these smaller wider tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be totally fair, I don&#x27;t drink coffee much, and don&#x27;t have seroiusly stained teeth.  And, many years ago, I tried another whitening toothpaste, and it also worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, yes, it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> The consistency and flavor of this toothpaste is excellent (and I&#x27;m not typically a fan of Crest products).  I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s made my teeth significantly whiter, but I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t blame me; I&#x27;m no toothpaste aficionado.  I know, however, if stuff works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a week now, and I can tell right after a good brushing that my teeth are a tint whiter.  It&#x27;s no drastic change, but I see my own teeth in the mirror often enough to know if there are any color changes (or food stuck in between).  The box shows that it takes up 14 days, but already I know there are some subtle differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re skeptical about this sort of stuff, that&#x27;s fine.  Really, if you brush your teeth as you&#x27;re supposed to every day, then it wouldn&#x27;t really matter what sort of toothpaste you use.  Only once did I have to use a whitening kit (by Crest) years ago, and that&#x27;s becuase my teeth yellowed from drinking gallons of black tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works fine, and that&#x27;s coming from a guy who has used the Colgate toothpaste bundles from Wal-Mart for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased the CREST 3d WHITE toothpaste right after I saw the commercial on TV.  I figured I would give it a shot and if it did not work, I can write a negative review.  Can I just tell you that this toothpaste not only works but it leaves your mouth tingling for hours as if you have used a mouthwash. I gave the toothpaste one full tube to start working and by the second week of using the toothpaste, EVERYONE started noticing my whiter teeth. Needless to say, by the end of the complete tube, my teeth were better than white. I just LOVE it! I have recommended this product to my co-workers, friends and family. After they try it, they can&#x27;t stop talking about it.  This is truly an easy and inexpensive way to brighten your teeth. This is better than a dentist&#x27;s office whitener. You have to brush your teeth daily right? So why not brighten them at the same time while you brush your teeth? The difference between this product and any other teeth whitener is that you are brightening EVERY tooth, inside and out, left and right, top and bottom, wherever that toothbrush goes. So your teeth are evenly white. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It works and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I tried 3d white after seeing the commercials on TV for it. I had been an avid user of crest whitestrips supreme which is the best whitening kit money can buy and wanted something to keep up the whiteness of my teeth when i was&#x27;nt whitening with the strips. My teeth would get white but not super glow in the dark white like i wanted. I would use colgate toothpaste with mini whitening strips(does nothing at all) along with baking soda brushing and never got results like this. After using this toothpaste for 6 brushes i already have noticed a considerable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. The taste of the toothpaste is marvelous and it doesnt have that famous overpowering mint taste to it that is just unbelievably hard to keep in your mouth. I have seen a review complaining abou the crystals getting stuck in your gums. I have personally not noticed any difference than my regular toothpaste and i have not gotten any sensitivity problems etc.. and i am a very HARD brusher. The toothpaste also makes my mouth feel cleaner than any other toothpaste i&#x27;ve used. Overall this toothpaste is whitening even further than whitestrips supreme and i absolutely love to wear a button down solid black shirt to show off the white teeth and give a huge smile to everyone i see. THIS IS THE ONLY WHITENING PASTE THAT DOES ANYTHING AT ALL.</li>
    <li> okay so i bought this toothpaste from the store, ive been using it for about a week now (7 days) at first it seemed to work then on the 4 day my teeth became dim again.    You know i would not recommend this product they always claim it does this and that but it barely does...    i suggest you getting \\&quot;Tom&#x27;s of main\\&quot; Anti plaque&amp;whitening does a much better job and it never stains teeth</li>
    <li> I cannot use any whitening strips at all - the bleaching agents make my teeth and gums throb with pain before I even take off the first strip. Unfortunately this means I cannot use many whitening agents, and I drink coffee so my teeth are a bit yellow. I&#x27;m not looking for freakishly blue-white teeth or anything, but a couple of shades lighter would look great. I picked up this toothpaste not expecting much (how much could it possibly do in under two minutes of contact with my teeth?) I was very pleasantly surprised with the results. My teeth are noticeably whiter and even the stains my braces left behind when I was a teenager were minimized, which is awesome because I assumed they were under the surface stains. The effects of this toothpaste are mild in terms of whitening, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle. But for people who can&#x27;t use traditional whitening methods, this is a very nice product that does get decent results. I do not experience any sensitivity with this product at all. I know some people do, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you can&#x27;t stand other whitening products.</li>
    <li> I bought this tonight, and used it once. (To early to see any whitening effect).&lt;br /&gt;However, when I brushed it burned my mouth and tongue and had an awful taste. My teeth fell very sensitive, sore and my lips hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after the crest whitestrips I used 3 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I wont use it again, its to strong.&lt;br /&gt;Also the only medical ingredient is flouride! And there&#x27;s no non-medical ingredients listed?!&lt;br /&gt;Very strange!&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant tasting paste. It seems to help on whiteness but I am a little wary of the chemistry of such products -- abrasives, compounds and whatever. So, there&#x27;s nothing here that makes this a \\&quot;must get\\&quot; alternative to whatever you use now. But it&#x27;s a good product and worth trying if you are like so many of us caffeine-loaded. I personally would not seek it out but I am quite likely to try it again for a while and see how it matches up against the Crest paste I now use.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a month.  Use it at least 3X a day (i.e., take it to work) to see good results, but it does deliver modest improvements. Possibly more noticeable with big tea drinkers (that is the case with this sample N&#x3D;1). Keep expectations in check, and you&#x27;ll think this product is worth the extra expense (comes in a smaller package than usual).  On the other hand, if you&#x27;re the sort who responds to the teeth whitening ads littering the internet, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I have been a life-long user of Crest. I was excited to see that it was advertised as having whiter teeth in 2 weeks but after using it, there was no noticeable difference.    This product reminds me of the Crest Pro-White in terms of taste but not as off putting. The consistency is slightly odd as it is not very water soluble like I&#x27;ve been accustomed to in toothpaste. I use a stand up electric toothbrush so the toothpaste I put on and leave standing for awhile has fallen off many times when I leave it standing. Also if it drops in the sink, the water really won&#x27;t wash it away without some force.    I do like how minty and clean my mouth and teeth do feel after brushing and rinsing but I think I will switch back to the Crest toothpaste with Scope after this tube is up.</li>
    <li> After using this for a few weeks, I started noticing little dark spots on a my gums in a few places. I was concerned so I went to the dentist. Turns out the little blue crystal beads from the toothpaste had gotten lodged under my gums in a few places! He was able to get them all out (some took work and others came out easily - overall not a fun experience). He advised me to throw the toothpaste out immediately and said if they had remained there, they could have caused an infection and possibly chronic Gingivitis. Thanks, Crest! :-/ Never again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste. It has become the only one I buy. It leaves my mouth extremely clean and really does a great job whitening. I use it about 3-4 times a day and haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity. My husband likes it as well and it has become the preferred toothpaste in my household.</li>
    <li> I started using the brand awhile ago and finally managed to find it cheaper here on Amazon. Good toothpaste. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Although it claims to potentially \\&quot;remove up to 80% of surface stains for a whiter smile in just 14 days\\&quot; I decided to test this out for 30. I figured that if anything my results would be better and enough so that I could post before &amp; after pictures to confirm my experience. Unfortunately neither has, nor I believe will happen and so I am going back to my regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this product doesn&#x27;t work, because in reading the reviews from others it is obvious that it does.  What I believe is that it won&#x27;t work for everyone and because of that you should really purchase just a single tube instead of six to begin with.  Give it a try and if you like the results, then buying here in bulk may be a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally maybe this toothpaste might be best used in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips]]?  I would think that if you use them to whiten your teeth first, that the toothpaste might be the best at keeping them white. Either way I can recommend trying this product as long as your expectations are reasonable. Hope for whiter teeth, but be prepared for just clean ones.</li>
    <li> My girls and I have used this toothpaste for the last 3 weeks.  I can say that our teeth are much whiter and feel cleaner/smoother.  I&#x27;m a 4-cup a morning coffee drinker and my girls are tea drinkers, all of us have seen marked improvement in the brightness of our teeth.  The &#x60;radiant mint&#x27; taste is refreshing and not too strong.  There isn&#x27;t a gritty texture like other whiting toothpastes we have tried.  Even thought the toothpaste is more expense, my girls (9 &amp; 10) seem to use less but don&#x27;t have complaints about brushing.  I believe that you pay for what you get...I will definitely add this to my regular shopping list.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a fresh taste--not too strong, but not too sweet--and the gel is light, not thick and sticky. I haven&#x27;t used a Crest product in years, but I like this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to love this toothpaste as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftern using it approximately 10 days I switched back to my old Colgate (well, to be honest, I couldn&#x27;t find this tube).  In only 3 days I noticed stains reappearing on my teeth and also I missed the really refreshing taste and smell of this toothpaste.  After relocating it, I decided to buy a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the stain whitening really work?  YES.  As a person who occasionally drinks red wine, and daily drinks both tea and coffee... I struggle with stains.  This toothpaste does not replace a professional cleaning, but it sure makes my teeth more noticeably whiter.  The tube says it takes &#x27;up to 14 days&#x27;, however I thought it was quite obvious after only 8-10 days.  I do have a whitening kit at home, but this is so very much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a light gel - not a paste -- and there are white sparkly inclusions in the gel.  As mentioned, the taste is very pleasant to me and it really freshens my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my new favorite toothpaste.  Yes, I recommend it highly and YES, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried it. The cap wasn&#x27;t sealed tight enough. The toothpaste got hard like a rock and I had to insert a knife to get more toothpaste out.  This happened several times.  Other, more cap-conscious consumers might like it better.    Tastes fine, didn&#x27;t see any change in tooth color.    Finally, I threw it out. It&#x27;s not worth it for me to have to fight with a tube of toothpaste every morning.  I want to squeeze and brush.</li>
    <li> While the manufacturer emphasizes the whitening potential of this product, I found its all around properties as a toothpaste quite excellent.  It really does go after surface stains and accumulated muck on the teeth very well, although the package claim it can remove up to 80% of surface stains in 14 days seems overblown. It cleans quite thoroughly and is not abrasive. While there is an improvement in whiteness, it was not enough to knock one&#x27;s socks off.  Perhaps the result would be more substantial with longer use than one tube. It also has a very neutral taste (no pina colada here).  On the downside, I found it hard to keep on the brush (it often seemed determined to slide off), and once it hit the sink, it was sometimes difficult to wash away. The bottom line is that this is a serious toothpaste that does the job quite well.  I purchased a large tube I was so impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and am very happy with it. I like the taste - very pleasant and not too strong. I have noticed a difference in how clean my teeth get without the abrasiveness of some other whitening toothpastes. Perhaps I was expecting too much but although my teeth are whiter and definitely look better, I only gave this four stars since it was not quite as dramatic as other reviewers have described.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it whitens my teeth in 2 weeks nd I happen to smoke and drinks lots of coffee a day (8 cups). Nows heres where the problem starts: After brushing twice  day and for doing it for 2 weeks, I noticed my teeth started being too sensitive to cold temperature. Before I started with this product, I used to chew ice cubes and eat a lot of ice cream, now I cant. I havent check with my dentist yet, and its been a month since I stopped using this product and my teeth is still sensitive but to a degree, still I decided to post this review in case somebody else have the same problem (this also happens with my wife&#x27;s teeth).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth to be any whiter, but I already had fairly white teeth to begin with so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. The thing I dislike about this toothpaste is the mint flavor is SO overwhelming...even 3-4 hours after I brush my teeth, I can still taste the mint. This is annoying when I want to eat something because it alters the flavor of the food. It didn&#x27;t bother me at first, but I&#x27;m on my second tube and I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.</li>
    <li> To be fair, it worked at least. I can’t say the same about a lot of these teeth whitening products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only on day 4 but already I see whiter teeth! The taste is great! I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the family liked this toothpaste, a rarity for our group to be sure. 2 adults and 2 kids (aged 9 and 13) used this toothpaste through the trial review period. Took a couple of uses to get used to the taste (at least for me), but we all generally liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flip top tube made for ease of use and less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey for everyday use. I could see buying this once in a while, especially as we like to have some occasional variety in our personal use items. Could be a good deal if you can find coupons or buy it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jury is still out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much of an apparent whitening effect. It did leave my teeth and mouth feeling clean, though. Perhaps I would notice more whitening over an extended period of use. Three weeks might not have been enough time to gauge this claim. I am a coffee drinker and being in my mid-40&#x27;s I have also lost some enamel, so it&#x27;s a little more difficult for me to observe gradual whitening effects when using a particular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste twice a day, every day, for 2 months, and I saw no discernible difference in the color of my teeth.  Using one of those tooth-shade charts, I checked my teeth maybe every other week, and not once did I think my teeth had become even one shade whiter.  The only real difference I noticed was that my gums felt more sensitive; after I stopped using the Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste, my gums felt normal again.</li>
    <li> I dont drink coffee or smoke but my teeth did have some discoloring (yellow).  I have been using the toothpaste for about two weeks and I can see that my teeth are whiter than before and have stayed that way.  The toothpaste is not expensive at all...I got mines at Target and for two tubes it was only $7 and some change and I also use the mouth wash as well.  I brush my teeth and mouth wash every morning and night and sometimes depending on what I eat brush after a meal. Hope this helps anyone whos on the edge about trying. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Crest 3D is a decent toothpaste.  It has a light mint taste leaning more towards the medicinal side of flavor than some other toothpastes.  It&#x27;s in gel form with some small particles in it that make it feel like it&#x27;s scrubbing your teeth.  And it comes is a nifty - if small - tube with a large flat cap so it can stand upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a fine toothpaste but a quick comparison of active ingredients reveal it to be no different than any other toothpaste (sodium fluoride, yo) and plenty of other toothpastes claim to whiten your teeth too.  So while it&#x27;s a fine toothpaste it&#x27;s just one of many choices.  Now if they invent a toothpaste where a little dental hygienist pops out of the tube and professionally cleans your teeth that will be something. :-)</li>
    <li> I drink coffee. Lots of it. I also smoke cigars. Not a lot of them, but from the standpoint of your teeth, any tobacco is probably too much. Therefore I wasn&#x27;t too shocked when I saw in a recent photo that my smile had turned a distinct and extremely unpleasant shade of yellow. I wasn&#x27;t shocked, but I wasn&#x27;t freaking happy about it either. I mean...yellow teeth? I&#x27;m 37. Not 97. Nothing on me should be yellow except, possibly, the hand-stamp of whatever Irish bar I happened to be drinking at last night. On the other hand, bleaching my teeth with anything but a dentist&#x27;s laser has no appeal, as the standard whiteners-in-a-box are notorious for making your teeth unbearably sensitive. And mine are already sensitive to begin with. So when Vine offered this toothpaste, I said, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bad product. Within a few days of use I noticed that the yellowness of my teeth was beginning to fade. After two weeks it faded considerably. If I up the frequency of my brushing from 1 - 2 to 3 times a day, I imagine I would get better results still. That&#x27;s the good news. The bad news is that I doubt those of you who have been heavy coffee-drinkers and smokers for many years will be able to achieve more than a reduction in the overall yellowness of your choppers. You definitely are NOT going to get a pearly-white, Matt Damon / Charisma Carpenter smile. But for the few bucks it takes to obtain this paste, I think the result is worth the expense.</li>
    <li> All of the brand-name toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever tried did an acceptable job of cleaning my teeth.  Crest 3D White Vivid does, too.  I haven&#x27;t particularly noticed that my teeth are whiter than they were before, but here again, regardless of any toothpaste&#x27;s claims to brighter brights and whiter whites, they all seem to clean pretty much the same to me.  Therefore, my rating of Crest 3D White Vivid is based on other characteristics.    I really like the zippy, minty flavor.  When I first started using this, I was also using up another tube of a different kind.  I started out using one in the morning and the other at night.  Before long, I was alternating days instead.  Before much longer, I was using the Crest for two or three days in a row, then making myself use the other just so I could get it used up.      I like the gel consistency, which seems as if it allows me to use less toothpaste than usual.  It freshens my mouth really well, and the freshness seems to last.  It makes my teeth feel very smooth and clean (I have to admit, though, that I attribute most of this to my Sonicare toothbrush).  I like the stand-up tube that keeps the product at the \\&quot;squirt end\\&quot; all the time, and I like the attached cap that never goes missing.  I&#x27;ll probably be choosing this one again next time I go toothpaste shopping.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to review this product, as I didn&#x27;t have much to say. At least I didn&#x27;t until I went for my checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visited my dentist and the hygienist asked me if I had whitened my teeth again. I said I hadn&#x27;t. They have a video system and it showed my teeth were as white if not a bit whiter than compared to my last visit. I was long overdue so at the very least, the Crest 3D White Vivid kept my teeth white.  I began to use it about 3-4 months after my whitening treatment, and based on results, it has done a very good job. I have used several other whitening toothpastes and while none gave astounding results, Crest 3D has done a good job at a far more reasonable price than others I have bought. I don&#x27;t know if this makes a difference, but I use this with a Sonicare toothbrush. The combination works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toothpaste, it&#x27;s fairly standard good toothpaste.  It tastes good, the mint isn&#x27;t overpowering and I like the flip top tube design. This has been my toothpaste for a while and will continue to be.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because I am a coffee drinker. Since I drink so much coffee, my teeth had been getting yellower and yellower. As an alternative to paying hundreds of dollars for a whitening procedure, I figured I might as well try this toothpaste. I have been using for less than a week and I already see an improvement in the color of my teeth. They are getting whiter and look much better. I am very happy with the results and I hope that it works just as well for everyone else!</li>
    <li> I just used this toothpaste today and I love it! My teeth were whiter within just one use, I already felt more confident of them. However, I am underage so therefor I don&#x27;t use any drug stuff, and I have only drank coffee a few times in my life, soda I rarely drink. Though naturally, my teeth have gotten a little  discolored, and to keep them at a healthier more attractive shade I bought this. I cannot wait to by the matching mouthwash, and maybe if I am not satisfied with my shade in 2 weeks I will get the strips. I know I will have happy results within the two weeks!</li>
    <li> Facts about me first:  I don&#x27;t go to the dentist regularly, last cleaning I had was in 2007 so 4 years ago.  I love to drink coffee and eat sweets.  I brush my teeth and tongue 3 times a day using C_l_a_e total in conjunction with Oral B vitality and Listerine (green).  My Morning breath stinks, sensitivity on the top right molars and sometimes it hurts.  After using this for 2 days and 2 nights:  First thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that food tasted great, My morning breath doesn&#x27;t stink anymore and best thing is that my toothache is gone. My teeth feels smooth and clean, also when I drink cold water it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much anymore and hopefully it gets better over time. My teeth also look whiter than it normally does. Didn&#x27;t took pictures but I never lie in my reviews. I only review products that makes me a happy camper or a very very angry camper. This product may work or not work for you because everyone takes care of their teeth differently, that is why I stated the facts about me first.</li>
    <li> I honestly do not know what&#x27;s in Crest 2D White but, it can&#x27;t be safe. There&#x27;s been numerous sites with people complaining about what the toothpaste does to their mouth.  This toothpaste DOES get your teeth white. Superr white. but, if you&#x27;re like me, then you&#x27;re also going to get chemical burns in your mouth from the toothpaste.  My advice, don&#x27;t get this toothpaste if you have a sensitive mouth, but other than that, this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is my main toothpaste. It keeps the teeth white and is easy to use. I bought like 20 boxes which will last me years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste.  Tastes ok, not hard to use (again, it&#x27;s toothpaste).  Didn&#x27;t notice much of a whitening difference though.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste might actually have whitened my teeth just a little bit, but if so, it is not extremely noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as most tooth-pastes, which always leaves you feeling like you didn&#x27;t put enough on your brush no matter how much you really did put on, and the flavor has an unusual pineapple-mint flavor in my opinion.  I actually got used to all these aspects of the toothpaste, but I would only buy it again if it were on sale.</li>
    <li> After using Crest 3D White Vivid for an extended period of time, I noticed a visible difference in how white my teeth are. For the price, this is a solid product that is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> im not sure what the germ killing contents of this toothpaste is, but oh my god its WAY too strong, almost everyone who uses this has burning in the gums, cracked gums/lips redness/swelling and it leaves white film around you&#x27;re gums too. i use the white strips those are great, but do NOT buy this toothpaste, it has literally burned a small hole on the inside of my lip that has been burning and irritating me for at least 2-3 days now.</li>
    <li> In addition to removing some minor stains and increasing the surface whiteness of my teeth to where I noticed it, it&#x27;s a good toothpaste in general.  My teeth felt cleaner than usual, and my breath stayed fresher for longer.  I do use whitening toothpastes often, so it might very well have a larger effect on those who don&#x27;t.  Not really sure what else I can say here.  It does what it says it does, and is a good toothpaste on top of that.  Plus the price isn&#x27;t much different from normal toothpastes.  I&#x27;m hesitant to give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it for a very long time, but consider this review to be 4 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have yellow teeth to begin with, but I do drink tea and grape juice often, so I wanted to make my teeth whiter without paying 30$ for strips. This toothpaste seemed promising since it said it removes 80% of stains in just 14 days. Well, it has been 14 days and I must say my teeth are not 80% whiter, but they are noticeably whiter. I even got comments on how white my teeth are. So don&#x27;t expect movie star white, or whitening strip white, just a shade or two lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is pretty strong and the texture it a little different too. Kind of grainy. It is weird that it leaves my tooth brush bristles stiff sometimes. It makes me think I&#x27;m brushing with cement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll go with a different toothpaste next time. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it whitens enough for my liking, although it does leave my breath fresher for longer than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is foamy - it feels busy in my mouth. I really liked how much cleaner my teeth and mouth felt after using it. IMHO, Crest has hit it out of the park.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good toothpaste. I did notice my teeth getting a little whiter when I first started using it. Now, they are sort of static. I think this toothpaste would be good at maintaining whiteness, but nothing magical will happen if you use it by itself. That being said, it&#x27;s very fresh and pleasant-tasting. I probably won&#x27;t buy a different toothpaste for a while.</li>
    <li> Tried it once and we preferred this toothpaste over sensedyne and all others for that matter.</li>
    <li> After I began using this product, not only did I not see quick results, but I had to stop using it for it created rawness and bleeding on the inside of my cheeks and lips. Awful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good toothpaste, noticed just a bit of improvement in the tooth color after a month, but nothing too noticeable. Good product overall</li>
    <li> This toothpaste caused me horrible gum/mouth problems. It contains blue plastic crystals that get under your gums.  I have LUPUS and the crystals caused irritation and infection.  My problems started when I purchased this toothpaste and  it is finally clearing up in the week that I took measures to remove the plastic under my gums.  Read Google on this subject.  I am grateful that someone posted this information on Facebook.  I don not understand how companies can put plastic in our products for the benefit of design, it is supposed to makes the toothpaste look better.&lt;br /&gt;According to dailybuzzlive.com/archives/5311&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3-D White “Vivid” toothpaste or Crest Complete Extreme Herbal Mint toothpaste, which contains hydrated silica, a sand like substance that serves as an abrasive to exfoliate the teeth of food and other particles, and polyethylene, which according to Crest is “a safe, inactive ingredient used to provide color” that gives a product the appearance of containing small beads or flex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not safe especially for Lupus patients!</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for just over a week and have started experiencing pain in my gums and a swollen bump on the tip of my tongue. I tried rinsing with a hydrogen peroxide/water mix and it helped a bit, but the bump is still here after 3 days. I was about to do an internet search for possible causes when I realized that this was the probable culprit.  My teeth look a little shinier but no whiter.  I&#x27;ll be throwing this toothpaste away.</li>
    <li> i tried this toothpaste and witin three days i was in extreme pain..i went to urgent care on a saturday  and by sunday my face was three times it size.  i went to my family doctor on monday for a shot and on steroid pills..i was told it was a reaction to the toothpaste itself  tues was a follow up with my dentist just to make sure he found 6 area also effeted.  i was in such extreme pain...never again !!!!</li>
    <li> I normally use Aquafresh but found a good deal on the 3D White toothpaste while I was shopping at Costco. I picked up a four pack and tried it out. Everything was good for the first week or two. My mouth felt fresh. I could not tell any difference in the whitening of my teeth compared to when I used Aquafresh. Somewhere between week 2-3 I developed a mouth ulcer, something I had not experienced in the past. I thought maybe I had eaten something that triggered it. I continued using Crest 3D while rinsing with warm salt water and baking soda once or twice a day. Even with the saltwater rinse the sore was not healing. So I Googled causes of mouth ulcers and read similar complaints from other Crest 3D users. The sodium lauryl sulfate they use appears to be the culprit. It&#x27;s a foaming agent that can harm your skin if you leave it on long enough. I stopped using Crest and continued using the saltwater rinse. Within a few days the sore started to disappear and was gone within a week. I now use Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, which does not contain any sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
    <li> My husband has terrible tobacco stains.  And after about 4 days of brushing with this product twice per day, they were visibly whiter.  Well not exactly white -- but the stains were lessened-- and I would assume that if he continues to use the product, he is well on his way to stain-free teeth.  He liked it because unlike products with peroxcide, didnot irritate his gums,etc.  Nor did the product make his teeth feels sensitive. Great product.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does work and whitening results are noticeable after 14 days, but it isn&#x27;t a night and day difference and seems very similar to other toothpaste with whiteners.    The package is well designed, but it is a very small amount of toothpaste at 4oz. They keep making product amounts smaller and everything may as well be travel size    There just is no wow factor or any major difference in whitening power and for real protection tartar control is a better additive.    Worth trying out one tube if teeth whitening is your main goal, but after 14 days this product has reached maximum effectiveness and continued use afterward does not appear to continue whitening.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste certainly cleans teeth, has a pleasant, almost bubblegum flavor compared to other mint toothpastes, and is a pleasure to use. The problem is that it is supposed to whiten after 14 days or so, and I can&#x27;t say I saw any whitening over that period of time. Granted, it didn&#x27;t turn my teeth yellow either, and with typical ADA approved ingredients designed to prevent tooth decay, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give this product a try. It might even whiten *your* teeth even though it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I love the flip-top design, which helps prevent mess and waste, but with less product in this smaller tube, you don&#x27;t get as much for your money. I would probably purchase it again as an everyday toothpaste, but for whitening I will probably look elsewhere for more dramatic results. Three solid stars for being a good, everyday toothpaste that fights tooth decay and leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker; the front of my teeth are naturally average white.  I was looking at my teeth using a dental type mirror.  The back side of my front teeth were very stained, probably from the smoking, or coffee and tea consumption.  I&#x27;m about 1/2 way done with the first tube; I brush twice a day for at least two minutes (I check the clock).  The stains on the back of my teeth are almost totally gone.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s taken off more than 80%.  My goal is to have them gone by my next dentist appointment in November.  The front of my teeth look much nicer, too.  If you want to check progress, check the back side of your teeth and judge from there.  The toothpaste works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the top of the line Crest 3-D whitening strips, have been using this tooth paste and the Crest 3-D whitening mouth wash for months and I see very little difference. I&#x27;ve not taken advantage of the 100% guarantee so I don&#x27;t know how good that is.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness....not only did this product not work for me, I have seen no improvement after two months of 2-3 times a day use...I have now found out those little blue beads in the toothpaste are plastic beads! Those beads can get caught between your teeth and gums. I had to see the dentist for an emergency tooth ache about a month ago. Now I wonder if there is a correlation....I will never but this or any other toothpaste with polyethylene again.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of 3D White. It claims to remove up to 80% of surface stains in 14 days.  The active ingredient is Sodium fluoride 0.243%. It claims to whiten by removal of surface stains, fight cavities, remove plaque and refresh mouth.     Normally I use [[ASIN:B001OOLLV8 Crest Pro Health Paste Enamel Shield, Fresh Mint, 7.8-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]. The Pro-Health claims to help with cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, whitening, and freshens breath. The active ingredient is Stannous fluoride 0.454% (0.16% w/v fluoride ion).    I do not notice a great whitening effect, however I am a coffee drinker and I don&#x27;t think that helps. I noticed a few little whiter spots. I like to have the \\&quot;enamel shield\\&quot; so in practice what I have been doing is using that one in the morning and the 3D White in the evening. I will buy both products again.</li>
    <li> This caused the inside of my mouth to peel as well as jaw pain and ulcers.  I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this product about 8 times now, 4 days in all. I have already noticed change in my teeth. However, I do brush a little differently. I start out with a quick brush of using standard Crest toothpaste just to get all the basic crap out of my mouth. Then use brush heavy duty with the 3d white. Cant wait to see the final results. Results will surely come faster if you brush regularly then a 2nd brush with the 3d white. (so technically brushing 4 times a day) 2 morning 2 night    My teeth are whiter though. Almost at my goal point and its only been 4 days!!!</li>
    <li> I got a sample size of this toothpaste when I bought a different kind in a regular sized tube.  I used it 3 or 4 times and developed an acute onset of severe pain to my front teeth (upper and lower).  The pain was so bad in 20 minutes, I was crying like a baby.  I took pain killers to ease the pain- it took a lot just to be able to tolerate it.  I was able to go to work that night but the next morning for some reason, the pain came back full force again.  I called my dentist and immediately went in.  X-rays were done and a full check-up.  Nothing was found to be wrong, but I mentioned the toothpaste and he told me that was probably the problem.  I received a prescription for Motrin (an anti-inflammatory) for the pain and amoxicillin just in case an infection was brewing.  It&#x27;s been 24 hours and I still and pain and throbbing and need to take the Motrin around the clock to have relief.  My advice- beware of whitening products!!!  I have used whitening toothpastes in the past for sensitive teeth with some sensitivity, but never pain or throbbing like I have experienced with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Used this a couple of times daily, notice whitening, none of problems others mention. But about halfway through, tube got very hard to squeeze. Today I decided to take off the cap (hard to do) and it was filled with the gel stuff, which had not been coming out in the right proportion on recent use. I&#x27;m guessing you need fairly even mix of the paste and gel, and clearly I wasn&#x27;t getting that through the goopy opening.  Carol</li>
    <li> I bought the toothpaste, used it everyday, and was so happy! It worked, my teeth were whiter! BUT PAINFUL.  When I went to my dentist he explained that the paste really works well at removing stains and whitening teeth, but it is so abrasive that it damages your teeth and causes sensitivity!!  His advise was to use it only on weekends, but with an extra strong sensitivity toothpaste during the week, to counter balance the effects!  Now, I hardly ever use it, as I don&#x27;t like painful teeth.  Shame really, as I like the whitening effect, but it&#x27;s not worth it for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent value with Amazon price and very stylish and confortable</li>
    <li> On time, as promised, good toothpaste, not much else to add.</li>
    <li> no change whatsoever. this feels like a fake product</li>
    <li> I have seen the commercials for this toothpaste for a while but I never gave it a second thought because I have never used a whitening toothpaste that made any sort of difference on my teeth. But at the end of this semester of college, my roommate moved out and left a huge tube behind. When I ran out of my regular sensodyne pronamel, I figured \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; and went for the crest.    I was ASTOUNDED a few days later when I realized how much it was brightening my teeth. It won&#x27;t make your teeth as white as the bleaching strips (which I periodically use) but it works wonders on day to day surface stains. I&#x27;m a big tea and coffee drinker, so my teeth are always a little dingy - until I started using this stuff. Now my teeth are a good shade or two lighter, and new stains come right off.    I definitely recommend this toothpaste to everyone, especially coffee drinkers who get those surface stains easily. And it&#x27;s even great for sensitive teeth. I have a lot of sensitivity in some areas (hence why I normally used sensodyne) but the crest toothpaste seems to help counteract sensitivity as well. I know some people have problems with the little blue dots, but I&#x27;ve never had any difficulties with them. Again, this stuff is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I both loved this toothpaste &amp; began using it exclusively.  We both have great teeth w/ no problems, but she began having tooth pain several months ago. Xrays showed no problem, so our dentist suggested switching to Sensodyne... problem resolved almost immediately.  We were recently on vacation out of the country and for packing simplicity, she began using 3D again.  With no warning, she began having \\&quot;worse than childbirth\\&quot; tooth pain, seemingly in the root of a healthy molar.  We almost cut our trip short to get home, assuming an emergency root canal was necessary.  As a final attempt to save our trip, she bought Sensodyne and Oragel.  The pain subsided almost immediately - Oragel was only used for a day, the Sensodyne took care of the rest of the pain.  Now two weeks later she is still pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use 3D.  My wife does not.</li>
    <li> Immediately upon using this toothpaste the act of brusing pushed the blue crystals under my gums.  I am trying to massage them out - flossing only pushes them higher.  If I can&#x27;t get them out on my own - will try a toothpick next - will have to go to the dentist and see if he can get them out.  I threw out an almost new container out today.</li>
    <li> I used twice a day for 14 days and was very dissapointed that my teeth did not get any whiter. I&#x27;d rate my teeth a 6.5/10 on a white scale and did not notice any difference. This product is no breakthru in whitening unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Good for whitening and health of teeth.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to sparkling white teeth soon !!  I can see an improvement in the short time I have been using this product</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have good dental hygiene. I use a Sonic-Care toothbrush, I brush and floss after every meal, and haven&#x27;t had any cavities (aside from a small one from childhood)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this toothpaste at a family member&#x27;s house one night on a trip and it left my teeth squeaky clean and I was convinced it was a great product, I saw it on sale so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a week I have gotten the worst mouth pain and irritation from it.  The roof of my mouth, my tongue, and the inside of my lips were very painfu and physically irritated.  I could actually see the irritation in the mirror, with my tongue I could feel patchy rough spots on the inside of my mouth.  It was so bad I had  called my dentist to schedule an appointment to figure out what was wrong!  After several day of trying to figure out what was causing this pain I realized it must be the toothpaste.  I switched back to my regular (non crest) toothpaste and my mouth irritation improved... COMPLETELY within 48 hours. I have since cancelled my appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no warnings on the packaging about this possible side effect from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy the product on amazon, but I wanted to post my review because it took me a couple of days to realize it was the toothpaste causing my mouth irritation which was VERY painful.  After reading other reviews obviously not everyone experiences this, but it is very painful. Anyone who tries this product should be aware of this in case the go through the same VERY unpleasant experience .</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great. I noticed results after using only a few times. It makes your teeth feel good and look good too. I can&#x27;t complain. One of my favorite whitening systems I have used and believe me, I have used a lot.</li>
    <li> One day I noticed a strange dark spot on my gums above both of my two front teeth. This was fairly sudden, and it was noticeable. After my husband pointed it out to me a few days later I decided to inspect further. When gently picking underneath my gums with a toothpick, I found SEVERAL of these little blue crystals lodged far up into my gums. Not only was this rather disturbing (and gross), but I&#x27;m sure that over time this would absolutely become harmful to my teeth or gums. I have used this toothpaste for over a year now, but needless to say, after my discovery I immediately discontinued using it.</li>
    <li> I wondered why this item was priced so much less per ounce than the same product in larger sizes.  And, it was only available in a pack of six.  This seemed strange, and now I know why.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I found that it had been hand wrapped in a pack of six, and the boxes were the old style.  When I checked the expiration date I found that it was only about 18 months away.  I could not possibly use this much tooth paste before the expiration date.  Back to amazon it went.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste!  The only type I use!  My teeth look great and my breath smells good too!  Great price for 6 tubes!</li>
    <li> i looove this toothpaste. my breath stays fresh much longer and my teeth actually appeared whiter. i live in barbados and i made my aunt send some for me. i love this product that much</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> I started using this a few months ago when i stayed with my girlfriend for a few days , this was the kind of toothpaste she had and i fell in love with it ever since. Its works for me , makes my teeth feel clean and makes my teeth white as well and ill continue to use it . I highly reccomend it :)))</li>
    <li> I began using this toothpaste because it came &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; with the purchase of some other Crest products which I was buying anyway. So I&#x27;m brushing day in and out, not noticing any significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Frankly, I wasn&#x27;t really looking since I was just using 3D to not waste it. Then, BAM! All of a sudden, my teeth were absolutely white. Granted, it took me longer than 2 weeks to see the effect (1month estimate). but i am really happy with these unintentional results. Moderate tea and soda drinker, red wine occasionally if it matters. This is my toothpaste from now on.</li>
