### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best sunscreens I have used.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I tried it and it works great.  </li>
      <li>2015&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not much good to me.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this stuff!</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many products over the years.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I ended up with a sunburn and many sunspots on my arms.  </li>
      <li>Mattifying effect on my super oily skin, love it!</li>
      <li>Last week I went on a strenuous 5 mile kayak trip through the Keys on a very bright and windy day.</li>
      <li>sunscreen isn&#x27;t cheap, but it sure beats the misery of a summer Florida sunburn.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly residue on your face or body.</li>
      <li>It is light, moisturizing and it stays on so the sun is continually blocked.</li>
      <li>but I am fair skinned and sun sensitive.</li>
      <li>Lots of spray, hanging legs over the side to cool off, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s June in Florida, so sun is hot and strong this time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky once it has been applied like many others I have tried, so this is my current favorite.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s never had a sunburn before with our normal sunscreen, but I thought since we were going to be in the water, that this would be better.</li>
      <li>I do think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Always like neutropenia sunscreen as it feels like it works and not crazy oily or smelly.</li>
      <li>hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how great it felt after applying, perfectly dry, no greasy feeling at all!</li>
      <li>I live in South Florida, so sun protection is important.</li>
      <li>smart move!</li>
      <li>I love the product and use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>Doubly so for me, as I love the outdoors</li>
      <li>This new wet skin one is great as I live in the south and sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It has a bit more scent to it than non wet skin</li>
      <li>Great product, thin and light exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
      <li>I live in FL so wear it every day!</li>
      <li>, I decided to put this stuff to the test but didn&#x27;t have high</li>
      <li>day originally started out cloudy and rainy, but I threw my sunscreen in the dry bag anyway-</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it right after getting out of the pool, but I don&#x27;t have to make sure my skin is completely dry like I do with other types.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had several unpleasant skin-cancer surgeries, so finding good products that work is VERY important to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s vaguely like the \\&quot;Fresh Linen\\&quot; scents that are so popular.</li>
      <li>His cheeks are swollen and red with his first sunburn.</li>
      <li>I have used this so far for running in the New Mexico sun on runs up to 1.5 hours.  </li>
      <li>Used this on my 2 year old a couple days ago on vacation in San Diego.</li>
      <li>Ditto for my legs and tops of my feet which were completely exposed to the sun in the kayak, and doused with water constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>especially the American Skin Cancer Association recommends using a full ounce of sunscreen for complete coverage if wearing a swim suit, and the bottle only comes with 3 ounces.</li>
      <li>This product most definitely did not protect me in the least.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I forgot to bring them to Hawaii and ended up buying Neutrogena, based on what I thought was a great reputation for their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really soaks in on wet skin</li>
      <li>I rarely burn and usually suntan quite well.  </li>
      <li>I  plan on making Wet Skin my new daily protective shield.</li>

<li> Must be the weird chemicals they put in for wet skin, but this stuff stings when it&#x27;s put on your face!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use</li>

    <li> Used this on my 2 year old a couple days ago on vacation in San Diego. We played by the pool for 2 hours, and I reapplied once. His cheeks are swollen and red with his first sunburn. He&#x27;s never had a sunburn before with our normal sunscreen, but I thought since we were going to be in the water, that this would be better. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the experience for the woman who said her child was sunburned, (that&#x27;s terrible)  but this product works for me. I live in South Florida, so sun protection is important. Doubly so for me, as I love the outdoors but I am fair skinned and sun sensitive. Last week I went on a strenuous 5 mile kayak trip through the Keys on a very bright and windy day. Lots of spray, hanging legs over the side to cool off, etc. It&#x27;s June in Florida, so sun is hot and strong this time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day originally started out cloudy and rainy, but I threw my sunscreen in the dry bag anyway- smart move! At the end of the day, I had two small spots where I \\&quot;missed\\&quot; applying the Neutrogena Wet Skin- and they were cherry red! Obviously, the lotion works, even on the back of my neck which never seems to keep from getting burned. Ditto for my legs and tops of my feet which were completely exposed to the sun in the kayak, and doused with water constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need two remember two rules for sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cover yourself with sunscreen BEFORE you get into the sun. Sitting on the beach for half an hour without protection before you apply is TOO LATE.&lt;br /&gt;2. Reapply often. If you remember to keep reapplying any sunscreen, it should work to the limits of its SPF. This one seems to work even after applying after swimming or sweating.&lt;br /&gt;Good sunscreen isn&#x27;t cheap, but it sure beats the misery of a summer Florida sunburn. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent too. It&#x27;s vaguely like the \\&quot;Fresh Linen\\&quot; scents that are so popular.</li>
    <li> Really soaks in on wet skin</li>
    <li> I have a team of people who work outdoors daily in the Phoenix sun, and this is the only stuff they will use.  We prefer the cream over the spray - the spray is too obnoxious; it feels like your going to choke from the fumes when you apply it.</li>
    <li> I love the product and use it regularly.  However, the 2 that I ordered and received in &amp;#34;June2015&amp;#34;  BOTH have expiration dates of &amp;#34;FEB 2015&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not much good to me.  Will have to find a different source.</li>
    <li> Great product, thin and light exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Always like neutropenia sunscreen as it feels like it works and not crazy oily or smelly. This new wet skin one is great as I live in the south and sweat a lot. It has a bit more scent to it than non wet skin helioplex neutropenia sun screen but nothing obnoxious.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens I have used.  Absorbs easily, not greasy.  My husband and I have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> Mattifying effect on my super oily skin, love it!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical on whether this would truely work when applying to wet skin.  I tried it and it works great.  I haven&#x27;t tried it right after getting out of the pool, but I don&#x27;t have to make sure my skin is completely dry like I do with other types.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was getting burned at the pool/beach/jogging no matter what sunscreen i used until i found this stuff.  if your serious about not getting burned and are doing something active or wet or you sweat a lot, this is the stuff to use, at least on the high burn probability areas (face, shoulders, etc...)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! Only wish I had discovered it before my family&#x27;s beach vacation this summer!&lt;br /&gt;As a pale white Irish girl who grew up being slathered in thick, greasy sunscreen that would make sand stick to me at the beach and me feel overall pretty miserable, as well as suffering with severe blistering sunburns year after year despite being vigilant with sunscreen when I used to work as a lifeguard, I decided to put this stuff to the test but didn&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how great it felt after applying, perfectly dry, no greasy feeling at all! I still wouldn&#x27;t trust it until it had been put to use though, I spent the next several hours at the pool, swimming, towel drying and laying out. No sunburn! It&#x27;s a little overpriced for such a small bottle, especially the American Skin Cancer Association recommends using a full ounce of sunscreen for complete coverage if wearing a swim suit, and the bottle only comes with 3 ounces. However, since in the pat I have avoided long beach days and prolonged trips to the pool simple because I hate the feeling of sunscreen, and venturing out without it is essentially suicide (long family history of skin cancer) I do think it is worth it. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Must be the weird chemicals they put in for wet skin, but this stuff stings when it&#x27;s put on your face! Put it on my poor kids face and felt terrible that it stung so badly. Won&#x27;t bother you as an adult, but definitely go for kid formula for the little ones!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has been improving/tweaking their sunscreen products for years, and it shows! This sunscreen goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly residue on your face or body. I am a daily swimmer who uses sunscreen all year round. I have tried many, many products over the years. I  plan on making Wet Skin my new daily protective shield. I&#x27;ve had several unpleasant skin-cancer surgeries, so finding good products that work is VERY important to me.</li>
    <li> I wear this sunscreen to go running out in the LA sun. It works well to keep me from being burnt, even though I&#x27;m sweating a ton.</li>
    <li> I have used several other waterproof sunscreens in the past, but forgot to bring them.  I have skied for hours with other brands and never even a hint of suntan or sunburn.  I rarely burn and usually suntan quite well.  Unfortunately, I forgot to bring them to Hawaii and ended up buying Neutrogena, based on what I thought was a great reputation for their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying several layers of Neutrogena Wet Skin all over my body I was in and out of the sun over a period of 2 hours (not continuous exposure).  I ended up with a sunburn and many sunspots on my arms.  This product most definitely did not protect me in the least.  I will never buy Neutrogena again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the products I have relied on for years of skiing:  Aloegator,  Bull Frog &amp; La Roche Posay Anthelios.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the least sticky of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I live in FL so wear it every day!</li>
    <li> I have used this so far for running in the New Mexico sun on runs up to 1.5 hours.  In spite of plenty of sweating, it doesn&#x27;t seem to wear off in this application.  It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky once it has been applied like many others I have tried, so this is my current favorite.  I haven&#x27;t tried it swimming yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I would definitely recommend this for active use!</li>
    <li> This sunblock is wonderful.  It is light, moisturizing and it stays on so the sun is continually blocked.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Protects even when in the water for a long time.  Does not stain clothing (we have well water and this is an issue with some sun products).  No stinging of eyes.</li>
