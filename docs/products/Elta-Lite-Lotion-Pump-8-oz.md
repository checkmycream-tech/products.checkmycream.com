<li> I ordered Elta lite (Eltatar smelled horrible)</li>
<li> Impossible to find in any retail store!!</li>

    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and I have been using it for many  years.  My 73 year old skin looks and feels younger.  Excellent product.</li>

    <li> This is a great, everyday use product.  Goes on nice, smooth, not heavy, and really helps moisturize my skin.  Now that it is winter, my face is telling me thanks for using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried every over the counter lotion from aquaphor to suave, NOTHING helped my dry, flakey &amp; cracking skin. A friend let me use her Eltatar ointment and instantly my hands were softer and even the pores looked smaller. I ordered Elta lite (Eltatar smelled horrible) and it works great too!! Will definitely be a long term customer &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been buying this lotion for over ten years.  It works great not greasy and absorbs quickly with no odor .</li>
    <li> This is the lotion given to me during radiation treatment for breast cancer and it is so easy to apply to delicate areas.  I am glad that I can buy it .</li>
    <li> Elta Lite was recommended to me by a nurse for gentle exfoliation of skin on my feet.  It works perfectly, especially in the winter.  I use it with a foot file for my &amp;#34;winter feet&amp;#34; dry skin.</li>
    <li> The best lotion you can use. Impossible to find in any retail store!!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but this lotion didn&#x27;t feel the same as what I licked up a sample of in my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Been using for 15 years.Use it on my face every night. Skin is very soft . I love this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Great daytime moisturizer. All you need is a small amount. Rub into skin then apply make-up. Much less expensive than other moistures &amp; works as well or better than the fancy designer brands sold in department stores. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a good day moisturizer. Even if you love the brand you currently use. Try this one. You will be happy you did &amp; will save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for your whole body and keep moist all day even on your face it works too</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light lotion without a perfumy odor.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when my husband was going through kidney dialysis because of diabetes which causes very dry skin, it was recommended by his doctor. He has since passed away but I can attest to how wonderful this product is. I myself use it, I use Elta Lite Lotion as my only face cream and my skin has benefited from it.&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy and just makes your skin feel wonderful. You only need to use a little so don&#x27;t be put off by the price it lasts a long time. The other one they sell which is only for the body is great too but it is not for the face. It comes in a red jar. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. I&#x27;m using it for tears.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping from seller.  I use this smaller pump in my car, and I have a larger bottle in my bathroom at home.  It&#x27;s just right</li>
    <li> When your skin feels like an alligator, Elta always does the trick. It doesn&#x27;t have an icky smell, either. I wish more places carried it.</li>
    <li> Best kept secret. Does an awesome job moisterizing. Pump is great as I don&#x27;t like putting my fingers in the lotion, possibly contaminating the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for quite a while and have also used the Elta Lite in a tube.  Both work well for me.</li>
    <li> i was recently involved in an arc flash accident and this is the same lotion they use in the hospital.  i burned my right hand and forearm and had to get some skin grafting on it.  this lotion is kinda oily but it really soaks in and works like a charm.  all good.  this is TRUE lotion that soaks in nice.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for dermatitis, it was recomend for my medical. I am happy with result, is the better for my skin</li>
    <li> Bought this due to areas of the skin no longer being able to produce oil resulting from cancer treatment.  The deep down itching was relieved when nothing else seemed to work.  Bought this for a sister who had some burn issues from radiation treatment, and it was also good for her.  This is great for super sensitive skin and a little goes a long way.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It softens your skin with being greasy.  I keep iton my bedside table to use before going to bed, and use it under my makeup in the morning.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion for night use.  It is a bit greasy for day time use but a good hydration lotion for over night use.</li>
