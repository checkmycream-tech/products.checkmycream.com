      <li>I love the way it smells, it leaves your hair soft abd manageable.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any significant results.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is color treated this Kanechom product balanced and put the right amount of moisture in my hair.</li>
      <li>I agree 100% with the first reviewer.</li>
      <li>and I am just used to it, or if the smell dissipates...but smells ok to me when dry.</li>
      <li>I rinsed it out very well because i knew that i had applied way to much in the beginning.  </li>
      <li>So i will continue to use this and do really like it.</li>
      <li>I really really like this conditioner</li>
      <li>If you have dry-damaged rough thick breaking hair, Kanechom Acai is perfect for you.</li>
      <li>Ilove how moisturized and soft my hair feels right away</li>
      <li>My hair came out super soft, and I am natural going on 2 years.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still a decent conditioner</li>
      <li>the only reason I took one star off is because the results as muuuch better when it&#x27;s mixed with silicon mix.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft, moistured and shiny!!</li>
      <li>Since all of my DC&#x27;s are pretty much full and the 3 Kanechom products I have (acai, chocolate, Karite butter) are so large I really have enough DC products for a few years, so I really have no excuse to buy anything else</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>Just for full disclosure I listed below the other products I used on my wash day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have 4a natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I could possible see myself not repurchasing the other three as often since I get the same results with the Acai at better bang for my buck.  </li>
      <li>But as i was blow drying i could tell my hair was very silky and soft, except for this course section in the back of my head that never seems to reap the benefits of any deep conditioner as well as the rest of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair dried out quickly with this product</li>
      <li>With that being said, since the later 3 are more expensive considering how much product I get</li>
      <li>I was looking for a conditioner that would leave my hair softer than soft and i found it THANKS to the other two reviews posted prior to me.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of purchasing this product b/c as a recovering product junkie, I had been burned too many times by the faux testimonials from youtube and natural hair blogs.</li>
      <li>I have natural African American Hair with a 4B curl pattern and my hair is highlighted blonde and brown.</li>
      <li>So, for all my other high maintenance kinks and curls out there, this product is the business.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if it still smells weird in my hair</li>
<li> but I was not impressed with this conditioner.  </li>
<li> I hated to see my money go to waste</li>
<li> Its very expensive.</li>
<li> Its very difficult to find a concentrated amount of acai in any conditioner or treatment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells amazing, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  I have been using Kanechom productsfor a year now and it is the only conditioner besides Wen that I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> Listen up!!! This product is magical. KANECHOM ACAI is the best hair moisturizer on the market. Its very difficult to find a concentrated amount of acai in any conditioner or treatment. Its very expensive. Kanechom is one of the best brazilian hair care line in the  world today. Ilove how moisturized and soft my hair feels right away once i  massage it in my  hair and scalp. It smells beyond great. Its all natural and made my hair look its best. If you have dry-damaged rough thick breaking hair, Kanechom Acai is perfect for you.If you are looking for a great moisturizer for damaged hair here it is. allow it to stay in your hair for atleast 45 minutes with a plastic cap. you can get under the dryer or steammer. Its incredible. The Kanechom line is a dream come true.</li>
    <li> Maybe I used it incorrectly but I was not impressed with this conditioner.  I ended up giving it away to a friend.  I have not idea how she liked it because she never said anything about it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell its yummy good consistency the first time I have ever used Dominican products and it did good hair was soft I did a deep condition and u don&#x27;t need alot</li>
    <li> Great moisture and amazing slip! Smells good too! I will be reordering soon. I will also be trying all the different varieties.</li>
    <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.  It provided no additional moisture unless I added to it.  So I did.  I added some oils and used it as a prepoo.  I hated to see my money go to waste and I definitely will not be buying this again.  I have 4a natural hair.  Perhaps it will work on someone else though *shrugs* never know.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time it. It works ok I was expecting miracle results and that didn&#x27;t happen. I really didn&#x27;t notice any significant results. But it&#x27;s still a decent conditioner</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for both natural and relaxed hair. I will def. refer and purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!</li>
    <li> This product smells absolutely wonderful and makes my hair extremely soft and defined my natural curls really well.  Very pleased with this product will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Its ok on its own, but I mixed this with Silicon conditioning mix, and it was better. My hair came out super soft, and I am natural going on 2 years.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, it leaves your hair soft abd manageable. The delivery was speedy, sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Also I mix the product with silicon a Dominican conditioner that smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells very good but did not work well with my hair texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of purchasing this product b/c as a recovering product junkie, I had been burned too many times by the faux testimonials from youtube and natural hair blogs. My doubt was kicked to the curb after one use. Not only did this product drastically reduce breakage and shedding, it also helped my chronically dry hair retain moisture. When I rinsed this out my dense, tight, corkscrew curls were POPPIN&#x27; and their thirst was quenched!  I will likely try the other products from this line b/c I was so impressed with the results of the Acai Mask. Honestly, you really don&#x27;t need to add the Silicon Mix to get the results. So, for all my other high maintenance kinks and curls out there, this product is the business. Just for full disclosure I listed below the other products I used on my wash day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo-Eulence Moisture Balance Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Condition-Kanechom Acai and Silicon Mix Bambu Nutrititve Treatment (Mixed together)&lt;br /&gt;Leave-In: Uniq One by Revlon&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer/sealant: Homemade oil blend of Grapeseed oil, castor oil, avocado oil, and olive oil</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes your hair feel great. It is one of the best conditioners ever.  Its good for both your natural hair and weave.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The deep conditioner made my hair feel softer. I have a mixture of kinky and curly hair and I use this product when I straighten my hair.  I gave it 3 stars due to the fact the conditioner did  dry my hair out when I tried to wear it curly and when I received the package it was damaged.</li>
    <li> I really really like this conditioner the only reason I took one star off is because the results as muuuch better when it&#x27;s mixed with silicon mix. You should give it a try its a miracle. I will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> Overall I did like this conditioner.  I liked the consistency and the smell.  I rinsed it out very well because i knew that i had applied way to much in the beginning.  After rinsing it out my hair felt great and since I&#x27;m only 9 days post relaxer i cant comment on it&#x27;s detangling benefits because I don&#x27;t have an issue with this soo soon post relaxer.  Since I never completely air dry my hair, only until about 50%, I can&#x27;t comment on air dried results.  But as i was blow drying i could tell my hair was very silky and soft, except for this course section in the back of my head that never seems to reap the benefits of any deep conditioner as well as the rest of my hair.  So i will continue to use this and do really like it. The only thing I will say is that it doesn&#x27;t give results any different than a few other DC products that I already use.  I get about the same results as when I use DB Pumpkin Seed, PM Super-charged Moisturizer, &amp; KeraPro Restorative treatment.  With that being said, since the later 3 are more expensive considering how much product I get I could possible see myself not repurchasing the other three as often since I get the same results with the Acai at better bang for my buck.  I say that now, but since I have to claim that I&#x27;m a PJ it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ll still buy them.  Since all of my DC&#x27;s are pretty much full and the 3 Kanechom products I have (acai, chocolate, Karite butter) are so large I really have enough DC products for a few years, so I really have no excuse to buy anything else lol</li>
    <li> Excelent product!!! It leaves your hair soft, moistured and shiny!! The item arrived before the time the seller promised.</li>
    <li> I uses this on my and my kids hair. Make your hair feel like silk! And it smells so good. Get it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a conditioner that would leave my hair softer than soft and i found it THANKS to the other two reviews posted prior to me.I TRULY  RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> My hair dried out quickly with this product but I think I am protein senstive, just don&#x27;t like how is says moisturizing but my hair is dry and brittle after deep conditioning with it.</li>
    <li> This Kanechom Deep Moisturizing Cream-Mascara Restauradora Condicionante Acai is totally incredible. I combined Kanechom with the Silicon Mix and it made my hair silky soft ,while at work I could not stop touching it. I have natural African American Hair with a 4B curl pattern and my hair is highlighted blonde and brown. Even though my hair is color treated this Kanechom product balanced and put the right amount of moisture in my hair. This product is great for anyone with thick or fine curly or kinky hair. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I agree 100% with the first reviewer. This product is awesome!!! My hair was breaking really badly :/. However after drying my hair after applying this to my hair and sitting under the dryer for 45 mins, I have little to no breakage. I highly recommend this product. I also have the kanechom chocolate mosturizing treatment and it is great also! This is an amazing line :)!</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried. Detangling is easy, the product smells great, and my hair is incredibly soft. I would write a long review, but there is no need. It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
    <li> Made my dry hair silkier. But it smells weird when being applied to hair. I don&#x27;t know if it still smells weird in my hair and I am just used to it, or if the smell dissipates...but smells ok to me when dry.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I going to try the rest of the line.  My hair felt strong and had a lot of movement.  I am truly happy about my hair for a change...Bravo!!!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of good things about this hair treatment, so my expectations were high.  To me, it was just okay.  I mixed it with the Silicon Mix as suggested but I don&#x27;t feel like it lives up to all the hype.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
