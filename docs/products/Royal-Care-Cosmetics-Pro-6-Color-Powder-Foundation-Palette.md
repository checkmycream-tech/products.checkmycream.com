      <li>I love it, I use it every day!!</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more to stock up!!</li>

      <li>So far so great!  </li>
      <li>I am a Licensed cosmetologist and professional makeup artist and I absolutely LOVE this palette!!!</li>
      <li>the size of each powder is pretty amazing too!</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>and i wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I would agree with another buyer that this contouring kit works better for evening and lower lighting.</li>
      <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve been trying to get a contour kit</li>
      <li>Very pigmented, stays on good and all day.</li>
      <li>I break out easy and this didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
      <li>HUGE PLUS 😄 will be reordering.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;and wears well with a nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>Product goes on smoothly and blends well.</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest this to first timers as well as professionals!  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>So I decided to try since the price was not bad at all</li>
      <li>Came quickly and intact.</li>
      <li>The dark color is pretty good, but the light does not go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I really do like it, but it did not blend as easily as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Occasionally the rose colored shaded for blush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pale and these work great for my skin.</li>
      <li>Any who, I&#x27;m in love with this, it last all day</li>
      <li>At first I accidentally caked way too much on</li>
      <li>Also very slim so it fits into my bag for clients on photo shoots really well!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s HIGHLY pigmented, which means that it&#x27;ll blend VERY WELL!</li>
      <li>great palette but came broken.</li>
      <li>Im giving it a 3 start because is not what i expected i was expecting something better since</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>First of all, the only reason Im leaving just 4 stars is because of the packaging it came into, I think the envelope should be more protective, I almost died when it came with a little part of the powder broken, besides that, the colors are very intense, perfect for MUA&#x27;s and normal people like me who like to play with makeup</li>
      <li>It works well, doesn&#x27;t flake everywhere, and the shades are decent.</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is good but the palette arrived broken</li>
      <li>I choose this set as it had multiple shades and the price was right.</li>
      <li>It made a huge mess, and I am even getting powder on my keyboard as I am typing this.</li>
      <li>Hard to keep covered as top is completely off</li>
      <li>However when using the browns or white for shading and contouring, you do need to blend it very well</li>

    <li> The pigmentation is good but the palette arrived broken and i wasn&#x27;t able to return it. I was really disappointed</li>
    <li> The dark color is pretty good, but the light does not go on smoothly. I&#x27;ve started using a cream highlighter. also the lid broke with no provocation. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Im giving it a 3 start because is not what i expected i was expecting something better since is PRO. But i do recommend it if your berly learning</li>
    <li> I saw this palette in a YouTube shading and contouring tutorial and decided to purchase it and give it a try. I really do like it, but it did not blend as easily as I had hoped. It took a little work to get it blended the way I wanted it. I would agree with another buyer that this contouring kit works better for evening and lower lighting. Although I did try it for daytime use too and it worked, but evening is when personally, I would use this palette. The pigmentation is great and it stays put. Hey, the price is great and the quality is very good. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First of all, the only reason Im leaving just 4 stars is because of the packaging it came into, I think the envelope should be more protective, I almost died when it came with a little part of the powder broken, besides that, the colors are very intense, perfect for MUA&#x27;s and normal people like me who like to play with makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to contour and highlight so I bought  this pallet to experiment with.  So far so great!  I&#x27;ve even used this pallet as nude eyeshadow and a brown smoky eye.  Great pigment stays on thru my 8 hour day</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, stays on good and all day. Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Got it broken. Returned!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m extremely pale and these work great for my skin.</li>
    <li> mine came to me BROKEN! i was so mad!!! but i do like that the color lasts all day and the size.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give this product one star. I got this item, and the second it came out of the envelope, the powder fell all over my desk, and the case came broken, and the powder is cracked and disgusting. It made a huge mess, and I am even getting powder on my keyboard as I am typing this. I have never gotten anything bad from Amazon.com, and this is the first time I have been so disappointed. This item is HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE! Came in perfect condition. It&#x27;s a great pallet on which to learn. The dark is a bit tough to blend, so I mix it with the next shade to make it easier to contour.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it every day!! Came quickly and intact. And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t break me out....HUGE PLUS 😄 will be reordering.</li>
    <li> i luv the price, the quality and color accuracy are all on point!! I plan on buying more to stock up!!</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been trying to get a contour kit but the one I wanted was sold out. So I decided to Amazon and I came to this contour kit and had great reviews. So I decided to try since the price was not bad at all didn&#x27;t care if I lost this amount. Any who, I&#x27;m in love with this, it last all day and it looks nature. Your pictures look like you have photo shop but its the contour.....Love this</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Perfect for powder contouring. Very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;and wears well with a nice matte finish. Very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> ...Great packaging! All powders were in tact! None were broken! Work awesome! I recommend if looking to buy this palette!</li>
    <li> I choose this set as it had multiple shades and the price was right. It works well, doesn&#x27;t flake everywhere, and the shades are decent. I really only use the white and two brown shade. Occasionally the rose colored shaded for blush. However when using the browns or white for shading and contouring, you do need to blend it very well and I would suggest that these not be used during the day. It would be best for lower lighting in the evenings or when going out at night.</li>
    <li> I broke out from this product.</li>
    <li> I am a Licensed cosmetologist and professional makeup artist and I absolutely LOVE this palette!!! It&#x27;s HIGHLY pigmented, which means that it&#x27;ll blend VERY WELL! The colors are versatile and with proper combinations you can match ANY complexion. I&#x27;ll be ordering from them again! Thanks for the fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nice palette for concealing and contouring.  It is very big in size and seems to have lots of product.  Product goes on smoothly and blends well.</li>
    <li> This make up has changed my make up application entirely!  I absolutely love it. At first I accidentally caked way too much on but once I figured out how to apply for my skin the results were amazing!  I strongly suggest this to first timers as well as professionals!  I am licensed and sometimes have to do make up applications. I will definitely use this pallet.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy great for,beginners who don&#x27;t wanna cake on all that thick crap. Also great for oily skin. I break out easy and this didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
    <li> love this palette for my clients! the size of each powder is pretty amazing too! Also very slim so it fits into my bag for clients on photo shoots really well!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Any dry skin will show horribly.</li>
    <li> great palette but came broken. Hard to keep covered as top is completely off but I still use daily!</li>
