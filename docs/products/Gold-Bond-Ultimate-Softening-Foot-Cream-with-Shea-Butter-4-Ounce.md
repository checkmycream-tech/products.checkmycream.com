<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves skin more silky smooth than Bath and Body Works spa products (which I used for years on my heels). Wish I had tried this sooner!</li>
    <li> I have problems with my feet and can&#x27;t wear inclosed shoes,so I wear sandals year round.My feet get so dry and this foot cream is great for my feet. It has a nice clean smell and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for more than a month now, I am still not getting the desire affect!</li>
    <li> Great foot lotion. Just wish it came in larger size.</li>
    <li> To quote another reviewer:&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried various other foot lotions/creams, and this one is by far the best.&amp;#34;  Couldn&#x27;t agree more.  My previous favorite was Eucerin foot cream, but this is a better product.  Does an outstanding job of softening and moisturizing the soles of the embarrassingly dry and scaly soles of my feet. Made for feet--the best body and hand creams in the world couldn&#x27;t fix my problem. I had complete success within one week of using.  I did help the process along initially by soaking my feet in an Epsom salt solution, and then using the Microplane &amp;#34;Colossal Pedicure Rasp&amp;#34; (available on Amazon) to remove some of the outer layer of dry skin.  But since then, my maintenance plan has been by using this foot cream only, and the cream, too, is Colossal, in my book. It&#x27;s possible the Microplane wasn&#x27;t necessary in the first place. Absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;smell&#x27; of this...don&#x27;t do any form of scent/perfume and this has a weird smell to it...glad I am putting it on my feet....not for me...don&#x27;t know how well it works yet...haven&#x27;t had it long enough...update later!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever.  Not greasy either.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best.</li>
    <li> Sure helps keep the tootsies soft and it&#x27;s not overly expensive.</li>
    <li> Great scent and it works instantly to soften feet.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Using product on feet for 1 year daily for dryness , no signs of improvement ,time to move on to another manufacturer  .</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I get it all the time. It&#x27;s pretty creamy and takes a few minutes to absorb/dry. Try not to step on any floors immediately after.</li>
    <li> Makes my feet feel very soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> We keep this handy, especially for sandal season</li>
    <li> I believe this lotion is better than O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s foot cream. I found that it made my feet extremely soft, cleared away the dry skin and best of all no oily residue. I apply the cream to my feet after a shower and I have all day softness.</li>
    <li> This is a great creamy lotion for dry feet. Not sticky and absorbs quickly, nice fragrance too. Perfect for winter dry feet, or in the spring when the sandals come out.</li>
    <li> This has been good for my feet, which have calluses and irritation on and between toes.</li>
    <li> Love this rich and luxurious texture and how quickly it absorbs. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really great! Mild scent that isn&#x27;t bothersome and my feet have never looked better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found to keep my feet soft between pedicures. It absorbs well, has a mild scent and is a great moisturizer. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This was an add-on item at my local grocery and I can attest I am now a convert! I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t suffer from cracked feet or unusually dry feet but I did notice that my feet are remarkably softer and smoother. My husband even noticed without prompt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency wise it&#x27;s thick due to the Shea, but it is surprisingly not greasy either. Smell wise it&#x27;s light but not too feminine either. Would definitely recommend you buy this.</li>
    <li> as  faiar  as i can tell  it  is</li>
    <li> Had heel cracks for years. Nothing else worked.  This is a miracle worker.  Slept in cellophane wrap and socks with ointments/cremes/oils and nothing repaired the cracks in my heals.  This product WORKS!!  Won&#x27;t be caught without it.!</li>
    <li> This lotion is thicker than most, thus feels as if it is softening your feet with its use.  However, I can&#x27;t justify the cost because I have used less expensive lotions that did just as well as this one for less.  I guess I don&#x27;t care for their claim that it softens feet that are dried out from the effects caused by Diabetes.  I&#x27;m not sure they can make that claim in this instance.  In other words, it&#x27;s not any better than an ordinary lotion.  Also, I prefer a scent but I guess I&#x27;m in the minority on that one since I notice quite a few lotions advertise specifically that they are unscented.</li>
    <li> Use it every two nights :) my feet are so smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the first foot cream I&#x27;ve used that does exactly as it advertises.  It absorbs easily and will leave your feet soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It feel great and helps my dry feet.  Nice smell too. It soaks into your feet better than other creams.</li>
    <li> its good....but it could not penetrate the hardness of the back side edges of my feet....i have feet like a giraffe....soaking in hot epsom salt  water is the only thing that softens them........but i can see how this would be a good lotion for people with normal or slightly dry feet.....i have hooves....</li>
    <li> This Gold Bond Softening Foot Cream provides excellent moisture and there is a noticeable improvement with continued usage.  My feet tend be dry year round, so I&#x27;m always looking for products to alleviate the problem.  The smell is pleasant and the cream is not too greasy.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate Softening Foot Cream is a great product that will moisturize and soften your feet, and help to address any irritation caused by dryness.  I have been very satisfied with the product overall in terms of helping to repair my feet from a long winter.  The cream itself is very moisturizing, but relatively easy to spread.  My one regret about the product is the amount of cream that you receive in each tube of cream -- I would have hoped that the item size were a little bit larger, but that is more a commentary on how good this foot cream is to use.  You won&#x27;t want to stop using it and will have to purchase more!  Overall, a great purchase that I will continue to use, especially during the winter.</li>
    <li> i have rough feet because i like walking bare feet a LOT and when i put sandals on they dont look as sexy because of the white marks and roughness. the product definitely works, i put it on and the softness lasted 3 days even after showering and still walking bare feet.....5 days later they are normal now but feel a lot more moisturized than before</li>
    <li> Works great!  I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this is one of my favorites.  I look for a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my foot feeling like I coated it in petroleum jelly.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It left my feet feeling greasy but did help with the dryness</li>
    <li> Like all Gold Bond products I have used, the softening foot cream with Shea Butter does a first rate job. I am not sure what Shea butter is, but it does work well.</li>
    <li> Leaves my feet moist for the time but hasn&#x27;t helped much restoring my feet..</li>
    <li> This foot cream is a great buy. Not only does it come with an attractive price tag, but it also works! It’s similar in texture to other Gold Bond moisturizers - thick, creamy and very smooth. It is easy to apply and absorbs into skin quickly without leaving any sticky residue behind - sock wearers rejoice! It also has a very light scent from the added Shea Butter, but it is not overpowering or perfume by any means. After applying the first time, there was an immediately noticeable difference in the way my skin looked and felt. A single application was enough to last for the entire day on my feet, which are moderately dry.  The Softening Foot Cream comes in a 4 ounce tube, which should last for a while. It has a convenient flip-top cap and is designed to stand upright, so you’ll never have to struggle to get the lotion out of the tube. The tube is small enough to travel with, but large enough to be easy to hold and easy to use. This moisturizer is a must-have beauty item for anyone!  Although I was given my first tube of cream for free to try and review, I have since purchased more because it really does work. My husband uses it on his hands after working in the yard, and the difference is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My feet were dry again after two hours I aplied it.</li>
    <li> Works great on hard spots of the feet. Softens them up</li>
    <li> Yes, Ghandi&#x27;s flip flops is not what I wa going for but I don&#x27;t have time to get pedi&#x27;s with a 4 yr old special needs child. I do this stuff myself at home, well I slacked a little..... This is great in am or pm or better BOTH!!! Keeps feet soft if you want to have hubby rub them &amp; not get smart comments back lol. Definitely try!</li>
    <li> LOVE  this stuff! Feels great on your feet before and after a long day. Scent is not too strong, even for men. Spa quality cream.Golden Bond products never disappoint me!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, I live in the west where it is very dry and my feet are especially dry. I just put a generous amount on them at night a few times a week and my feet look amazing!</li>
    <li> always a pleasure to have soft feet.  Anything Goldbond can be trusted.</li>
    <li> OK, NOT AS IMPRESSED AS I WAS HOPING</li>
    <li> This foot cream is great.  Softens my feet very well.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry winter feet.</li>
    <li> This cream has really helped my dry cracked gross heels.  They are softer and smoother.  Using a pumice stone along with this has made my feet pretty again!</li>
    <li> For years the rough scaly, thickly calloused condition of my&lt;br /&gt;feet have been a source of embarrassment and pain to me. And recently&lt;br /&gt;the previously uninfected part of my toes began looking like crocodile hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a toe nail fungus infection that causes the nails to be thick&lt;br /&gt;and brittle for theV last 45 years. It leaves&lt;br /&gt;the skin surrounding the nail thick and rough. The skin and&lt;br /&gt;nails were so rough and hard between trips to&lt;br /&gt;the podiatrist that I occasionally tore holes in my sox&lt;br /&gt;putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes of applying the cream I felt softness&lt;br /&gt;and some relief and they looked more like the feet&lt;br /&gt;of an \\&quot;older\\&quot; but definitely healthy biped.&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1* to 10*, my physical comfort went from&lt;br /&gt;10* to a 3*.  That&#x27;s with 1* being pain&lt;br /&gt;free and 10 being \\&quot;my feet are killing me\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Two days passed after the first application and I couldn&#x27;t believe&lt;br /&gt;how soft and smooth the skin around my toes had become.&lt;br /&gt;I treat myself to a GoldBond foot massage every three or four days&lt;br /&gt;Now on a scale of 1* to 10* I am down to 0* on discomfort and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;My toe nails look and feel softer and so much healthier and are&lt;br /&gt;so much easier to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the makers of Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Foot Cream with Shea Butter...</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dry skin on my feet for ages and this is by far the best smelling, feeling and softening cream you can find.  I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I had dry cracked feet and this stuff took care of my splitting heels in just a few days.  I began using it on my hands too.  This winter in the northeast has been rough - dry and so cold. This stuff has really protected my skin.  I will definitely continue to buy it and use it!</li>
    <li> I am usually barefoot around the house and my feet are very dry, often flaky at the heels.  I have never used anything that works better than this at softening and smoothing the skin.  I also use it on my hands in the winter if they get dry and chapped, does a great job and is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Really excellent cream for your feet.  Softens and smooths them quickly.  Works even better when you put socks on over your moisturized feet just before bed.</li>
    <li> This product works well to soften my feet.  It seems to rub in well and not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This cream absorbed into my skin quickly as if my skin were a sponge that was soaking it up. It made my skin feel as soft as velvet... no, more like a rose petal. Not only does it have a great feel, but the scent is light and so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any of the perfume that I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say I was impressed. I expected a moisturizer of this quality to cost much more, but was pleasantly surprised at the affordability. I feel like I am really treating myself with spa-quality lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have cream for anyone suffering with chronic dry skin like myself. Gold Bond has a new life-long customer. I&#x27;m so glad that my friend told me about this one! I just wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> First time I used this was before going to sleep for the night, and was seriously surprised at the difference I could notice in the morning.  I have badly calloused feet from having to wear waterproof boots at work every day, 8 to 10 hours a day on cement floors. The softening cream worked better for me than the healing cream, both are good, but the softening cream actually made my feet look and feel normal again.  I highly recommend trying it, you have nothing to lose but the rough, calloused, sore feet that made me embarrassed to the point of never wearing any type of shoe that would show how bad my feet looked.</li>
    <li> I work at home and live in slippers and flip flops, my feet were so dry they hurt. I have been using this for a couple weeks twice a day and my feet feel so much better. I have ordered it to be delivered on our Subscribe and Save so I won&#x27;t run out. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Best dry skin remedy for feet. Tried everything and this really works. Going to try other gold bond products as well.</li>
    <li> It worked to heal my cracked heel overnight with the first use. Dry feet were new to me and this was the third product I have tried.</li>
    <li> This foot cream really works for dry feet.  I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works well enough, but on really cracked heels, just ok.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and really does what it advertises.  The lotion is thick and absorbs quickly, making it easy to put on socks immediately after applying.  It smells nice with the added Shea Butter, and you only have to apply occasionally.</li>
    <li> It was a good price and nice foot cream.</li>
    <li> I could not find my regular product at Target, the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Overnight Foot Cream for Her.  I love that stuff - it&#x27;s the only thing that improved my heels due to the vital ingredient, urea. I also liked the mild, peppermint scent.  I wear flip flops all summer long - don&#x27;t like to wear shoes or socks. I know it&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked this Gold Bond up as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nutty, perfumey scent due to the shea butter. I prefer the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s peppermint scent better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s for Her Overnight Cream performed much better and faster. Don&#x27;t worry if you are a guy, just get it and you&#x27;ll see results (plus you don&#x27;t have that fake-perfume scent to contend with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Bond is not much better than an average foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d order Dr. Scholl&#x27;s online if I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> This stuff must be magic or something.  My feet feel so much softer.  I&#x27;ve even started using it on my hands!</li>
    <li> Wife can&#x27;t live without this.  Two thumbs up. (I never used it but she always makes me order this when I buy something from Amazon)</li>
    <li> What i got is half empty!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. I could not find in stores. So glad I could find this on Amazon. This product will keep your feet soft.</li>
    <li> Yes, Finally something to soothe that savage beast that look like my feet...lol, Immediately after I put this on, my feet felt sooo much better. And that&#x27;s saying a lot for these old dawgs.......smells good too......</li>
    <li> Mein Mann ist Diabetiker und immer, wenn er diese Creme benutzt fühlen sich seine Fußsohlen wieder weich an und es entstehen auch keine Risse mehr in der Haut. Es ist wunderbar. Unsere Freundin aus Ohio hatte diese Creme vor 2 Jahren mitgebracht und sie hielt bis jetzt. In Deutschland gibt es diese Creme nicht.Schade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is diabetic and whenever he used this cream his feet feel soft again and there also no cracks occur more in the skin. It is wonderful. Our friend from Ohio brought these cream 2 years ago and she held until now. In Germany, there is not this cream.What a pity.</li>
    <li> Good foot cream. Take if from someone who has DRY feet and heels! I wear flip flops and sandals - A LOT. My feet get really dry. This is one of the only things I have tried that REALLY works. If I use it consistently for a few days, my feet are MUCH softer. It&#x27;s pretty miraculous actually. If I have been using it and skip a few days, my feet still feel really soft - but you do need to keep it up.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re better off just using Shea Butter. It&#x27;s one, simple ingredient. Works great, too and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a hundred other ingredients giving you cancer or something. I use \\&quot;Intensely Moisturizing Shea Butter\\&quot; by Nourish Organic. Or you can use an organic hemp cream. I once used it and it worked really well. And as for the Shea Butter, I not only use it for dry skin, but in my homemade deodorant as well. The less ingredients the better.</li>
    <li> The only cream that I&#x27;ve found that works on the tough, dry skin on my heals and big toe. I do have to use my PediEgg first to get most of the dry dead skin off.</li>
    <li> this is a good cream but I have not seen extremely noticeable results yet (have been using it for a month now)</li>
    <li> I use this every day, and I like the way it makes my heels softer.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, soft foot cream that I use every night.  Don&#x27;t have any specific foot dryness problems, but maybe that&#x27;s because I use this.</li>
    <li> I try to use as little of it as possible and make it last as long as possible.  Trying to save.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have already used half of tube in just 2 weeks. It has done wonders with my dry feet.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for your feet.  It works better than just plain old hand lotion and it has a slight odor.  I use it in the morning when I get up.  I sand down both feet, put the cream on, and then the socks and I&#x27;m good to go.  A few years back I bought a tube of Dr. Scholls cream which was even better then this but I don&#x27;t think it is manufactured anymore so I&#x27;ll use the Gold Bond.  I hope this product does not get discontinued.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to find how quickly this product healed a crack on the side of my foot. I had tried many other products which would soften but not heal. This product did both. I will make sure I have Gold Bond on hand permanently.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my foot</li>
    <li> This was a repeat order because I like it and will need it with the cooler dry weather coming up. It seems to penetrate well without being too greasy. It has a subtle clean smell and is nice and thick. I also find it useful on dry elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> If you want a miracle product that will turn your tough-callused feet into soft baby feet, this is not going to do the trick. Perhaps somewhat foolishly, I thought this would help my feet transform from hobbit feet into elf feet. That said, it is really great if you have issues with cracked heels, and if you use it in conjunction with some kind of abrading device, you will have significantly softer feet. I&#x27;m somewhat ashamed to say this, but rather than getting some little cheese grater or microplane device (yes, they make them for your feet), I took a different route. After a shower, I took my pocket knife (yes, a pocket knife) and put a small rubbish bin under my foot. Then I used the blade perpendicularly (that is, edge straight-on towards my calluses) and carefully scraped away a bunch of dead skin, which came off really easily when my feet were wet. I scraped away the skin that came away easily, then I stopped and applied some of this lotion. Again, my feet are not soft like baby skin, and they likely never will be -- but they aren&#x27;t so dry and scratchy that they damage my socks anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my two bits -- the lotion is only half of the equation here. You may also need to use some good old fashioned elbow grease in conjunction with it. It smells a lot nicer than the standard gold bond foot cream (less medicinal), and it seems to work a little better.</li>
    <li> Product is great but tube was barely 75% full. :(</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It helps my feet get soft. Use it every night.  Has a wonderful smell to it too.</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t realize the mail situation with everyone ordering online and delivery a bit behind.  This Gold Bond Foot Cream is a dream.  My feet feel like a baby&#x27;s.  The best.</li>
    <li> Not too slippery, dries quickly.  Works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lotion.  For your feet.  Don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> I used this product every night before bed for a week on my rough, dry heels.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  I think any lotion would do as much.</li>
    <li> I really liked this as well.</li>
    <li> Great foot cream! It came in time before my sandals arrived. Its good for dry feet and heels of the foot. I  wear flip flops and sandals alot during the summer. My feet get really dry during this time of year. This is one of the only things I have tried that  works.</li>
    <li> Really help my crack heel</li>
    <li> Working wonders on my dry, cracking heels! Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> This has really helped make by heels much softer. I not longer have to worry about my heals wearing out my stockings.</li>
    <li> Do so love my soft soft soles!</li>
    <li> My Mom bought this for me as a stocking stuffer, needless to say I fell in love with the cream.  I use it on my hands, arms, legs and feet.  It really sloughs off the dead skin cells and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and smooth.  Last year I bought it for all the women in my family and put it in their stockings.  Everyone loves the way if makes their skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever tried. It is not greasy at all, and absorbs super quickly. But, it actually cures the dry cracked skin on my heels and softens all the skin on my feet. I put it on before bed and wake up to super soft feet with smooth heels! It is a miracle. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it has a nice subtle scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering but just smells fresh. I would definitely recommend this above all other foot creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is awesome. I have very dry skin and this cream helps all my cracker and healing so well.</li>
    <li> Excellent !  Also very good on my hands !</li>
    <li> Great product for my cracked feet</li>
    <li> Great product. Works quick on rough skin.</li>
    <li> The product is smooth but thick so it lasts a while on your skin.  I usually wear socks and shoes after I put the cream on and that makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, there does seem to be a softening of the skin.  Works!</li>
    <li> I have tried other products and they did not work.  This actually does what it says it will do.  It is a nice thick lotion that heals and softens cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Thank you for quick shipping, love the products, great prices!</li>
    <li> This foot cream gets 5+ stars. It&#x27;s summer and that means sandals season! Nothing is worse than dry, cracked peeling feet exposed for the whole world to see in open toed shoes or sandals and Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate softening foot cream does what it claims! This cream softens the dry skin on feet and improves not only the feel but look of your tootsies... I even use it on my elbows and it works wonders on them, too! I have tried other foot creams that leave my feet greasy feeling and thus making my shoes slip and slide not to mention, I don&#x27;t particularly like the feeling of sweaty feet. Buy this cream and you won&#x27;t be disappointed as it moisturizes dry skin without leaving a greasy residue because it absorbs quickly and continues to hydrate for the entire day or night. If you use it before bed I recommend some fluffy socks to further enhance the softening but it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
    <li> Being diabetic, I have excessively dry skin.  I purchased this foot cream along with the body cream specifically designed for extra dry skin.  It works great, dries quickly, and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> No other footcream can compare- my feet are baby soft and silky smoothe. No smell and the cream is absorbed instantly without greasey residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other foot lotions/creams, and this one is by far the best. I tend to wear sandals whenever the weather permits, and my feet get pretty dry/rough. This stuff helps a lot! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good product, leaves our feet feeling great, and has also cut down on the amount of trouble that I have had with fungal infections.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the foot cream I would buy if I didn&#x27;t make my own now. It&#x27;s great. But expensive. So, I started making my own.</li>
    <li> This works very well and is inexpensive. I have very sensitive skins so I&#x27;m cautious about what I use but this actually works for me and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird odor smell the Shea butter is great! And leave my feet soft for hours.</li>
    <li> great product, love the way it makes my feet feel.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this once before and could not find it again when I ran out.  I have toxic neuropathy from chemotherapy and it has especially affected my feet - loss of natural moisture...  so this product helps to keep them from splitting from being overly dry.  It softens the callouses and helps the loss of feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin - and tell you to use it every night.  I especially like it because it is not greasy and soaks in well.</li>
    <li> I wear sandals all summer, so my feet get really cracked and rough. I have tried many creams, and this one works the best--and is quite reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different foot lotions and have found some that were amazing and some that were..blah. Well, this Gold Bond lotion is amazing. I received results overnight. I take good care of my feet but I&#x27;m a dancer and I love walking without shoes so my feet can get pretty dry and sometimes scaly (not really that bad but can&#x27;t think of a better word). Anyway, not too greasy..just perfect to be honest.</li>
    <li> nice product, easy to use.</li>
    <li> If your feet get dry in the winter, or any time of year, this is a great product. It&#x27;s not greasy, softens the skin on your feet, and has a pleasant, light scent. It is very effective. The container is a handy size and handy to use. I do a lot of walking on the treadmill, or should, and it&#x27;s great to have this around to soften my feet. I put it on several times during the day when the air is dry.</li>
    <li> Works well, non greasy. My go to for feet after trying several brands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so delighted with their hand cream that I was expecting to be wowed by this. Not really. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great. Softens calluses, I guess, but isn&#x27;t any better than a lot of other creams out there (unlike the hand cream, which is miles above everybody else).</li>
    <li> Great for softening dry skin.  Long lasting and soothing.</li>
    <li> Works only if you put socks on after applying and you have to leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> Works well for me. I saw great improvement in the skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> So smooth and creamy. Makes my feet feel great!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She has extremely dry skin on her feet.  She says this cream works better than others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> what a shock...found it somewhere locally and when I ran out, found it on Amazon.  am a diabetic with very dry feet, take lots of diuretics because of lymphedema...this has kept my feet  and cuticles soft and moist. would not go without it if I can help it.  Even my husbands hands are doing better with this, would recommend it to anyone...!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion!! It smells amazing! I use it at night and wear socks and the next day my feel are softer. The body lotion that matches this is amazing as well! I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have used this.  It seems to work very well. I like to have smooth feet &amp; this seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Great feel...makes for comfortable massage by partner</li>
    <li> This cream is GREAT. My skin is super sensitive and dry. It restored my skin within days. I&#x27;ve been buying it since. I have not found anything better than this.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry feet</li>
    <li> This foot cream works really well to soften dry, calloused feet. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I suggest putting a liberal amount on your feet and covering with socks for about an hour or overnight for best results.</li>
    <li> I do have very dry feet, and my best friend introduced me to this cream.  It works better than Amlactin for me, plus it has a lovely, light scent.</li>
    <li> This is smooth, non-greasy, healing cream for my dry cracked feet. I always keep it on hand, and at foot.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my rough feet and that is the reason why I bought it. However, I&#x27;m not completely sold on its scent. I wished Gold Bond could work on it. It does not smell like Shea Butter to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to use along with an Amope that I also bought on amazon. Honestly I just searched foot lotion and this price seemed reasonable enough to spend on a lotion that I might not like. It was very thick and definitely did its job of moisturizing my feet after using the Amope, but I didn&#x27;t care for the smell. It was very bland and I would have preferred a little bit of a smell. Nothing strong, but at least something. That&#x27;s just a personal preference, so if you don&#x27;t mind having not much of a scent to your lotions then this one is great for getting your feet nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Works great. If you put it on them socks and sleep like that it will improve your feet a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It really helps to soften the bottoms of the feet is used every night before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps feet nice and soft winter and summer.  Best foot cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, keeps your feet soft, reduces calluses, and has pleasant scent. Great!</li>
    <li> This works very well and is inexpensive. I&#x27;ve tried the Norwegian blend stuff for $300/bottle (I jest, but it is expensive!) and several other products like it. This product beats all of them handily and at a great price point.</li>
    <li> I used it the night I got it. It is very moisturizing and non greasy at the same time. Since the other products I bought from Gold Bond have all had positive effects, I believe this one will too.</li>
    <li> My heals were so cracked during our long, dry, cold winters that my socks were being ripped by my rough skin everyday! I have tried so many products with no real results. This year I decided to try one more, this Gold Bond softening cream, and it is amazing! I put it on my heals every night after my shower before I put my socks on, and within a few days the big rough spots were much better. After a month at least 3/4 of the cracks on my heals were gone completely! I still put it on every day and have a few cracks, but they are not painful or rough at all. I have been using this bottle for almost 2 months and it is almost gone, so there is a decent amount. So thankful I found this cream!</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream because it allows me to have pain free walking by softening my four problem hammer toes that grow a combination of callous and nail on their tips.  This is the most effective of the several brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> This cream really helped heal my cracked toe and heal. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this cream makes my feet feel very soft</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion for all dry skin, not only feet. I have dry skin on arms and legs, and this protects for days. After menopause I have very dry skin, so this cream is a lifesaver. WRINKLES AND TIGHTNESS ARE GONE!</li>
    <li> Works well. Softens foot just as product claims.  Very mild, pleasant fragrance.  Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it is not greasy. I have used it on my feet several times now and my hands and it works well. Would recommend and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard walker in all weather, and my feet take a literal beating.  Although I&#x27;ve used daily lotions on them, the only thing that has made a discernable difference in the winter is Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Foot Cream.  I use it immediately after bathing when the skin is still moist, and I apply it liberally. It also helps to apply it to night and wear silk or cotton socks to bed.  The cream has a very mild and unobtrusive scent, and it&#x27;s priced well to be able to use it as often as necessary to promote skin health.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to brand for my very dry skin. This is the first time I have used this particular product - I was pleased by how lasting it is.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and taking care of my feet is so important and this lotion is so awesome!</li>
    <li> Strong smell, leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Simply... WOW!  This stuff really works!  You can see results right away. My dry feet looked normal again!  I apply after showering and it&#x27;s been about a month now. My calluses have soften and are getting smaller and smaller.  Many rough spots from my sandals have already disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this on my feet and I do recommend this to others. It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have battled dry feet for many years &amp; I have recently discovered Gold Bond thanks to all the wonderful Amazon reviewers.  I am amazed at how soft my feet feel for the entire day after I use this.  I have so many &amp;#34;foot remedies&amp;#34; that have failed me, but I am raving about this!!</li>
    <li> This cream does wonders for my feet.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my feet. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this one works the best and surprisingly fast. Within a couple of days, using it at night i&#x27;ve already seen a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using another Gold Bond foot lotion that I thought was the best anybody could possibly make. I tried this when I was out of the other kind and like this better! It absorbs into the skin and makes it feel instantly softer, plus it doesn&#x27;t make me feel I need to wear socks to bed after applying it at bedtime. If you have very dry skin on your feet, you will like this product!</li>
    <li> Works well for really dry skin on the feet/heels. First product that I would buy again for the dry skin on my feet. Keeps them softer longer.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This really does work it softens feet almost immediately.</li>
    <li> this ready works on you heels</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this foot cream; it does what it is supposed to do and leaves my feet very soft.  I love it.</li>
</ol>
