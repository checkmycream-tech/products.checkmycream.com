### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>…I&#x27;d rather spend good money on makeup that lasts, like the MAC eyeliners!!</li>
      <li>Like some others here, I was very happy with this in the beginning.</li>
      <li>but this is the best.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent and stays all day!!</li>
      <li>It is the best.  </li>
      <li>Great for tightlining as well!</li>
      <li>Best eyeliner, worth the price...will buy again..</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>Love this one!</li>
      <li>(i.e. warm) with the lid always on</li>
      <li>great packaging quick shipping..</li>
      <li>When I first got this product 6 weeks ago I loved it!</li>
      <li>I Know They Can Do Better.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I say more, it can stand the test of time.</li>
      <li>Upon initial use, I loved this product!!</li>
      <li>, she used and i love it</li>
      <li>My favorite eyeliner ever.</li>
      <li>If you, like me, love a pencil look vs. liquid liner look, but fear smudges by 10am - then this is for you.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge all over my eye and to top it</li>
      <li>You want something that lasts months and months, go to the drug store and by maybelline :-)</li>
      <li>Even kept the top on after every use.</li>
      <li>If It Didn&#x27;t Dry Out, We&#x27;d Have The Perfect Pencil Liner.</li>
      <li>Lasts all day without significant smudging like most cheaper eyeliners.</li>
      <li>I gave it one star for how wonderful it was for 4 weeks, other than that the product rendered useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After about 4 weeks I noticed that it didn&#x27;t go on quite as easily</li>
      <li>and it still is as good as new.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through many many brands and willing to spend up to $30 on a pencil.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on smooth and easily but still runs in the corners.</li>
      <li>Never had eyeliner that went on this easily and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m noticing that it doesn&#x27;t go on so smoothly anymore.</li>
      <li>I use good old Vaseline, which I don&#x27;t mind as it conditions my lashes and adds moisture to the eye area.</li>
      <li>I always make sure I have this and will not purchase any other kind now!</li>
      <li>- it went on really smoothly, was quite soft, comes with a built in sharpener and most importantly, it stays on with no smudging.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If your eyes lids get oily through the day a quick wipe will fix it and you will still have product on.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with it and definitely won&#x27;t be changing brands for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>but, hey, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Even on day one of use, it didn&#x27;t go on right for me.</li>
      <li>I have learned that the best, do not smudge, stay all day (ALL day), are wicked black, and last longer then the cheapies.</li>
      <li>It is soft and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Just like the previous reviewer, I LOVED this eyeliner when I first bought it.</li>
      <li>I love how dark and smooth the eyeliner is.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner&#x27;s very similar but higher quality, and has  self-sharpening tip that you spin to push more pencil out.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely Loved It Before It Dried Out.</li>
      <li>Sure, it runs out fairly quick, about two months, maybe less</li>
      <li>It is also the perfect shade of black, very dark which I like.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Still purchased another because it just goes on so fast.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>Should Not Cost As Much As It Did.</li>
      <li>Sharpening it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>At first I was in love and thought I found the eyeliner of my dreams, haha, but about a couple months later, I noticed that the pencil tip got too dry for the liner to apply correctly, and then when I did get it on, it would start flaking off right away.</li>
      <li>My only regret is that the brown is coppery vs. a rich coffee brown</li>
      <li>but I make sure to keep the cap on really tight any time i&#x27;m not using it.  </li>
      <li>Worth the extra $$.</li>
      <li>, once the original point has been worn down from use, the sharpener most certainly does not make another sharp point for you - it kind of pares down the bluntness slightly</li>
      <li>last long and easy to use.</li>
      <li>But once I tried it again, it was hard to apply, tugging at my eyelids, and &#x27;skipping&amp;#34;, not making a solid line as it once had…not sure if it was because the product had hardened up or just got old really fast</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dare applying it anywhere near my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have very watery eyes and eyeliners never last!</li>
      <li>There is enough of the product to last for much longer.</li>

<li> Also, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes like other waterproofs do.  </li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
<li> I wear eyeliner every single day so it might not last me as long as the next person</li>
<li> Unfortunately, for the price of this liner, I expected much better.</li>
<li> : Took 3.5 months for it to dry out.</li>
<li> The pencil arrived dry and not usable.</li>
<li> Maybe its just the dry AZ air?</li>
<li> and I had to press harder for it to go on</li>
<li> A bit disappointed but still was able to get 80% out of it.</li>
<li> I have had mine for a couple months and it is not dry in the least.</li>
<li> You can make your eye dramatic by putting it on heavier or put it on lightly by not pressing down much.  </li>
<li> This cost way too much for it to be useless after 6 weeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with any other eyeliner</li>
<li> This black pencil does not budge.</li>
<li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve never left the cap off, never left it in my car overnight for it to get frozen and dried out.</li>
<li> This one is the only one that has ever stayed on at least 4-5 hours!</li>
<li> I need a waterproof, easy-glide eye pencil for everyday wear.</li>
<li> That was dried out as well.</li>
<li> I tested it and that was dried out as well.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I purchased this looking for an eyeliner to use on my waterline without it smudging in the corners after a few hours.</li>
<li> …whatever the reason, I&#x27;m not using mine anymore and feel like it&#x27;s a totally waste of money</li>
<li> it&#x27;s completely dried out.</li>
<li> I usually wear a type of Prestige drugstore eyeliner that has become increasingly difficult to find where I live.  </li>
<li> Prefect for waterline and tight lining, doesn&#x27;t run at all!</li>
<li> TOTAL disappointment.</li>
<li> If you have about an hour to spare, a ridiculous amount of patience, and plenty of makeup remover</li>
<li> Something is wrong with the texture so it leaves behind chunks on your eyelid.</li>
<li> I read these reviews before I ordered mine, and was afraid of it drying out -</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad that its not useable.</li>
<li> Horrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Like some others here, I was very happy with this in the beginning. - it went on really smoothly, was quite soft, comes with a built in sharpener and most importantly, it stays on with no smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3-4 weeks of using it I&#x27;m noticing that it doesn&#x27;t go on so smoothly anymore. I store it in my bedroom (i.e. warm) with the lid always on and it is just drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, once the original point has been worn down from use, the sharpener most certainly does not make another sharp point for you - it kind of pares down the bluntness slightly but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make a pointed tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing</li>
    <li> Love this! It stays on all day and does not smudge. Great for tightlining as well! I always make sure I have this and will not purchase any other kind now!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! I didn&#x27;t have any issues with mine drying out at all, and it stays on all day with no problem.  Also, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes like other waterproofs do.  I read these reviews before I ordered mine, and was afraid of it drying out - but I make sure to keep the cap on really tight any time i&#x27;m not using it.  I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and it still is as good as new.  When this one is gone, I will definitely get another one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Loved It Before It Dried Out. TOTAL disappointment. I Know They Can Do Better. Should Not Cost As Much As It Did. If It Didn&#x27;t Dry Out, We&#x27;d Have The Perfect Pencil Liner.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is soft and goes on easily. It is also the perfect shade of black, very dark which I like.</li>
    <li> Horrible! The pencil arrived dry and not usable. I wouldn&#x27;t dare applying it anywhere near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Just like the previous reviewer, I LOVED this eyeliner when I first bought it. I need a waterproof, easy-glide eye pencil for everyday wear. At first I was in love and thought I found the eyeliner of my dreams, haha, but about a couple months later, I noticed that the pencil tip got too dry for the liner to apply correctly, and then when I did get it on, it would start flaking off right away. Sharpening it didn&#x27;t help much. Unfortunately, for the price of this liner, I expected much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this looking for an eyeliner to use on my waterline without it smudging in the corners after a few hours. This eyeliner goes on smooth and easily but still runs in the corners. I like it for the ease of use but isn&#x27;t as long-wear as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is complaining about this eyeliner drying out.  I have used this for about two years.  It is the best.  You can make your eye dramatic by putting it on heavier or put it on lightly by not pressing down much.  Sure, it runs out fairly quick, about two months, maybe less but, hey, it&#x27;s worth it.  You want something that lasts months and months, go to the drug store and by maybelline :-)</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. Even on day one of use, it didn&#x27;t go on right for me. Something is wrong with the texture so it leaves behind chunks on your eyelid. If you have about an hour to spare, a ridiculous amount of patience, and plenty of makeup remover, you can make it work. I&#x27;ve never had trouble with any other eyeliner</li>
    <li> I love how dark and smooth the eyeliner is. It doesn&#x27;t smudge all over my eye and to top it it has a sharpner attached to it. My favorite eyeliner ever.</li>
    <li> Upon initial use, I loved this product!! But once I tried it again, it was hard to apply, tugging at my eyelids, and &#x27;skipping&amp;#34;, not making a solid line as it once had…not sure if it was because the product had hardened up or just got old really fast…whatever the reason, I&#x27;m not using mine anymore and feel like it&#x27;s a totally waste of money…I&#x27;d rather spend good money on makeup that lasts, like the MAC eyeliners!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and stays all day!! I buy it because i saw videos in youtube like missglamorazzi, she used and i love it</li>
    <li> Longest lasting eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! Prefect for waterline and tight lining, doesn&#x27;t run at all!</li>
    <li> When I first got this product 6 weeks ago I loved it! It went on effortlessly and stayed on the majority of the day. After about 4 weeks I noticed that it didn&#x27;t go on quite as easily and I had to press harder for it to go on and it didn&#x27;t last as long either. Now that I&#x27;ve had it for six weeks it&#x27;s completely dried out. It won&#x27;t make lines on my eyes at all! Needless to say I&#x27;ve never left the cap off, never left it in my car overnight for it to get frozen and dried out. This cost way too much for it to be useless after 6 weeks. There is enough of the product to last for much longer. It&#x27;s too bad that its not useable. I will never buy this product again! I gave it one star for how wonderful it was for 4 weeks, other than that the product rendered useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***As a side note I was recently in a cosmetics store and there was a sample out. I tested it and that was dried out as well. I tried to put a line on my hand with it and it didn&#x27;t even make a mark. That was dried out as well.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Never had eyeliner that went on this easily and smoothly. Lasts all day without significant smudging like most cheaper eyeliners. Have been using this product over two months now. Very satisfied with it and definitely won&#x27;t be changing brands for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Took 3.5 months for it to dry out. A bit disappointed but still was able to get 80% out of it. Even kept the top on after every use. Maybe its just the dry AZ air? Still purchased another because it just goes on so fast.</li>
    <li> last long and easy to use. you dont need a sharpener so thats a plus. its like using the gel eyeliner without having to use the brush to put it on.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been through many many brands and willing to spend up to $30 on a pencil. I have learned that the best, do not smudge, stay all day (ALL day), are wicked black, and last longer then the cheapies. I wear eyeliner every single day so it might not last me as long as the next person but this is the best. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a ton.</li>
    <li> I usually wear a type of Prestige drugstore eyeliner that has become increasingly difficult to find where I live.  This eyeliner&#x27;s very similar but higher quality, and has  self-sharpening tip that you spin to push more pencil out.  Worth the extra $$.</li>
    <li> This black pencil does not budge. If you, like me, love a pencil look vs. liquid liner look, but fear smudges by 10am - then this is for you. I have had mine for a couple months and it is not dry in the least. All this said, you have to work to get this off. I use good old Vaseline, which I don&#x27;t mind as it conditions my lashes and adds moisture to the eye area. My only regret is that the brown is coppery vs. a rich coffee brown or I would buy that too.</li>
    <li> It can make it through the work day, need I say more, it can stand the test of time. If your eyes lids get oily through the day a quick wipe will fix it and you will still have product on.</li>
    <li> I have very watery eyes and eyeliners never last! This one is the only one that has ever stayed on at least 4-5 hours! Love this one! It lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner, worth the price...will buy again..great packaging quick shipping..thanks</li>
