      <li>Great color.</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff !</li>
      <li>I did not get good results with this product.</li>
      <li>She charges $10 for a tube, so this is a good price.</li>
      <li>(I have brown hair with lots of gold-blond highlights), but it is a good color</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
      <li>Blends in nicely and washes out with soap and water.  </li>
      <li>Handy size and manageable to use.  </li>
      <li>works great for a quick touch up around face... along hair line before blow drying hair.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with an $8 touch up kit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting it on anything else and wash your hands thoroughly after.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>More like 30 seconds.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Much better than Mascara too, which leaves alot of residue.</li>
      <li>I can more easily blend</li>
      <li>What a great product for those stubborn white hairs!</li>
      <li>great substitue when your roots start going grey before color appt</li>
      <li>covers grey very nicely.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product for quick touch ups, although I must admit...</li>
      <li>I think this is a great little product.  </li>
      <li>gave it two stars b/c it did succeed in covering the gray, but the \\&quot;means to the end\\&quot; just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s temporary but that what I expected, have to apply fairly often.</li>
      <li>People who are complaining about it not drying or rubbing off might be putting too much on or putting it on top of some kind of other product that is causing that.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you peruse these reviews and ultimately make your own decision whether or not to purchase the item...but make sure you&#x27;re looking at the reviews from people that have actually purchased it.</li>
      <li>but it did not work as well for me, as it was dryer and with the dreamlock being more fluid</li>
      <li>Love this stuff because it takes away Grey without dying my hair.  </li>
      <li>It does the job, but is still a little hassle but worth give me and extra week before seeing my good friend the hairdresser.</li>
      <li>The applicator is very well designed so you have lots of control over how much you&#x27;re using.  </li>
      <li>but over all I really like the concept.</li>
      <li>It works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>Like mascarra you can get too much product on the brush, or get a hair wrapped up in it.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser recommended, as my hair grows really fast</li>
      <li>GIves definite grey coverage and coloring is great, and goes on nicely when hair is wet or dry.</li>
      <li>I mainly use around the front and sides of my hair.</li>
      <li>Came as expected, when expected, good quality, will continue to purchase from this seller</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, the color blended well with my natural hair color and there was no flaking or powdery look.</li>
      <li>--just looks like dark roots growing out and blends fine.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice the grey after I use Dreamlock and blend, and it can give me a good week at least before I have to get in to see the hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is meant to be a touch-up between salon or home coloring, so it should only go on parts or around the hairline where the gray growth shows (for me mostly my part, because I wear my hair down and have bangs).  </li>
      <li>it works, and is fast to apply but you do have to work it in immediately after applied so that it blends from the grey to your hair colored line.  </li>
      <li>Have to use every morning but is simple to use and looks natural.</li>
      <li>But because its so little bother putting it on, if it only lasted a day, it would still be worth it.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser only had dark brown available, so I got that, though I thought it would be too dark</li>

<li> It weighs down your hair, so unless you have naturally curly hair, prepare for it to go limp and forget styling it cause its ends up stiff and isn&#x27;t managable, and it will come off on your brush or comb or end up on your skin.</li>

<li> I put it on wet hair after shampooing and then blow dry as usual</li>
<li> so took less time to cover what I needed.  </li>
<li> This fills in, covers grey and does not run with sweat (even in a really hard workout).  </li>
<li> Otherwise it stays on and does not make a mess.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviewers are talking about--maybe they aren&#x27;t using this product properly.  </li>
<li> Just a little messy to apply.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this inferior product.</li>
<li> Have had for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t dried out, which is a plus.</li>
<li> but that got messy</li>
<li> It feels sticky and comes of on your hands after it has dried.  </li>
<li> it is not mascara, as it has a almost waxy texture that makes it stay in place for days or at least until you cannot stand your hair and have to wash.  </li>
<li> It does work to get the grey out though, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless I was desperate.</li>
<li> It could be that with age my eye sight is getting worse</li>

    <li> works great, a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> First of all it smells really bad, and I had to use it on my hairline near my face, so yuck!  It weighs down your hair, so unless you have naturally curly hair, prepare for it to go limp and forget styling it cause its ends up stiff and isn&#x27;t managable, and it will come off on your brush or comb or end up on your skin. I wear bangs, and some of it came off on my forehead. It does work to get the grey out though, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless I was desperate.</li>
    <li> great substitue when your roots start going grey before color appt</li>
    <li> This product is a disaster.  It never dries, even if you blow dry it dry, it&#x27;s still wiping off on your hands and it&#x27;s a complete mess.  You&#x27;re better off with an $8 touch up kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars b/c it did succeed in covering the gray, but the \\&quot;means to the end\\&quot; just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended, as my hair grows really fast and I started to grey early.&lt;br /&gt;Going in every three weeks for a touch up, was a really big pain and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dab dreamlook onto the grey showing, then work it in with my finger tips or a makeup sponge.  It looks like a mascarra tube and so does the applicator with the spiral brush.  Like mascarra you can get too much product on the brush, or get a hair wrapped up in it.  There is not a fragrance that I noticed and I have noticed no damage to my hair from use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with it around the face by dabbing the brush intermittantly and then blend.  I also section my hair where it would part and dab on, then blend as well.  If I am off to work out, I wear my hair up so dap around the outside hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is not mascara, as it has a almost waxy texture that makes it stay in place for days or at least until you cannot stand your hair and have to wash.  It could be that with age my eye sight is getting worse but I don&#x27;t notice the grey after I use Dreamlock and blend, and it can give me a good week at least before I have to get in to see the hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works, and is fast to apply but you do have to work it in immediately after applied so that it blends from the grey to your hair colored line.  Then wash your hands with soap and water, as water alone won&#x27;t remove the waxy substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed it coming off on clothes or pillows, but when I exercise and wear a visor I do notice some color on the sweat band, but hey it is inside the visor and the visor washes so no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the crayon or lipstick tube instant hair color but it did not work as well for me, as it was dryer and with the dreamlock being more fluid I can more easily blend so took less time to cover what I needed.  It does the job, but is still a little hassle but worth give me and extra week before seeing my good friend the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Have to use every morning but is simple to use and looks natural. NO skin irritation!! I will keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> It works but just too sticky.</li>
    <li> GIves definite grey coverage and coloring is great, and goes on nicely when hair is wet or dry. Unfortunately, it leaves that part of my hair looking greasy. . There is a residue that even after you brush it thru, the hair clumps a bit together, leaving the impression that it is greasy. Even so I will continue to use this along with another Touch Up. Much better than Mascara too, which leaves alot of residue.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I was worried that the color would not blend in well. Much to my surprise, the color blended well with my natural hair color and there was no flaking or powdery look. Very pleased with this product and I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I never thought about using a type of mascara to hide grey hair but this product works well and covers the grey hair, It does take a minute to dry so if you run your hand over it, you will notice the color on your hand but over all I really like the concept.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times in the past year and a half. I love it. Great color. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> great product.  This fills in, covers grey and does not run with sweat (even in a really hard workout).  Amazing stuff !</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this inferior product. Every time I have applied this product, the color just comes off in matter of hour or so.  Plus, it will ruin your clothes.</li>
    <li> Every time I pull the applicator out there it splatters on my hand.  It does cover well and stays on. Just a little messy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff because it takes away Grey without dying my hair.  Blends in nicely and washes out with soap and water.  Otherwise it stays on and does not make a mess.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviewers are talking about--maybe they aren&#x27;t using this product properly.  It works really well for me.  It is meant to be a touch-up between salon or home coloring, so it should only go on parts or around the hairline where the gray growth shows (for me mostly my part, because I wear my hair down and have bangs).

You have to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting it on anything else and wash your hands thoroughly after.  I put it on wet hair after shampooing and then blow dry as usual and it lasts until the next wash, which for me is usually almost a week.  My hairdresser only had dark brown available, so I got that, though I thought it would be too dark (I have brown hair with lots of gold-blond highlights), but it is a good color--just looks like dark roots growing out and blends fine.  People who are complaining about it not drying or rubbing off might be putting too much on or putting it on top of some kind of other product that is causing that.  And it is NOT mascara.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great little product.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It takes me under a minute to apply it.  More like 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* You need only minute quantities to touch up hair.  SO it will last.&lt;br /&gt;* The applicator is very well designed so you have lots of control over how much you&#x27;re using.  I can get some gray out and leaves some in according to what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I go swimming regularly, I can&#x27;t say how long the coloring will generally last.  But because its so little bother putting it on, if it only lasted a day, it would still be worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist turned me on to this.  She charges $10 for a tube, so this is a good price.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. The product did not work as described.  I did not get good results with this product. It feels sticky and comes of on your hands after it has dried.  Although it seems to never fully dry</li>
    <li> Came as expected, when expected, good quality, will continue to purchase from this seller</li>
    <li> I can now lengthen the time in-between my colorings due to this product.  The only thing that is annoying is that the applicator sticks to the hair as you aply itm and it sometimes gets all over my fingers.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product for quick touch ups, although I must admit...I was skeptical. Ironically, I&#x27;d been using mascara to do the job...but that got messy so I decided to check this out. Basically, it&#x27;s the same thing. Mascara! Although, just as one of the other reviewers noted, it never dries. Also, it was shipped loose, and in a plain yellow envelope. It looks very generic. The label is a sticker. If you&#x27;re like me, you peruse these reviews and ultimately make your own decision whether or not to purchase the item...but make sure you&#x27;re looking at the reviews from people that have actually purchased it. It&#x27;s in your best interest to pass on this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s temporary but that what I expected, have to apply fairly often. I mainly use around the front and sides of my hair.</li>
    <li> Handy size and manageable to use.  Have had for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t dried out, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> It actually lasts and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or signs of &amp;#34;temporary color&amp;#34;.  I would buy it again and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> works great for a quick touch up around face... along hair line before blow drying hair.  covers grey very nicely.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found this in stores.  What a great product for those stubborn white hairs!</li>
