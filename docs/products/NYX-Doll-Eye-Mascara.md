### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best mascara.</li>
      <li>Best Curl</li>
      <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
      <li>Love It!!!  </li>
      <li>so, it&#x27;s very good in some aspects but</li>
      <li>arrived quickly; great mascara</li>
      <li>Liked the product as it is waterproof and stays perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The best thing is to soak you eyes with a cotton ball soaked in coconut oil and let it kind of &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; off your lashes.</li>
      <li>Great mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Perfect for those who need smudge-free, easy to remove (with make-up remover) mascara!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The seller was good too with prompt shipment.  </li>
      <li>I do get a good look when I do that.  </li>
      <li>Good service and good mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced better coverage and stay power with $5.99 versions of Maybelline.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It almost sounded magical!</li>
      <li>Great price too and easy to remove with eye make remover.</li>
      <li>it kind of balls up and peels off of your lashes.</li>
      <li>Easy to take off in the shower with some body wash or whatever soap handy!</li>
      <li>Ok this mascara is amazing.</li>
      <li>Granted, it is waterproof, so if you are frequently swimming or in the line of a firehose, this stuff is probably awesome.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, and looks good enough, though not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>with this mascara, i must be very attentive and put it on all at one time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very important to me that the mascara can hold a curl, add volume, and not clump up.</li>
      <li>i am allergic to most all mascaras, but my eyes didn&#x27;t water with this one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that waterproof mascara tends to hold the curl better.  </li>
      <li>I have used many mascara, this one has the mid-price and the mid-quality.  </li>
      <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I am picky about mascara and have tried many brands over the decades.  </li>
      <li>I can line both my top AND my bottom lashes (never been able to do that before) and there is no smudge problem whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, so most waterproof mascaras eventually run on me by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t become my favorite.</li>
      <li>; mascara much better, but I tried this to see if I could find something comparable for the price...</li>
      <li>If you curl after applying, than this make work better for you...if you already have voluminous lashes.</li>
      <li>Its ok once it dries.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for then this might be a winner for you, but I prefer a mascara that does a bit more.</li>
      <li>Just absolutely fantastic!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
      <li>real though, this is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This did lengthen my lashes and give it more volume, but I don&#x27;t think this is the product for me.</li>
      <li>I use waterproof mascara because it tends to stay on better, keep a curl and not smudge.  </li>
      <li>Aaahh LOVE</li>
      <li>I thought it was better</li>
      <li>Have you also looked up several articles about the best mascara?</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I have tried top brands to drugstore brands and this mascara tops them all.  </li>
      <li>I Love it.  </li>
      <li>I wish there were more fibers and lengthened my eyelashes better, but for someone who already has naturally long/thick/curled eyelashes this mascara would be great.</li>
      <li>Mascara is pretty good</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, easily.</li>
      <li>If you have problems with mascara smudging, flaking, or in any other way not staying on your lashes throughout the day, this is the perfect mascara for you!</li>
      <li>No clumping with easy to apply applicator.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t smudge and it curled my lashes and added the volume.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It flakes if anything, which you can easily wipe off.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, but comes off easily with cleaners and water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok mascara, nothing special</li>
      <li>It was delivered on time and the packaging was fine.</li>
      <li>If you scrape off 3/4 that comes on the brush, you should be fine.  </li>
      <li>Made my eyes huge looking.</li>
      <li>Fabulous mascara, does not sweat off &amp; does not make lashes brittle.</li>
      <li>Combine this mascara with a good eyelash curler (I use and recommend [[ASIN:B00Q0IDADA Professional Eyelash Curler -</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are beautiful and long with this product.</li>
      <li>but hey, you have to clean your face anyway).</li>
      <li>For Full Eyelashes</li>
      <li>But there are some obvious problems with it, as well as some good things.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I liked how soft the applicator brush is on this mascara, but it didn&#x27;t hold up my lashes like I wanted.</li>
      <li>I have very oily eyelids and most mascara smudges.</li>
      <li>but not bad</li>
      <li>, it is SUPER waterproof.</li>
      <li>Also dries out really quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very waterproof at all, comes off easily (as stated</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited about getting this mascara after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>I read all the rave reviews for the original Doll Eye mascara, so I thought the waterproof one would be a no fail.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lucky to have nice long eyelashes</li>
      <li>I have never been able to go an entire day without having to wipe away flakes or smudging from mascara, which obviously ruined the rest of my makeup along the way, but this mascara is absolutely in every way smudge, water, sweat, and flake-proof.&lt;br /&gt;However, at the end of the day it is incredibly easy to take off with even just water; the trick is to massage the water into your lashes gently, and the mascara will begin to come off in little tubes and flakes, leaving no smudging at all but coming off perfectly and cleanly!</li>
      <li>Good mascara,  I have ordered it twice now, Doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as other products.</li>
      <li>The price is just right for my wallet compared to the luxe products that didn&#x27;t perform as well and cost 3×</li>
      <li>This caused smudges under my eyes almost right away.</li>
      <li>Finding the perfect mascara for my extremely thin &amp; straight eye lashes continues to be an on-going battle I have.</li>
      <li>i do NOT recommend this to anyone who has straight lashes like me!</li>
      <li>I was hot ,so I put some water on my face .</li>
      <li>, I first curled my lashes and then applied the mascara.</li>
      <li>It goes one without clumping, makes my lashes look dark and lovely, and l-a-s-t-s!  </li>
      <li>Although I really like several of the NYX mascaras, this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It required about 3 full coats before it reached its full potential.</li>
      <li>I guess this mascara is for people that really want that spaced, gapped eyelash look.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump as much.</li>

      <li>I bought the waterproof version of this mascara, and although it works as described (darkens, thickens), it doesn&#x27;t lengthen or curl my eyelashes as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>This mascara was very clumpy, but I worked around it cause</li>
      <li>needed a lot of combing to remove chunks &amp; was really sticky</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara and the brush too.  </li>
      <li>I have straight lashes.  </li>
      <li>It would stay on for three days straight</li>
      <li>Really does separate my lashes.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t really waterproof.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thin mascara that doesn&#x27;t do much for your lashes. Doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken them, just makes what you have look black. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for then this might be a winner for you, but I prefer a mascara that does a bit more.</li>
    <li> Too messy and hard to work with. Its ok once it dries.</li>
    <li> needed a lot of combing to remove chunks &amp; was really sticky</li>
    <li> I have very oily eyelids and most mascara smudges. this one does not!</li>
    <li> This mascara was very clumpy, but I worked around it cause I thought maybe it&#x27;s just those few clumps the first time I opened it. Nope. Every single time I use it, huge hard clumps come out of the tube.  Also for some reason it has this plastic rotten smell.&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I buy mascara online.</li>
    <li> Not only did my eye lashes clump together with this, but this costed me breakage of eyelashes, hate this stuff!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to go super duper heavy on eye makeup; I just want to put on mascara that will last throughout the day and be dark enough to make my eyes pop! I have problems with &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; products smearing all over the place due to oily skin around my eyes, but this product has not caused me ANY issues with smearing! I would have given it five stars, except it gets kinda chunky when you go to remove it...it&#x27;s not DIFFICULT to remove, per say, it just does that thing where black flakes come off as you&#x27;re wiping. Though, maybe it&#x27;s that chunky texture that makes it so reliably waterproof...</li>
    <li> it weighed heavy and dried like plastic</li>
    <li> I like this mascara if I know I&#x27;m going to get sweaty or cry...it does &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; the lashes to make the Doll-Eye effect. Removing this is weird...it kind of balls up and peels off of your lashes. The best thing is to soak you eyes with a cotton ball soaked in coconut oil and let it kind of &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; off your lashes. I would buy this again because I like cruelty-free vegan mascaras, and this one came at an unbeatable price-point!</li>
    <li> Love It!!!  I have oily eye lids and this is the only mascara that does not wind up on my eye lids during the day.  Great price too and easy to remove with eye make remover.</li>
    <li> I liked how soft the applicator brush is on this mascara, but it didn&#x27;t hold up my lashes like I wanted. But I will give it this, it is SUPER waterproof. It was hard to get off using Clinque&#x27;s Take Off the Day and an oil based cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did lengthen my lashes and give it more volume, but I don&#x27;t think this is the product for me. I was hoping for a waterproof mascara that would lengthen and hold up my curled lashes. If you already have naturally curled lashes, this might be the mascara for you. But it isn&#x27;t for me, unforunately.</li>
    <li> Makes your lashes pretty thick</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give a good review, because the tube seems to have either dried up or it&#x27;s nearly empty. You can&#x27;t get the wand coated with mascara to actually cover your lashes.</li>
    <li> Only mascara that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara does not burn or run at all!  Never used it before and found it just surfing Amazon one day.  Thought I would give it a try.  Next time I will order two or three.</li>
    <li> I have used many mascara, this one has the mid-price and the mid-quality.  The &amp;#34;doll eye&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t tell the truth. but not bad</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and no matter what mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past, I end up with raccoon eyes by the end of my 12 hour shifts. Yet this mascara cannot be smudged! I can line both my top AND my bottom lashes (never been able to do that before) and there is no smudge problem whatsoever. It flakes if anything, which you can easily wipe off. It can clump a little going on, but that&#x27;s fixed by wiping off the brush before you use it each time, so product doesn&#x27;t built up. That&#x27;s what a pro makeup artist would do anyway -- a fresh brush, not the same one over and over. Love it!</li>
    <li> I guess this mascara is for people that really want that spaced, gapped eyelash look. I can&#x27;t stand my eyelashes being extremely spaced out and no volume or length. This is also not waterproof.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the other reviewers that this mascara was bad for them but I had no problems with it at all.  My lashes are not curly but they are long with little volume so I was looking for a mascara to give me the volume I need and help me keep the curl I got with my curler.  I found that the Doll Eye did just that.  I had no problems like the other 2 reviewers.  It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t smudge and it curled my lashes and added the volume.  No problem getting it off either. I use either Maybelline or Wet n&#x27; Wild eye makeup remover with a cotton pad.  I drench the cotton pad, put it on my eye and let it sit there for a minute and then wipe off the mascara. I may have to repeat the process but it always comes off without breaking my lashes or tearing any eyelashes out. I would suggest doing that to avoid damaging your lashes. I use waterproof mascara because it tends to stay on better, keep a curl and not smudge.  I really like NYX Doll Eye and would suggest it to others (I have) and would definitely buy it again as I am doing now.</li>
    <li> Although I really like several of the NYX mascaras, this one is my favorite.  It goes one without clumping, makes my lashes look dark and lovely, and l-a-s-t-s!  It doesn&#x27;t run, but comes off easily with cleaners and water.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t really waterproof.  I end up with smudges under my eyes as the day passes because I guess I have oily lids.  This is why I need waterproof mascara.  This caused smudges under my eyes almost right away.</li>
    <li> So bought this for the summer for going around, pools, etc. Well, first use in water and it was totally gone. So, doesn&#x27;t do the job it says it does. It&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
    <li> Worst Product, don&#x27;t buy it. Mascara is all dried up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it is waterproof eye mascara. It is not true. I was hot ,so I put some water on my face . My waterproof mascara was running off. I was very disappointed. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best mascara. No clumping with easy to apply applicator. My new fav!</li>
    <li> I just received my mascara and it&#x27;s a winner.  No clumping, lengthens lashes,  and adds moderate volume. I have tried top brands to drugstore brands and this mascara tops them all.  The price is just right for my wallet compared to the luxe products that didn&#x27;t perform as well and cost 3× the price 😕!</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t last at all, much less be waterproof.  I sweat a little and it was flaking &amp; smudging then in the pool it wiped off..... I got out of the pool and there was nothing left. I&#x27;m throwing it away since it&#x27;s not worth the shipping to return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have nice long eyelashes but this mascara does nothing for them. As carefully as you might put it on, it gets other places that have to be wiped off. Didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I know that&#x27;s silly but if you&#x27;re reading this review, you are where I was a year ago. Have you also looked up several articles about the best mascara? Same. Uggh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great. But if you&#x27;re looking for some miracle mascara that makes you look like Zooey Deschanel with one application that will last all day, that&#x27;s not possible. Here&#x27;s what you have to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Curl your eyelashes. You have to. There&#x27;s no way around it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all three of these formulas but always come back to the waterproof. They all do their respective jobs (length, volume, staying put as waterproof) but waterproof is thick and lasts all day. You do have to use make-up remover to get it off (but hey, you have to clean your face anyway). Combine this mascara with a good eyelash curler (I use and recommend [[ASIN:B00Q0IDADA Professional Eyelash Curler - Never Needs Refill Pads! - Doesn&#x27;t Pinch Or Pull! - Best Curl For Full Eyelashes With Cute Pink Packaging]]) and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this once, in one coat, once a day and I&#x27;m set for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why waterproof? As a scientist who is female, I need something that lasts through lots of crying and falling in love too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For real though, this is great. Just try it.</li>
    <li> Made my eyelashes stick together like glue and does not wash off at night, you have to try to pick it off and loose eye lashes in the process!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this a 3.5 star review, but the site won&#x27;t let me.  This tube packs a lot of mascara.  I have to scrape so much off of the brush, or my lashes get extremely clumpy due to too much product.  It gets all over my lids, etc.  If you scrape off 3/4 that comes on the brush, you should be fine.  I do get a good look when I do that.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, but I&#x27;m going to give it a chance &amp; use what I have &amp; then decide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this mascara. The waterproof formula works well and it&#x27;s easy to apply. It does not lengthen my lashes at all. I like my mascara to make my eyes seem bigger, with long lashes. This mascara makes my eyes appear small with stubby lashes. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> only used it once and wasn&#x27;t wowed or anything. It was packaged horrible.. I picked the box up from my door step and I could feel the three products I ordered sliding around and when I opened it the mascara was out of the box -??.. you get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> Good service and good mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok mascara, nothing special</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what it is abbout this mascara.  i like the effect.  however, i&#x27;m use to putting on Several layers.  with this mascara, i must be very attentive and put it on all at one time.  instead of put one layer on, come back and put another layer on.  if i wait too long, my lashes are dry and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to add another layer.  i am allergic to most all mascaras, but my eyes didn&#x27;t water with this one.  at the end of the day, it was difficult to remove.  i thought Lancomme was difficult to remove.........  so, it&#x27;s very good in some aspects but has it&#x27;s drawbacks.  the brush was firm.  i do not like those new rubber flimsy brushes.  so, give it a try !!!!</li>
    <li> I got this mascara a few weeks ago, and tried it. The first time I wore it weighed down my lashes. I thought it was just my eyelashes. My eye lashes are not curly but they are long.  So I wore it again today, I first curled my lashes and then applied the mascara. It weighed my lashes down, and then made my lashes clump together. And made my lashes very hard. It took me awhile just to get the product off. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product and Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Worst mascara ever purchased.  Can&#x27;t even tell I have any on when I apply it</li>
    <li> I was lured in by the enticing reviews but unfortunately this mascara is not as good as reviews claim. ..I tried it in and after while it was smearing under eye...</li>
    <li> Not a stellar mascara.  I&#x27;ve experienced better coverage and stay power with $5.99 versions of Maybelline.  Won&#x27;t become my favorite.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those who need smudge-free, easy to remove (with make-up remover) mascara! No clumping, no smudging, doesn&#x27;t leave residue (if you use make-up remover). By far, my fav mascara.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and the brush too.  I am picky about mascara and have tried many brands over the decades.  This one does what it says it will and I am pleased with the results. The seller was good too with prompt shipment.  I would definitely recommend this product and also the seller.</li>
    <li> Ok this mascara is amazing. I did a test. I didn&#x27;t wash it off. It stayed on for three days!! Hardly any flaking!! Made my eyes huge looking. Great mascara. I have been looking for something like this and now I found it. My eyelashes are beautiful and long with this product. Aaahh LOVE</li>
    <li> very disappointed! the mascara is way too wet, which cannot hold the lashes in curls and its definitely  not waterproof at all! i do NOT recommend this to anyone who has straight lashes like me!</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t do much for me other than clump my lashes up pretty bad. It was pretty much everything that I hate about trying new mascara.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with mascara smudging, flaking, or in any other way not staying on your lashes throughout the day, this is the perfect mascara for you! I have never been able to go an entire day without having to wipe away flakes or smudging from mascara, which obviously ruined the rest of my makeup along the way, but this mascara is absolutely in every way smudge, water, sweat, and flake-proof.&lt;br /&gt;However, at the end of the day it is incredibly easy to take off with even just water; the trick is to massage the water into your lashes gently, and the mascara will begin to come off in little tubes and flakes, leaving no smudging at all but coming off perfectly and cleanly! The massage is the key; without it they&#x27;ll stay on forever! (not literally, hopefully, but definitely overnight. I&#x27;d know!)</li>
    <li> I like everything about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my lashes fantiasticly long.&lt;br /&gt;Minimal clumps. It would stay on for three days straight if I allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
    <li> Liked the product as it is waterproof and stays perfectly.  The formula was a bit too dry for me to work with.</li>
    <li> I just started using it yesterday so I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet. My mascara seemed a little dried out</li>
    <li> Like the look of this mascara, but it can get clumpy if I use without an eyelash comb with the mascara (I customarily do anyway). It&#x27;s so darn hard to remove though, even with waterproof remover- which is enough for me to rate it 3-stars (wish I could rate 3.5). I will stick with my Rimmel Scandaleyes, Benefit They&#x27;re Real, or Peter Thomas Roth Lashes to Die For mascaras instead.</li>
    <li> Daughter didn&#x27;t like shape of brush.</li>
    <li> Fabulous mascara, does not sweat off &amp; does not make lashes brittle. Washes off w/ ease w/ facial cleanser (I use cetaphil for normal to oily skin) &amp; water.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> Mascara is pretty good it gives the length and blackness but It does not give your lashes the fullness.</li>
    <li> Clumps like crazy! Also dries out really quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I will use now! Never flakes off and doesn&#x27;t smear when your in the water! Easy to take off in the shower with some body wash or whatever soap handy!</li>
    <li> I have straight lashes.  It takes me some time to curl my lashes, so I want a mascara that can hold a curl.  I&#x27;ve found that waterproof mascara tends to hold the curl better.  I read all the rave reviews for the original Doll Eye mascara, so I thought the waterproof one would be a no fail.  Not even a few seconds after I put the first coat on were my lashes drooping. By the second coat, my curl was completely gone.  I even tried using a different waterproof mascara as a base coat, hoping to get the volume I wanted from the Doll Eye.  No luck, droopy eye lashes again.  What a waste, not using again.</li>
    <li> I Love it.  My lashes look super long and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like some other mascaras do.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> It is a very decent mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor I was looking for! I thought it was better</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara. Comparable (if not identical)  to YSL Babydoll. Really does separate my lashes. No clumps. No flakes. No spider lashes. Just absolutely fantastic!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, easily.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly; great mascara....stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Finding the perfect mascara for my extremely thin &amp; straight eye lashes continues to be an on-going battle I have. I bought the waterproof version of this mascara, and although it works as described (darkens, thickens), it doesn&#x27;t lengthen or curl my eyelashes as much as I&#x27;d like. It required about 3 full coats before it reached its full potential. If you let it dry between coats, it gets really hard and crunchy, making it impossible to add more layers - and it dries pretty quickly. Other than that, it works pretty well for a mascara this inexpensive. I wish there were more fibers and lengthened my eyelashes better, but for someone who already has naturally long/thick/curled eyelashes this mascara would be great. I still recommend trying it out even though it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good mascara,  I have ordered it twice now, Doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as other products.</li>
    <li> Doesnt smudge. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your lashes down too much. Doesn&#x27;t clump as much. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, and looks good enough, though not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. My complaint is that it takes a serious amount of effort to get it off, and when it does come off, it peels off like the rubber retreads from a truck tire. We are talking several minutes with the makeup remover every day. Granted, it is waterproof, so if you are frequently swimming or in the line of a firehose, this stuff is probably awesome. I like &amp;#34;Its So Big&amp;#34; mascara much better, but I tried this to see if I could find something comparable for the price...I guess I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t run on me at all.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly every waterproof mascara there is, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t run as long as I have it on.  I have oily skin, so most waterproof mascaras eventually run on me by the end of the day.  Not this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered the NYX Doll Eye Mascara in Extreme Black Waterproof. I was pretty excited about getting this mascara after reading the reviews. It almost sounded magical! It was delivered on time and the packaging was fine. But there are some obvious problems with it, as well as some good things.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not hard to remove which causes less irritation of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Not flaky&lt;br /&gt;Flexible feeling, not like my eyelashes are all crunchy after applying&lt;br /&gt;Lashes look longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very waterproof at all, comes off easily (as stated above)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t hold a curl if it&#x27;s life depended on it&lt;br /&gt;Clumps lashes and doesn&#x27;t comb out well at all. Can&#x27;t apply multiple layers at all, it only makes it horrendously worse!&lt;br /&gt;No volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there are equal number of pros and cons about this mascara, what I&#x27;m looking for in one is not in this one. It&#x27;s very important to me that the mascara can hold a curl, add volume, and not clump up. I did discover though that if you curl the lashes after they have dried, it holds some kind of curl, but I hate doing that since it pulls out lashes. I like to curl my lashes prior to applying and this mascara is not made for that. If you curl after applying, than this make work better for you...if you already have voluminous lashes.</li>
