      <li>This threader is very good and makes it much easier for me to floss the bridge.  </li>
      <li>They are ok, but not as flexible as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Just love, love these Floss Threaders.</li>
      <li>Great product and this company shops fast.</li>
      <li>Wish I had a better way of storing them as you can reuse them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m travelling on the road most of the time living in an rv and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>had tried most stores and pharmacies around the country to no avail.  </li>
      <li>:  )</li>
      <li>pleased to see I could purchase through them.  </li>
      <li>Great product ...super fast shipping</li>
      <li>Had I purchased this amount from the company&#x27;s website, I would have paid much more.</li>
      <li>These flossers work so much better than the ones I&#x27;ve been using for 15 years - I didn&#x27;t know they existed until I started searching on amazon to get a better price flossers than at the drug store.  </li>
      <li>I find it most helpful and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>My hygienist noticed the difference :).</li>
      <li>Nice to see a bigger box of these great bridge threaders.  </li>
      <li>I have been using them for years and think they are much better and easier to use than the ones with the huge loops.</li>
      <li>These threaders make flossing under bridges so easy, and the fact that you can buy them in bulk saves a LOT of money.  </li>
      <li>The floss aid by bridgeaid works fine for me</li>
      <li>I have a bridge and these threaders are solid not flimsy like some threaders&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so they are easily manipulated to do a great job of flossing.</li>
      <li>I buy these for my husband and this box of 1,000 is the most economical way to purchase them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got a free sample from my dentist years ago.</li>
      <li>purchased them since they were cheap, and they do the trick.</li>
      <li>It almost feels like these were meant to be provided as samples by a dentist, but at about .02 per threader this was the cheapest option available at the time of purchase.  </li>
      <li>I am an obsessive flosser and this by far is the most effective.  </li>
      <li>This threader is not only sold at a good price but is better quality and easier to use the those found at Walgreens etc.</li>
      <li>I transfer a bunch into the plastic container I originally bought, and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>My son wears a permanent band on his lower front teeth after orthodontia and finds this product very useful for his needs.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a huge supply, so even if the Apocalypse comes, I&#x27;ll have clean bridgework.  </li>
      <li>handy to use and a decent price</li>
      <li>I originally was given some of these threaders by my dentist to try but</li>
      <li>My husband needs these to clean his bridge.</li>
      <li>Better than buying at high priced pharmacy!</li>
      <li>I ordered these Floss Aid ones  based on one review that said they worked better, and by golly they really do.  </li>
      <li>Having two permanent retainers, floss threaders are as necessary as toothpaste for good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price was good and the product the same as the samples that the dentist gave me.  </li>
      <li>Good was to buy them when you use daily.</li>
      <li>Product is exactly as described and received it quickly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to see a product that was biodegradable instead of sending more plastic into the landfill, but not quite sure if they&#x27;d work the same.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the service, it was delivered one day earlier than promised!  </li>
      <li>These are like a plastic needle, very compact and easy to thread.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS WORKING FINE WITH MY IMPLANT TEETH, THANKS.</li>
      <li>It is far better than the type of flosser that comes with a strand of floss attached.</li>
      <li>I saw these, which were really cheap, and I actually like them a lot better.</li>
      <li>However, these were way cheaper, and I now have years worth of them.</li>
      <li>They are certainly more thicker and more stiff than the longer, thinner options available from Butler.  </li>
      <li>This made it quick to string floss successfully on the the first try in hard to reach areas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best floss threader in the business just stiff enough and long enough to make flossing a breeze my lower plate is a fixed on with six post that need flossed daily</li>
    <li> These floss threaders are awesome. Other brands just don&#x27;t work as effectively for me. Getting under a dental bridge is much easier to do with this brand - that means it gets done every day!</li>
    <li> My husband needs these to clean his bridge. Great price and timely shipping!</li>
    <li> Great value!!! Better than buying at high priced pharmacy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for permanent retainers! Great value for how many you get. I&#x27;ll buy again once I run out in a few years.</li>
    <li> Great product and a must have in your bathroom! You can clean under your bridges alot easier and better access to tough hard to reach places that need flossing!   Thanks for a great deal and gave me the best buy online!   I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> Great product ...super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from my dentist years ago. Went nutz trying to find it in shops. Finally Amazon to the rescue. This gets back in the last bridge in my metal mouth. The Best!</li>
    <li> These are the best floss threaders I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;ve been using them for over 10 years.  The ones they give out at the dentist are big and flimsy, whereas these are small and rigid.  You can get between small spaces easily and they&#x27;re easy to manipulate in your mouth because of their small size.  Also, they last for a long time.  I just rinse before and after each use---and I&#x27;ve often had a single threader last a month or more before it finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a huge supply, so even if the Apocalypse comes, I&#x27;ll have clean bridgework.  :  )</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me start a routine of flossing every day. This was the best price I could find for the quantity. I don&#x27;t mind having 1000 of these in exchange for paying less in the end. For some reason, it didn&#x27;t occur to me to investigate the size of these things vs. the ones my dentist gave me--maybe I thought they were standardized? But this threader has a little ball at the tip where you insert the floss. This thing gets stuck between a few of my teeth where either my teeth are really close or the retainer is low or my gums are too high. This wasn&#x27;t an issue with the brand my dentist gave me. I&#x27;ll use these until the 1000 are gone and wince on a daily basis when flossing a few teeth, but then I&#x27;ll probably find a brand that doesn&#x27;t have that little hook at the end. Also, I&#x27;d use each threader (from the brand my dentist gave me) for about a week before trashing. These ones get bent and can only be used once or twice.</li>
    <li> Good service.  Item arrived promptly and was as expected.  Like these floss threaders.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying it and receiving less than it claimed as one reviewer said, but I counted a couple packs and it had 10 as stated with 100 packs. It obviously works and saved me a lot of money in the long run. It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> My son uses these to floss his teeth now that he has braces.  I have googled these everywhere and amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> Having received the box,  I randomly picked three of 100 envolopes, opened and counted, There 8 threaders in two of them and 9 in the 3rd one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the service, it was delivered one day earlier than promised!  My son wears a permanent band on his lower front teeth after orthodontia and finds this product very useful for his needs.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> the best ever, curved for easier use</li>
    <li> I recently purchased another popular brand from Walmart and it was not nearly as easy. This product is superior in quality and ease of use.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. It is so much faster and  easier to get in  around and out of a bridge. Flossing is a breeze, however the shipping time was slow. If you can wait, it&#x27;s an inexpensive way to get a great product. You can use any floss you want with these, you aren&#x27;t at the mercy of something with an inferior tip. This gives you control.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool to be able to thread through braces.  I am an obsessive flosser and this by far is the most effective.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> The perfect tool for flossing between teeth and under a bridge. I have used them for at least 10 years and couldn&#x27;t have a healthy mouth without them!</li>
    <li> They work very well for getting under a permanent wire retainer. Having never flossed under them before, they were very tough to get used to. But, after my gums adjusted, they now are very easy to use. My hygienist noticed the difference :).</li>
    <li> The floss aid by bridgeaid works fine for me</li>
    <li> Bridgaid product is stiff, flat and curved. This made it quick to string floss successfully on the the first try in hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than the full floss threaders I have been using in the past.  I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This may be a life time supply for me since I use each one multiple times.  The price was good and the product the same as the samples that the dentist gave me.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly same product what they have in dental office. It is very easy to use and price is  great too.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does.  Good product. A bit expensive, but this product seems to be okay.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good for my teeth I got a lot of it 💕</li>
    <li> These things work for getting under my permanent retainer, but they are not nearly as comfortable as the other type of these things, that look like little blue loops of fishing line.  However, these were way cheaper, and I now have years worth of them.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I was ordering. Too small and stiff.</li>
    <li> Nice to see a bigger box of these great bridge threaders.  I have been using them for years and think they are much better and easier to use than the ones with the huge loops.</li>
    <li> For me these are the best bridge flossers.  This 1000 pack is perfect.  I like these flossers because they are a bit stiffer than the others I&#x27;ve tried.  They&#x27;re easy to get in the tight spaces and pull through. Great product and this company shops fast.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I had used it before and I knew what I was getting.  I didn&#x27;t really look at the price because I had gotten a poor quality threader from another company.  I didn&#x27;t want to run the risk of being disappointed again.</li>
    <li> was disappointed thought the threader would be a little stronger</li>
    <li> The only any to buy these to afford them...I transfer a bunch into the plastic container I originally bought, and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to floss threaders by my dentist who gave me a sample of these. These are very effective and easily slide under and around dental work for a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing because i got the sample from my Orthodontics and i like it. It helps the flossing go easier with my braces on. I use the empty pill bottle from the pharmacy to store the threader since i don&#x27;t like to wet the paper package all the time when i wanna grab one threader. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The product description indicates 10 flosses/envelope x 100 envelopes&#x3D;1000/box. When I receive the product, there is only average of 8 flosses per envelope. I would not give it a 1 star if they respond at all to my inquiry. I emailed them twice and filed an Amazon complaint. They did not bother to respond a single word.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WORKING FINE WITH MY IMPLANT TEETH, THANKS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good price, but I was disappointed with this product.  It&#x27;s short and thick compared to other bridge cleaners making it difficult to go under a bride.  It&#x27;s not flexible like the others.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find these in any of the stores, and I bought this box a year ago and still haven&#x27;t made a big dent in it. It should last me awhile but i&#x27;m happy with them.  I&#x27;d like to see a product that was biodegradable instead of sending more plastic into the landfill, but not quite sure if they&#x27;d work the same. But maybe?</li>
    <li> These are a fantastic buy if you have a bridge!!  They&#x27;re packaged in small envelopes -- super easy to deal with</li>
    <li> this is excellent for floss with braces. I highly recommend this since most dentist use the same product  I got a pack of 1000 this should last me awhile</li>
    <li> A little too stiff and could be thinner.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the picture is a little misleading. It does not come with the floss. It is just the plastic pieces that you put the floss in. My daughter says it works good but you do need to purchase floss separate.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking that it was a good deal over the ones sold Gum ezz brand sold everywhere. Do not buy these, they are very small and you won&#x27;t be able to thread them under your work, specially if it&#x27;s in the back. Forget about returning them if you try one, cause this merchant won&#x27;t take them back.</li>
    <li> wrong product for me. i returned it..it&#x27;s for denture...</li>
    <li> Was looking to buy threaders in bulk as they are SO expensive in the stores.  And these get the job done for a decent price.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try another brand next time though if the price is right.</li>
    <li> handy to use and a decent price</li>
    <li> These are firm enough to feel the spot to thread the floss under your bridgework.</li>
    <li> I have been using for my bridges for years. It&#x27;s better product compare to other brands</li>
    <li> Good product. Received timely.</li>
    <li> Imagine how happy I was to find these threaders at such a great price!  Had I purchased this amount from the company&#x27;s website, I would have paid much more.</li>
    <li> These flossers work so much better than the ones I&#x27;ve been using for 15 years - I didn&#x27;t know they existed until I started searching on amazon to get a better price flossers than at the drug store.  I had been using the Butler Eaz-Thru flossers (what my dentist gave me, and the only kind I&#x27;ve ever seen in local stores).  They are the skinny plastic thread shaped in a loop.  They worked OK, but recently one of my top crown bridges was redone to include a back tooth, and that skinny plastic thread was useless at getting between those two back teeth.  I ordered these Floss Aid ones  based on one review that said they worked better, and by golly they really do.  THey are sturdier (but still thin) so they hold their shape when you push on it, and they are curved so you can curve up or curve down. And that did the trick like magic, using it curving down on my upper bridge.  So I am delighted with them, because these crown bridges are really expensive, and I try very hard to keep them clean and gums in shape. The packaging is also easy to use and store (1000 fit in a pretty small box).</li>
    <li> Very good item. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the same product my dentist gave me to use. It works well cleaning bridges and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> not much room for rave reviews here - they navigate between your teeth as you&#x27;d expect. If you need these, you should get them!</li>
    <li> I use these with floss and the Smartmouth Mint Toothpaste, as I have a lot of restorative dental work.  These threaders make flossing under bridges so easy, and the fact that you can buy them in bulk saves a LOT of money.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best in class...easy to use and works!</li>
    <li> This threader is not only sold at a good price but is better quality and easier to use the those found at Walgreens etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazingly good product.  I have a permanent bridge and food always gets caught under the bridge.  The only thing that removes that stuck food is Floss aid. It&#x27;s a Great product.</li>
    <li> Just love, love these Floss Threaders. I originally was given some of these threaders by my dentist to try but&lt;br /&gt;after I moved State I just couldn&#x27;t get hold of any. I&#x27;m travelling on the road most of the time living in an rv and&lt;br /&gt;I had tried most stores and pharmacies around the country to no avail.  Then I decided to check Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;was pleased to see I could purchase through them.  I purchased a box of 1,000 so I will never have to worry&lt;br /&gt;about not having any for a long time.  I have a bridge and these threaders are solid not flimsy like some threaders&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so they are easily manipulated to do a great job of flossing.</li>
    <li> Dentist turned me onto these.... They are awesome... Wish I had a better way of storing them as you can reuse them. Great product.</li>
    <li> love these got them from dentist office and now bought them in bulk and can not get enough of them ...</li>
    <li> I have purchased this particular brand of floss threaders in the past, although in much smaller quantities.  For me, they are much easier to hold and control than the longer, thinner type of threader.  But my local drugstore charges almost $5 for a package of 30, or about  $60 dollars a year for 360 threaders.  This package of 1,000 was only 1/3 the cost of a year&#x27;s supply from the drugstore and contains almost three times as many threaders.  Talk about a bargain!!  And, the box is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of storage space.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Work great. Good was to buy them when you use daily.</li>
    <li> My son just got braces and the ortho gave him a starter pack of the Floss aid. Well, if your so or daughter keeps up with their cleaning then you will know you can go through these pretty fast. So, I stocked up and as promised they are what is advertised.</li>
    <li> These threaders work fairly well, except the the opening is quite smaller than other threaders that I have used.  However, they are an excellent bargain for the price, so I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> This is thicker than &amp;#34;G-U-M Eez-Thru Floss Threaders&amp;#34; and my gum bled the first three times I used this but it is so much cheaper than G-U-M I tried a few more times and have gotten accustomed to it. I didn&#x27;t count how many were in the pack but even if the box only had half of what&#x27;s posted, it is still an economical alternative to G-U-M.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my husband and this box of 1,000 is the most economical way to purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little strange that the 1,000 come packaged in 100 packets of 10 threaders.  It&#x27;s as if they&lt;br /&gt;were intended for dentists to give away as samples.  I don&#x27;t mind, I just put them all into a baggie.&lt;br /&gt;The only small problem I found was that I counted each individual packet and got different amounts&lt;br /&gt;in several packets.  I counted 8 in some packets and 17 and 18 in other packets.  All totalled,&lt;br /&gt;I came up with 1,000, which is what I wanted.  Shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> This products performs as expected.  It is useful in situations with tight bridgework.  I do recommend this product for those who need it.</li>
    <li> Easy and good to use. Very helpful with braces. Great price.</li>
    <li> The Floss Aid Birdgeaid Floss threader 1000/bx came on time and was as advertised.  I find it most helpful and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> Having two permanent retainers, floss threaders are as necessary as toothpaste for good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried nearly every threading product (including the terrible and expensive &amp;#34;threader floss&amp;#34;), Bridgeaids are my favorite to use.  They are certainly more thicker and more stiff than the longer, thinner options available from Butler.  This could be an issue if you don&#x27;t have a lot of clearance between teeth, though it wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get here is a cardboard box filled with hundreds of paper packets each containing around 10 floss threaders (some more, some less).  It almost feels like these were meant to be provided as samples by a dentist, but at about .02 per threader this was the cheapest option available at the time of purchase.  Since you will probably use only one or two threaders a day, this supply should last a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a convenient product as you can easily tuck a few paper packets everywhere (in your wallet, desk, bathroom, travel bag, etc).</li>
    <li> The stuff works great with the tape floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried samples from the dentist and these work fine and hold up the best.  A thousand pack appeals to my frugality and encourages the flossing my bridge requires.</li>
    <li> They are ok, but not as flexible as I would have liked. They work and they are cheap!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased them since they were cheap, and they do the trick. I have braces that require flossing. They help me to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the OralB floss threaders, which I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore. I saw these, which were really cheap, and I actually like them a lot better. They are made of a stronger plastic and have a curve to them, which make it a lot easier to get under the bridge in the back of my mouth. I will definitely continue buying these (even if they restock the Oral B ones again).</li>
    <li> I have a bridge and want to take care of it.  This threader is very good and makes it much easier for me to floss the bridge.  It is far better than the type of flosser that comes with a strand of floss attached.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described and received it quickly!</li>
    <li> The picture is not the threaders I thought they were.  The threader is very hard plastics and cut my gums the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me some of these threaders over 20 years ago.  I tried the ones available in the stores, but found them too long and more difficult to use.  These are like a plastic needle, very compact and easy to thread.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> They work the best for me</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> First of all, the item&#x27;s picture confused me so I had to return it.  I believe the reason why they changed the product picture now.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they charged me $10 when I returned the item.  There was a small tear on top of the box when I opened the box and they called damaged and they charged me $ 10. I don&#x27;t believe that the small paper box would cost $10.</li>
