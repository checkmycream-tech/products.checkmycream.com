      <li>best of all, I mix with brown sugar and a little grapeseed oil, rub on my face as an exfoliant, rinse and ...magic.</li>
      <li>Great for soaking in the tub along with some essential oils.</li>

      <li>It really is amazing how soft it makes your skin right away.  </li>
      <li>I mix it with essential oils and the feeling is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Have made several DIY skin care product with this and loving the results.</li>
      <li>The skin is now healthy looking and the scales are almost completely gone.  </li>
      <li>I normally take showers, but now I also try to take a relaxing bath in the salts prior to bed for relief and a good nites sleep.  </li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t do anything special</li>
      <li>I took a bath for the first time in my life (always shower) and now, nobody can get me out of my tub.</li>
      <li>I made my first bath salts ever yesterday.</li>
      <li>Over time old acne scars have  lightened up and my skin is baby smooth</li>
      <li>Delivery was on time, and the product was exactly what was described.</li>
      <li>I have Psoriasis, on my first try I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>It also cleared up a hot spot on his hip.  </li>
      <li>Burns when used as a scrub at first but skin is healing and it does not burn when applied anymore.</li>
      <li>She has been using it for hot baths.  </li>
      <li>I noticed results from the first application.</li>
      <li>I had shaved his belly and chest and had used a chlorhexidine and phytosphingosine salicyloyl shampoo which works pretty good, but I have to shampoo the area for several days in a row, and the area was still red and scaly.  </li>
      <li>We have had continued good service from Natural Planet and some of their other products.</li>
      <li>I buy this often, very softening.</li>
      <li>Having never done it before I could not see 1 cup of salt absorbing some color and fragrance.</li>
      <li>Seems to be helping much</li>
      <li>salts work like mineral or epsom salts and are very relaxing in  bath.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>If you do keep and use this in your shower area, make sure to seal the bag as the salt will clump up due to moisture in the room.</li>
      <li>I soaked in the bath several times and it has helped with the psoriasis and also gives me temporary relief from the itching bug bites and my skin started feeling softer right after the first bath.  </li>
      <li>Currently can&#x27;t live w/o it!</li>

      <li>Works great makes my 82 year old hands feel like a babies behind</li>
      <li>It really works I have tried everything from natural remedies to medical creams for my Dermatitis on face and</li>
      <li>I used it for my son&#x27;s eczema, and it has already started to clear up.</li>
      <li>The minerals are all natural and just revive your skin.</li>
      <li>My hands were as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making a product that’s natural with out side effects.</li>
      <li>I took a bath using 1 cup and my skin is so soft</li>
      <li>I usually use epsom salts, but this product has several minerals instead of just one, so it should work better for soreness.</li>
      <li>I use this to calm my severe psoriasis down.</li>
      <li>It only took 1 treatment with the dead sea salt to make a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Really helps alleviate dry, itchy, winter skin.</li>
      <li>I am also going to soak my hands in the dead sea salt solution which are sore with mild arthritis and overuse.  </li>
      <li>This is not the first product I have used from the Dead Sea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have arthritis and purchased this product to put in order to add it to my bath and soak.  It works wonders, albeit only in the short term.  But at this point, any relief is welcome relief.  I recommend this produce to relieve chronic aches and pains, if only for a few hours - at least you can get a decent night&#x27;s sleep, and if you have pain like I do you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Basic dead sea salt.  Fine grain, worked as desired.</li>
    <li> just started using for a daily soap on scalp to help get rid of rash in hair.  Seems to be helping much</li>
    <li> The stuff is awesome! Helps dry scalp and dry skin. Nice soak too.</li>
    <li> Works great for making bath salts!</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered.I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the top pf the zipper bag unzipped and I lost some. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Delivery was on time, and the product was exactly what was described. I used it for my son&#x27;s eczema, and it has already started to clear up. It is great for dry skin in the winter and for relaxing muscles post workout. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product !! Dead Sea Salt baths aid in recovery post long runs, long workouts..love it !!</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I ordered it on Monday and it came on Thursday. I took a bath using 1 cup and my skin is so soft and I feel so relaxed! Great product, I am a loyal customer now!</li>
    <li> Works great makes my 82 year old hands feel like a babies behind</li>
    <li> someone suggested a bath with one cup of sea salt and one cup of Epsom salt and eucalyptus.  I just melted right into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Great for sore muscles or just plain tired and worn out.</li>
    <li> This is a very good skin softening agent. I was walking through the mall and a store clerk stopped me and invited me into his store to try this amazing product. He had me rub my hands together and wash them. My hands were as soft as a baby&#x27;s. He told me that it was because of the dead sea salts. I was sold until he told me that the jar was 150.00. So I cam home and did my research and made it myself for less than 26 ...and much more product. I mix it with castor oil, almond oil and grapeseed , rub my hands together as in an effort to exfoliate/ scrub, then wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;The salts work like mineral or epsom salts and are very relaxing in  bath.&lt;br /&gt;But best of all, I mix with brown sugar and a little grapeseed oil, rub on my face as an exfoliant, rinse and ...magic. My face was so soft and beautiful. Over time old acne scars have  lightened up and my skin is baby smooth</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes me feel once I&#x27;ve gotten out of the bath.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my psoriasis, but when I got it I was also suffering from mosquito and fire ant bites.  I soaked in the bath several times and it has helped with the psoriasis and also gives me temporary relief from the itching bug bites and my skin started feeling softer right after the first bath.  I normally take showers, but now I also try to take a relaxing bath in the salts prior to bed for relief and a good nites sleep.  It really is amazing how soft it makes your skin right away.  Will definately continue this product.</li>
    <li> Used this for making body scrubs for my friends.  Worked beautifully</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife.  She has been using it for hot baths.  She said it dissolves very fast and feels wonderful on the muscles.&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely be purchasing more.  As far as the product, delivery was on time and product was as expected and noted on the product description.  We have had continued good service from Natural Planet and some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Great product.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Great for psoriasis wow</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything special</li>
    <li> love this stuff great when making body scrubs or even just adding it to your bath to soak in.</li>
    <li> I buy this often, very softening.</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis, on my first try I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  I will be ordering more.  Thank you for making a product that’s natural with out side effects.</li>
    <li> Essential for my eczema tsw skin! Currently can&#x27;t live w/o it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Really helps alleviate dry, itchy, winter skin.</li>
    <li> Have made several DIY skin care product with this and loving the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for psoriasis.  My son takes showers instead of baths so uses it in a spray bottle.  He adds a few tablespoons in water to dissolve and sprays on his skin and lets it dry.  The price is great as he was paying about $10 for a 12 ounce container from our local health supplier.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make DIY home and beauty products!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! It really works I have tried everything from natural remedies to medical creams for my Dermatitis on face and the Dead sea salt helps. I noticed results from the first application. It was to coarse so I put in hand blender to make smaller made a paste of raw honey &amp; dead sea salt and applied to skin...lets just say this stuff is healing my skin :) I&#x27;am very pleased</li>
    <li> Great for soaking in the tub along with some essential oils.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering this. It is a good quality of sea salt. I am seeing dramatic effects on psoriasis I have had for 20 years. Burns when used as a scrub at first but skin is healing and it does not burn when applied anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what they say it is. Have used this a lot for scalp issues (Seborreic Dermatitus). It does not, &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; the condition. Can&#x27;t say it even helps it in any significant or measurable fashion. It can be an alternative to shampoos and all the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; they contain but I would suggest it may not be in your best interests to use this every day as I have seen my hair become more dry with increased fall-out but that can be age, season and condition related; not sure. I&#x27;m not a fan of the packaging as its just a thicker baggie type thing with the line inside the groove sealing which is a minor inconvenience. If you do keep and use this in your shower area, make sure to seal the bag as the salt will clump up due to moisture in the room. I&#x27;ve used two products like this. They seem to be the same.</li>
    <li> Boy am I pleased. I bought the Sea Salts to treat my grand daughter&#x27;s eczema but when I learned that is good to relieve stress I filled the tub and jumped in it. I took a bath for the first time in my life (always shower) and now, nobody can get me out of my tub. I mix it with essential oils and the feeling is AMAZING. I will not stop purchasing this salts.</li>
    <li> I use this to calm my severe psoriasis down. It helps with the symptom of itching, flaking, and redness It does dry my skin a little, so I use moisturizing after soaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my dog&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis.  He had a terrible flareup a couple days before I ordered this product.  I had shaved his belly and chest and had used a chlorhexidine and phytosphingosine salicyloyl shampoo which works pretty good, but I have to shampoo the area for several days in a row, and the area was still red and scaly.  I dissolved the dead sea salt in water and used a wash cloth to create a wet compress.  It only took 1 treatment with the dead sea salt to make a huge difference.  The skin is now healthy looking and the scales are almost completely gone.  There is still one area that he has been bothering, so I will treat that again.  It also cleared up a hot spot on his hip.  I am very happy with this product.  I am also going to soak my hands in the dead sea salt solution which are sore with mild arthritis and overuse.  I usually use epsom salts, but this product has several minerals instead of just one, so it should work better for soreness.</li>
    <li> Use in bath for help with eczema</li>
    <li> Nice except I didn&#x27;t float in my bathtub.</li>
    <li> Good product. Doing salt soaks on the advice of my dermatologist for a wound -- it&#x27;s effective!</li>
    <li> I made my first bath salts ever yesterday. Having never done it before I could not see 1 cup of salt absorbing some color and fragrance. It worked perfectly and everyone who has seen them think they are fantastic. This is not the first product I have used from the Dead Sea. The minerals are all natural and just revive your skin.</li>
    <li> I used a cup each of this, Dead Sea salts and baking soda for a detox bath. It was wonderful! I will buy more.</li>
