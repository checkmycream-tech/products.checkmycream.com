      <li>Fortunately I haven&#x27;t seen most of those folks in a while</li>
      <li>and I received it yesterday 10/2, so it came very quickly.</li>
      <li>when I saw the case, it&#x27;s really nice, but on the fifth finger of the first use of one of the clippers, it broke.</li>

      <li>It would fit easily in a suitcase or pocket.  </li>
      <li>the instruments worked fine.  </li>
      <li>She has had it for almost a year now and still thinks it is very nice - especially the cuticle cutter which is very sharp and works perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I bought the deluxe stainless steel one from Lighthouse.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to contact them to send me the finger nail clippers, instead of returning the whole set.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made manicure set.</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;ll probably have to answer for a cheap gift.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturer and distributor of this product should really rethink this Deluxe Manicure Set..</li>
      <li>I was excited</li>
      <li>I am keeping this kit just for purposes of making fun of it to all of my friends and maybe my daughter can have it after I purchase some more clippers and the fun of</li>
      <li>They are very light weight and stainless steel.</li>
      <li>This kit comes with a nice array of tools that are sturdy, sharp, and nice looking with satin finish.</li>
      <li>My wife deserves better than this, I went to the store and bought all of Sally Hansen manicure and pedicure items and put them in a real leather case I found at Hobby Lobby.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>Not sure it should have &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; in its name, but the components are good quality and the price is nice.  </li>
      <li>The file wears out quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty set.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised!  </li>
      <li>The New Stainless Steel Deluxe Manicure Set by The Lighthouse was a gift for one of our daughters.</li>
      <li>worth the money.</li>
      <li>The case is nice, but I&#x27;ve already had to replace several items that have fallen apart.  </li>
      <li>The blades for the cutters are very sharp and he loved it.  </li>
      <li>The manicure set is nice and offers a complete variety of tools.</li>
      <li>This item made a great Xmas present or stocking stuffer last year.  </li>
      <li>She leaves the set in her desk at work as several of her office mates have used it and are just as pleased as she is with the set.</li>
      <li>Am returning this and will look at my local beauty supply for a better quality kit.</li>
      <li>Maybe re-name it to \\&quot;Almost OK for Your Teenage Daughter</li>
      <li>First off, I recieved my manicure set which I purchased for my wife for Christmas</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your good money on this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the set for over one year, and the tools are just as sharp and effective as the day I first got them.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the heavy duty design and the leather case it came in</li>
      <li>They do fall out of the leather loops easily when the case is open.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something exactly like this kit and aside from the cheap instruments then kit is solid.</li>
      <li>: the large clipper trimmed my thickest toenail without difficulty.</li>
      <li>It is very compact and usable.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your product that was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I was very embarrassed.</li>
      <li>The scissors are pretty sharp and the tweezers are ok but the quality of the pieces reminds me of a \\&quot;stainless\\&quot; kitchen utensil set I bought at the dollar store for my dorm room in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought several of these for my male family members and all of them love the set.  </li>
      <li>I transplanted some decent manicure tools in it</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and clip nails with a smooth cut.  </li>
      <li>We bought 2 - as we live on 2 islands and hates to pay to check a bag each time to carry it with him.</li>
      <li>He likes both sizes of the normal shaped clippers, not side angled.... and the box is relatively small and handsome.  </li>
      <li>I finally returned the whole set and my search for a decent manicure set continues.  </li>
      <li>There is truth to the old adage:  </li>
      <li>Pops right back open.</li>
      <li>Everything seemed sharp, and tight fitting.  </li>
      <li>I can barely shut it.  </li>
      <li>... seems kind of cheesy to me.</li>
      <li>Worst part is that based on the first two months of good use, I got a few more to give away as gifts.  </li>
      <li>As a man who&#x27;s never really followed a regimen, the identiy and proper use of the various tools were a bit bewildering at first.</li>
      <li>Seriously, for the price, or really even for 75% off the price you would be paying too much.</li>
      <li>I guess the &#x27;stainless&#x27; steal in the name is emphasizing the &#x27;less&#x27; part.&lt;br</li>

    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband.  He was very impressed with the quality of the stainless steel.  The blades for the cutters are very sharp and he loved it.  I would highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!  Great kit</li>
    <li> I bought this manicure set for my wife and she loves it.  It is very compact and usable. What more can I say, eh?</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard before I settled on this for my husbands Christmas stocking stuffer - and I made out like a bandit!  This ended up being my hubands favorite gift. The item came to me just like the description said it would. A very nice box container and not to mention the awesome little case for all the tools.  They are very light weight and stainless steel. Great value for my money!I would buy this all over again!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. This kit comes with a nice array of tools that are sturdy, sharp, and nice looking with satin finish. Definitely, a complete set... at least as far as I&#x27;m concerned. The tools themselves deserve 5 stars, however I have to deduct 2 for the case since it is imperative that the tools remain together in a dependable case... this case, however, does not stay closed. I have fiddled around with the clasp to try to tilt it and bend it to hold closed... nope. Pops right back open. The case has a nice leather feel and appearance, but unfortunately, appearance doesn&#x27;t mean as much as functionality in this case. The pieces also move around and don&#x27;t stay in place which is a bad combination with not staying closed. Maybe it&#x27;s just mine. I don&#x27;t know... but that part is a little disappointing. Guess I&#x27;ll be securing it with rubber bands... seems kind of cheesy to me.</li>
    <li> The implements in this set are good for the price and the case looks nice. They do fall out of the leather loops easily when the case is open.</li>
    <li> First off, I recieved my manicure set which I purchased for my wife for Christmas and I was confused because it didn&#x27;t have any clippers in the case. No fingernail clippers, no toenail clippers, just a set of diagonal clippers which I still haven&#x27;t figured out the purpose for.. The second thing I noticed was that the case didn&#x27;t close or open properly because the cheapo clasp is missing a part that forces the button to spring back into place. The scissors are pretty sharp and the tweezers are ok but the quality of the pieces reminds me of a \\&quot;stainless\\&quot; kitchen utensil set I bought at the dollar store for my dorm room in the early 90&#x27;s. The blade on the file is almost smooth which is obviously frustrating to say the least, it&#x27;s like the cutting blade on the file making machine was dull that day or something. Seriously, for the price, or really even for 75% off the price you would be paying too much. The manufacturer and distributor of this product should really rethink this Deluxe Manicure Set.. Maybe re-name it to \\&quot;Almost OK for Your Teenage Daughter If You Go Buy Toenail and Fingernail Clippers Separately Manicure Set\\&quot; and drop the price of course. My wife deserves better than this, I went to the store and bought all of Sally Hansen manicure and pedicure items and put them in a real leather case I found at Hobby Lobby. Now that is what I expect and what my wife deserves. Don&#x27;t buy this garbage!!! I am keeping this kit just for purposes of making fun of it to all of my friends and maybe my daughter can have it after I purchase some more clippers and the fun of anti-marketing runs its course.</li>
    <li> Prior to owning this kit, I had the same nail kit for almost 10 years.  Within 2 months of buying this kit -- of only light use -- the weld on the nail file had broken, separating the handle from the tool.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for well over a year now and still love it. The quality in the pieces here are top-notch. The case is wonderful. This product really has that &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; feel to it where you feel like the pieces were all built with great craftsmanship and care. Everything feels solid and durable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. When the recipient opened it, it was missing the nail clipper and the latch on the case was defective, preventing it from closing. I was very embarrassed. If I could rate it zero, I would.</li>
    <li> Great product! It is sharp, durable even with tough nails.  Small case (which is what I wanted) that fits all the stuff I need.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I saw the case, it&#x27;s really nice, but on the fifth finger of the first use of one of the clippers, it broke. I haven&#x27;t even have these open for 24 hours. I&#x27;m disappointed, it&#x27;s gardening season and I like to keep my nails cleaned up. Am returning this and will look at my local beauty supply for a better quality kit.</li>
    <li> I got this and was a little worried that it might be flimsy.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn&#x27;t to bad at all.  Everything seemed sharp, and tight fitting.  The metal was the same type and quality as any of my other clippers I have owned.  I ordered the set in the snap case and it is perfect for the job.  It is about the size of a checkbook, maybe a little thicker.  It would fit easily in a suitcase or pocket.  For the price it makes a great gift, or a nice treat for yourself.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made manicure set. Nail clippers broke after a few uses. Was unable to return item for refund.  Don&#x27;t waste your good money on this.  There is truth to the old adage:  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these as gifts and everyone loved them I don&#x27;t know what all these tools due, but my kids seemed to know.</li>
    <li> I purchased this manicure ste include in my get-out-quick bag.  Quick review, items appear nicely constructed and the case is very nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  The quality is good and I was impressed with the workmanship.  However, one of the items was missing and replaced with another.  The picture on the box shows three sets of nail clippers in the set.  When we received the set the finger nail clippers were missing and in its place was another tool, its purpose and use not quite clear.  I was very, very disappointed.  A manicure set is incomplete without a set of finger nail clippers.  Adding to the disappointment was the fact that the seller could not be contacted via Amazon.  I would have liked to contact them to send me the finger nail clippers, instead of returning the whole set.  I finally returned the whole set and my search for a decent manicure set continues.  I&#x27;m giving it one star because of the missing clippers, the seller is not contactable via Amazon and having to return it due to their error</li>
    <li> Looks better than it is.  Works great for a while, but then it starts to fall apart.  The nail clipper broke in half while using them about 6 months in.  This was supposed to clip my nails, not the other way around!  Worst part is that based on the first two months of good use, I got a few more to give away as gifts.  Fortunately I haven&#x27;t seen most of those folks in a while or I&#x27;ll probably have to answer for a cheap gift.  I guess the &#x27;stainless&#x27; steal in the name is emphasizing the &#x27;less&#x27; part.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend, unless, of course, you want to give it as a gift during secret santa or whatever so that it can&#x27;t be traced back to you.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my sister as a gift. I was very pleased with the heavy duty design and the leather case it came in was very stylish. I was not completely sure what all of the \\&quot;tools\\&quot; are for, but they are all well made and look like they should last a life time.</li>
    <li> The quality and the color of the holder were not as pictured.  I returned it.  :-( Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Not sure it should have &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; in its name, but the components are good quality and the price is nice.  Good practical set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: the large clipper trimmed my thickest toenail without difficulty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these for my male family members and all of them love the set.  The girls in the family are often stealing them from them!</li>
    <li> The New Stainless Steel Deluxe Manicure Set by The Lighthouse was a gift for one of our daughters. She has had it for almost a year now and still thinks it is very nice - especially the cuticle cutter which is very sharp and works perfectly. She leaves the set in her desk at work as several of her office mates have used it and are just as pleased as she is with the set.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start taking better care of my nails, but didn&#x27;t want to pay a ton of money. So, I got this set. It&#x27;s great, all of the items are of excellent quality and easy to use. The case is very nice, vinyl, not leather. But, at this price it&#x27;s fine. The case does have an nicely embossed finish making it look leather like. As a man who&#x27;s never really followed a regimen, the identiy and proper use of the various tools were a bit bewildering at first. So, I just did some diligent web searching to identify and use the various items. I&#x27;ve had the set for over one year, and the tools are just as sharp and effective as the day I first got them.</li>
    <li> just what I needed. worth the money. still using a year later, nothing broken or lost</li>
    <li> It was hard to find a set a man would like with ALL the pieces.  He likes the small sizzors which are hard to find in a complete set.  He likes both sizes of the normal shaped clippers, not side angled.... and the box is relatively small and handsome.  The perfect find.  We bought 2 - as we live on 2 islands and hates to pay to check a bag each time to carry it with him.</li>
    <li> We returned this item-the case looked much nicer in the picture and the tools did not appear to be very good quality for the money.</li>
    <li> The manicure set is nice and offers a complete variety of tools. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it appears to be of good quality and the tools are made out of steel. The only problem i had was trying to get the case to close, I had to reorganize them a bit, but i got it to work. I would recommend as the quality was great for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty set. But I wouldn&#x27;t call it quality.  The case is nice, but I&#x27;ve already had to replace several items that have fallen apart.  But what do you expect for the price?</li>
    <li> I had a manicure kit that was with me for years but it fell apart and I canned it. I was looking for something exactly like this kit and aside from the cheap instruments then kit is solid. I transplanted some decent manicure tools in it and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> i found all of the tools in this kit to be poorly made and unusable.  the clippers just twist sideways in my hand instead of clipping a nail.  nice looking case though.</li>
    <li> This item made a great Xmas present or stocking stuffer last year.  I was a little skeptical since I thought the price was kind of low for a manicure set.  However, when they arrived (I purchased 2 sets) I was very impressed.  The case was very nice and suitable for a man or woman and the instruments worked fine.  They are sharp and clip nails with a smooth cut.  My only complaint is that after a while one of the leather strips that holds the cuticle cutter came off on one side.  The stitching came loose and I don&#x27;t see any way to attach it again.  But all in all this is a dynamite manicure set for the money.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> I can barely shut it.  The items keep falling out of their holding spots and fall out when I open it.  The file wears out quickly</li>
    <li> My mom asked for a manicure set and I bought the deluxe stainless steel one from Lighthouse. I gave it to my mom for her birthday and she loved it. The tools were sturdy and nicely made. The case was also very nice. I wasn&#x27;t suppose to receive it until 10/4 and I received it yesterday 10/2, so it came very quickly. We look forward to many years of use. Thank you for your product that was reasonably priced.</li>
