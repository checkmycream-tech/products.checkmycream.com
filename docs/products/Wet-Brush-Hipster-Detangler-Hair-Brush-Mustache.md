    <li> I recommend these brushes all the time.  I actually opened my mouth to recommend these to my stylist, and then he pulled one out himself to detangle my hair.  They&#x27;re that good!  My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  I have every bathroom stocked with these.</li>

It had a slight burnt rubber smell but after reaching out to Wet Brush, they gave me a few tips to get rid of the scent. I use this brush on a daily basis. Will buy again!</li>
