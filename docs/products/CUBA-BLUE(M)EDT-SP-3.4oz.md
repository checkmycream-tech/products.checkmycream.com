      <li>and I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
      <li>for being a fragrance for men is pretty much good for women also.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this cologne, Cuba colognes are fantastic, affordable, cool bottles and</li>
      <li>Packaging is very cool and unique as well</li>
      <li>I also got the free shipping for purchase over 25$ and the product arrived within the promised time.</li>
      <li>And the original product.</li>
      <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
      <li>Found this originally at a flea market.</li>
      <li>but at this price i am just going to order some more and apply more frequently..</li>
      <li>Reminds of a citrus type smell, kind of like CK1 back in the day, but with a newer, refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>This one was our favorite, so I turned right around and ordered the big bottle for my fiance.  </li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price.</li>
      <li>The delivery was very fast and the product exacly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>He firstly like the casing of the perfume.</li>
      <li>Different than most perfumes where they just come in a square bottle and box.</li>
      <li>its funny that a friend of mine also told me that she loves it and wears it also.</li>
      <li>The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future.</li>
      <li>but this is the one I love the most, came in a timely meaner and the it last for a long time.</li>
      <li>Not overly strong but definitely a manly cologne.</li>
      <li>Lavender and tobacco notes at the beginning seem promising.</li>
      <li>I really like the packaging too.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent above Penguin Rocks, Curve Mambo, Ralph Lauren Chaps, and Tuscany (old formula).</li>
      <li>Nothing masculine about this cologne at all.</li>
      <li>CERTAINLY NOT TOO HEAVY, JUST RIGHT GREAT FOR WORK, CASUAL OR</li>

<li> Nauseating artificial floral scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price this is a steal. People will think you&#x27;re using a much more expensive perfume from a bigger brand. I&#x27;ve even ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Was a gitst from me to my uncle. He firstly like the casing of the perfume. When he opened it, he was amazed by the fragrance!</li>
    <li> Found this originally at a flea market. It works well with my husbands smell. Last all day without having to reapply. Not overly strong but definitely a manly cologne. I love it. Good size bottle, lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
    <li> The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future. I personally like all of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased. The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price. Packaging is very cool and unique as well and it&#x27;s compliments my perfumery/cologne display collection.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent for approx. 11$.. I also got the free shipping for purchase over 25$ and the product arrived within the promised time.</li>
    <li> Smells good for about an hour. .. and it&#x27;s gone. Even after a dozen sprays directly on me no one can smell it at all by the time I get to work. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I got this for my spouse as a xmas gift. he likes it and I love the way it smells. the smell stays on, doesnt fade as the day goes on. smells like you just sprayed it on.</li>
    <li> It hard for me to find this one in local stores in Houston Tx, I only find the gold one but this is the one I love the most, came in a timely meaner and the it last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller very fast. And the original product. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is a great deal for the amount of spray for the price. I wear this every day.</li>
    <li> Bought last year as a gift for a teen. I&#x27;m not familiar with the product and went with the reviews. Very good product - smells really nice and is inexpensive ($10.36 March 2013). I really like the packaging too. Different than most perfumes where they just come in a square bottle and box. One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given. Will be giving these away again this year.</li>
    <li> great smell, great price...the scent doesnt last forever but at this price i am just going to order some more and apply more frequently..very.happy with overall transaction and product</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this, she loves it. i also use it once in a while. its funny that a friend of mine also told me that she loves it and wears it also. for being a fragrance for men is pretty much good for women also.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. I had seen this some place else and when I found it on Amazon I was delighted. The delivery was very fast and the product exacly what I wanted. I will reorder when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Reminds of a citrus type smell, kind of like CK1 back in the day, but with a newer, refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Nauseating artificial floral scent. Lavender and tobacco notes at the beginning seem promising. Unfortunately it quickly fades into something slightly sour (not fruity), and finally dries down to a weak and fake-smelling vanilla musk (odor almost similar to burnt plastic). Nothing masculine about this cologne at all. Smells like something an amateur perfumist would make by mixing household cosmetics. Absolutely love the bottle and packaging though!</li>
    <li> GREAT SCENT, NOT TOO LIGHT AND CERTAINLY NOT TOO HEAVY, JUST RIGHT GREAT FOR WORK, CASUAL OR A NIGHT OUT.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cologne, Cuba colognes are fantastic, affordable, cool bottles and all of them smell AWESOME!  I bought my husband every kind they offer! I recommend this to any  guy out there!</li>
    <li> I ordered a smaller bottle of this at Christmas for him that came with other Cuba scents as well. This one was our favorite, so I turned right around and ordered the big bottle for my fiance.  It smells absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent above Penguin Rocks, Curve Mambo, Ralph Lauren Chaps, and Tuscany (old formula). To me it smells like vanilla, leather, tobacco with hints of sugar cookie. This is a scent I  spray on my wrist and smell again and again. It has a calming, pleasurable effect on me.</li>
