      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY the right answer!!!</li>
      <li>but if you clean it good with the brush</li>
      <li>Pretty good...definitely not as great as they say...</li>

      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love the results</li>
      <li>THIS WORKS MUCH BETTER...</li>
      <li>but I said I will give  this one a shot because the foot cream promotion and its rechargeable  device and definitely  it is so much better than what I got before it has  much more power to it,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought her the rechargeable one I think it is way better than AA  battery ones&lt;</li>
      <li>Seems to work okay.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried for many years to find a product that truly works.  </li>
      <li>,this nature tech company really awesome my mother always try to find a solution for her dry feet</li>
      <li>Great product - it arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>it makes it a special gift :))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and clean</li>
      <li>you for the free foot cream that comes with the kit</li>
      <li>It works great and will definitely help my callous problem.</li>
      <li>My feet looks fantastic after just three uses.</li>
      <li>Worth the month and saves on a pedicure cost!  </li>
      <li>love this, my heels feel so much smoother.</li>
      <li>Fast Prime shipping and seems to be well made and able to do what it was made for.</li>
      <li>If you are getting a lot of dead skin off be sure to stop and brush it off good (inside and out).  </li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Sanding is adequate.</li>
      <li>It seems well made, the motor is quiet and it stores nicely in the original box.</li>
      <li>He was very pleased with this present.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to have smooth feet...</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price to have a rechargeable instead of buying batteries.</li>
      <li>ITS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM AND VERY CONVENIENT</li>
      <li>I would certainly add my 5 stars!  </li>
      <li>I am very much liking this product.  </li>
      <li>I would keep a little brush handy also to clean off the revolving stone, and your skin.</li>
      <li>Finally dry feet solution  device that really works&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day as a gift she loved it so much</li>
      <li>I tried the product and it works exactly how I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>Also the AC charger get really hot during charge</li>
      <li>so I overdid it the first time.</li>
      <li>Used this electric shaver once and found my heals to be so much better the next day after having applied some lotion on them before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
      <li>First time using  callus remover and my husband</li>
      <li>Not me (once a month is my splurge) but this handy little tool just works</li>
      <li>AND IT WAS FAST RESOLVED ....</li>
      <li>Seems to be well made and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>THANKS...</li>
      <li>Replacement heads are reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Does removed the dead skins fairly, however the one I received is NOT NEW.  </li>
      <li>I was under the impression I purchased a new item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always summer in FL which means I basically live in sandals and flip flops so my feet should look decent when I go out in public.  </li>
      <li>The item I received has clearly been used.</li>
      <li>I have used it so far on fingers, toes and heels.</li>
      <li>Just remember to be patient especially if you have a really cracked feet .</li>
      <li>The rotation is just fast enough so heat is not generated from friction.</li>
      <li>I think I lost 5 pounds of dead skin on my first use</li>
      <li>The first thing I did when I got home a few days later was to order</li>
      <li>I have hammertoe, and it has been extremely useful to grind down those rough areas.</li>
      <li>so you can imagine how my feet  looks,and after using this thing a few times the results are incredible , you should use slow circular motion on the dry area of your feet and not to press too hard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Well I have tried everything for my feet and this is AWESOME!!! It got the job done in no time and my hands never got tired from trying to file my heels...I would recommend this to anyone that wants to have smooth feet...</li>
    <li> JUST RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL AND USED IT ALREADY...THE  PEDI CALLAS REMOVER WORKS PERFECTLY...HAD NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER...ITS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM AND VERY CONVENIENT TOO...I USE TO USE THAT SORT OF HAND SCARPER AND USING MANUAL HAND LABOR...THIS WORKS MUCH BETTER...AND NO BATTERIES...WHICH IS JUST GREAT...GLAD I  PURCHASE THIS PEDI DRY SKIN REMOVER...THANKS...</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED....I HAD A PROBLEM..AND IT WAS FAST RESOLVED .... NO WORRY.,,, EXCELLENT AFTER SALE SERVICE. MY SISTERS NEEDS TO HAVE ONE TOO.</li>
    <li> Liked this product. Holds a charge a really long time. Sanding is adequate.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son, since his feet get so rough in the summer.  One year, a great patch of skin came off his heel (OUCH!), so I didn&#x27;t want this to happen again!  He was very pleased with this present.  I also got some Nature Tech Pedi- refills of another color, so his wife can use the callus remover, too.  Both of them were very happy for this great gift.</li>
    <li> Works well. I have used it so far on fingers, toes and heels. Removes loose skin and rounds out calluses. I have hammertoe, and it has been extremely useful to grind down those rough areas. I got the same results with this that I got from going to the foot doctor. Be careful though of the warning to only use it a couple of seconds on each area, as I have burned myself in a few spots. I would keep a little brush handy also to clean off the revolving stone, and your skin. The picture shows that you can rinse it under water, but I personally would not try this. Why take a chance?  It came at least partially charged, and I have used it a dozen or so times and not had to recharge it yet.</li>
    <li> Works well! Made my feet so soft!love it!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression I purchased a new item. The item I received has clearly been used. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> Had rough dry heals that pumice stone would not remove . Used this electric shaver once and found my heals to be so much better the next day after having applied some lotion on them before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this along with refill rollers for my wife. She has used it a couple of times and is very satisfied with it. Seems to be well made and the price is reasonable. Will file another review after she/we have used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew these existed sooner.  This is what I have needed.  I opened it up and it was already charged, so I immediately tested it out and was highly impressed.</li>
    <li> Pretty good...definitely not as great as they say...</li>
    <li> I bought from a different company a very similar product looking but I said I will give  this one a shot because the foot cream promotion and its rechargeable  device and definitely  it is so much better than what I got before it has  much more power to it,  I&#x27;m a man and im going a lot to the beach to surf so you can imagine how my feet  looks,and after using this thing a few times the results are incredible , you should use slow circular motion on the dry area of your feet and not to press too hard let the machine do the work Love it</li>
    <li> Does what it says. feet look great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always summer in FL which means I basically live in sandals and flip flops so my feet should look decent when I go out in public.  Who can afford pedicures every week?  Not me (once a month is my splurge) but this handy little tool just works so well my tootsies look like they&#x27;re getting spa attention!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and clean - I wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> Seems to work okay. My feet are pretty bad so it took a few sessions to make a difference. I think the before/after pictures are exaggerated. Definitely worth the price to have a rechargeable instead of buying batteries. Says that each roller should last a few sessions but if you clean it good with the brush it&#x27;s good for more. If you are getting a lot of dead skin off be sure to stop and brush it off good (inside and out).  Best thing is the wax included - that was an immediate improvement on my feet.</li>
    <li> My husband researched these tools and found this one to have the best reviews. I would certainly add my 5 stars!  It seems well made, the motor is quiet and it stores nicely in the original box. Coming with two grinding wheels we can each have our own; swapping wheels is wick &amp; easy.  My feet looks fantastic after just three uses. Not that they looked that bad up begin with  ;)</li>
    <li> Very excellent gadget!  Works great.  Follow the directions, let the machine do the work, do not press.  Replacement heads are reasonable.  Worth the month and saves on a pedicure cost!  The rotation is just fast enough so heat is not generated from friction.</li>
    <li> Does removed the dead skins fairly, however the one I received is NOT NEW.  It got black/old stains on machine AND the roller.  Also the AC charger get really hot during charge don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Very good price for this upgraded item plus Amazon had a discount cut and clip coupon too. Fast Prime shipping and seems to be well made and able to do what it was made for. No issues here.</li>
    <li> First time using  callus remover and my husband and I love it!</li>
    <li> I think I lost 5 pounds of dead skin on my first use lol.  My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in years.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have a problem with cracked feet this product is a must !!! You can start noticing the difference with just a couple of uses. Just remember to be patient especially if you have a really cracked feet . I like to do 10 min sessions on each feet everyday just don&#x27;t over do it because it can be painful ! You&#x27;ll love the results</li>
    <li> I suffer with really dry skin on my feet and I&#x27;ve tried for many years to find a product that truly works.  Be it creams, lotions, scrapers, oils, etc.  I was visiting my family and my granddaughter had this electric callus remover.  I tried it and immediately realized the difference it made.  The first thing I did when I got home a few days later was to order one.&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY the right answer!!!</li>
    <li> I am very much liking this product.  It does exactly what it says it will.  It was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I only just got this item, so I can not give it a five star rating yet.  It is however a great callus remover!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time. Packaged nicely. I tried the product and it works exactly how I hoped it would. Excellent! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing, nice design and great quality. It makes the process faster and easier</li>
    <li> Great callus remover, quick delivery and great price!</li>
    <li> This was perfect. My husband gets the worst calluses on his feet. This works perfect.  Also, he works on his knees a lot, this works well on calluses on his knees too.</li>
    <li> love this, my heels feel so much smoother.</li>
    <li> Finally dry feet solution  device that really works&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day as a gift she loved it so much so I had to give this one 5 star good review ,this nature tech company really awesome my mother always try to find a solution for her dry feet she tried everything , but it didn&#x27;t do as a good job and so easy as this one&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m glad I bought her the rechargeable one I think it is way better than AA  battery ones&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get one for myself for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;thank you for the free foot cream that comes with the kit it makes it a special gift :))</li>
    <li> Great product - it arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Will shop with them again!</li>
    <li> worked like it said.  great deal</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great and will definitely help my callous problem.</li>
    <li> Works great. I hate wearing shoes and have paid for it..this is so much better and faster than all the hand tools I&#x27;ve used before. I do agree to go slowly. My feet aren&#x27;t too bad so I overdid it the first time. I have been using it on dry feet and I think I&#x27;ll try it on my feet after soaking or after a shower. Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> i am quite happy with this purchase. it works well and does what I had hoped it would.</li>
