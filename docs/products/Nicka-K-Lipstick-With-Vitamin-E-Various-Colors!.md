    <li> If only there was a way to give no stars. This product not only failed to show up as dark as I had expected, it gave my lips a bright pink stain.

I hope others had a better experience with this product than I.</li>
    <li> The lipstick was purple when I putted on. So it was not what I expect....</li>
    <li> I originally thought this was black but its not even black. When you put it on your lips its a darkish red color, and you really have to build it up. It leaves off a pinkish reddish stain. I use it as a stain now but I&#x27;m upset because I thought it was black...But it smells good..</li>
    <li> Love it it is my color black it is great color I love wearing black it is a beautiful color</li>
