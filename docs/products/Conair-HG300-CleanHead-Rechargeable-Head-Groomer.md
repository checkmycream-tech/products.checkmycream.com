      <li>This razor is amazing !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
      <li>My husband already had one of these for years and loved.  </li>

      <li>This was a good by, I like it,</li>
      <li>yea about time This shaver works I am very happy with results it took two wks for a smooth shave,, 4640</li>
      <li>Not quite but good.</li>
      <li>Nice head buzzer/shaver.</li>
      <li>I bought a Conair and liked the cordless nature</li>
      <li>if you try to wait longer than a day or 2 at the most, you won&#x27;t get good results.</li>
      <li>Does a great job at leaving a clean shaven head.</li>
      <li>My scalp is smooth and feels good -- I don&#x27;t have the nicks, scrapes or sensitivity of a razor shave.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect shape for my hand and trims the head rather quickly, as its width is the perfect balance for the shape of the average head and doing the job</li>
      <li>My husband loves it not to mention the design is easy to use!</li>
      <li>It fits nicely in your hand, easy to use in any angle, and lightweight.</li>
      <li>After spending 30 minutes or more trying to shave my head</li>
      <li>the quality of the shave is better as well in that it gets the hair by all grains</li>
      <li>Another shaver I bought does a much better job.</li>
      <li>and I have a nice, smooth head for the rest of the day.  </li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>..... you can buy this unit, and spend more than an hour shaving your head.</li>
      <li>You must use this every day to look bald,if you go for more than two days without using it,you will have to trim your hair again.</li>
      <li>but I feel like I more than got my money out of this product.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who does not want to use a razor on their head,it will do as it promises,no more or and no less,and it is durable too.</li>
      <li>This is one item that DOES what it says and more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked great so far.</li>
      <li>This has been the most comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>This was my fourth attempt at a good trimer to shave my head and beard and is, by far, the best one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique design was interesting, but execution was aweful.</li>
      <li>is easy and there&#x27;s a brush included).  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m (always) on the lookout for something better but, for now, I&#x27;m quite happy with this device for a daily, full-head shave.</li>
      <li>He does not have much hair to begin with, and this gives a good close comfortable trim.</li>
      <li>It does a decent job for what I need it for, easy to clean, and the charge is good for four days.</li>
      <li>It did not shave my head smooth at all.</li>
      <li>The CleanHead is what it is,an electric shaver for the head,therefore,it won&#x27;t give you a smooth as glass dome,but you can pass for being bald all day,though by the end of the day you will have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t just have a one direction smooth shave.</li>
      <li>, IT MAY TAKE 10 OR 15 MINUTES TO BE COMPLETELY SMOOTH.</li>
      <li>, IT&#x27;S AS SMOOTH</li>
      <li>Best everyday head shaver I have used.  </li>
      <li>I like how comfortable it is to hold and</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good idea to discharge it completey, and recharge it completely every time or else the battery life will be shortened.  </li>
      <li>The first 2-3 shaves were okay</li>
      <li>The manufacturer could improve this by using higher quality, more pliable plastic.</li>
      <li>Would definately recommend the Conair HG300 Clean Head rechargeable razor for clean head shave.</li>
      <li>I picked one of these up on sale last fall in order to be able to cut my own hair.</li>
      <li>I have to clean the razor after each use (taking it apart</li>
      <li>Overall, not that good of a product</li>
      <li>Everyone has a different opinion of what&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>Great little head shaver at a really cheap price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a bit more difficult to clean than many of trimers I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m happy to trade that for all the benefits.</li>
      <li>Not even worthy of returning to the seller.</li>
      <li>so he was very excited to get a new one.</li>
      <li>Gives a pretty close shave, and you can use a razorblade for a clean shine.</li>
      <li>I gave myself a nice baldie that my wife approved of before I left.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty sweet.  </li>
      <li>My old Norelco razor that I used for my face would have done a much better job, but think a Norelco razor gets too close for the scalp.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only thing I can say nice about it.</li>
      <li>Works ok if you use it, at the most, every other day.</li>
      <li>The price was right, especially on sale, and it performed adequately for my needs - touching up a crew cut once a month or so.</li>
      <li>i havent used that attachment enough to know if its really good, but the main purpose of the unit IS fulfilled very well.</li>
      <li>shaver feels good in your hand, pretty easy to use with right and left hands due to the bulbous &amp; symmetrical shape of the handle.</li>
      <li>but after its good just took a little to get use to it.</li>
      <li>When I received it I noticed it was geared more toward African Americans.</li>
      <li>you keep a better scalp as well with fresher skin as opposed to open pores from a razor shave.</li>
      <li>The only concern I have is I have not been able to find replacement blades.</li>
      <li>I realy do, but the first time I droped it the trimer gage that I used the most broke, as I said I like it, but now I have a smaller hair style</li>
      <li>it works pretty darn well.  </li>
      <li>The main problem for me is that by the time I get my head clean, I have too much burn.&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
      <li>Just keep it clean and oiled and works flawlessly so far.</li>
      <li>Actually did an ok job w/o any real burning or anything.</li>
      <li>Fits nice in your hand and has a neat little charging stand.</li>
      <li>he really loves it.</li>
      <li>If I wait 2 days in between shaves, it doesn&#x27;t cut much.</li>
      <li>how much easier it is to ride the contours of my head than the longer handled trimmers.  </li>
      <li>And the thing is, it doesn&#x27;t really shave.</li>
      <li>It works very well for an electric on your head.  </li>
      <li>BUT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL FOR ME</li>
      <li>But the one good thing I found, I was late for work and used it in the car for my face.</li>
      <li>that means you need to start with a clean shave, then use this daily to shave the stubble.</li>
      <li>I can not get a full shave without plugging it back.</li>
      <li>I have been cutting my own hair for many years now.</li>
      <li>but nothing particularly well.</li>
      <li>My husband usually shaves his head with a razor so at first it worked ok</li>
      <li>the main thing to keep in mind is this-it&#x27;s designed to shave stubble.</li>
      <li>I bought this item with high hopes.</li>
      <li>I used to shave my head with Gillette fusion razor great razor but expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This item is supposed to be a bald head shaver. It does not really not do the job, without too much work. Another shaver I bought does a much better job. The main problem for me is that by the time I get my head clean, I have too much burn.&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well on my well trimmed head.  I like how comfortable it is to hold and how much easier it is to ride the contours of my head than the longer handled trimmers.  The problem is the plastic comb attachments broke and there is no place to buy replacements.  The trimmer still works good, I used rubber bands to hold the combs on.  Why did they not design packs of replaceable combs to go with this product?</li>
    <li> Best everyday head shaver I have used.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean. Need to use everyday or every other day or hair gets too long to cut.</li>
    <li> The Cleanhead performed well beyond what I was expecting. Use it daily and have had no problems. Just keep it clean and oiled and works flawlessly so far.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it is the BEST hair trimmer he has ever had.  He does not have much hair to begin with, and this gives a good close comfortable trim.</li>
    <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE LIKE ME AND LIKE TO HAVE A SMOOTH,CLEAN DOME WITHOUT STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR EVERY NIGHT THIS IS FOR YOU. I WAS SKEPTICAL BUT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL FOR ME, IT&#x27;S AS SMOOTH IF NOT SMOOTHER THAN A BLADE. I CAN SIT ON MY COUCH AND WATCH TV WHILE GETTING A CLOSE SHAVE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND BE PATIENT, IT MAY TAKE 10 OR 15 MINUTES TO BE COMPLETELY SMOOTH. IF YOU DO THIS AND USE IT EVERY NIGHT AS RECOMMENDED, I DON&#x27;T THINK YOU&#x27;LL BE DISAPPOINTED. I KNOW I&#x27;M NOT.</li>
    <li> my hubsand loves this to shave his head[[ASIN:B002CJHWCQ Conair HG300 CleanHead? Rechargeable Head Groomer]] this is the second one i bought him. the only bad thing is that there is no replacement blades made for shaver so i had to buy him another. he really loves it.</li>
    <li> The CleanHead is what it is,an electric shaver for the head,therefore,it won&#x27;t give you a smooth as glass dome,but you can pass for being bald all day,though by the end of the day you will have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. You must use this every day to look bald,if you go for more than two days without using it,you will have to trim your hair again. I recommend this product to anyone who does not want to use a razor on their head,it will do as it promises,no more or and no less,and it is durable too.</li>
    <li> Gives a pretty close shave, and you can use a razorblade for a clean shine. Must use everyday to keep close stubs off the head!!!</li>
    <li> yea about time This shaver works I am very happy with results it took two wks for a smooth shave,, 4640</li>
    <li> ...but nothing particularly well. Works ok if you use it, at the most, every other day. If you wait longer than that, it takes FOREVER to shave your head. And the thing is, it doesn&#x27;t really shave. If you look after you finish, there are random hairs that it simply doesn&#x27;t cut and then I have to use a razor to finish the job which defeats the purpose of this item. But the one good thing I found, I was late for work and used it in the car for my face. Actually did an ok job w/o any real burning or anything. Overall, not that good of a product but I guess okfor the price.</li>
    <li> This was my fourth attempt at a good trimer to shave my head and beard and is, by far, the best one.  I love this.  The charge holds longer than any previous one I&#x27;ve used which is a huge plus.  It&#x27;s perfect shape for my hand and trims the head rather quickly, as its width is the perfect balance for the shape of the average head and doing the job quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit more difficult to clean than many of trimers I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m happy to trade that for all the benefits.</li>
    <li> The item is not worth getting. The first 2-3 shaves were okay but after that, it takes foreverrrrrr to trim your head. The angled foils seem like a perk, but it really does not make everything easier or faster because in essence, the unit is really just separating the foils from each other, resulting in a slower shave. My traditional foil shaver (the ones with two sets of parallel foils) actually trimmed my head faster. But even then, that took a long time. I really only got this device because I wanted to avoid the bloody mess of shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the truth... there is really no device that can provide short-cuts or easier methods when it comes shaving your head bald. Nothing will ever beat the results of a traditional straight edge, or double edge razor. I would suggest investing some time to practice the art of shaving with a straight edge, single edge, or double edge razor. Over time, you will actually learn techniques to shave your head faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or..... you can buy this unit, and spend more than an hour shaving your head. lol</li>
    <li> It does a decent job for what I need it for, easy to clean, and the charge is good for four days.</li>
    <li> Great little head shaver at a really cheap price. Fits nice in your hand and has a neat little charging stand. Have to shave every day because it will not cut anything but stubble but convenient enough to do so.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my head (with a razor) for the last 10+ years.  In the last couple of years I&#x27;ve become lazy about it -- letting what hair I have grow out and get sloppy between shaves.  I bought the Conair CleanHead just over a month ago.  The day I got it I put it on to charge and shaved my head with a razor.  Starting the next day and every day (but one) thereafter, I&#x27;ve shaved my head with the Conair using no attachments.  Each morning I spend a few minutes shaving off the prior day&#x27;s stubble and I have a nice, smooth head for the rest of the day.  BUT if I skip a day (only did it once) the shaving time triples or quadruples.  I have to clean the razor after each use (taking it apart is easy and there&#x27;s a brush included).  I sometimes have to touch up tight spots around my ears but not often.  It&#x27;s great for stubble but sometimes misses longer hairs.   My scalp is smooth and feels good -- I don&#x27;t have the nicks, scrapes or sensitivity of a razor shave.  I&#x27;m (always) on the lookout for something better but, for now, I&#x27;m quite happy with this device for a daily, full-head shave.</li>
    <li> Considering the difficulty of removing the foil for cleaning (ridiculously difficult) and the poor performance,  mine went right in the garbage within a week.  What a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
    <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t cut, not powerful. Don&#x27;t buy. Wish I hadn&#x27;t.  Not even worthy of returning to the seller. Awful. Crap</li>
    <li> best head shaver period.</li>
    <li> These days my hairs is falling faster then leaves from a tree in autumn, I hate the blotchy look, so the Conair gets used regularly to get rid of the look I hate. It&#x27;s worked great so far.</li>
    <li> Used it for a few months went back to the electric razor I use for my face.</li>
    <li> This product has to be the most awful product I have ever purchased. It looks good. That&#x27;s the only thing I can say nice about it. Beyond that, it does nothing; it doesn&#x27;t cut. Regardless of what length your hair is, it will not cut what is on your head... or face... or chest. nothing. Please, do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of shavers/hair clippers and this was the worst. It&#x27;s unique design was interesting, but execution was aweful. It did not trim well at all. It did not shave my head smooth at all. It was very very hard to change the head attachments. Really, this is a bad product.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have found. I like to shave my head and am always cutting it. I saw this item and thought I would give it a try. When I received it I noticed it was geared more toward African Americans. The reason I am saying this is due to the pictures on the box. Still I figured nothing ventured.... This is one item that DOES what it says and more. The only concern I have is I have not been able to find replacement blades. I hope it continues to give great service.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with high hopes. It leaves your hair a little patchy. Only buy if you have a trimmer to help even out the patchy areas. Some spots were bald, while others parts werent. I suugest you wash hair before using. My old Norelco razor that I used for my face would have done a much better job, but think a Norelco razor gets too close for the scalp.</li>
    <li> Nice head buzzer/shaver. I have been cutting my own hair for many years now. This has been the most comfortable to use. It fits nicely in your hand, easy to use in any angle, and lightweight. It has a wide blade so you can finish sooner. The 3 blade  settings plus the 3 guides are perfect for doing a buzz fade. The battery charge lasts for a while, usually 3 to 4 buzzing sessions for me. The entire set is also small enough to pack in my suitcase when I travel. BUT...less than a month after I purchased, one of the guides broke. The little tabs that hold it in place while mounted on the unit are gone. They must have broken when I packed them all in a little bag in my suitcase. The manufacturer could improve this by using higher quality, more pliable plastic. Another thing I don&#x27;t like is that the unit will not operate while it is plugged in, so if you lose charge in the middle of a buzzing session you will have to wait. And the batteries completely recharges in several hours. Since the batteries are nickel cadmium it&#x27;s a good idea to discharge it completey, and recharge it completely every time or else the battery life will be shortened.  Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> this item is a godsend in that it will save you so much money that would usually be spent on razors &amp; shaving cream. the quality of the shave is better as well in that it gets the hair by all grains so you don&#x27;t just have a one direction smooth shave. you keep a better scalp as well with fresher skin as opposed to open pores from a razor shave.</li>
    <li> the main thing to keep in mind is this-it&#x27;s designed to shave stubble. that means you need to start with a clean shave, then use this daily to shave the stubble. if you try to wait longer than a day or 2 at the most, you won&#x27;t get good results. this unit does come with a standard blade attachment that is supposed to help if your hair is longer. i havent used that attachment enough to know if its really good, but the main purpose of the unit IS fulfilled very well. shaver feels good in your hand, pretty easy to use with right and left hands due to the bulbous &amp; symmetrical shape of the handle. recommended.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002CJHWCQ Conair HG300 CleanHead? Rechargeable Head Groomer]]Tried once and it worked.  After that it would not turn on.  I followed directions on charging, but the groomer would not run.  I am sending it back!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty sweet.  It works very well for an electric on your head.  Not quite as close as some blades will get, but for touch ups, traveling, driving/shaving, etc... it works pretty darn well.  Good price too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver. On a recent trip I did have to go over my neck and nape with my trimmer clippers again. I bought this product to be the ultimate finisher.  Not quite but good. I gave myself a nice baldie that my wife approved of before I left. ***1/2</li>
    <li> Everyone has a different opinion of what&#x27;s good. Some people think frozen pizza is the best!!! All I know is, I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 years....everyday!!!! THE SAME ONE...it finally will not respond to any maintenance I provide...so this morning I ordered another one. With the same confidence as the first one. Believe me or don&#x27;t...but I feel like I more than got my money out of this product.</li>
    <li> I used it when i received it and it didn&#x27;t cut not 1 hair. I sent it right back the next day.</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up on sale last fall in order to be able to cut my own hair. The price was right, especially on sale, and it performed adequately for my needs - touching up a crew cut once a month or so. However the tabs which allow the guides (which Conair inexplicably calls \\&quot;combs\\&quot;) to clip on to the main unit are flimsy and in roughly nine months of infrequent use I have broken the tabs on all three attachments, meaning that the unit can no longer adjust to trim hair at any length greater than bald skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a real flaw, but I was willing to put up with it, right up until I tried to order replacement \\&quot;combs\\&quot; and found that while they will sell you replacements, it&#x27;s totally impossible to order such replacements online. The manufacturer has an online store and there&#x27;s a separate website dedicated specifically to this product - but neither website has current pricing nor ordering info for replacement parts. If you want to order replacement parts, you have to do it by phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying a different brand of trimmer for next month&#x27;s haircut.</li>
    <li> This was a good by, I like it, I realy do, but the first time I droped it the trimer gage that I used the most broke, as I said I like it, but now I have a smaller hair style then I like</li>
    <li> Shaves the head well.  Various levels of cut down to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; - no hair.  Charge lasts at least 5 cuts. Well constructed.</li>
    <li> Thought it was curved, has two straight blades like any other regular shaver, i will end up using a blade from here on out.</li>
    <li> I bought a Conair and liked the cordless nature but it quickly disappointed me. The grade 1 attachment is very fragile and broke after the second use. The charging quickly degraded, becoming poor at cutting even though it was plugged in charging all day everyday. Now it barely cuts because it won&#x27;t hold a charge and grabs at my hair rather than cutting it.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing ! Would definately recommend the Conair HG300 Clean Head rechargeable razor for clean head shave. Works for any shape head.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  Does not work as promoted.  After spending 30 minutes or more trying to shave my head I had no results.  Went back to a standard blade razor.</li>
    <li> My husband usually shaves his head with a razor so at first it worked ok but after its good just took a little to get use to it.</li>
    <li> This thing ripped the hair off my head and never did get it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus you can&#x27;t buy a new blade for it either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a poor quality product. First it doesn&#x27;t shave much unless I use it everyday. If I wait 2 days in between shaves, it doesn&#x27;t cut much. Also, the battery started dying after just a few months. I can not get a full shave without plugging it back.</li>
    <li> My husband already had one of these for years and loved.  When it wore out he couldn&#x27;t find another one so he was very excited to get a new one.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at leaving a clean shaven head. My husband loves it not to mention the design is easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 1 year and it works great. I used to shave my head with Gillette fusion razor great razor but expensive. This shaver rocks, I will give a 10 stars if possible. By accident it ended into our pool. I&#x27;m very impressed that even it was soaked it never stop working it seems that it is indestructible.</li>
