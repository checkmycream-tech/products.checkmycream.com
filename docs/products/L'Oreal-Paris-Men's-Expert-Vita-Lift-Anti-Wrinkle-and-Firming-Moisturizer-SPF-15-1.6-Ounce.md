### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Probably the best thing is to use the version without the sunscreen at night before going to bed.  </li>
      <li>so I was happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>This is a great firming, moisturizer for a guy in a rush.</li>
      <li>Opposed to wearing nothing on his skin, this is a great, great improvement and the effects are noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great deal for all that help...</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the STOP Lines product so tried the Vita Lift...just as good and works great</li>
      <li>I kind of am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really works great!!!</li>
      <li>love this product.&lt;br /&gt;specially for the SPF</li>
      <li>The lines on my forehead are a whole bunch lighter, which is great.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
      <li>, I started getting more wrinkles</li>
      <li>It had always been my favorite to use since it had the sunscreen in it</li>
      <li>What more could you need?</li>
      <li>Tried a free sample, love it.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is great, but they send me the one with no SPF 15 (the old one), not the one show.</li>
      <li>I will stick with the men&#x27;s neutrogena &amp; nivea face products which are much more mild in the scent department.</li>
      <li>product is also available without sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It probably has to do with the Pro-Retinol formula (which is like a really light version of Retin-A without all the redness/skin irritation of Retin-A).</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m sure it is a good sun block, I would only apply this product before I shower</li>
      <li>Feels nice and clean and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve tried a variety, and none of them really blew me away with astoundingly better skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only does it soak in smoothly and undetectably, but it doesn&#x27;t make me more greasy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything, and those anti-aging ingredients?</li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want people to know they laugh and smile a lot, right?</li>
      <li>I think this Men&#x27;s product by L&#x27;Oreal is worth the money for sure and you get multiple benefits in just one purchase.</li>
      <li>Then, during the day use this verion with the sunscreen (but only SPF 15, so not too much protection - but good for normal day-to-day sun exposure).  </li>
      <li>Really love these products, especially for the $.</li>
      <li>I have often heard it said that a 15 min walk outside in the sun each day does more skin damage than a week at the beach.  </li>
      <li>Not two weeks later she&#x27;s commenting on my jawline and eyes looking better.</li>
      <li>I would have rated it 5 stars if it had a higher SPF rating than 15.</li>
      <li>With regular use, you should notice wrinkles smooth out over time</li>
      <li>Very sticky, face feels oily all the time after using this and it smells like a women&#x27;s cream.</li>
      <li>I extend it from under my eyes to my forehead as it is for the whole face.</li>
      <li>SO if you spend any time outside while working and are at all concerned about ageing super fast, get this.</li>
      <li>My entire face looks and feels better since I have been using this, especially the areas where I shave - smoother, less irritations, better shave.  </li>
      <li>(maybe add a little more to problem areas).</li>
      <li>And all but my deepest crow&#x27;s feet have entirely disappeared -- which is kind of disappointing because I actually liked the character they added.</li>
      <li>First, you don&#x27;t need much (especially if you tend to get oily skin).  </li>
      <li>When I was using it religiously, everybody always remarked how much younger I looked than my true age.</li>
      <li>The important thing, however, is that he wears it everyday, rain or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Whether it was the Loreal Vita Lift that was making me look younger, or whether my body just wasn&#x27;t ready to start wrinkling till I reached my 40&#x27;s, or whether it was a combination of the two, I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
      <li>(And a whole bunch joined a heap of rejects for being too greasy, too gritty, too smelly...)</li>
      <li>and I look my age now (42 years old).</li>
      <li>I purchased this product the other day and was excited to see if it actually lived up to its promise as a non greasy sun screen.  </li>
      <li>Just smooth a small amount over your face</li>
      <li>But for better or worse, they&#x27;re gone, and all it took was a product that&#x27;s ten bucks at a brick-and-mortar.</li>
      <li>so I could wash it off before I interact with the general public.  </li>
      <li>couple years ago, my dermatologist made it quite clear I should be using a moisturizer with SPF every single day.</li>

<li> Great product, terrible price.</li>
<li> I selected this product because of a few key features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> SPF, the sun protection provides a nice base to my face regardless of my plans for the day.  </li>
<li> I have used other l&#x27;oreal men&#x27;s products which didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all.</li>
<li> We purchase it every time we can find it at a reasonable cost, sorry we can not get it in stores anymore.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the dark under my eyes, but have noticed firmer, moister skin which others have noticed too.</li>
<li> I may be the first person on earth to be disappointed by an &amp;#34;age reducing&amp;#34; product that actually worked, but...</li>
<li> The lotion smell goes away after a few minutes too, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
<li> Thus, the reason the product is so small.</li>
<li> I find that it is fairly difficult to find with sunscreen lately and am not sure why.</li>
<li> VERY disappointed!!!</li>
<li> VERY UNHAPPY!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Youthful secret..don&#x27;t buy I want all of it for me!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with spf15, because the stores around us have been out for some time. When it came, it did not have the spf in it, and was the same stuff I could pick up at Walgreens!  VERY UNHAPPY!!! I will not trust this person again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered this item from this non-Amazon on-line supplier, so keep that in mind.  I have purchased this product locally at a grocery store (new/fresh product). It really works great!!! First, you don&#x27;t need much (especially if you tend to get oily skin).  Thus, the reason the product is so small. Just smooth a small amount over your face (maybe add a little more to problem areas). With regular use, you should notice wrinkles smooth out over time (I know I have in a short time).  Also, I noticed a benefit of fading dark spots on my skin (i.e., freckles or age spots from sun exposure) and it helps with the occasional blemish too. It probably has to do with the Pro-Retinol formula (which is like a really light version of Retin-A without all the redness/skin irritation of Retin-A). Probably the best thing is to use the version without the sunscreen at night before going to bed.  Then, during the day use this verion with the sunscreen (but only SPF 15, so not too much protection - but good for normal day-to-day sun exposure).  I think this Men&#x27;s product by L&#x27;Oreal is worth the money for sure and you get multiple benefits in just one purchase. A great deal for all that help...</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement to my skin almost immediately.  I have tried MANY EXPENSIVE men&#x27;s skin products and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s line beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this in the evening.  I shave each morning in the shower and am prone to razor irritation, bumps and ingrown hairs.  My entire face looks and feels better since I have been using this, especially the areas where I shave - smoother, less irritations, better shave.  I have also been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Expert After Shave Balm each morning.  Really love these products, especially for the $.</li>
    <li> What more could you need? It goes on easily, is non-greasy and light, yet stops nasty dryness all day. If you suffer from too much sebum though, could get a little slick later on in the day.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is great, but they send me the one with no SPF 15 (the old one), not the one show.</li>
    <li> For a men&#x27;s product this item is overly fragranced with what I would not associate with a manly scent. I will stick with the men&#x27;s neutrogena &amp; nivea face products which are much more mild in the scent department. I have used other l&#x27;oreal men&#x27;s products which didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all. I don&#x27;t understand why they went this direction with a face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very sticky, face feels oily all the time after using this and it smells like a women&#x27;s cream. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I ordered the cream with the sunscreen in it but got the cream without sunscreen instead.  Seems to me an anti aging cream would automatically have a sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Great product, terrible price. Found it for less than ten bucks including shipping to an APO.  Disappointed at that kind of mark up.</li>
    <li> Product description includes SPF 15, but when it came, it was a different product w/ no SPF.  VERY disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it. It is too greasy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had a higher SPF rating than 15. The important thing, however, is that he wears it everyday, rain or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This day creme/moisturizer is non-greasy, non-sticky, and does not run. It moisturizes and softens the skin and protects it somewhat from the sun. It is not meant to be a sun screen for outdoor activities, it is a day creme moisturizer and it works well. Opposed to wearing nothing on his skin, this is a great, great improvement and the effects are noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also available without sunscreen. I find that it is fairly difficult to find with sunscreen lately and am not sure why. It is still being featured on the L&#x27;Oreal web site, so it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.....yet. A similar, acceptable product from L&#x27;Oreal is the [[ASIN:B00C93O4N0 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Comfort Max SPF 15 Anti-Irritation After Shave Balm]] , which has sunscreen but fewer wrinkle fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: The major drug store chains sell this product for about eight to twelve dollars or less. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the STOP Lines product so tried the Vita Lift...just as good and works great</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for a couple of years, and then quit using it when my local grocery store quit carrying it. It had always been my favorite to use since it had the sunscreen in it and my doctor has always hammered into me about using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. When I was using it religiously, everybody always remarked how much younger I looked than my true age. When my grocery store quit carrying it and I then quit using it, I started getting more wrinkles and I look my age now (42 years old). Whether it was the Loreal Vita Lift that was making me look younger, or whether my body just wasn&#x27;t ready to start wrinkling till I reached my 40&#x27;s, or whether it was a combination of the two, I&#x27;ll never know. However, since I started using it again a couple of weeks ago I have noticed that some of my wrinkles are SLOWLY starting to disappear. The lotion smell goes away after a few minutes too, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I plan on making this part of my morning and nightly routine again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product the other day and was excited to see if it actually lived up to its promise as a non greasy sun screen.  I applied some in the morning and was off for my morning hike, by the time I was done I felt like a wax candle.  Non greasy my foot.  While I&#x27;m sure it is a good sun block, I would only apply this product before I shower so I could wash it off before I interact with the general public.  I now plan on using only when I swim or before I work out outdoors.</li>
    <li> This is a great firming, moisturizer for a guy in a rush. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the dark under my eyes, but have noticed firmer, moister skin which others have noticed too. I extend it from under my eyes to my forehead as it is for the whole face. I read about this in a magazine and it definitely has meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have long wondered why women tend to always look younger than men.  The answer is rather simple.  Skin care!  I selected this product because of a few key features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) SPF, the sun protection provides a nice base to my face regardless of my plans for the day.  I have often heard it said that a 15 min walk outside in the sun each day does more skin damage than a week at the beach.  Here I am protected.&lt;br /&gt;2) Pro-Retinal, this basically means that the product has a vitamin A derivative which enables your skin to look younger and fight wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I may be the first person on earth to be disappointed by an &amp;#34;age reducing&amp;#34; product that actually worked, but... I kind of am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago, my dermatologist made it quite clear I should be using a moisturizer with SPF every single day. Since then, I&#x27;ve tried a variety, and none of them really blew me away with astoundingly better skin. (And a whole bunch joined a heap of rejects for being too greasy, too gritty, too smelly...) I finally picked up the Vita Lift a couple weeks ago when it was the only thing Target had in stock. And I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it soak in smoothly and undetectably, but it doesn&#x27;t make me more greasy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything, and those anti-aging ingredients? They work. The lines on my forehead are a whole bunch lighter, which is great. And all but my deepest crow&#x27;s feet have entirely disappeared -- which is kind of disappointing because I actually liked the character they added. Who doesn&#x27;t want people to know they laugh and smile a lot, right? But for better or worse, they&#x27;re gone, and all it took was a product that&#x27;s ten bucks at a brick-and-mortar.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizing product that my husband can use on his face.  All others that he had tried result in his face severely breaking out. We purchase it every time we can find it at a reasonable cost, sorry we can not get it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Tried a free sample, love it.</li>
    <li> SO if you spend any time outside while working and are at all concerned about ageing super fast, get this. Feels nice and clean and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly. I use every morning before I head to work and my girlfriend has noticed the difference within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product and our drug store where he purchase it initially has stopped carrying it so I was happy to find it here. It has a sunscreen that my husband does not object to using.</li>
    <li> My sister raved about the Revitalift line so I tried the men&#x27;s stuff. Not two weeks later she&#x27;s commenting on my jawline and eyes looking better. I thought it was in my head. I&#x27;ve ordered the rest of the line. Until they make a hand cream, I&#x27;m putting one in my glovebox.</li>
    <li> love this product.&lt;br /&gt;specially for the SPF and it dries so fast.&lt;br /&gt;i recomend all the line of Loreal Men Ex.</li>
</ol>
