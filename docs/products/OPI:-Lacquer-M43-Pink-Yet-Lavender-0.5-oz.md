    <li> The bottle was scraped and the name on the bottom of the polish was covered. dissapointing. i expected more than</li>
    <li> This is a nice glittery mix of pinks and different sized glitter chunks. I wore it over a light Lavendar polish.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency but wish the glitter applied better.</li>
    <li> OPI nailed it again (Ha!!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of glitter polish, but this one is fantastic. I used it over a base of light pink and the result was beautiful. I think it would look great over any shade of pink or violet. You get and even distribution of glitter too. I&#x27;ve received many compliments so far and several friends have even purchased it.</li>
    <li> bedazzled nails! the shimmer of this polish is amazing perfect dressed up or dressed down....compliments any other polish that you wear...It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> the picture doesnt do it justice!&lt;br /&gt;i really like this polish, pair it over a color or just do the tips</li>
    <li> This polish is a very pretty color by itself or over other polish.  I love what glitter polish can do...and this color is very pretty for a variety of polish colors.</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful but it is such a pain to remove.  You really need to soak each finger in nail polish remover for five minutes at least.</li>
    <li> Color is pretty...OPI really should nix the giant glitter though. It&#x27;s so much of a pain to remove that I won&#x27;t use it again. Oh well....Maybe for a very special occasion if it doesn&#x27;t harden in the mean time.</li>
    <li> this is my daughter nail polish. she loves it so very much and looks great on her nails. i say that every girl should get this nail ploish.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at NW Beauty Supply - I had gone in for wax strips and came out with 3 Mariah Carey OPI polishes, and this was one of them. It&#x27;s a gorgeous very pale pink toned base, with pink glitters. I used it in a glitter gradient over Anti Bleak (another GORGEOUS shade), and I LOVE it! As mentioned by the other review (another Rachel with good taste), it would be beautiful on it&#x27;s own or on the tips. My next mani will be this over french tips. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the sparkles. Pretty colors, they make me feel like a princess, and we all need that sometimes. It looks great with the Butterfly Moment.</li>
    <li> This looked great as an accent to the Anti-Bleak Mariah Carey polish, amazing when put together.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and hope you will like it as much as I do.</li>

    <li> This nail polish I found better the others I have bought in the past. It is glittered and it is what I personally was looking for. It might not be for everybody but I found it very and light.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful. Pictures can do it no justice. Looks great over many different colors of polish. Gives your polish that little kick and any polish becomes more exciting. You can see holographic glitter in different types of light, it&#x27;s multidimensional and just stunning. Thanks OPI and Mariah Carey - I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Its okay.  It is pretty but to make it look like the picture on someones nail it is very difficult.  the glitter is very sparatic and after even 2 coats some are clumped on one side and non on the other. It doesn&#x27;t apply evenly but it is expected with such chunky glitter.  Even application of the glitter only works when the glitter pieces are smaller.  Still a pretty color.  Its such a pain to remove with any glitter so I tend to stay away from using this polish.  Don&#x27;t expect your nail to look like the picture.</li>
    <li> I just love this color, a pale rose tone (almost like a rose gold but less yellow).  But, like so many glitter polishes, there is just not enough glitter in one coat.  Needs to be more &amp;#34;packed&amp;#34; with glitter!  I like that it has both larger and smaller glitter pieces but to get good coverage I need at least two coats.  In fact, I picked this at a nail salon and my very-experienced nail tech had trouble with it as well because of the scant amount of glitter in the bottle.

    <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use it as an top coat or make my own style manicure with it !I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I was so in love with this polish and I am so sad to say that after a year it dries up horribly and does not go on as a polish should! DO NOT waste your money. If you are looking for a pink glitter polish go with China glaze Doll house.</li>
