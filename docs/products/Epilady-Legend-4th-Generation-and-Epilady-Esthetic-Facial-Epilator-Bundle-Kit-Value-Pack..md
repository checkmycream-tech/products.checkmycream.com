      <li>just hope it stays nice and hairfree because  shaving scares  me on the face...</li>
      <li>she liked it ,just takes getting use to  the plucking</li>
      <li>I love both of them and this was a good price</li>
      <li>Easy to use, does a good job.</li>
      <li>I had the first Epilady, and it works so good!</li>
      <li>Also more effective.</li>
      <li>But the leg one is inferior to the original, and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.  </li>
      <li>These are my first ones and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>

      <li>I only gave this 4 stars because Iove the full-size Epilady and it did a wonderful job on my legs and arms.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I thought I needed a better made model that HSN offered, so I decided to give the EP-810-33A with the mini</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I am going to love this product.  </li>
      <li>The directions do not say that when the hair is longer, it works better.  </li>
      <li>Plan on buying more as gifts.</li>
      <li>Not only does it do a wonderful job at keeping unwanted hair on my face, but since using my face color is more even and healthier looking.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;All-in-all, though, I love the Epilady products.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>It takes a lot of passes on the area being depilated to get the hairs, and there&#x27;s more breakage instead of hair extraction.</li>
      <li>but I love it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it still</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it that it is rechargeable and that t</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>ok..</li>
      <li>So much better than the knockoff brand.</li>
      <li>Save your money and be pain free in the process!</li>
      <li>I have tried another brand after my first epilady pooped out (10 years) and it stunk!!!  </li>
      <li>Love the full size epilady!  </li>
      <li>VERY TRUE  </li>
      <li>Better than the original Epilady.</li>
      <li>Works great, you just need to be patient and go over some spots more than once and at different angles.</li>
      <li>I find the Epilady easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Waxing doesn&#x27;t work on my face so maybe my peach fuzz is too fine</li>
      <li>The directions also say works best after hot shower, when pores are open.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and according to my wife, is almost pain free.</li>
      <li>However, neither one of this set would pick up the fine hairs on my face.</li>
      <li>This new one is great, I have used it 3 times now and they are right</li>
      <li>Fantastic service.</li>
      <li>If you follow instructions and use it properly it works great.  </li>
      <li>The smaller one works great for the face and the underarm.</li>
      <li>Overall a great buy.</li>
      <li>The Epilady does not leave as smooth a skin as I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>I did enjoy plucking my eyebrows, however, because after a beginning with pain, it had evolved into a pleasurable experience.  </li>
      <li>Now I enjoy &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My legs have never been so smooth.  </li>
      <li>received in fantastic condition.</li>
      <li>The smaller sized one is a great idea and it works well.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, would buy again.</li>
      <li>While this version of the Epilady works fine, I defnitely prefer the original.  </li>
      <li>was very pleased with the small epilator that came with it and is very handy to have.</li>
      <li>The results of the epilady is exactly what I expected and works excellent.</li>
      <li>uses every few weeks is really kind of pleasant.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the original and have been using it for about 20 years.  </li>
      <li>had one of the original EpiLady coil systems</li>
      <li>I never had an Epilady until I originally ordered one from HSN and it kept breaking and after (3)</li>
      <li>This epilady is better than the first one I had.  </li>
      <li>you can wash it and clean it easily.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Great deal - works as expected - will take practice</li>
      <li>I believe the older version did a better job.  </li>
      <li>but you get used to it quickly.</li>
      <li>Epilady, darn it, but briefly, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, even after repeatedly going over the area,  but after using it weekly for about two months, my legs stay smooth between uses, and the hair is growing in much more fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fabulous product!! Loved it so much I bought this kit for my young adult daughter after using it myself for a couple of months. I did warn her that the first time you use it can be a bit painful but subsequent uses every few weeks is really kind of pleasant. I&#x27;ve personally seen an approximate 80% reduction of hair regrowth. That is phenomenal in my book!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too happy when I got my package. When I open the box, product box was in bad condition. It was a little torn and dented. I should  have returned it, but never had time to.</li>
    <li> so much nicer than the original EpiLady...doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  shirley</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does a good job. Does not hurt...</li>
    <li> a bit painful on more tender skin on the leg. The results of the epilady is exactly what I expected and works excellent.</li>
    <li> Both work well. Improvement over older model.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Only recived the smaller item not the full size item. It was meant for a bithday present now I have to return it partial item get credit and reorder. Not cool.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered it but my Dr had told me I had to quit shaving, I was getting staff infection from the scrapes (not even cuts) I had an old version with some kind of spring type wires that was so painful.  This new one is great, I have used it 3 times now and they are right it hurts less every time you use it.  My lower legs are almost hair free now and although the upper thigh is tender the small kind rash is almost gone.  I am a believer although I haven&#x27;t tried on my face or underarms yet.  One step at a time.</li>
    <li> Love it. When I lost mine, I bought another one!</li>
    <li> I wish it was not so painful, but it is still better than shaving and having those awful razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilady for a couple of months now and I really like. Of course there will be a little pain but no more than a wax. This is great on getting hair with one pass and I haven&#x27;t experienced any punching of the skin. I Like the fact that it has two speeds so you can start off slow then work your way up to a higher speed. The smaller one works great for the face and the underarm. I am pleasantly surprised with the way this epilady performs. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful way for us ladies to rid ourselves of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Ehhh,not my kind of results :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not as powerful as previous model.</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell!  Does a good job removing hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, you just need to be patient and go over some spots more than once and at different angles.</li>
    <li> It works well but it doesn&#x27;t get the finner hairs very well, works great on the corse hairs the best. It is a little more time consuming to use than shaving results last a few weeks. I would recommend it might even buy one my daughter for the holidays.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hurt or not.  It does NOT, you just feel a little like pinch.  I love both of them and this was a good price</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the facial works on one of them</li>
    <li> It works well though a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> Stings a bit when you&#x27;re shaving as it actually pulls the hairs out by the roots, but not much more than using the tweezers and a lot easier.  Also more effective.</li>
    <li> I never had an Epilady until I originally ordered one from HSN and it kept breaking and after (3) I said this was enough. However, I was tired of getting my face wax and paying $45 bucks each time. I could not keep that fuzz off my face and felt everyone could see it.  I thought I needed a better made model that HSN offered, so I decided to give the EP-810-33A with the mini and it works great. It is was more expensive than the first one, however it is also made better.  The mini does not get all the hair, but I go back with the larger one on my face.  I would purchase another if I needed to.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Would like to return it. doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> This Epilady was a gift for my daughter. She loved it! But the litt,e face one was useless, not worth bothering with....cjt</li>
    <li> Ooo-oooh, baby!  Do I love that Epilady!  I was among the first to try it back in the eighties.  I had a friend who regularly went to get her legs waxed.  She described it as a horrible torture, but subjected herself to it in the service of beauty.  I had always shaved my legs, but never liked the resulting stubble immediately after the act!  I did enjoy plucking my eyebrows, however, because after a beginning with pain, it had evolved into a pleasurable experience.  So I hoped that Epilady, with it&#x27;s plucking action, would prevent the torture that ripping out square feet of leg hairs at one time produces, and do it in a slower, more humane fashion.  Well, that is exactly what happened.  Now I enjoy &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34; acres of leg hairs in series, rather than all at the same time, and I have all the advantages of waxing -- the most important being that they don&#x27;t grow back right away, and that there is never any stubble.  The hairs grow back finer and finer, and in some cases disappear altogether.  Get this magic, ladies!</li>
    <li> It left a few short hairs on first use, but it seems to work.  Used the old style for years.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product. I had the first Epilady, and it works so good! Great hair remover!</li>
    <li> a little pinchy but  i had no problem just hope it stays nice and hairfree because  shaving scares  me on the face...i used the  facial one ok..but the  big one  did the  job better.i used it on my face carefully no problem at all i am surprised ...i  was afraid. of it  from all the  other statements .but ilove it</li>
    <li> Only the larger unit is rechargeable.  The facial unit is not.  It is battery operated and no battery is provided.&lt;br /&gt;This smaller unit did not start when I inserted a brand new AA battery.  I turned the wheel by hand and it started very very slowly and then stopped.  I have to return it to the supplier but I am told I have to pay for postage and insurance. So no, not a good experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Epilady since its inception and am just as happy as ever with my latest model. The small version is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Small unit didn&#x27;t work. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> The two most perfect products together. I&#x27;m so happy. No other brand compares to epilady. Believe me, I have tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sisters. I&#x27;ve used the product for years starting with the coiled epilady. after 20 yrs!!! she died and I got one like this. instead of my sister borrowing mine I purchased this set. the facial one was for my other sister for her face...&lt;br /&gt;this definitely beats going to the salon for a wax. after using it for so long I hardly have any leh hair!</li>
    <li> Love the full size epilady!  I get similar results to leg waxing without the irritation waxing causes to my sensitive skin.  It is powerful, and it does a great job!  The ding in stars comes from the facial epilady.  I found it to be pretty much worthless.  No amount of going over my facial hair would come even remotely close to removing my facial hair.  (And I am not the bearded lady!)  If I had this purchase to make over again, I would skip the combo pack and just get the big one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the facial epilady!</li>
    <li> I went over the areas I wanted hair removed from several times.  It simply didn&#x27;t work. I sent it back. I have given up on home hair removal systems.</li>
    <li> I love Epilady!  I love it that it is rechargeable and that t he cord is 110-220V.  Makes it easier living in Europe temporarily...  Always been an Epilady Fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the epilady! It works well and hair regrowth is much slower!</li>
    <li> I love it. I shaved my legs and didn&#x27;t have to for a great while. The hair does not grow in prickly and black. This product was so worth the purchase. It doesn&#x27;t hurt all that much.</li>
    <li> My first time using an epilator. Hurts quite a bit during first use, but after that, it is a non-event. Subsequent hair growth is at different rates, so not as many hairs being removed as the first use. If I had to do it again, I would wax my armpits and bikini area first, then maintain with the Epilady. My only complaint is that it does not get all the hairs. I have to go over and over the same areas. However, it is time well spent as I love being hair free and not having to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is so much less painful than waxing.  Older skin is a thinner and waxing was just tearing it up.  This removes hair just as well with no damage.  On my face a whole lot less painful than waxing.  Still smarts to do the arms but hurts less each time you do it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it still and it&#x27;s been years since purchased!</li>
    <li> Great value, love the travel Face Epilady that was part of the offer.</li>
    <li> Can be used without the cord and my legs are left smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Better than the original Epilady.</li>
    <li> While this version of the Epilady works fine, I defnitely prefer the original.  The smaller version was doing a good job on facial hair and underarms but, unfotunately, the unit broke apart when I dropped it on the bathroom floor - not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I believe the older version did a better job.  I think I&#x27;ll try to find an older model.</li>
    <li> My teenager will not go NEAR it but I love it.  Gave the small personal unit to my mother who loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I was very scared to buy this because I read reviews that it hurts like crazy. It doesn&#x27;t. If you can handle waxing then this is no problem. It feels like a little sting but that&#x27;s it, and there&#x27;s none of the scare factor of waxing. I would definitely recommend this. Fantastic service. Arrived faster than promised. Packaged brand-new, never opened, does exactly what it was described. Fantastic product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Ireally like it ixan use it charged for long time</li>
    <li> My sister in law and I both ordered this product. She only received the smaller one in her box and I still have not received either..... Disappointed</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the original and have been using it for about 20 years.  I though to upgrade with this package.  I haven&#x27;t used the face one yet. But the leg one is inferior to the original, and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.  It takes a lot of passes on the area being depilated to get the hairs, and there&#x27;s more breakage instead of hair extraction.</li>
    <li> This does not work as good as expected you have to let the hair grow too long before you can use this</li>
    <li> Main unit broke almost immediately.  Angle is awkward to use and a patch of skin got caught.  Not only did it rip the hell out of my leg, it threw the rotating components out of alignment, rendering the system completely useless.  The smaller face model is battery powered and has barely enough oomph to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of the original EpiLady coil systems and they were fantastic!!  This new design is horrible, does not work as well, and is flimsy.  I will NOT buy one of these again.  Money wasted.</li>
    <li> Better than shaving it last for weeks and I never shave</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  If you follow instructions and use it properly it works great.  The facial epi lady works great on facial hair around the chin and lips.</li>
    <li> It didnt remove my hair and it pulled.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I have some facial hair I am  tired of plucking every day, and hated when I found I had missed one.  This has been perfect for my needs.  It&#x27;s worked so great I&#x27;ve used it for other areas also.</li>
    <li> I have waited several years to get another epilady!  I have tried another brand after my first epilady pooped out (10 years) and it stunk!!!  Nothing can compare.  This epilady is better than the first one I had.  Thank you--Kathy.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts like a mother. Inhuman noises involuntarily escape from me when using it below the knee, especially on the insides of my legs. BUT IT WORKS. I cuts back drastically on shaving, especially as you use it more and more.</li>
    <li> Love the mini epilady for my eyebrows, its the perfect size. I&#x27;ve ordered the epilady before and forgot it on our vaca, it really does the job! I use it on my legs and under arm s it beat shaving any ! And hair grows back alot thinner.</li>
    <li> I find the Epilady easy to use.  I just wish I&#x27;d thought of it before.  Using the first time in bikini area, I have read other reviewers problems.  Cutting hair first helps immensely,.  Also, using it on regrowth is much easier.  I was expecting it to be a painful experience from other reviewers.  For me I did not find that to be the case.  I used on legs, arms, etc.  I am very happy with the pair.</li>
    <li> My wife found this to be painful to use and didn&#x27;t fulfill all of the things the product promised.</li>
    <li> You may as well use your tweezers to pull out your hair because neither epilator removed any hair. It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this purchase.  I would definitely not recommend either item.  The little epilady, is completely ineffective and the larger of the two isn&#x27;t much better.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> works exactly as described. received in fantastic condition. packaged great! was very pleased with the small epilator that came with it and is very handy to have. did not know I needed it until I tried it. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Not only does it do a wonderful job at keeping unwanted hair on my face, but since using my face color is more even and healthier looking.  Plan on buying more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has never used one. She loves it. Said it hurt the first time she used it but now its not an issue. She used to shave 3 times a week now she uses this once every week or two and its not an issue.</li>
    <li> I had used an older model of epilady for about 10 years. That finally gave out. Since I had such a good run with the first one I got this one.  It&#x27;s a great product. You can tell the upgrades make a difference. The bonus for sensitive areas is also a plus. Overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> These do NOT work.  Save your money and be pain free in the process!</li>
    <li> Product was just as expected.</li>
    <li> I am going to love this product.  Only have had it a few days, but unwanted hair has already begun to disappear.  Pretty easy to use and not so painful to use.  I am 68 years old and so wish I had gotten one years sooner!!  Too many years of almost daily shaving and waxing. Both units are working well for me.  Getting one for my daughter so she won&#x27;t have to waste all those years as I did.</li>
    <li> Sounded painful but not so much. No worse than plucking eyebrows or waxing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for a great price. My wife loved it. Easy to use and according to my wife, is almost pain free.</li>
    <li> I wrote a longer review under the wrong Epilady, darn it, but briefly, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, even after repeatedly going over the area,  but after using it weekly for about two months, my legs stay smooth between uses, and the hair is growing in much more fine. Skip the bonus kit, the battery operated one is useless. And use Dove deodorant afterwards, it prevents ingrown hairs and soothes the redness from having the hair ripped out by the roots. Yes, it hurts like beck the first time, but the more you do it, the less it hurts.</li>
    <li> yeah! I love this product.My legs are smooth and lasts so much longer and less hassle then shaving in the shower.It feels a little prickly at first but you get used to it quickly.Wish I would have purchased one sooner.I use the smaller one on my face.</li>
    <li> The body epilady performs good. Its fast, thus you do not experience much pain. you can wash it and clean it easily.&lt;br /&gt;But the face epilator comes with the former is totally useless</li>
    <li> she liked it ,just takes getting use to  the plucking</li>
    <li> It hurts less than other epilators, but it also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Takes longer, pulls out fewer hairs.  And forget the battery powered mini one.  It is worthless.  Overall, I&#x27;m not happy I paid so much for it.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 4 stars because Iove the full-size Epilady and it did a wonderful job on my legs and arms.  The facial Epilady seems to be very low-powered and I can&#x27;t feel a lot of hair being pulled, and when I looked after I used it, sure enough, there was a lot of peach fuzz left behind.  Waxing doesn&#x27;t work on my face so maybe my peach fuzz is too fine and I&#x27;m the problem, not the Epilady.  Or I could be doing something wrong in the angle I&#x27;m holding it.  I noticed that facial hair fuzz, on my face at least, grows in in all different directions, unlike on legs, so maybe trying different directions on spots that it&#x27;s not working on will help it work better.  It seems that since the same tweezer style of Epilady works so well on my arms and legs, that the facial one would work on thicker facial hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries to see if I have better results, and will update my review if so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very willing to try the Epilady coil facial hair remover if necessary, which may work much better on fine peach fuzz like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, though, I love the Epilady products.  These are my first ones and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> If you have coarse hair, I believe this epilator would work fine. However, neither one of this set would pick up the fine hairs on my face. I tried it too long to send it back, so I&#x27;m just out the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Epilady for many years until it needed replacement recently. This new one is horrible; doesn&#x27;t work at all. Neither the leg epilady or facial epilady is worth anything. Useless.</li>
    <li> So much better than the knockoff brand. It does a far better job in half the time.  It does not hurt!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a younger guy who purchased the Epilady to remove unwanted body hair. This thing works great, but it IS painful - make no mistake. Personally I think the effort is worth the result, but to each their own. I give this product 5 stars for functionality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there were two epilators.  The smaller sized one is a great idea and it works well.</li>
    <li> It works great.  My legs have never been so smooth.  And the little one is great for those single wayward hairs</li>
    <li> The best purchase ever!! It really makes its work. Be prepare for the first time to use :) Highly recommended since then, I have never spent money on razor blades!!</li>
    <li> #1  The directions say pull skin tight.  Uh, and if you don&#x27;t, you will be pinched.&lt;br /&gt;#2  The directions also say works best after hot shower, when pores are open.  VERY TRUE  After a hot shower, I wrap a towel around one leg, to keep it warm and dry.  Then I pull skin tight, and it works!!!  Tried it without the hot shower option, ouchy!&lt;br /&gt;#3  The directions do not say that when the hair is longer, it works better.  The hair needs to be at least 1/4 inch long, and wahlah!&lt;br /&gt;#4  I&#x27;ve done my legs about four times in the first week, and my legs are now hair free.&lt;br /&gt;#5  I have removed hair on my arms, hands, feet, and swimsuit-showing area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA OVE Epilady Legend, not the facial companion, which is a complete waste of time. . .</li>
    <li> Epilady Legend is a big disappointment ... Doesn&#x27;t catch fine short hairs and leaves stubbles. Same with the battery operated one.</li>
    <li> The Epilady is not the most comfortable way to shave, as it pulls the hair out and can be painful.  It does appear not to need done as often, so it makes it a lot easier than shaving every other day.  If it didn&#x27;t hurt, it would e a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> Great deal - works as expected - will take practice</li>
    <li> I had the older model for a good 8 years and finally expired.  I got this new one and is more powerful and somehow way less painful.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well, but not the first time around. I used it everyday for 5 days until I got used to it and all the hair was gone. Now I use it once each week. It was as painful as waxing, only it took longer to get all the hair. It was prolonged torture at first, now it&#x27;s a breeze. No lumps, bumps, or rashes from wax and razors. I only wish it pulled out more hair at a time to get it done and over with faster.</li>
    <li> The Epilady does not leave as smooth a skin as I had hoped for. It seems to cut some of the hair instead of pulling it out. It seems as though it has to be used almost every day when initially purchased to get the desired effect.The facial Epilady also leaves some fine hair on the boney prominence of the chin. I still have to get the tweezers out but; I must admit, it is much easier than relying on waxing or tweezing alone. I tried my underarms but it was a little too painful to complete that task. All in all, it was a good purchase.</li>
