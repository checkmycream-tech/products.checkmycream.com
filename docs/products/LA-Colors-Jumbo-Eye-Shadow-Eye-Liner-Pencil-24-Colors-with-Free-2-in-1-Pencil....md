      <li>Liked the colors but too creamy</li>
      <li>Theres so many colors to choose from and there all nice and its a cheaper alternative than the the NYX i Love this item!</li>
      <li>good pigmentation and would become even more pigmented the more I added..</li>

      <li>They went on very smooth and light and are pleasantly scented.</li>
      <li>They were amazing on time plus everything was packed beautifuly :)</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re inexpensive and easy to use!</li>
      <li>The colors are wonderful and they do help make my blue eyes pop.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They stay on all day and night, I love them and use them every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And most of the pencils have NOT done that.  </li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t matter since there are so many colors to choose from.</li>
      <li>AND I GUESS THEY WORK OK</li>
      <li>I love LA colors brand.</li>
      <li>I love the quality and the colors of most of them, some I even send to my sister.</li>
      <li>I ordered these because I love having a variety of colors and eye shadow sticks are easier to apply than powder version, but most sticks go for upwards of 2 dollars a piece.</li>
      <li>I still love them there</li>
      <li>cute colors and bases for eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>i am allergic to most eye shadows, i have never tried the sticks before</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with this find.</li>
      <li>There are so many colours to choose from, you can coordinate with all your clothes/accessories.</li>
      <li>I love all the color choices.</li>
      <li>I think i have now used every color and love them all.</li>
      <li>Was very excited to try these on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a pretty good deal but don&#x27;t expect all day wear and keep in mind that you get what you pay</li>
      <li>At first i wasnt to shure if they were going to be good</li>
      <li>Excited!</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased a set of 12 jumbo pencils from Bundle Monster, which were great, but are sadly no longer available.</li>
      <li>I love the color and how smooth it goes on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going with 5 stars instead of 4 because of how great the pencils are, and what an outstanding deal this is at $29 - barely over a dollar per pencil and free shipping,</li>
      <li>They are the same great quality with even more</li>
      <li>The pencils make it easy to apply.</li>
      <li>These will also be great for me as I travel alot and are so much more convenient than a big plastic square tray of colours.</li>
      <li>Overall, great product, glad I got them.</li>
      <li>so smooth and easy to use.</li>
      <li>this was a great shadow that brought out my blue eyes..</li>
      <li>overall, its a great addition to any makeup kit.</li>
      <li>They are a great alternative to NYX and would totally purchase them again...</li>
      <li>They even send you a cute pencil sharpener, and they arrived super quick.</li>
      <li>but I still think They&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
      <li>make sure you use a primer first though because they will wear off quickly</li>
      <li>The color goes on smooth and bright and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve noticed that these will smudge, even hours later, even with a good primer.</li>
      <li>Also, it does come with a really cool sharpener.</li>
      <li>goes on pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t smear so quickly.</li>
      <li>I took a chance on these eye shadows because the price for the variety of colors was super tempting.</li>
      <li>I guess I got lucky with my color selection.</li>
      <li>but I  do like them for a quick fix for my work makeup.</li>
      <li>They are very quick and simple to use, the product goes on the eye very easily, you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over and over just to get out a descent bit of colour.</li>
      <li>Most of these colors are very natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light green- smudged allot and wasn&#x27;t as attractive in color as I thought it would be..</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth the money.</li>

    <li> This eye shadow smears everywhere</li>
    <li> This product was all that I was expecting it has lots and lots of colors to choose from that will match any outfit, I do recommend and eyelid primer to keep the colors on longer, but over all it was a good buy for the price</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner/shadow.  Excellent variety of colors.  There&#x27;s enough to keep and share.</li>
    <li> I love these things!  For the price I couldn&#x27;t resist trying out a slew of different colors of eye shadow eye liner.  The colors are wonderful and they do help make my blue eyes pop.  I like the texture of the pencils and the color goes on pretty easily.  I have used other liners before that are so hard and dry nothing comes off.  That is not the case with these, they are really great!</li>
    <li> These jumbo eye pencils are a very good dupe for the NYX jumbo eye pencils, and they are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Ripoff. Jumbo my foot. I waited for a long time for micro pencil. Totally ripoff!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t need all of those eye pencils but I couldn&#x27;t order the colors I wanted so I got the entire set. It came in good shape, they were boxed 3 in a box, the boxes were fine. I love the quality and the colors of most of them, some I even send to my sister. It&#x27;s very hard to find orange and pink and purple eye pencils so this was perfect! They should have included yellow and light teal, but thankfully I all ready had those from other brands.</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected, colors are all beautiful i did expect a red but nope oh well. I still love them there all creamy beautiful and easy to use i&#x27;ve only had a day with them and i&#x27;ve already received compliments one the plum purple one..ohh i will for sure be using these pencils daily! until i ran out then i&#x27;ll buy more from the same seller! They were amazing on time plus everything was packed beautifuly :)</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. My only issue is that I received my sharpener cracked, but it&#x27;s still usable. These are the best alternative to the NYX jumbo eye pencils, they work just as well. And yes, they can be sharpened with the sharpener that comes with it and any other eye pencil sharpener. You might want to wait until the exposed pencil is completely finished though. Overall, great product, glad I got them.</li>
    <li> Liked the colors but too creamy</li>
    <li> nice colors, BUT color does not last long only a few hours, had to send back, was looking for something that lasts thru out the day.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product a five stars if it didn&#x27;t smear. I love the color and how smooth it goes on. Just wish it didn&#x27;t smear so quickly. I had to keep cleaning up my eye makeup, so I wouldn&#x27;t look like a raccoon.</li>
    <li> Awesome bold colors! They truly make your eyes pop. I use them as my shadow base, or to line the my inner lower lids.</li>
    <li> At first i wasnt to shure if they were going to be good but they are! Theres so many colors to choose from and there all nice and its a cheaper alternative than the the NYX i Love this item!</li>
    <li> easy to rub on the eyes doesnt tug much creases a little but if buy again they blend alright. dont depot them with heat though the consistency changes</li>
    <li> I guess I got lucky with my color selection. These really pop! But I&#x27;ve noticed that these will smudge, even hours later, even with a good primer. Then again, these pencils are meant to blend and smudge, so it really is a personal choice. But you can&#x27;t beat all the great colors for this price. They even send you a cute pencil sharpener, and they arrived super quick.</li>
    <li> I used to use these. I got 7 pencils for $7.99 at Burke&#x27;s. Some of them are not pigmented than others. I stopped using them because this are creamy eye-shadows and I prefer powder. Here is some info on some of the colors I had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink- not very pigmented but in the light shines and showed a pinkish tint..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Blue- good pigmentation and would become even more pigmented the more I added..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black- very dark gray looking but not at all like black shark skin shadow..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey- dark grey, very similar to the black, not good for blending with powders, especially white shadow..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark brown- this was a great shadow that brought out my blue eyes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender- also went well with my blue eyes and for some reason this color stayed on most of the day where as the other colors would come off in just a couple of hours..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light green- smudged allot and wasn&#x27;t as attractive in color as I thought it would be..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good deal but don&#x27;t expect all day wear and keep in mind that you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to try this product for yourself then I suggest you but it for this price because I stated above how much I paid for seven of them so this is a little bit better of a deal for 24 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: would recommend them for temporary use.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased a set of 12 jumbo pencils from Bundle Monster, which were great, but are sadly no longer available. When I stumbled across these I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order. They are the same great quality with even more colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these to be incredibly long lasting. I get ready for work at 4:30am and these last a full 12 hours and more; I usually end up removing it in the shower!  What I love about them is they can be used as eye shadow base and eyeliner, no need to buy two products.  I simply use my finger to blend the colors for a base.  The color variety is fantastic and includes various options in the same color family. E.g. there are a few shades of pinks and purples so you can blend a custom color and have a coordinating eyeliner.  The set includes metallic colors, silver, copper, gold, as well as pastels and darks.  It truly is an all inclusive set. And, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  A small 2 or 3 color shadow compact is $6+ in retail shops, and you don&#x27;t get to choose your colors.  These pencils come out to $1.25 each and they last a long time. I still have all the pencils from my Bundle Monster set that I purchased in March 2012!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these! I highly recommend the set.</li>
    <li> I really like them! It pretty much came with allot all the colors one can think of! Excited! I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> i am allergic to most eye shadows, i have never tried the sticks before so i thought i would give it a shot! i absolutely love these!! make sure you use a primer first though because they will wear off quickly if you dont! delivery was great and packaging was sturdy! i had a ton of packages to open because they put like 5 in each package!</li>
    <li> Great collection of colors!</li>
    <li> cute colors and bases for eyeshadows. they are very metallic colors and are so bold. i mix them in with eyeshadow for a bolder look or to get a different tint. i also use leave on spray so that they will stay in place and have use them without the spray with no run off problem. overall, its a great addition to any makeup kit.</li>
    <li> This a fantastic deal in comparison to purchasing these individually in the store. I did not receive any duplicate colors nor were any of my pencils broken. These probably aren&#x27;t the longest wearing eye shadow pencils but for the price I have no complaints. The free pencil sharpener was different than the one pictured but that wasn&#x27;t a big concern.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed by this product. I love all the colors! such a variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very vibrant colors and very east to blend them with your eye shadow&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I use a color I test it on my hand and match it with my eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay on all day and night, I love them and use them every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very great price for all the variety!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend these to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a month now and am loving them. They are a great alternative to NYX and would totally purchase them again... if I ever run out of them. Even using them for a month I haven&#x27;t had to sharpen a single one. Also, it does come with a really cool sharpener. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this set 4 stars is that some have a little bit of oil on them that you have to clean off (though this could just be because I live in a very hot place) and maybe 4 or 5 have a little bit of a plastic-like scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive or revolting.</li>
    <li> You can get these at Dollar General....... for a dollar a piece.... lol I have the blue and the green xD (Still) Some good stuff :D</li>
    <li> All are really great. I haven&#x27;t used them all but I have swatches  them all are really great. There is one that doesn&#x27;t come off all that great it&#x27;s a grayish white color it is great as a base for your eye shadow.</li>
    <li> I love the bright colors and the pencils just glide on. I don&#x27;t have to keep scraping powder. There is a color for just about everything I wear. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that their is no brown. I would still buy this again and plan in the future.</li>
    <li> The LA COLORS eyeshadow pens are the best. I use them for top and bottom eyelids and majority of the colors show on my skin tone ( medium/ dark ) and last all day!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this pencils are soft easy to use&lt;br /&gt;beautiful colors and great quality too if you buy this&lt;br /&gt;for sure like and have great price too , come in perfect&lt;br /&gt;shape and on time</li>
    <li> I love LA colors brand. so smooth and easy to use. they dont have that old smell like others I had purchase.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin, but for the money, it is very worth it.  I still haven&#x27;t tried all the colors yet-- there are so many!</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money so excited to use yyyaaayyyy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this find. It has all the colors I need. The pencils make it easy to apply. You can wear it deeply colored or barely there. I want my make-up there but subtle. Love these color pencils!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I love having a variety of colors and eye shadow sticks are easier to apply than powder version, but most sticks go for upwards of 2 dollars a piece. This set is basically $1 per stick plus a sharpener, so it&#x27;s an amazing buy! The colors are vibrant and apply very easily, just like my other more expensive eye shadow sticks that I&#x27;ve used for the past few months. My only complaint is that one had a broken tip, but since the product is like a paste (sorry if that sounds gross), I just pushed it back into the container and it&#x27;s now usable, so it&#x27;s not a major problem. Two of the colors had repeats, but one was in my favorite color light blue and the other was in my second fave color electric purple, so another non-issue. I also got 25 sticks, even though they advertised 24. It also arrived after only 3 or 4 days (with free shipping), even though I live on the opposite side of the country, which is super fast. This literally has been my best experience with an Amazon sold product and I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase. If I ever run out, that is!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THESE A GOOD 6MONS AGO AND STILL HAVE ALL THESE AND THEY SUCK !!! NOW I JUST USE THEM AS SHADOW BASE AND I GUESS THEY WORK OK AS THAT.. BUT I WONT PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> I agree with what others have said - GREAT buy, tons and tons of colors (all shown, it looks like, across those 3 pics), and they do go on very smoothly.  I wanted to add 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;-One of my pencils, still sealed, arrived with the tip broken off, and the seller (Chimayo) was awesome!  Sent me a replacement, no hassle having to return the messed up one (which I had offered to do).&lt;br /&gt;-In the week or so that i&#x27;ve had them - and i&#x27;ve only played with maybe 10-11 of them -- a couple more have sorta fallen off their base or the tip got bent, maybe because of the summer heat, but anyway it happens easily.  BUT, it is not that big of a deal, it turns out, to sort of mush them back in place.  (I&#x27;d probably be more annoyed if there weren&#x27;t so very many pencils included.)  And most of the pencils have NOT done that.  I&#x27;m going with 5 stars instead of 4 because of how great the pencils are, and what an outstanding deal this is at $29 - barely over a dollar per pencil and free shipping, wow.</li>
    <li> I originaly got these because i like to line my lower lids with gold and i have had a hard time finding goog gold liners, these were cheap and i got a lot of colors so i figured i would try it out. I am soo glad i did! I think i have now used every color and love them all. My only complaint would be if i apply a lot on my eyes in place of shadow they crease but i can easily prevent that by setting it with spray or powder so its not much of a complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it came with a sharpener and it is awesome as well!</li>
    <li> I took a chance on these eye shadows because the price for the variety of colors was super tempting. However, when I got them some were broken and one had this glue like stuff all over the crayon and lid. It was gross and disappointing.  The colors are super pretty, but I had to send them back. The seller was understanding so that is a plus in their favor. If you order these eye shadow pencils you are taking a risk in the condition you get them. Beware!</li>
    <li> The colors are great. Good selection, some for both me and my daughter. Product is only in the tip, as far as I can tell it can not be sharpened. A few of the pencils tips are broken, rendering them useless but the remaining ones are nice. The color goes on smooth and bright and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the money. They are not as long as I thought they would be but I can&#x27;t compare them to the NYX jumbo pencils because I have never seen them in person. I thought they would be the same length as a regular eyeshadow pencil. But that doesn&#x27;t matter since there are so many colors to choose from. They came 6 days earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> The color lasts ALL DAY!!! LOVE IT! However, the colors can break in the pencil from time to time. One of the greens broke and I lost a good two inches of it. BUT, I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Most of these colors are very natural. A lot of browns and grey, black, and white. Then a few vibrant colors. I was hoping for a little more variety in color. But over all, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> There are so many colours to choose from, you can coordinate with all your clothes/accessories. They are very quick and simple to use, the product goes on the eye very easily, you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over and over just to get out a descent bit of colour. You don&#x27;t have to worry about holding the shadow and using a brush, excellent for when you&#x27;re in a rush to get somewhere. These will also be great for me as I travel alot and are so much more convenient than a big plastic square tray of colours.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to try these on. They went on very smooth and light and are pleasantly scented. Would&#x27;ve liked a wider variety of colours but I  do like them for a quick fix for my work makeup.</li>
    <li> This was great!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love them!! The colors are beautiful and so many to choose from to work (or play) with :)&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re inexpensive and easy to use! I have 4 tips that broke off though... but I still think They&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love all the color choices. I like that a sharpener was included in the set.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.</li>
