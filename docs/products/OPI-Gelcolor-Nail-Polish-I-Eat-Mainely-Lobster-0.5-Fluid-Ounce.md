      <li>It&#x27;s a nice coral with a shimmer/sparkle to it.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice summery color with a bit of sparkle added for interest.  </li>
      <li>Color is fairly close to the label on the top of the bottle (brush handle).</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s beautiful and exactly the color of a lobster if you think about it.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t bought a top coat yet, so presumably once you put that on top it will have a nice shine.</li>
      <li>The color is a lot more orange that the picture shows</li>
      <li>Love it for spring and summer.</li>
      <li>I did 3 coats just to be sure it wouldn&#x27;t turn out too seethrough.</li>
      <li>I really love the color and quality of the product.</li>
      <li>I started wearing this at the salon, then they ran out, gad Iwa able to buy a bottle just for me and have them use it on my manicures!&lt;br /</li>

      <li>I tried to take pictures of it, but the camera didn&#x27;t capture the slight shimmer or how great the color is in person.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Thanks OPI!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and quick to dry.</li>
      <li>Large selection of colors.</li>
      <li>The shiny gloss comes off after you cure and with off the tacky residue, and it looks very matte.  </li>
      <li>I love this color, its a bright orangey pink with a subtle shimmer.</li>
      <li>I had bought it in regular polish and was so excited that it comes in the gel color too.</li>
      <li>Love the color, but its extremely runny!</li>
      <li>The color shrinks back from the tip of your nail if you don&#x27;t work somewhat quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but once you see it in person, you&#x27;ll fall in love!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a little more red/orange after viewing another person&#x27;s review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this color on myself and at least 2 other people and it&#x27;s looked great on all of us.</li>
      <li>It takes some time to soak it off but it is totally worth the long lasting wear and shine.</li>

    <li> Perfect bright coral color. Love it for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> Perfect coral for the summer. I had bought it in regular polish and was so excited that it comes in the gel color too. The color shrinks back from the tip of your nail if you don&#x27;t work somewhat quickly but it doens&#x27;t keep me from using it</li>
    <li> Always a fan of OPI.  Color is fairly close to the label on the top of the bottle (brush handle).</li>
    <li> The color is a lot more orange that the picture shows but it&#x27;s beautiful and exactly the color of a lobster if you think about it. This polish goes perfectly with all gel systems and it lasts a long time. Also, this polish is very easy to use and goes on beautifully.</li>
    <li> Very bright color. I would describe as coral. I was expecting a little more red/orange after viewing another person&#x27;s review. Not completely what I was expecting but a great color.</li>
    <li> This is a nice summery color with a bit of sparkle added for interest.  OPI products always deliver.</li>
    <li> This color is awesome. Goes on smooth and looks fabulous.  I get compliments all the time when people see my nails.  If your looking for a great salmon color this is the one for you.  Thanks OPI!</li>
    <li> It was amazing and great price.I really love the color and quality of the product. Easy to use and quick to dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice coral with a shimmer/sparkle to it.  OPI is the best gel on the market, adheres nicely and is opaque after 2 coats.  Stayed 3 weeks where others lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this company and product! I ordered this polish along with another one and only one arrived and the other one never made it. I contacted the company and no questions asked...they offered to send out another one and did so immediately. I will definitely be doing business with them again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this color on myself and at least 2 other people and it&#x27;s looked great on all of us. I didn&#x27;t experience shrinkage. This color is the perfect coral, not too fiery, not pastely at all</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described and on time, color is super cute, I received lots of compliments the first time I wore it.  Easy to apply and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this! I started wearing this at the salon, then they ran out, gad Iwa able to buy a bottle just for me and have them use it on my manicures!&lt;br /&gt; I even bought a regular bottle just in case...</li>
    <li> Perfect coral color it does have shimmer it the application is perfect no shrinking at all. i would say anyone could use this color.</li>
    <li> I love this color, its a bright orangey pink with a subtle shimmer. The shiny gloss comes off after you cure and with off the tacky residue, and it looks very matte.  The color was still pretty, but that was a slight disappointment.  I hadn&#x27;t bought a top coat yet, so presumably once you put that on top it will have a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color. It is a shimmering coral not to red not to orange. It takes some time to soak it off but it is totally worth the long lasting wear and shine. Tried a different brands no light need gel and came back to opi gel color the same day.  Opi gels have great staying power. You get back to life as soon as they are cured and buffed with alchol. Large selection of colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of a neon orangey red color (great for Spring) and has some sparkle. I would say it looks good on all skin tones. Love!</li>
    <li> Love the color, but its extremely runny! I did 3 coats just to be sure it wouldn&#x27;t turn out too seethrough. Overall, like but not love</li>

I tried to take pictures of it, but the camera didn&#x27;t capture the slight shimmer or how great the color is in person. The color definitely has a hint of pink, but not too pink. It&#x27;s also not too orange, either. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but once you see it in person, you&#x27;ll fall in love!</li>
