      <li>Happy....</li>
      <li>and I am happy I found it.</li>
      <li>The shampoo works great on my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>It smells good and works great.</li>
      <li>I have used TriDerma product for some years now and I have my thought of it as a really good product.</li>
      <li>Good over-the-counter product.</li>
      <li>The Tri Derma products are all good.</li>
      <li>This is good shampoo and makes my head not itch.</li>
      <li>So glad this product exists!  </li>
      <li>Helps to keep flaking in better control.</li>
      <li>This works better</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, except make my scalp more tender and flaky.</li>
      <li>The Psoriasis control worked ok but in it&#x27;s defense I think my scalp problem is to advanced for just Psoriasis shampoo.</li>
      <li>I think the Psoriasis Control Shampoo would have worked fine.</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t so advanced</li>
      <li>And luckily it doesn&#x27;t smell funny :-)</li>
      <li>or it gets super greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently developed patches of psoriasis on my scalp along my hairline in the most noticeable and embarrassing places.</li>
      <li>Really like all the products!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>and I get so much relief.</li>
      <li>and she really likes it.</li>
      <li>I hate to say it, but it is not as effective as the Psoriasin shampoo and even using this I create a flurry of &amp;#34;snowflakes&amp;#34; when I brush my hair, but so far this is the most effective product I have found</li>
      <li>No strong odor which is nice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It completely got rid of a large patch on my thigh.  </li>
      <li>The first 2 washes did nothing noticeable for the psoriasis patches, but the little tube of serum stuff that came with the shampoo did a good job of keeping it from flaking; and then by the 3rd wash, I started noticing a big difference.</li>
      <li>I was in a panic because the Psoriasin lotion and cream does not help me at all and the shampoo was great for my scalp and also scales on my back and behind my ears.  </li>
      <li>When Psoriasin suddenly stopped making their shampoo available to the public  </li>
      <li>Not knowing the different between dandruff and psoriasis, I tried some selson blue dandruff shampoo which did absolutely nothing, and then ordered this based on its reviews and that it was color-safe.</li>

    <li> It is ok. Helped a little bit But I think I need something stronger.</li>
    <li> When Psoriasin suddenly stopped making their shampoo available to the public  I was in a panic because the Psoriasin lotion and cream does not help me at all and the shampoo was great for my scalp and also scales on my back and behind my ears.  It completely got rid of a large patch on my thigh.  I was going crazy until I found this.  I hate to say it, but it is not as effective as the Psoriasin shampoo and even using this I create a flurry of &amp;#34;snowflakes&amp;#34; when I brush my hair, but so far this is the most effective product I have found and I am happy I found it.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo and makes my head not itch.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it &amp;#34;wouldn&#x27;t strip color-treated hair&amp;#34;. Seemed to work as described for me! And luckily it doesn&#x27;t smell funny :-) Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> The meds the doctor prescribed cost $600.00. This works better and I get so much relief. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So glad this product exists!  I thought I was doomed to either have nasty dandruff or nasty rashes from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; dandruff control shampoos.  Seems to be working well.  Little to no fragrance.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great on my color treated hair. The Psoriasis control worked ok but in it&#x27;s defense I think my scalp problem is to advanced for just Psoriasis shampoo. I think I need a prescription medication.  If it weren&#x27;t so advanced I think the Psoriasis Control Shampoo would have worked fine.</li>
    <li> Helps to keep flaking in better control. No strong odor which is nice.</li>
    <li> It works on itching scalp.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, except make my scalp more tender and flaky. I am not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> After using it for a couple times my itchy scalp and buildup was gone.  It smells good and works great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped control the problem while preserving the color applied to my hair.</li>
    <li> I started getting bumps around my hairline that hurt. I have used TriDerma product for some years now and I have my thought of it as a really good product. No Cortizones... Happy.... so I got this shampoo and washed my hair 2x and went to bed. The bumps were flat the next day and almost gone. Works Good For Me !!!!</li>
    <li> As advertised!  Does the job. I got RID of a problem that I&#x27;d had forr years.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently developed patches of psoriasis on my scalp along my hairline in the most noticeable and embarrassing places. Not knowing the different between dandruff and psoriasis, I tried some selson blue dandruff shampoo which did absolutely nothing, and then ordered this based on its reviews and that it was color-safe. I have waist-length hair and can only wash it every 3-4 days or it gets super greasy. The first 2 washes did nothing noticeable for the psoriasis patches, but the little tube of serum stuff that came with the shampoo did a good job of keeping it from flaking; and then by the 3rd wash, I started noticing a big difference. And now after a month of using it, the patches are actually gone. I only use it on my scalp and use my regular shampoo on the rest of my hair, so I&#x27;m only having to use a little of the TriDerma at a time, which will hopefully make it last a long time. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good over-the-counter product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Aunt and she really likes it. Really like all the products!</li>
    <li> The Tri Derma products are all good. I used the shampoo, and cream to help me along when I had a horrible scalp psoriassis. Along with taking a Boron supplement every day (which I still take), it finally went away!</li>
