      <li>Otherwise, this is a good product.</li>
      <li>It does heat up, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing, it drys your hair faster.  </li>
      <li>It is good for conditioning treatments, though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea</li>
      <li>In theory this is a good idea</li>
      <li>The fit was perfect when the dryer was off but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head when the dryer was turned on.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>This product worked good for a week, after that the strings came off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it works perfectly with my hair dryer and takes no space (which is important for me) and it&#x27;s easy to pack it when traveling!</li>

      <li>I love this dryer attachment!  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I am a freelance hair stylist and this is a great product to use because it&#x27;s easy to carry.</li>
      <li>works fine and great to take when traveling</li>
      <li>Its amazing.</li>
      <li>It was a bit of a challenge to get it to fit on my blow dryer, but after accomplishing that, it worked great.</li>
      <li>Amazing is all I can say</li>
      <li>I use this when I am catching up on my emails or browsing because it is a hands free alternative, great way to heat up the coditioning treatments..</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s better than nothing and the plastic seems good quality.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a dryer with hot/warm/cool/low/high settings like the Rvdr5029.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, I own two blow dryers...</li>
      <li>And it also has a tendency to slide off of my head while drying (the drawstring is not as effective as i would like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shorter hair</li>
      <li>But It’s so effective and</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Has anyone experienced success with this product?</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and my hair</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, especially good for deep conditioning treatments or using curlers.  </li>
      <li>Attaching the elastic opening to the end of my dryer hose makes drying very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>but hey, don&#x27;t knock it till you try it :)&lt;</li>
      <li>works ok.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend thinks it looks hilarious</li>
      <li>Buy it, it&#x27;s all it says and more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s going to be challenging to keep the bonnet from blowing off.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this BONNET</li>
      <li>There are much better on the market.</li>
      <li>This bonnet is ok for the price</li>
      <li>i have no bad news for this product its wonderfull and gets the job done!!!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great product</li>
      <li>So hurry up and BYE :)</li>
      <li>Get a better one.</li>
      <li>I noticed that some people had an issue with it fitting on their dryer.</li>
      <li>so this is a much better way to get hair done.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this hood, I can read or do something while drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanx to the inventor of this product:)</li>
      <li>Overall, great purchase!</li>
      <li>The drawstring doesn&#x27;t secure the bonnet on your head, at all!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It get super hot!!!!</li>
      <li>I did my daughters hair in a twist out after washing and her hair was dry after 30 mintues, very happy with purchaes</li>
      <li>The dryer doesn&#x27;t fly off of my head and when it gets too hot, I just press the cool button on my dryer.</li>
      <li>If you are adding light heat to a conditioning treatment then i guess maybe just make sure u have a scrunchi to keep it on your head.</li>
      <li>I use the lowest setting because this will burn you on the top of the head, its cheap made&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Need to find a better way to secure product to the head.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the company for the good deal.</li>
      <li>This is so easy to use and store.  </li>
      <li>Its compact and easy to carry.</li>
      <li>and easy to set up and use</li>
      <li>If that string could be changed for a strong elastic band, the problem would be solved.  </li>
      <li>Although the ring includes strong elastic, it does not stick to the surface of the dryer nozzle.</li>
      <li>I automatically went for the Huetiful Hair Steamer because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it from many people, and thought that justified the $100 price tag.</li>
      <li>But this time I can honestly say I&#x27;ve uncovered a real find!</li>
      <li>Knocking a star down because the tightening strap doesn&#x27;t work the greatest</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, works just as described. Knocking a star down because the tightening strap doesn&#x27;t work the greatest but  it still serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> I ought it because it was cheap and I wanted something to dry my hair fast when I do a roller set. But it won&#x27;t stay on my head with the string (the string broke the second time I used it). I have to secure it with a headband.</li>
    <li> Ordered after looking to long. Buy it, it&#x27;s all it says and more. Nothing like old hat box soft dryers.&lt;br /&gt;work and dry. No tired arms. Great.</li>
    <li> This would work if it was elasticized.  It isn&#x27;t, it is done with a draw string.  So as soon as you use the air, the blowing up pulls the draw string open.  Not a good design at all.</li>
    <li> The adjustable string on the bonnet broke after two uses. And even with the adjustable strings it still does not stay on your head. You have to constantly keep re-adjusting the stings because the entire bonnet is very poorly made. Really sucks because I really thought I would get more use out of this then my dryer I actually have to sit under, but I was wrong. It was a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on head.</li>
    <li> It gets really hot I learned after my first experience with it just put you blow dryer at warm/high or hot/low. The negatives were the string thing doesn&#x27;t stay put I actually had to wrap a hair net around the bonnet to stay in place, the air only circulates around the edges after n hr with this thing on my hair in the middle was still wet, and the last neg will be its hard to keep on the blow dryer maybe if they did a cap on it like the attachments for the dryer maybe it&#x27;ll stay put</li>
    <li> I really use this thing,I do my own roller and this thing make it easy to dry,it works very good.</li>
    <li> i use it for my conditioner treatments. i don&#x27;t use it for anything else. i guess it does what it states.</li>
    <li> was very nice and came faster than expected.</li>
    <li> This item does not stay on your head when you attach the blow dryer. The string is not sufficient to hold the hood on your head. It is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Great time-saver!  I roll up the front of my hair and can do other stuff while it dries!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty but the draw string system that&#x27;s suppose to secure the bonnet to your head doesn&#x27;t work, so the bonnet continuously blows off your head.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Will not stay on the blow dryer once you turn on the power. I even tried securing it with a rubber band. It just won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get it to stay on my head.  My niece had same problem.  You have to hold it with one hand while on your head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does the job but once the air fills up if you don&#x27;t hold it it blows off your head.</li>
    <li> This Bonet appears to perform as described, however, I have not used it enough to know if it was built to last.</li>
    <li> This product was received promply (within a week) and it attached to my old hair dry plus it works great.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work. The draw string to keep it tight loosens as soon as you let go. I had to use a hair elastic to keep on my head from blowing off. If you are using it for DRYING do not by. If you are adding light heat to a conditioning treatment then i guess maybe just make sure u have a scrunchi to keep it on your head. smh annoying. NOT for rollerset drying or dreadlock style drying. Currently shopping for another one as we speak</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a bonnet hair dryer, and after reading many horrible reviews and some good reviews, I ended up going the cheap route and buying this bonnet which connects to the hair dryer I already own.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend my money on one of the expensive ones because this works perfectly!  I had to fight the thing to get it onto my hair dryer at first (mine has a rather wide nose), but once on, I had no problems.  The adjustable head strap is great.  I have a medium sized head, but it could fit a head much larger than mine or much smaller because of the draw string.  I turned my dryer on low, and I just rested it on a chair behind me while doing dishes or sitting at my computer.  The tube is long enough that you have some freedom in where you put your dryer.  The tube doesn&#x27;t have to be perfectly straight for it to work either.  It heated my head evenly, considering the tube connects in one place, but I guess it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s so much space inside the bubble.  If my head ever got too hot, I would just put my dryer on cool for a minute or so, then back to heat.  I kept my ears outside the bonnet.  I&#x27;ve used it with pin curls and 1-1/2\\&quot; sponge rollers, and there was still room to spare.  My hair dried completely in about an hour (I have mid-back length hair), although it might be faster.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and I just haven&#x27;t tried taking it off sooner.  Now I just want to use it all the time!  The only thing I disliked about wet sets was the drying time, and now I don&#x27;t have to sleep in pin curls overnight!</li>
    <li> Did not like it, because the air from the blow dryer would blow off the cap</li>
    <li> The bonnet works as promised.  There is no need to hold up the blow dyer in order to receive the full air flow you need to dry your hair like other ones do.  It does get pretty hot under there but if you leave your blow dryer at a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting you should be fine utilizing it for 20-30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Make sure to have a basic blow dryer (nozzle that is round).  The bonnet will not fit into a wide end blow dyer.  Other than that the item is a great buy.</li>
    <li> It works great for wraps. It takes a few hours to dry my roller sets.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great because it works perfectly with my hair dryer and takes no space (which is important for me) and it&#x27;s easy to pack it when traveling! Most hotels have hand-held hair dryers so no need to pack my dryer too - just the bonnet! I didn&#x27;t rate it at 5 only because I wish the drawstring were a little bit tighter.</li>
    <li> I like he product for the price but it does leave some parts damp. Also it does float up when turn the dryer on if there&#x27;s nothing on you hair such as curlers.</li>
    <li> The hole to place on the blow dryer is extremely small so I had to use my blow dryer attachment first to be able to secure it on. Also, the string isn&#x27;t tight enough so at times the bonnet can blow right off your head. I&#x27;ve had to hold it multiple times. Overall, it does get the job done of drying your hair.</li>
    <li> It only fits dryers with tiny nosles. I had to go out and buy a new dryer. Otherwise, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.  It blows right off.  The clasp does not tighten to keep it on.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  It allows for great hands-free drying and the nozzle piece fit perfectly over the nozzle of my hair dryer (though it might not fit if your dryer has a very wide nozzle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it can get very hot, and you may need something to cover your ears like at the salon. And it also has a tendency to slide off of my head while drying (the drawstring is not as effective as i would like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shorter hair so I don&#x27;t know if big rollers will fit underneath it like with a hooded dryer, but it works well with a perm rod set for tighter curls.</li>
    <li> hot setting is too hot&lt;br /&gt;draw string hood tightener doesn&#x27;t work well&lt;br /&gt;Asking me for 8 more words is annoying</li>
    <li> This is not sturdy and once you connect the blow dryer you will have to end up holding it to keep it on your head. I would not recommend buying this. Get a regular sit under dryer and wait it out. This product is flimsy and a waste of time.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical when I found this product online.  I wet-set my hair with magnetic rollers every night and use a soft bonnet dryer to partially dry the hair, only if I roll it too late at night.  My soft bonnet dryer recently formed holes in the hose, so I had to send it back to the manufacturer for a replacement, which left me w/out a dryer. That&#x27;s when I ordered the EZ Blow Dryer Bonnet, which arrived in 3 rapid days. I just used it and this thing really works! The very spacious bonnet perfectly fits over large rollers, with much room left for comfort. I, however, recommend use on low blow dryer speed and, by the way, it says it fits any blow dryer nozzle but it actually doesn&#x27;t. The nozzle must be narrow in order for the opening of the bonnet&#x27;s hose to even go over it. Thankfully, I own two blow dryers...one with a narrow nozzle (Silver Bird Conair Pro.)and one with a wide nozzle (Conair Gel Grips), which it would not fit, no matter how hard I tried. The drawstring locks in place after you position the bonnet around your head and push the black locking button. You will feel some air escaping on the sides of your head, but the hair is still thorougly drying in the process, which is pretty quick, and the bonnet expands to cover your entire head comfortably. I only hope and pray this product will last for years to come (plastic doesn&#x27;t seem very thick and durable) because I absolutely love it.  God bless the person who invented it! Price was very reasonable, too!  Thanks, hairproducts.com (All Essentials, Inc.)!</li>
    <li> This bonnet looked like a real winner when we found it on the Amazon website, so we ordered it to replace the worn out bonnet that came with one of my wife&#x27;s former hair dryers. It has lots of nice features; it even creates a pillow of warm air around the user&#x27;s head to create a gentle warmth instead of blasting hot air into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, there are two major problems with this unit. 1. The ring that is supposed to hold the hose on the dryer is too slippery to hold it in place. The ring needed to be lined with rubber so that it would not keep slipping off during use. Although the ring includes strong elastic, it does not stick to the surface of the dryer nozzle. We had to wrap cloth adhesive tape around the dryer nozzle to hold the hose in place. 2. The inside part of the bonnet is larger than the outside, so it expands inward and pushes the unit off of your head, instead of allowing a free flow of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely a redesign is in order. Has anyone experienced success with this product?</li>
    <li> The drawstring doesn&#x27;t tighten up tight enough, so the bonnet keep slipping of my head as soon as I turn the dryer on.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  no sitting half a day waiting for my hair to dry up in curlers. This dries my hair in 20 or so minutes and my hair is super thick and course.</li>
    <li> This worked fine, I use it when I color my hair.  The only problem I had was I had to keep tightening the cord that holds the bonnet on your head but that may be because my head is small.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer attachment!  The bonnet stays on and the attachment worked very well with my standard blow dryer which allows me to use it with cool air.  I am an African-American woman with natural hair so I do not use heat often, but when I need to get my hair dry in a hurry, this is the product I go to!</li>
    <li> I use it when I travel</li>
    <li> This helped me maintain my hair in college this is defiantly worth buying . So hurry up and BYE :)</li>
    <li> This bonnet works very well for deep-heat conditioning of the hair.  The drawstring is a bit uncomfortable because the hot air pulls it up tightly against your head.  Nevertheless, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It was a bit of a challenge to get it to fit on my blow dryer, but after accomplishing that, it worked great. Thanks to the company for the good deal. It arrived it great time, and was a good price.</li>
    <li> Dryer gets extremely hot around the hairline.  It was difficult to get my hair dry at the crown. I had difficulty getting the cap tight enough to stay in place.  Takes more time to dry hair than typical hood dryer.  Its compact and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> BUT I had to secure it with Velcro.  It was super hard to get on, so I&#x27;m afraid to take it off to use the hairdryer.  It&#x27;s great to take on vacation and I had to use it when the piece of crap gold-n-hot hair bonnet dryer I had broke.  I&#x27;ll mainly use it for backup and travel.</li>
    <li> The draw string on the head piece is loose and doesn&#x27;t hold tight so when I turn my blow dryer on it just blows blows right off. I usually have to put a towel or something on to hold it down. Other than that it a good/useful product.</li>
    <li> Every time I put the blow dryer into the opening it comes off. Plus it&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Hooked up to blow dryer when outta shower, didn&#x27;t get my hair dry as I wanted it to be, I have really thick curly hair it&#x27;s a real pain to get it dry.</li>
    <li> This product is useless because the toggle latch on the drawstring does not lock so when I turn on the dryer, the bonnet flies off my head.</li>
    <li> If you have alot of hair,  this is not for you.  Also the bonnet does not really stay on your head.  So I used one hand to keep it on my head and the other for the blow dryer.  Great arm workout but I didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used this product on several attempts but did not like it. The fit was perfect when the dryer was off but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head when the dryer was turned on. The bonnet kept slipping off of my head messing up my hairstyle still not drying the hair. I would not recommend this product, and if it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble I would have returned the item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the reviews and it does fit to my dryer but I have to hold bonnet with both the hand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> If you add your blow dryer to the end the presser up top is too much so you have to hold in down in order for it to stay on your head.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the reviews and it doesn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer with is a standard size nozzle.  I can see it not fitting the large ones but it states it fits all sizes.  I can&#x27;t use it :(.  I assume that if you can get it on your dryer it will work well.</li>
    <li> 1. The elastic on the hose was so snug it took almost 10 minutes for my arthritic fingers to get it onto the end of my very average conair dryer. since I got this to try and make it easier to dry my hair due to my arthritis, this is a point against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.The spring clamp on the adjustment strings for the hood constantly comes apart. And even if it didnt, it is too flimsy to put enough tension on the strings to hold them tight. The slightest movement causes the strings to loosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Related to above, as soon as the hood inflates,it levitates right off your head. I&#x27;m sure one could hold it down, but that again defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. If you manage to keep it on your head, approximately 45 seconds after turning the dryer on, it will overheat and turn itself off, because despite the vent holes in the hose, it still gets hot enough at the nozzle from the hose containing the hot air, that it will shut itself off for the next 5 minutes. Dunno about you, but my hair takes longer than 45 seconds to dry. Conair dryers are pretty standard, so I know I can&#x27;t be the only one with this issue. And yes, the intake vents are clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will be buying a real bonnet dryer instead of trying to make a regular blow dryer makeshift.</li>
    <li> This fit my Revlon blowdryer. I used it for curlers and it fit on my head. It was fine on low/warm setting on dryer, not too hot like some of the other reviews stated. The tube is long enough to leave dryer on vanity while doing makeup.</li>
    <li> This bonnet is ok for the price but it is very hard for this to stay on the head once it is attached to the blow dryer. It keeps blowing off. I tighten the bungee ties but it still blows off. I cant complain too much as I only paid $10.00 but would be nice if they improve this in the future.</li>
    <li> this would be an awesome dryer if the bonnet stayed in place. it does NOT. I should&#x27;ve listened to the others who reviewed this product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this worked...... even on my small hair dryer. My boyfriend thinks it looks hilarious but hey, don&#x27;t knock it till you try it :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it. it can take a bit of time though. So just be patient.</li>
    <li> My hair dried in half the time, and that is saying something bc my hair takes an entire day to air dry.  In 20 min, my hair was dry.  Its amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is sort of &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34;.  It will work for a few heated conditioning treatments but not for any duration.&lt;br /&gt;Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural and often do twist hair styles.  This bonnet does not stay on my head tightly which is disappointing.  It put out alot of heat but keeps blowing off my head.  The dryer gets you hair dry</li>
    <li> Material is very thin. The part that u should put ur blow dryer is quite tiny. When I try to stretch it seems it&#x27;s gonna tear off..  Haven&#x27;t used it yet though</li>
    <li> fits the end of my blowdryer just fine, but to have an outlet for the air, the drawstring doesn&#x27;t tighten very much, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to keep on your head unless you have a bunch of curlers to keep it on.  They should have put a few small holes in it to allow the air out.  But on the whole, it was well worth the $5.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly. Haven&#x27;t used it yet. Don&#x27;t have a need for it anymore. Plan to give to my niece as she is going to school for cosmetology.</li>
    <li> I tried and tried and tried to get this thing to stay on my head while blow drying my wrap. No. The string is not stretchy or designed well enough and doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough around your head to keep the cap from popping off of your head when the blow dryer is on anything above low. I tried using stretchy headbands, ribbon, clips, clamps...anything to keep this glorified metallic bag on my head. Eventually, I gave up after an hour+ of struggling, sweating and looking like a bad science experiment, for only the outer layer of my hair to dry.</li>
    <li> I use the lowest setting because this will burn you on the top of the head, its cheap made&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a month</li>
    <li> IT FITS THE DRYER WELL, HOWEVER WHEN TURNED ON, IT DOESNOT STAY ON MY HEAD.</li>
    <li> If I could give tho negative stars I would. Total waste of money. I was excited when the hose fit over my only blow dryer only to be disappointed when I turned it on and the bonnet flew off even on he lowest setting. Will pursue a refund.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how anyone keeps this on their head as the blow drier is on. The clip doesn&#x27;t work and it doesn&#x27;t tighten. I put a differ cord on it and hold it with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;I does help dry my hair and keeps curls but there must be an easier way to help this on my head. It&#x27;s just such a cheap item.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing that I should buy these bonnets because of their efficiency and I saw how good the reviews were so I really couldn&#x27;t resist. It&#x27;s true, it does get hot really easily, especially on concentrated areas of the head, but my other issues are the it&#x27;s really easy to blow off, and the string doesn&#x27;t hold it very tightly to your head. That aside, it really gets the job done and that&#x27;s something I can appreciate.</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry chemically processed hair and have done basically everything ever recommended to keep my hair moisturized. Deep conditioning often has been the answer to my dry hair problems, and to get the best conditioning treatments you need a good way to apply heat to the hair so that the product could really seep through your strands. I automatically went for the Huetiful Hair Steamer because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it from many people, and thought that justified the $100 price tag. Though the Huetiful worked in making my moisturizing hair products penetrate my hair, it always bothered me that the hood didn&#x27;t completely cover my head, and therefore, never got to treat all of my hair. It was also annoying to use because you couldn&#x27;t use tap water with it to create the steam, and had to messily measure out water and clean out the machine often, among other things. I ended up not using it anymore. Thankfully, I saw that this bonnet was offered with a good price and it had great reviews so i decided to try it out. It looked simple enough and i liked that it looked like it covered the whole head! I had some trouble at first with it slipping off my head, but using the medium setting on my dryer (high causes my bonnet to fly off!) and pulling the bonnet down lower on my face, along with tightening the draw string well is the method that works for me. I only use it for 15 minutes per use, so I could deal with it covering some of my face. So here&#x27;s what i think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Not bulky (Great for travel!)&lt;br /&gt;-Fast and easy to set up and use&lt;br /&gt;-Allows product to penetrate hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Does NOT fit ALL hair dryers... Smaller circumferences are the best&lt;br /&gt;-Took me a while to find a comfortable way for it to stay on my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t involved wireless technology, or any electronics, or anything to that nature. This should be a relatively simple product. The first complain that I have is that it doesn&#x27;t stay securely on my head. I have to the string into a know for it to stay on. Not too much of a big deal, but then if the bonnet isn&#x27;t sitting exactly right, then it burns. Alright, well if it burns then common sense says turn the heat setting down, which I did. I watched two 1 hour television shows and my hair still wasn&#x27;t dry. I bought another dryer to see if I will have the same issue, but this shouldn&#x27;t this complicated. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, not even a dog.</li>
    <li> The elastic end doesn&#x27;t stay on the blowdryer nozzle. When I turn the dryer on the burst of air even at a low level, blows the end off. I have to tie string around the elastic end to keep it attached to the dryer.</li>
    <li> Works great and drys my hair efficiently, dried a style in rollers in 30 minutes! Gets very hot on high so medium heat will work!</li>
    <li> i didnt like this at all! the top does not even distribute the heat properly and the air pressure from the dryer basically blows the cap off your head. i basically had to hold the cap down the whole time. it didnt dry my hair let alone provide heat.  id recommend one of the caps the plugs into the wall instead</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re already in the review section, you&#x27;re 3/4ths of the way to purchasing this and having a good experience.  Like other buyers, I noticed that the part that attaches to the hair dryer was kind of small.  Luckily I bought a new hair dryer at the same time with this in mind, so everything worked out well (Revlon Rvdr5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer, if you&#x27;re interested).  The bonnet also gets pretty hot so it&#x27;s nice to have a dryer with hot/warm/cool/low/high settings like the Rvdr5029.  I mostly use this for conditioning treatments and setting curls, and noticed that having a shower/processing cap on also helps keep the heat directly off your scalp so you don&#x27;t melt your head like a Barbie doll on a grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the drawstring closure, it is definitely cheap.  And maybe this only works because I already have a big head and I&#x27;m usually wearing curlers, but I noticed if I tie a loose knot after I move the little plastic piece into place, the bonnet stays on.  All in all, I feel like this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Not useful at all.  It won&#x27;t stay on head.  I tried to give it a try a couple of times.  I just stuck in my drawer and will pull it out as a last resort.</li>
    <li> Not so goot . It fly away from head. ... have to keep it with hands till end. Won&#x27;t stay on .... how ever keep head hot and eventually dry!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I have a larger head. LOL not sure if I have he brain to go with, but I do have smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is exactly \\&quot; you get what you pay for\\&quot;. Snug fit on the blow dryer,but.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head for nothing!  The spring in the push grip on the rope is not strong enough to hold back a butterfly sneeze. So...here I am one hand holding the dryer and one hand trying to keep the bonnet from flying off my head. Must have been funny to see!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got out 2 of my thin, very strong rubber sports head bands, and looped one through the handle of the dry and hung it on the bathroom door, and the other I took two clothes pins and clipped them on either side of my face along with the rubber head band, made a great chin strap. Keeps it in place and is almost as amusing as the other dance, only this time I have free hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to see ICU wanted to spend the extra money on a real bonnet hair dryer. I haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet, but with a little finagling it works well.</li>
    <li> It get super hot!!!! So hot my friend couldnt even stand to have it on her head long! I had to only put the dryer in half way to mitigate the heat.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, but the drawstring closer doesn&#x27;t stay secure. I usually end up holding it onto my head with my hand. But it&#x27;s better than nothing and the plastic seems good quality. Hasn&#x27;t stretched, cracked or ripped.</li>
    <li> Best portable, cheap substitute for a hooded hairdryer. I absolutely love this hood, I can read or do something while drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanx to the inventor of this product:)</li>
    <li> Sad to say I couldn&#x27;t find a way to keep it on my head. Maybe it would work with a larger head and curlers. My kids did have a blast putting it on and watching it blow up and fly off their head!</li>
    <li> over all it left my hair super soft with the treatment i used so it works great i have a standard blow dryer and it fit perfectly the only thing i did not like its the clip it has does not stay put i had to hold the back of the bag in place because the hot air would make it slide up but next time i will just put a clip to hold it tight over all i love the result of it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item one month ago, and I was so let down because it&#x27;s poorly made. The drawstring doesn&#x27;t secure the bonnet on your head, at all! I spent the whole drying time holding it closed. Also, the material on the \\&quot;tubing\\&quot; melted, however, this could be due to my blow dryer temperature. I will be ordering a different product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster than my actual heavy duty hair dryer like some reviews say it does but it&#x27;s okay. Oh, you can&#x27;t put your hand dryer on high with it cause every time I tried to do it, the entire bonnet kept blowing off my head (very frustrating). However, if you leave the dryer on low and have a few hours to do nothing with it can come in handy. You can&#x27;t watch tv with it on though, you don&#x27;t hair a thing. But reading a book can work out well. You have a lot more freedom to move with this product than an actual salon dryer but it just takes soooo long to dry. The last time I used it I stayed under it for 2 hours with my hand dryer on low and the middle of my hair was still wet.</li>
    <li> This dryer bonnet was delivered promptly. There were two in the package and I still haven&#x27;t opened the second one because the first one is still running like a champ.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I had big metal free standing hair dryer that took up space and was awkward to sit under. This product makes it so easy and much faster</li>
    <li> I would not buy this at all. It worked one time. The second time the edges separated and I tried to duct tape it together. Just invest in a real hair dryer. That is all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it.  This bonnet actually stays on your head when the hair dryer is on.  I bought a similar item at Sallys but the bonnet would just pop off of my head when ever I turned the hair dryer on.  Fortunately, I found this item online and decided to give it a try.  Because of the drawstring, the bonnet stays in place on your head so that you can finally get that deep conditioning treatment in.  Even the end at dryer end stayed put.  This bonnet is a great portable &amp; easily stored alternative to a hard hood bonnet.  I like it so much that I plan to get my Mom one as well..</li>
    <li> The drawstring isn&#x27;t that sturdy so once you turn on your blow dryer it&#x27;s going to be challenging to keep the bonnet from blowing off.</li>
    <li> I read the excellent comments about the EZ Dryer Bonnet, but I&#x27;m unable to assess it because I can&#x27;t get the band around my hand-held dryer. I know it has to be tight, but my hands are not strong enough to put it on.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> keeps falling off when i attach blow dryer. i have to hold it on my hands when i use it which is not good since it get really hot</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 Weeks ago because I read the reviews. This is nothing I would recommend Anyone. The bonnet has a drawstring to tighten, but when the dryer comes on the bonnet start to fly off. You have to constantly adjust it. It also gets hot and you can get burned, so watch out. This is the first time I used it and will be the last. Oh another thing, they do not give Refunds if you use it. Do not waste your money......</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this BONNET its so convenient and it helps hair dry quickly. The opening for the hair dyer fits my dryer perfectly. I have natural hair and I often do perm rod sets, this bonnet drys my hair so quickly. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Works as described, it does get tight when you put your blow dryer on its highest setting it will press tightly against your head, it will get really hot so to avoid that dont put it up high (obviously) &amp; if you pull the draw string comfortably tight to your head it will not blow off (duh) I put my dryer on its lowest setting and I had no problems I was comfortable... I didn&#x27;t get brunt or anything...yes it took longer to dry but its better than nothing or air drying. Money well spent. If your looking for a simple dryer for cheap for a deep condition or roller set I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i only wanted this dryer to do my deep conditiongs with and it is great!! it sure does get the job done and gets my whole head warm enough when im deep conditiong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the elastic to put your dryer through is a little too tight but once you get it on there and keep it on there for awhile then the elastic will eventually stretch out some more so it wont be so hard to put it on your dryer the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i havent used this to actually dry my hair because my hair usually is ok with air drying but as far as deep conditioning and other treatments go, this is a great inexpensive product to use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;loooove ittt !!</li>
    <li> Bonnet does not stay on my head once the dryer is turned on. It balloons up and off my head no matter how tightly I tie the draw string.</li>
    <li> Loose around head when dryer is on. No matter how tight you try and tighten it. ; (</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t fit over your head if you use big rollers. I forced it in and it was so tight that it didn&#x27;t dry any of the lower rollers and gave me a big headache due to the tightness. Not sure why they didn&#x27;t make this a bit bigger. Definitely not worth the almost $19 I aid including the shipping.</li>
    <li> Dries fast but needs a little more support.</li>
    <li> Works well on low setting, will not stay on your head if you put on high setting. I draw the string and bring it under my chin then around my ear to assist it in staying in place. Heat drys just fine on low thou.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, and it is what I expected. Cheap materials, but it works. Don&#x27;t know that it would be my everyday go-to, but I bought it as a back-up and travel item.</li>
    <li> This product is on the lower price which is great, the heat that is needed to dry hair and set hair you will definitely get.  The only problem I have with it is the draw sting is of poor quality. By no means doesn&#x27;t it get tight enough for the bonnet to stay on your head.  I have tried my best to pull it as tight as I can but it doesn&#x27;t work, eventually it will loosen up.  Watch the level of your hair dryer because this bonnet release so much hot air it does get VERY hot around the ears and the nape of your neck areas.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  Doesn&#x27;t fit well.  Get very hot under the hood.  Should have used it right away.  Get a better one.</li>
    <li> does the job of heating the hair but it pushes so far up on my head when the hair dryer is on i have to keep the setting low and off my ears. fits weird on my head but does a thorough heating with faster drying time...</li>
    <li> This bonnet dryer works very well! I noticed that some people had an issue with it fitting on their dryer. I also had this problem. So, I put it on my concentration nozzle attachment and it was much easier to fit over that. I plan to just leave it on there. The dryer doesn&#x27;t fly off of my head and when it gets too hot, I just press the cool button on my dryer. Overall, great purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this to set my hair faster with soft curlers. I have very fine hair and my hair never dried with this bonnet. Even after a hour t was still wet. It gets very hot, does not stay in position without extra support and I ended up melting the tip of my hair dryer and put a hole in the tubing of the product. That was only the third time of use. Won&#x27;t even bother hassling with it. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet! The heat comes out near the top of my head and the bonnet itself becomes full of warm air. The warm air gently dries or helps your moisturizer to condition your hair. You can do either with this bonnet. It is very convenient to use because the hose is long enough to set your dryer down on something nearby. You then have your hands free to do something else.</li>
    <li> This Hair Art EZ Dryer Bonnet Gold  is the best  because it works  and I did not have to purchase another &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34;  Just add it onto my  blow dryer.</li>
    <li> It does not stay on once you turn on the blow dryer it is too much holding the strings for this to be of any real help.</li>
    <li> So far this works! It attached to my dryer and stays on.  Hat covers my lg rollers and drys my hair in abt 40 minutes.  I cant believe it but it does work .</li>
    <li> works ok. was really hard to get me t very the nozzle if my hair dryer and the cap flew  .  off my head when I turned it on. I had to hold it down while it was on</li>
    <li> You can not used with a set of rollers, is very very small and its get CRAZY hot around the ears. I tried once and to the &#x27;&#x27;never use again drawer&#x27;&#x27; it went.....</li>
    <li> The drawsting is not strong enough.  It blows off your head when the dryer is on high.</li>
    <li> fills up with air so there&#x27;s no space in the hood for my head. a total waste of money. glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. also does not fit on some hair dryers.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S SO CONVENIENT, I USE IT AS I&#x27;M PUTTING ON MY MAKEUP, SOMETIMES ON HIGH I HAVE TO ATTACH THE DANGLING TINGTENING COURD TO MY ROBE SO IT WON&#x27;T PULL OFF, BUT I HAVE NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER.</li>
    <li> did not stay on my head. It was a great white elephant gift.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and store.  It does exactly how the description reads.  The only thing that was a little different is the length of the hose.  I&#x27;m tall and cannot leave my dryer on the counter as the length of the hose doesn&#x27;t allow it and will pull the bonnet off of my head.  However, I put it in my towel holder and can move a little bit around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> works fine and great to take when traveling</li>
    <li> I have super thick, long wavy/frizzy coarse hair.  I like a tousled, beachy look, so after washing I randomly insert salon clips in sections of hair all over my head, sort of \\&quot;poofing\\&quot; the hair up between clips to give it some \\&quot;bend.\\&quot; I usually allow it to air dry, but as I said, my hair is super thick so it can take hours.  Before, when I needed to quick dry my hair, I had use a diffuser, which took a long time and tended to pull out the curl and make my hair frizzy.  Enter this product.  It not only drys evenly, and keeps frizz to a minimum, it&#x27;s also easy and economical.  I can use the dryer I already have, the product is priced well and it&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for travel.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the hood flying off, but this one has a drawstring that keeps it in place.  It does heat up, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing, it drys your hair faster.  When I noticed a (very slight) discomfort from heat on my neck, I just lowered the heat setting on my dryer. All in all, this is a great solution for a thick haired gal like me.  My only concern is that, because it&#x27;s so lightweight, it will wear out fast.  But at $14, I can afford to replace it.  Believe me, as someone with \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; hair, I try EVERYTHING on the market to get a handle on it.  But this time I can honestly say I&#x27;ve uncovered a real find!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality! When the air goes in, it flies away. I couldn&#x27;t even tie it around my head!</li>
    <li> Does Not stay on your head once heating is started.  Poor choice.</li>
    <li> struggled to get this one my Conair with 3-in diameter nozzle, but it&#x27;s on good!  comfortable and efficient</li>
    <li> Definitely not for big heads or extra long hair.</li>
    <li> This product hold the heat</li>
    <li> Works fine with rollers but blows off otherwise. Not great for plopping(curly hair) or deep conditioning. The drawstring clip is just not strong enough to keep the bonnet on your head without something to hold on to. Also, it gets very hot! if you don&#x27;t have lo-med-hi settings on your dryer this may not work for you</li>
    <li> it is a useful item to dry your hair without using your hands to hold the dryer , very good</li>
    <li> This product works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to fit over the end of a hand-held, hair dryer, stores neatly, and most importantly provides even, over all hair drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it fits over your head and tightens to stay on, closely monitor the temperature because it can get very hot, very quickly</li>
    <li> The bonnett won&#x27;t stay on your head. As soon as you turn on the dryer even on a low setting it blows right off your head. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to make the cap tight so that it does not blow away.  But i like the concept!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and use the Deva Curl products. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. I pop this thing on in the morning and sit in the chair and pay bills or do whatever. I&#x27;m not tied to the bathroom waiting for my hair to dry. I just plug the blow dryer in in the kitchen and sit at the table and am hands free. Very easy to use. My only complain it the bead that is used to keep the bonnet tight doesn&#x27;t stay very well so I may have to figure something out to keep it on.</li>
    <li> The bonnet does not stay in place.  It is very difficult to dry your hair when yo have to use a scarf and put it around your head to hold the bonnet in place. Please! If that string could be changed for a strong elastic band, the problem would be solved.  On the other end of the bonnet (the one that goes attached to the hairdryer), the elastic band (irony, oh, irony!) does not hold when you turn on the hairdryer. You have to use a rubber band to keep it in place. It&#x27;s a good idea but I think that the designer never took the time to test it.</li>
    <li> great item for travel.  I don&#x27;t  use a blow drier all the time so this is a much better way to get hair done.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift . She loved it</li>
    <li> It blows right ff if your head and heats up your ears to a level of painful. Nope get a hard bonnet dryer! The cost per use is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, especially good for deep conditioning treatments or using curlers.  I use this when I am catching up on my emails or browsing because it is a hands free alternative, great way to heat up the coditioning treatments..</li>
    <li> It works well if you can manage to make it stay on your head. The pressure from the hair dryer tends to make the bonnet pop off. I replace the string with elastic and that made it a little better but not much.</li>
    <li> awesome product gives the great amount of heat with my blowdryer i have no bad news for this product its wonderfull and gets the job done!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase! It worked as expected.</li>
    <li> not as I thought it would work</li>
    <li> Amazing is all I can say</li>
    <li> I love this! It gets super hot depending on the blow dryer you use, but it works wonders &amp; gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made only used once.  It ripped on first use</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t stay on my head,  and it let&#x27;s the hair dryer over heat and shut off within 15 seconds</li>
    <li> It works exactly as I hoped it would. Since I use rollers, the EZ Dryer Bonnet allows me to dry my hair while I&#x27;m checking email at my computer. What a time saver! It’s lightweight material so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last. But It’s so effective and a great value that I’ll be purchasing another one as backup.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  In theory this is a good idea but the closure doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough and hot air escapes.  There are much better on the market.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit my blow dryer. But after I cut it &amp; messed with it a bit. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Always falling off like I&#x27;m literally pushing it down</li>
    <li> The opening of this bonnet is so narrow that it does not fit over the opening of today&#x27;s portable hairdryers.  After wrestling with it over my hairdryer and looking at the opening of other hairdryers at the drug store to see if they were narrow enough to fit this contraception, I made a trip to the trash can.</li>
    <li> I received this FedEx yesterday because I was doing my hair and I wrapped it and wanted to try the Saran Wrap method which needed to have a dryer. So, since I have a blow dryer, I needed an attachment that could fit my blow dryer nozzle. This did but didn&#x27;t stay once the blow dryer was on. So I finagled a way to get a rubberband around it so that part could stay put. But try keeping the HAT PART on! That thing FLEW off my head the second I turned on my blow dryer!! Even with that sad, pitiful tie thingie! I had to wind up holding the tie string AND the hat part! Good thing I don&#x27;t do this method often. I&#x27;ll keep it, but what a true waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Please do not believe the positive reviews you read on this product bc clearly the my are a lie. The cord doesn&#x27;t stay when you adjust it and it the whole unit pops off of your head. Thumbs down... Just get the one from sallys and save yourself the disappointment</li>
    <li> I am a freelance hair stylist and this is a great product to use because it&#x27;s easy to carry. Especially if you travel.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t stay on your head can&#x27;t close</li>
    <li> This product worked good for a week, after that the strings came off. Now I have to hold the strings together while trying to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Great item just  a pain to keep on my head when turned on. I have to lay my head back on a sofa chair to keep it on. But is great for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but could use some improvements. The latch on the drawstring tightener loosens as the bonnet inflates and I wouldn&#x27;t mind the hose being even longer. This was my first time ordering a bonnet dryer attachments and now I have an idea of what to look for next time. This will do for now though.</li>
    <li> I did my daughters hair in a twist out after washing and her hair was dry after 30 mintues, very happy with purchaes</li>
    <li> 1st - it doesn&#x27;t fit all dryers. It didn&#x27;t fit mine. I was going to return it, but it was cheap so I decided to make it fit, by slitting the elastic a little and using another piece of elastic to hold it in place. &amp;#34;what do I got to lose?&amp;#34; famous last words&lt;br /&gt;2nd - it was a pain to get on. the drawstring wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. but I finally got it &amp; turned on the dryer on low.&lt;br /&gt;3rd - I started on low, but the hot hair wasn&#x27;t really reaching (even w/ no kinks in the tube) so I started alternating 30 secs low w/ 30s high.  within 3 minutes my dryer overheated. and it is beyond a little overheated - it will not start up again.&lt;br /&gt;so end result: a bonnet I can&#x27;t return cause I cut it, a hair dryer that no longer works and my hair is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to find a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Wont stay on your head. Had to punch holes in hat to keep it on my wife head. Need to find a better way to secure product to the head.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. I use it for hot oil treatments so I can&#x27;t really review it for using curlers</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me, it just didn&#x27;t.  I found that to use it, I had to hold pretty still.  A little movement (like attempting to do my makeup while drying) and the hose would slide right off the dryer.  While the bonnet would secure so-so, when the dryer was turned on, it pulled the bonnet back against my curlers.  Not only was this slightly uncomfortable, but it dried my hair around my face pulled back (extremely) and with a kink where the bonnet edge stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will dry your hair, but I think you need to be willing to just sit and wait while it does with the cap pulled low onto your forehead (so no kink) and that just isn&#x27;t what I was hoping to accomplish.  I wanted a time saver and this just isn&#x27;t.  It is good for conditioning treatments, though.</li>
    <li> Even with the drawstring, it doesn&#x27;t stay put.  I just sit with my head against the couch which keeps it in place.  No major complaints, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This works well if you have a lot of time on your hands. It kept sliding off my head and had to use clips to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my soft bonnet dryer since replacements seem to be non-existent.  Attaching the elastic opening to the end of my dryer hose makes drying very comfortable.  I can&#x27;t imagine holding a blow-dryer upright for an hour, but using the hose made it comfortable to sit for 30 minutes to dry my very short, wrapped hairstyle.  The bonnet has a drawstring running around the edges to keep it on the head and heat flows well. I will order a few more to keep on hand for the future just in case.</li>
    <li> I had a 1964 Sunbeam bonnet dryer that worked for over 40 years.  Then I had to replace it.  The products today are not like they used to be, as the saying goes.  The bonnet did not work well so I thought I would try this bonnet attachment to my new dryer.  It worked and so I ordered one for my mother-in-law, too, as she is having the same problem.</li>
    <li> Its my favorite color but WILL NOT FIT MY STANDARD SIZE DRYER! The attachment to the dryer is too small. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> the hood is a little loose but stayed on my head while it dried.&lt;br /&gt;had to no problem attaching my 2 hair dryers to it. both worked well&lt;br /&gt;hood does get a little hot so be careful when removing it</li>
    <li> It is what it is. For the price it does the job. The problem though is it won&#x27;t stay on lol I have to hold it down or it will fly off. In all fairness I did use this for semi permanent color so maybe if I used it for rollers would stay put.</li>
