      <li>this is a nice plesant scent.</li>

      <li>Smells great and is my first encounter with Sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>I will be a customer for life and plan on trying more Caswell-Massey Sandalwood products.</li>
      <li>Gotta love a product from the oldest apothecary in the USA.</li>
      <li>Everything Caswell-Massey makes is top notch</li>
      <li>Ordered and received 4 more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent.</li>
      <li>Smelled more like Brut or something else</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more of the Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelled much better sandalwood scents and this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this talc.</li>
      <li>I love this scent---</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Caswell-Massey Sandalwood Talc Powder.</li>
      <li>The talc rubs on nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>A very cheap smelling fragrance, and way too light.  </li>
      <li>and i really enjoy this Caswell Mossey better.</li>
      <li>I  enjoy the sandalwood scent because it reminds me of the &#x27;70&#x27;s without going over the top.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t knew how good this talc was until i twisted the lid and smelled the nice and relaxing sandalwood of this wonderful product,</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a smoker, you&#x27;ll never notice how strong the fragrance is.  </li>
      <li>This is a fine product.</li>
      <li>its quite soft and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>I use this primarily for my feet.</li>
      <li>talc is just silky smooth</li>
      <li>you need talcum powder with a masculine, wood fragrance, Caswell-Massey&#x27;s Sandalwood Talc is a good choice.</li>
      <li>I burn and wear sandalwood daily, and if you love or like sandalwood you will be very pleased with Caswell-Massey Sandalwood</li>
      <li>It does not distribute very easily or evenly, which causes the need for more powder to cover an entire area.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so strong, I wouldn&#x27;t dare try to wear a cologne with it for fear of having an overpowering and offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It did a great job at keeping things dry</li>
      <li>The package&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fine Italian talc&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really important to me, but what is good is the Sandalwood fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It smells somewhat soapy directly from the container, but then when it blends with your natural odor it changes to a more pleasant aroma . . .</li>
      <li>/&gt;First please note that this is most certainly talc based and not cornstarch as one review said.  </li>
      <li>Makes after-shower time special.</li>
      <li>If you travel with it you&#x27;d better put it in a Ziploc as the lid turns to the open position VERY easily.  </li>
      <li>It has a warm, muted, &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; smell that everyone loves to be near.</li>
      <li>Too sweet.</li>
      <li>not bad not bad at all</li>
      <li>It smells nice and the fragrance lasts a long time which we both love.</li>
      <li>At first, the fragrance seemed strong.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;fresh out of the shower\\&quot; smell, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>Brought back nice memories but don&#x27;t want to smell like him.    </li>
      <li>I own different designer deodorants</li>
      <li>but well worth it if you like the smell of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and not overly \\&quot;woodsy.\\&quot; I bought 3 for fear they might discontinue the item.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand but a trip to their website shows they&#x27;ve been around forever and have a large range of products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But for adult men it has a very clean and dignified scent.  </li>
      <li>If I&#x27;d fallen in love with it and was planing on using it on a daily basis I&#x27;d be broke pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I was concerned it would be too strong for my wife since she is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
      <li>more of what I would describe as a very upscale Old Spice smell.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, I always thought talc powder was the way to go in the summer but had a hard time finding talcs that weren&#x27;t designed after colognes...</li>
      <li>I have been using this talc for about four years now and continue to find the scent refreshing, especially after a bath.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted almost a year.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>powder works well enough to create a nice smooth feel that lasts a very long time (depending on usage and need).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the fresh, masculine, natural aroma.</li>
      <li>This powder leaves you feeling cool and dry, and the light sandalwood fragrance really stays with you.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is understated and elegant, and it keeps you dry.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and the fact that it helps keep my feet dry and comfy in soggy Northwest winters.</li>
      <li>Very manly scent</li>
      <li>and I really like the scent.  </li>
      <li>Is ready to end up in the trash.</li>
      <li>The only problem with it is that it isn&#x27;t as smooth and silky feeling as I would like.  </li>
      <li>but I really wanted to give 2 \\&quot;I</li>
      <li>Thanks, to evereyone who rated and reviewed this product before me.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I prefer the $4 stuff I find at the grocery store for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It has the most sandalwood scent of any of the other myriad of products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
      <li>I live in Oklahoma where the heat and humidity is abundant, and talcum powder is absolutely essential after showering, otherwise your clothing ends up sticking to you like a second skin.</li>
      <li>nice high quality long lasting sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I use this particularly in the summer and it helps me stay drier.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like being in new construction and smelling the fresh cut wood; only difference is it&#x27;s not pine.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and high quality talc.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It has a terrific sent.</li>
    <li> Talc wouldn&#x27;t come out of the can&lt;br /&gt;I texted to complain&lt;br /&gt;They said-&amp;#34;too bad&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I say-&amp;#34;F you&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this is the BEST talc I have ever used. I&#x27;m ordering more of the Sandalwood. At first, the fragrance seemed strong. I was concerned it would be too strong for my wife since she is sensitive to perfumes. But my wife liked the fragrance. After using it for 2 weeks, it was hardly noticeable, but it keeps me dry and smelling good. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and wears it all the time. It smells nice and the fragrance lasts a long time which we both love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years and it has an excellent sandalwood smell.  It is the best sandalwood powder that I&#x27;ve ever found.  The only problem with it is that it isn&#x27;t as smooth and silky feeling as I would like.  It has a coarse consistency but I continue to buy and use it for the excellent smell.</li>
    <li> While the product does the job well, the Sandalwood fragrance is very strong.  I&#x27;d prefer it to be dialed back a bit, but it&#x27;s not a show-stopper.    The skinny of it is, this product does what it&#x27;s meant to do.  If you&#x27;re a smoker, you&#x27;ll never notice how strong the fragrance is.  If you aren&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this talc. It&#x27;s fresh and not overly \\&quot;woodsy.\\&quot; I bought 3 for fear they might discontinue the item.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I need to keep dry in the summer, but I really don&#x27;t want to smell like baby powder. The package&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fine Italian talc&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really important to me, but what is good is the Sandalwood fragrance.  It&#x27;s a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package is a hard bottle that you shake into a hand and apply as needed.  The instructions encourage you to be generous, but I find there&#x27;s a lot more fragrance than talc here, so you might want to start off with small amounts.  I did too much the other day and felt like I had a Sandalwood cloud around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need talcum powder with a masculine, wood fragrance, Caswell-Massey&#x27;s Sandalwood Talc is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I use this particularly in the summer and it helps me stay drier.  I  enjoy the sandalwood scent because it reminds me of the &#x27;70&#x27;s without going over the top.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Caswell-Massey Sandalwood Talc Powder. I burn and wear sandalwood daily, and if you love or like sandalwood you will be very pleased with Caswell-Massey Sandalwood this is a nice plesant scent. I wish that it was smoother without the talc. Like recently purchased Gold Bond Ultimate it&#x27;s 100% talc free and it applies an feels smoother and dryer in the armpit and groin area. I will continue to use and buy Caswell-Massey Sandalwood , just budgeting my money. I will be a customer for life and plan on trying more Caswell-Massey Sandalwood products. Thanks, to evereyone who rated and reviewed this product before me.</li>
    <li> Too sweet. I have used sandalwood talc and shave products from various other companies for years. CM has a noticeably sweeter smell. So sweet it wasn&#x27;t pleasant to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer.  Ever get out of the shower, towel off, and find yourself still dripping with perspiration?  (Floridians take note.)  This is the product you want to solve that problem.  The fragrance is understated and elegant, and it keeps you dry.  Why bother with boring old regular talcum powder when you can have this?  And it&#x27;s Caswell-Massey -- the name means excellence.</li>
    <li> not bad not bad at all</li>
    <li> This is the scent I remember from twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice high quality long lasting sandalwood. The ladies said it was pleasant on me. The low rating is because I now hate it, with a passion. It lingers even after a shower. You may like this. I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been using this talc for about four years now and continue to find the scent refreshing, especially after a bath.  My wife loves it, so I will continue to buy and use it.</li>
    <li> Very nice and just the right amount of scent. Lasts a long time I was surprised. Very soft and high quality talc.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. Maybe a little expensive as far as talcum powders go but well worth it if you like the smell of sandalwood. I live in Oklahoma where the heat and humidity is abundant, and talcum powder is absolutely essential after showering, otherwise your clothing ends up sticking to you like a second skin. This powder leaves you feeling cool and dry, and the light sandalwood fragrance really stays with you. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product. The first one lasted almost a year. I will continue purchasing this product and would recommend it to anyone who likes the smell of sandalwood.</li>
    <li> fragrance is not as good as the newport talc...</li>
    <li> Smell lasts all day. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it lasts forever. Ive had mine for like 4 months now, and haven&#x27;t even used half</li>
    <li> This talc smells like they mixed sandalwood sawdust with the talc...a good thing.  It has the most sandalwood scent of any of the other myriad of products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  It&#x27;s like being in new construction and smelling the fresh cut wood; only difference is it&#x27;s not pine.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Received product on time but the scent isn&#x27;t very nice. Smells like dirt to me. I&#x27;ve smelled much better sandalwood scents and this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that Amazon sold products such as talc.  Frankly, I could find no talc in my home town and expected to purchase it online from Caswell Massey.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and purchased a year&#x27;s supply.  I always thought of Amazon as a book seller but now I have learned that it sells a great deal mo.  I am delighted with the versatility of the company and would now go to it for mopst any product that I need.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I thought I would give this talc a try.  I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand but a trip to their website shows they&#x27;ve been around forever and have a large range of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First please note that this is most certainly talc based and not cornstarch as one review said.  Unless you&#x27;re a 3 month old baby (you don&#x27;t use talc on babies, EVER) you should be wary of putting on cornstarch based products.  These can lead to yeast infections (yes men can get yeast infections).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talc is just silky smooth and I really like the scent.  It&#x27;s not an earthy-hippie Sandlewood... more of what I would describe as a very upscale Old Spice smell. If you&#x27;re 18, this might not be your thing.  But for adult men it has a very clean and dignified scent.  My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try some other scents just for curiosity sake but will definitely be buying more Caswell-Massey talc.</li>
    <li> very cheap smelling at the fragrance also too expensive</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t knew how good this talc was until i twisted the lid and smelled the nice and relaxing sandalwood of this wonderful product, its quite soft and pleasant. I own different designer deodorants and i really enjoy this Caswell Mossey better. The only downside its the size.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is my first encounter with Sandalwood.  The only downside I see so far is the container.  If you travel with it you&#x27;d better put it in a Ziploc as the lid turns to the open position VERY easily.  Good transaction and I would buy it again.  Oh yeah, I did by it again.  Ordered and received 4 more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually never smelled Sandalwood that smells like this!  It&#x27;s okay but not great.</li>
    <li> I like having a talc and this is a great smell.  My wife likes the smell too and that&#x27;s a great plus.</li>
    <li> Gotta love a product from the oldest apothecary in the USA. Our colonial forebears -- including George Washington -- used Caswell Massey products. I really enjoy the fresh, masculine, natural aroma.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Packaging a little confusing - top holes were covered over with a plastic guard that was so transparent that I didn&#x27;t realize it was there and couldn&#x27;t understand why the talc was not coming out.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily for my feet. A little goes a very long way. I love the fragrance and the fact that it helps keep my feet dry and comfy in soggy Northwest winters.</li>
    <li> What kind of scent is Caswell Massey&#x27;s Sandalwood? No one stops me in the street to ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. But when friends hug me they invariably exclaim &amp;#34;You smell so good!&amp;#34; And I do. You have to be up close to smell it. It has a warm, muted, &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; smell that everyone loves to be near. It is a human smell -- neither boy or girl. I&#x27;m a woman in her 40s and I&#x27;m giving some to my 14 year old nephew for Christmas. He&#x27;s just discovered the ladies and needs to get his little mojo working.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Very manly scent, it feels great going on after a shower. Makes me feel cool and dry for hours afterward. I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Disgusted with the smell and threw it in trash.  Very old and fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read great things about this powder, and even admire the name.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the smell is a little too robust for me, and not suitable for a male in his early 30s. It&#x27;s definitely a smell my father or grandfather could pull off...but not me.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;fresh out of the shower\\&quot; smell, this isn&#x27;t it. Honestly, I prefer the $4 stuff I find at the grocery store for everyday use. Additionally, the powder itself resembles the grind of a French roast coffee....large chunks. It does not distribute very easily or evenly, which causes the need for more powder to cover an entire area.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so strong, I wouldn&#x27;t dare try to wear a cologne with it for fear of having an overpowering and offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;The 3.5 oz container is likely going to last me years.</li>
    <li> Awesome sandalwood scent.  This is not the fake perfume heavy sandalwood.  This is the classic old school musk type sandalwood.  Lasts all through the day, but is not overwhelming.  I am a 28 year old guy, and this scent is perfect for me.  My wife loves the smell too.  This is my second bottle.  The talc rubs on nice and smooth.  The grind is bigger than that of a corn starch baby powder, but nothing like coarse ground coffee as one reviewer stated.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Makes after-shower time special.</li>
    <li> I love this scent---it&#x27;s relaxing, soothing and subtle. Everything Caswell-Massey makes is top notch and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> A very cheap smelling fragrance, and way too light.  Flimsy construction of the container too.  Is ready to end up in the trash.</li>
    <li> smells great love it  thank you</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 \\&quot;It&#x27;s okay\\&quot; because I&#x27;m neutral but I really wanted to give 2 \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t.  There is NOTHING wrong with the product.  It did a great job at keeping things dry but it wasn&#x27;t a Sandalwood scent I&#x27;d ever smelled before.    Smelled more like Brut or something else you&#x27;d find in the \\&quot;locked case\\&quot; at Thrifty/CVS.    Reminded me of grandpa.  Brought back nice memories but don&#x27;t want to smell like him.    EDIT:  It didn&#x27;t go to waste, though.  I gave it to my mom.  I think she uses it on her dogs.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, I always thought talc powder was the way to go in the summer but had a hard time finding talcs that weren&#x27;t designed after colognes... this one is unique, masculine and long lasting as a little goes a long way .... very surprised by the sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  Excellent after a shower. Long lasting and mixes with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> First of all the bottle is far smaller than I originally thought (that&#x27;s probably just my fault, however, because I&#x27;m used to the metric system so oz means little to me). It smells somewhat soapy directly from the container, but then when it blends with your natural odor it changes to a more pleasant aroma . . . eventually, because it takes some time to settle down and become subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about sandalwood based on incense you have burned be prepared to call this smell something else because it has little in common with incense sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder works well enough to create a nice smooth feel that lasts a very long time (depending on usage and need).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I deducted a couple of stars because the smell is off, the container is too small, and the price is too high for something like this. If I&#x27;d fallen in love with it and was planing on using it on a daily basis I&#x27;d be broke pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. Caswell Massey needs to will bring it back. It is the only talc I use. Wonder why it was pulled.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, fragranced nicely.</li>
