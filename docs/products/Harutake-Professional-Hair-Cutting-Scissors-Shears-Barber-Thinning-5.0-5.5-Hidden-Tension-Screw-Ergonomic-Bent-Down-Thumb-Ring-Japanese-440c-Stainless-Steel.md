      <li>The shears have been nice.</li>
      <li>These are well worth every penny!!!  </li>

      <li>Her teacher was pleased with the quality</li>
      <li>I bought one more set for his colleague.</li>
      <li>feeling is sometimes you are paying more for the label than the product.</li>
      <li>, My sally&#x27;s cheap texturizing shears work better than these.</li>
      <li>some girls were saying they too nice for class hahaha!</li>
      <li>for bang for your buck this is an amazing deal - and I&#x27;m thrilled they&#x27;re such a hit and work</li>
      <li>so I received free two day shipping to boot.</li>
      <li>so I received free two day shipping to boot.</li>
      <li>The case is scented with Cologne so every time you open the bag is smells great.</li>
      <li>Great back up shears.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Incredibly well balanced and sharp.</li>
      <li>Not being in a position to pay this kind of money I started a few days of research and was impressed but skeptical about this set of tools by Harutake - for the price it seemed to good be true, but the 5 star reviews from professional hair stylists really impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are still very sharp after many haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; after using these for over three years it is still performing great.</li>
      <li>the new ones i just bought (different company) are just as awesome</li>
      <li>So far the best shear set I&#x27;ve had in a long time as a stylist.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many pairs of shears, spending as much as $485 on one pair.  </li>
      <li>I have a  $90 Calphalon Chef knife in Stainless that is the sharpest, most well balanced knife</li>
      <li>No one should ever hesitate to do business with you, I for one am very pleased especially with your promptness!</li>
      <li>The scissors she got from school was pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>multi color is quite beautiful and sets the tools apart, clients love the visual and 60 other hair stylists are full of questions about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They cut hair really smoothly and feels very ergonomic in design.</li>
      <li>the ergonomics alone is worth it.</li>
      <li>These are good one tip is aliitle rough.</li>
      <li>They looks fun and cut so well.</li>
      <li>love it so far</li>
      <li>I took a chance and My daughter love it as a gift from me as she now is a professional hair stylist.</li>
      <li>My better half however, has been a hair stylist for 15 years and is creative director of one the countries top ten rated day spas - he knows his scissors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is the mid tier with the top tier being $100</li>
      <li>especially given the fact that it is a free gift with the purchase!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sharp when you get them, great for thick hair.</li>
      <li>I even bravely cut my long asian hair to layered bob by myself.</li>
      <li>If you are using them a lot and feel they are dulling they most likely need to be tightened.</li>
      <li>I would just like to thank you very much and let you know that it is greatly appreciated that you sent me</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I do know that the old adage &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; is not always true.</li>
      <li>the cost of tax alone on many single pairs of scissors the kit includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>She really likes these scissors.</li>
      <li>Very prompt in shipping.</li>
      <li>These are barber killers for real.</li>
      <li>Terrific build quality and perfectly smooth movement.</li>
      <li>Definitely not the quality of most professional shears.</li>
      <li>from quality Japanese hollow ground steel and coated with Titanium, this is a brilliant set for the novice or long time Pro.</li>
      <li>from quality Japanese hollow ground steel and coated with Titanium, this is a brilliant set for the novice or long time Pro.</li>
      <li>I cut hair daily in my job, these scissors are balanced/weight, amazing feel, comfortable, and i dont think they are very gonna dual for a long long time..</li>
      <li>I knew my spouse needed new tools and he has had scissors over the years that cost as much $800.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a few days of working with these the report back is that they are hands down the best scissors he has worked with.</li>
      <li>I just received the email you sent me to let you me know that you placed a new feather razor in the mail to me.</li>
      <li>dull need to send off to sharpen other than that very nice</li>
      <li>I guess I would just recommend spending a little extra for better shears.</li>
      <li>Great kit to start cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been looking for professional shears for a year.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my mom who is a professional hair stylist.</li>
      <li>although probably does not fit most hands that wear a ring size larger than 5.5 or 6.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is made with high quality Japanese steel with a Rockwell hardness of 60+.</li>
      <li>I purchased them last year, and beyond the normal use they are giving my wife some difficulty.</li>
      <li>Be careful to not cut too much hair at a time (as with any pair of scissors) and watch your hands as you can get cut by these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They dull quickly.</li>

    <li> Nice shears for the price. Great back up shears.</li>
    <li> a nice set handles well fits hands well but dull need to send off to sharpen other than that very nice</li>
    <li> These are beautiful and work really well. They cut hair really smoothly and feels very ergonomic in design. It is made with high quality Japanese steel with a Rockwell hardness of 60+. They come in a nice leatherette case that is useful and good looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these for over two years now, I can confidently say this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The scissors work great still. They are still very sharp after many haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; after using these for over three years it is still performing great. Excellent.</li>
    <li> So far the best shear set I&#x27;ve had in a long time as a stylist. I am impressed with the feel and weight and especially with the sharpness of the blades.  Love these and they look great.</li>
    <li> The shears work great. I am a stylist .It does what it suppose to .&lt;br /&gt;The color is awesome .i love it so far</li>
    <li> Great shears! If you are using them a lot and feel they are dulling they most likely need to be tightened. Great $</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how lightweight they were and I was never able to even use the longest pair because it just bent the hair instead of cutting. The thinning shears broke in half while I was giving a haircut (which was embarrassing). I guess I would just recommend spending a little extra for better shears.</li>
    <li> this is a GREAT set of shears for the price.  I have purchased many pairs of shears, spending as much as $485 on one pair.  This set is certainly equal in quality, if not better than my $485 pair.</li>
    <li> if they werent stolen i would still be using them&lt;br /&gt;but the new ones i just bought (different company) are just as awesome</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom who is a professional hair stylist. She really likes these scissors. In fact she liked them better than the $250 pair of scissors she had before these.</li>
    <li> Im in love with my shears from Harutake! Awesome deal, very happy! If you come across these, buy them. They won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I just received the email you sent me to let you me know that you placed a new feather razor in the mail to me. I would just like to thank you very much and let you know that it is greatly appreciated that you sent me a knew one especially given the fact that it is a free gift with the purchase!

    <li> Terrible quality. Scissors dulled after 1 month of usage. Wish I could return. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and My daughter love it as a gift from me as she now is a professional hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these scissors for my brother. He is a proffessional hairdreser and he loves them. I bought one more set for his colleague.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the money. Purchased as gift for neice who is going to school to be a hairdresser. When she used them to cut my hair we both noticed the superior quality compared to what she had been using. Excellent craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who is in Cosmetology School.  She loves them and loves the color.  Her teacher was pleased with the quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different professional brands and I have to say this cut like my hikari&#x27;s do!! I love them!!</li>
    <li> I cut hair daily in my job, these scissors are balanced/weight, amazing feel, comfortable, and i dont think they are very gonna dual for a long long time.. I def say if you can spend a ton of money on scissors these are perfect... superior quality great price.</li>
    <li> I have to say that the sharpness of the blades of these scissors are excellent, a fine price for the quality you&#x27;ll buy.</li>
    <li> My husband decided to let me try cutting his hair and he didn&#x27;t hate it, so we decided to drop some serious cash on a decent set of hair cutting scissors.  These will not disappoint.  We did some research and this is the mid tier with the top tier being $100+ per pair.  So for the quality and price that you get, these are a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are ergonomic and my hands do not tire in them while I&#x27;m cutting hair.  They are also very sharp.  Be careful to not cut too much hair at a time (as with any pair of scissors) and watch your hands as you can get cut by these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is serious about cutting hair enough to work with professional level tools.  Trust me, the ergonomics alone is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very prompt in shipping. I ordered the wrong pair and had to get another one. That transaction was done very smoothly. Although the shears have no longevity. They dull quickly. Definitely not the quality of most professional shears.</li>
    <li> What is up?? I have been looking for professional shears for a year. These are good one tip is aliitle rough. But work good. But I am upset that I went back on Amazon and the set was about 1/2 price. So I am upset.</li>
    <li> These shears are not professional quality, the blades didnt match up felt very gritty when cutting.  Its not a well known shear brand and now I know why dont take the risk.</li>
    <li> Too small to handle if you have a relatively large hands</li>
    <li> Hi, just wondered if anyone knew what the warranty on this item is. I purchased them last year, and beyond the normal use they are giving my wife some difficulty. Thanks.</li>
    <li> she was floored by these an so were all the girls in her class...  some girls were saying they too nice for class hahaha!</li>

I also know a bit about cutlery. As an example I have Carbon Steel Yaxo chef knife, they run about $400.

    <li> Great shears although probably does not fit most hands that wear a ring size larger than 5.5 or 6.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp when you get them, great for thick hair. Does not have a sharpening service, will have to find one to sharpen the shears when they get dull. Haven&#x27;t used the feathering razor because I can&#x27;t seem to find replacement razors for them. The case is scented with Cologne so every time you open the bag is smells great. The case is lovely and fits 3 shears and one feathering razor securely with a nice zipper. I don&#x27;t understand why there is a metal tag taped inside the case so I just threw it away. Great kit to start cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision: Don&#x27;t throw away the tag, I think its used to tighten the shears for the best configuration of use.</li>
    <li> These are well worth every penny!!!  Great balance and feel in your hand, they cut amazing! Very very happy I would buy again without thinking</li>
    <li> So far so good. The shears have been nice. But I will say that the texturizing shears are hit or miss. They were cutting well one moment and then barely cutting the hair the next, My sally&#x27;s cheap texturizing shears work better than these.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my daughter as a gift when she graduated beauty school.  The scissors she got from school was pretty cheap. My daughter loves these in comparison. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for my husband and children for a few years now, and cheap scissors from CVS wasn&#x27;t just cutting it. Good thing I invested in this set. They looks fun and cut so well. They are perfect size for ladies to hold. I even bravely cut my long asian hair to layered bob by myself. People were impressed! These are barber killers for real.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and He loves them! Bought them for him while he was in school but is not finished They are very sharp but the Razr did not seem as sharp though</li>
