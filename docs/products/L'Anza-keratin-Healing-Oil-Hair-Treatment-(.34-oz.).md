      <li>, Im sure that you will love it also!</li>
      <li>Much better things on the line.</li>
      <li>Also, I noticed that I could see more scalp - my hair was falling out and breaking.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoyed the way it controls the &amp;#34;frizzes&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
      <li>It seemed ok for my hair though.</li>
      <li>This is a great product but be aware that this one is a free sample size.</li>
      <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t care for the smell-very strong.</li>
      <li>Not fruity or light.</li>
      <li>I stick to matirx smooth and sleek now.</li>
      <li>and the results are fantastic.</li>
      <li>These are also great products, but through process of elimination, I determined that this is the key to reduced breakage.</li>
      <li>its amazing oil but its very small bottle but very easy to use and excellent for all the hair washing or dry</li>
      <li>Pretty good serum, teeny tiny bottle!</li>
      <li>It absorbed into my skin within 5 minutes with no greasy feeling at all.</li>
      <li>i put a quarter size on my hair while it was wet and rubbed in the scalp and hair good..</li>
      <li>The small size is great for travel or trying.</li>
      <li>She really really Loves this stuff too!  </li>
      <li>I have a short bob (hair comes to the top of my shoulders)</li>
      <li>Again, she really Loves it!</li>
      <li>This is similar to a Moroccan Oil type of product and a good alternate to mix things up.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product a long time ago.  </li>
      <li>I am 41 years ago and have fine, brown hair that is colored blonde.</li>
      <li>my hair was amazing after it dried.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
      <li>Really like this in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, but I have fine-textured hair...</li>
      <li>and i must say i really like it..</li>
      <li>This size is perfect, you only need a small drop in your palm and pull it through your hair from middle to the end</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, not weighed down and strong - my breakage had almost disappeared as a result of using this product.</li>
      <li>My hair dresser actually had me test it on my hands first, to demonstrate that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
      <li>This was a stylist sample that clearly said on the front &amp;#34;Stylist Sample - Not for Resale&amp;#34; and I paid $9.00 for it.  </li>
      <li>but I was surprised to see that it is a stylist sample not meant for resale.</li>
      <li>I am surprised Amazon allowed it to be sold.</li>
      <li>Did not purchase at the hairdressers as they marked it up quite a bit.</li>
      <li>Does not make my hair feel as soft as Keratase.</li>
      <li>I thought I was gonna have to cut my hair off after bleaching it completely.</li>
      <li>Doesnt leave the hair oily or have a loud smell..</li>
      <li>sadly i need more than .34 oz !</li>
      <li>Bottle was only 1/2 full....not happy :(</li>

<li> Although it is only advertised as a product for your hair, I rub the residue on my elbows after I apply it - my chronically dry elbows are no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
<li> I used it dry hair seemed a bit greasy, used it last night on wet hair after smearing a dime amount in hands.</li>

<li> A little too heavy for me.</li>
<li> Not too heavy.</li>
<li> Smooths without leaving any heavy residue.</li>
<li> I add it to my leave-in, just a few drops and to my hair after shampoo to restore slip and elasticity.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product.</li>
<li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
<li> it is need very little drops for to use</li>
<li> sooooooooo small</li>
<li> You can have no better critique than that.  </li>
<li> Within 2 weeks my brows are thick and even.</li>
<li> This is a very small size.  </li>
<li> Not happy.</li>
<li> Not impressed with this stuff.</li>
<li> Not advertised correct size of bottle, over priced for the size you get, not great quality oil, insulting and rude customer service</li>

    <li> Pretty good serum, teeny tiny bottle! lol Save your money. If I had read the description I would have saved mine.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and two for my daughter who has extremely dry hair.  I believe this was a good bet. I add it to my leave-in, just a few drops and to my hair after shampoo to restore slip and elasticity. Reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> This is similar to a Moroccan Oil type of product and a good alternate to mix things up.  The small size is great for travel or trying.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil just one drop and will smooth hair and shine too</li>
    <li> I purchased this after I got a perm to help heal my hair. It is wonderful. However I began using it on my brows and lashes too and the results are fantastic. Within 2 weeks my brows are thick and even. Still working on the lashes but at least they are visible without several coats of mascara. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
    <li> This is the product that the hairdresser uses on my hair and I really enjoyed the way it controls the &amp;#34;frizzes&amp;#34;. Did not purchase at the hairdressers as they marked it up quite a bit. Since I found ALL L&#x27;Anza products on Amazon I have been thrilled.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product for damaged hair. Smooths without leaving any heavy residue.</li>

    <li> Does not make my hair feel as soft as Keratase. It seemed ok for my hair though. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I thought I was gonna have to cut my hair off after bleaching it completely. This stuff brought it back to life. I am amazed!</li>
    <li> Not advertised correct size of bottle, over priced for the size you get, not great quality oil, insulting and rude customer service</li>
    <li> This product is amazing - makes even the frizziest of hair sleek and shiny!  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the cost.  For curly hair - expect it to remove some curl - but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years ago and have fine, brown hair that is colored blonde. Despite coloring my hair since the age of 13, I have never had any problems with breakage. I began to notice that my hair was falling out - the amount of hair in the shower drain in 2 days was the equivalent of what I saw in a month before! Also, I noticed that I could see more scalp - my hair was falling out and breaking. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. While waiting for the tests and the meds, I wanted to do something to stop the breakage and keep what was left of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this product on Amazon (yet, will buy a refill here shortly) as I bought it from my hair salon that carries Lanza products. After washing and drying your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner, you put this on damp hair. I have a short bob (hair comes to the top of my shoulders) and I use enough to equal about the size of a quarter. You rub this into your hair while it&#x27;s damp and dry as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING. Within 48 hours of using this, my hair breakage was reduced by 60%. Within 1 week of using this, my hair breakage was reduced by 90%. It has almost no smell to it. It&#x27;s not like any other oil that you have tried - this is not greasy at all. My hair dresser actually had me test it on my hands first, to demonstrate that it&#x27;s not greasy. It absorbed into my skin within 5 minutes with no greasy feeling at all. My hair is shiny, not weighed down and strong - my breakage had almost disappeared as a result of using this product. It was not the meds - I didn&#x27;t even start them for 4 weeks. Although it is only advertised as a product for your hair, I rub the residue on my elbows after I apply it - my chronically dry elbows are no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did use this in combination with the Lanza Strength shampoo and conditioner. These are also great products, but through process of elimination, I determined that this is the key to reduced breakage. This product works great! And, this is a great price on Amazon - they sell this for twice this price in the salon. I will be buying my refill from here going forward.roduct works great!

    <li> purchased a couple weeks ago. I used it dry hair seemed a bit greasy, used it last night on wet hair after smearing a dime amount in hands. my hair was amazing after it dried. great product...just bought another..</li>
    <li> its amazing oil but its very small bottle but very easy to use and excellent for all the hair washing or dry</li>
    <li> sooooooooo small&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t get any benefit from it</li>
    <li> it is very good for hair. it makes hair briliant. I love it. it is need very little drops for to use</li>
    <li> It is a good oil but I was surprised to see that it is a stylist sample not meant for resale. I am surprised Amazon allowed it to be sold.</li>
    <li> It is very moisturizing, but I have fine-textured hair... A little too heavy for me. Plus, I don&#x27;t care for the smell-very strong. Not fruity or light.</li>
    <li> She really really Loves this stuff too!  You can have no better critique than that.  Recommend.  Again, she really Loves it!</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this stuff. Much better things on the line. This is a sample you receive and it states not for resale. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product. Waste of money in my opinion. I have frizzy hair and this does nothing for me at all. I stick to matirx smooth and sleek now.</li>
    <li> This was a stylist sample that clearly said on the front &amp;#34;Stylist Sample - Not for Resale&amp;#34; and I paid $9.00 for it.  It is the size of a bottle of nail polish for $9.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but be aware that this one is a free sample size. I recommend you go big on this one! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> sadly i need more than .34 oz !</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product a long time ago.  It really is an awesome product and heals from the inside out.  Give it a try, Im sure that you will love it also!</li>
    <li> Really like this in my hair.  Its not too greasy and makes it feel nice.  Was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I purchased the smaller oil to see how i would like it and i must say i really like it.. Doesnt leave the hair oily or have a loud smell..i put a quarter size on my hair while it was wet and rubbed in the scalp and hair good.. End results was great.. Will purchase larger size next time</li>
    <li> Bottle was only 1/2 full....not happy :(</li>
    <li> This is a very small size.  In fact, the bottle says \\&quot;Sample Size. Not For Resale\\&quot;. The amount of oil isn&#x27;t enough for one treatment, unless you have very, very short hair.  Save the $5</li>
