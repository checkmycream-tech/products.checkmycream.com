<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using with the shampoo conditioner and minoxidil drops. Have been pleasantly surprised at the results after a month more hair is definitely hoeing in</li>
    <li> I did not use it the side effect&#x27;s are too risky to me my fault should have checked it out before purchasing it my loss!</li>
    <li> This product is too expensive and does not regrow hair.  You can find Monoxidil at much lower price in local stores.</li>
    <li> Have not really had time to see results yet....still waiting...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the beginning of the 3rd month of using the keranique products.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing at the rate I was previously and  I felt like I was also starting to notice growth but wasn&#x27;t sure.  When I had my hair cut a couple of weeks ago my stylist, who I&#x27;ve been going to for years, said I had new baby hairs and a lot of them.  She said as the hair got older they would naturally thicken.  Then yesterday someone who had no idea I&#x27;ve been treating my hair commented on how much thicker my hair was looking. Yay!! It wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking, it&#x27;s actually working!! You do have to be patient.  I&#x27;m sure this has to do with the hair growth cycles but IT ACTUALLY WORKS!  I use the shampoo, conditioner, spray treatment and the mousse.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Hair has noticeably grown since use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I think it&#x27;s working!!!</li>
    <li> The warning signs were not stated in the TV commercial.  Once the products were received, I read the warning signs, such as &amp;#34;stop use if chest pains, rapid heart beat, dizziness occurs, if hands and feet swell, scalp becomes red and irritated and if unwanted facial hair occurs, etc.  There are too many possible negatives, too risky.  I will never use Keranique.  You don&#x27;t know about this negative  information until you receive the products; had I known this beforehand, I would not have ordered this product.  While ordering &amp;#34;K&amp;#34;, it sound like you are speaking to a tape, therefore, you are not able to ask any questions at that time.  Never used this product, but I&#x27;m forced to rate it nevertheless.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, and lately it does not seem to help as much.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i see hair growing on the sides where it is very thin.. Just a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted the shampoo to work so bad and I used it like I was suppose to and it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Yes! It works for me, had purchase the full system &amp; it is so expensive. Still have some of shampoo &amp; condition left so all I needed was the regrowth, so it is nice to know that I can purchase separate items without paying the full amount.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I follow the directions on the bottle but  don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair. Maybe I have to use it a little  longer.</li>
    <li> i have seen no hair growth or change, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;for the money you spend for this product, it is frustrating.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I can see tremendous thickness of my hair in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Hello this is my second bottle of this hair regrowth  and it does work for me</li>
    <li> having trouble returning product</li>
    <li> Love the spray bottle.  Hope to see results soon.</li>
    <li> I am hoping this will help as I have some balding spots.  I love the shampoo and conditioner and hope this will do what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair dry and brake</li>
    <li> No comment at this time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for a few months now and see definitely more hair.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be minoxidil and cost more than buying at the department store. The name Keranique hair regrowth just hides the fact that you can buy this generic at most store.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used for thinning hair that actually works. I&#x27;m on my fourth month of using it and I have a full head of hair now. Love it!</li>
    <li> I USED &amp;#34;ROGAINE&amp;#34; IN THE PAST AND DID LIKE IT, BUT KERANIQUE&#x27;S SPRAY IS MUCH EASIER TO APPLY.  WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITH OUT IT.  THE BEST PART IS &amp;#34;IT WORKS&amp;#34; AND DOES GROW HAIR!  NO STICKY FEELING EIT HER!</li>
    <li> Great product Great Amazon service</li>
    <li> I returned it.  I kept forgetting to spray it on (you had to do it 2 times a day).  It wasn&#x27;t worth the money to me.  My hair isn&#x27;t that thin.</li>
    <li> Still need more time to see</li>
    <li> Too many cautions about possible ill effects I was afraid to try it ..too bad - I thought it showed promise</li>
    <li> It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I have not finished using this product yet but so far, I am not showing any regrowth of my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well. I like the fact that it is a spray. Much easier to use than a dropper.</li>
    <li> Started using about year ago as a skeptic based on other similar promising products...which did little or nothing...was surprised and thrilled to see tiny hairs sprouting!  Like a happy Gardner I am getting thicker looking hair with growth in areas I thought were vacant!.....I will continue to use if it continues to work for me......</li>
    <li> If your hair is thiningbor it has fallen out. Then you should stock up on this product. It definitely stops the shedding and it grows hair back.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite awhile, at this point I can&#x27;t tell any difference.. I doubt I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Would I buy it every month, if I believed in some success  !</li>
    <li> Ddn&#x27;t do as much as I expected,  wouldn&#x27;t spend that much money again.</li>
    <li> excellent product highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I have not received any  results after three months of use, not even a slight amount of growth.  not sure if it is going to work at all.</li>
    <li> This product do not work at all</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have noticed  that my bald spot is gradually growing back. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a little help.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T USE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE!  I used this for a month &amp; have noticed more hair loss than EVER before,(I can see my scalp now) also I used to have thin but thick hair now it&#x27;s getting very fine and thinning almost like my scalp is squeezing the hair follicles down to nothing..</li>
    <li> Finally a prioduct that actually helped with my loss of volume as well as actual bald spot.  Been using for about 6 months and there has been a definite improvement and complete filling in of area with complete hair loss.</li>
    <li> The last thing I want is to make worse my problem (like shaving because I grew moustache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worse was not be able to read all the cautions about this product before buying it!</li>
    <li> hmmm im not sure if this works...i can&#x27;t say as yet but....firstly i ordered this spray and they sent the serum instead but thats okay...i just thought the spray would of been easier to apply....after reading the reviews I&#x27;m not really sure what to expect...im using this about three weeks into a month now and my hair appears to be thinner....after doing some research on the active ingredient (minoxidil), and after what I&#x27;ve heard, they said that old hair will fall out and new ones will regrow.....my hair is dropping like crazy but I&#x27;m hoping this product will work after giving it some time... ill say maybe 2 months .....</li>
