      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>so most tanners make me look orange.</li>
      <li>I heard about Faux through a friends and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have used many similar products, this is the best.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunless tanner.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I prefer olive-based tanners like St. Tropez (my favorite).  </li>
      <li>I have tried many sunless tanning products.  </li>
      <li>If applied appropriately it does not streak.</li>
      <li>but there are better formulas out there.  </li>
      <li>The color is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>The price point is much better</li>
      <li>and I was able to put my clothes on and go about my day.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use rubber gloves though</li>
      <li>I love the face Faux Tan much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners.</li>
      <li>All in all, I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again just because I like St. Tropez SO much better.</li>
      <li>and for the price, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased.</li>
      <li>I cannot stand the smells of most self-tanners, including those that smell like coconuts or beach-y smells.</li>
      <li>Which I love.</li>
      <li>Nice color and no bad odor.  </li>
      <li>I just wanted to have a nice tan that looked natural for my medium fair skin</li>
      <li>You really need the brush to be able to get it looking good and streak free.</li>
      <li>Goes on very easy and dries fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have the brush from a couple years ago when I purchased this product from QVC, so it makes application so easy.  </li>
      <li>Okay lets be honest, during the summer everyone wants to be tan.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Use glove to apply because it will darken palms and doesn&#x27;t wash from hands easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several self-tanners after swearing off tanning beds this year, finding many great options for my body, but none for my face.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>the tan doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as when I purchased it from QVC/Sephora</li>
      <li>It is dark when it come out and blends perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is hands down the best self-tanner, I&#x27;m done looking.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this hands down as the best on the market.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, has a nice smell and gives a good color.  </li>
      <li>From my experience the best one out there is sunlabs self tanner in very dark.</li>
      <li>Nothing orange about this sunless tanner, a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t got to see it streak free yet.</li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s free of parabens.</li>
      <li>It has excellent coverage and very little smell.</li>
      <li>I was extreamly excited to get this</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a never-ending battle that I gave up trying to win a long time ago.</li>
      <li>The original formula which is quite pricey I always added a drop of oil to help blend it.</li>
      <li>It was 98% ineffective compared to what I originally purchased.</li>
      <li>Or get this stuff which is the original formula:&lt;br</li>
      <li>Truly looks &#x27;better than real&#x27;.</li>
      <li>A nice natural looking tan, and I&#x27;m convinced my skin looks</li>
      <li>Go for it if you want a safe natural looking tan!!!</li>
      <li>But it dries fairly quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait 10 minutes to put clothes on.</li>
      <li>It soaks into the skin quickly, and will darken your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting better from bare Minerals as I love most of their natural products.</li>
      <li>However, this faux tan body is not near as good.  </li>
      <li>Believe me I have tried all of the most expensive ones, including LaMer and Le&#x27; Prarie, and this is the best most natural product out there.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand of self tanner for ease of application, provides the most natural tan (I have olive skin tones normally), lasts several days, and most importantly DOES NOT SMELL.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>so I figured it would defiantly be worth giving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I rarely have any streaking with this product and if I do, it&#x27;s because I rushed through putting it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many other self tanners with much better results.</li>
      <li>The tanner did not smell right nor did it work.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this item because of the rating I saw on line.  My wife loves this product and will order in the future.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> LOVE this tanner!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Faux Tan Sunless Tanner has been advertised on QVC as a product that has no odor.  While it smells less than other brands, it still smells.  After it has dried for several hours, you still cannot take a shower because the color comes off on the wash cloth and towel very easily.  Have never seen that with other products of sunless tanning, which generally just fade throughout the week.  So, it is not a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners. This one seemed really promising however, it turned me orange. From my experience the best one out there is sunlabs self tanner in very dark. Make sure you use some type of vinyl or latex gloves when applying.</li>
    <li> This self tanner has a vanilla berry smell to it and very little self-tan odor. It does a tremendous job of giving you a glowing tan without the orange fake bake appearance. It lasts a week. If applied appropriately it does not streak. Exfoliate 1 day before applying self-tanner. Bare Minerals beats Department Store Brands by a mile. Go for it if you want a safe natural looking tan!!! A+++</li>
    <li> Worked as promised&lt;br /&gt;Read directions</li>
    <li> Instant quick glow. Make sure you use rubber gloves though</li>
    <li> I love this sunless tanner.  I have the brush from a couple years ago when I purchased this product from QVC, so it makes application so easy.  This tanner gives a natural color.  I usually apply 2-3 days in a row and then the color lasts for a week.  Make sure to exfoliate before applying this or any other sunless tanner.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> No matter what they say, it still turned me orange.  I was really hoping this met the product statement that it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Nice color and no bad odor.  Very pleased with the look.</li>
    <li> This sunless tanner is an ashy gray color.</li>
    <li> I used on my face too.</li>
    <li> This product provides a realistic tan.  The underlying color is brown, not orange.  Easy to apply and relatively long lasting.  Must reapply every 4-5 days.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Has been my go-to tanning lotion for years. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners and this one is by far the best! There is no odor, which I awesome, and you can seethe color as you put it on. I rarely have any streaking with this product and if I do, it&#x27;s because I rushed through putting it on. The color is awesome, not orange at all, and it lasts for close to 5 days. I also like that it&#x27;s free of parabens. Great product all around!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Have purchased several bottles and will again. The color of lotion makes it easy to see as it is applied so to prevent dark spots. Use glove to apply because it will darken palms and doesn&#x27;t wash from hands easily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no smell, extremely easy to apply, no streaking, no drying time.  I even put it on in the morning and head to work.  The color is fabulous!  I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is hands down the best self-tanner, I&#x27;m done looking.</li>
    <li> It is the only self tanner that looks natural but you need the brush to get it even.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply with brush.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This product works! It looks as though you have spent time in the sun, but without the risk. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I first tired this and made my purchase at Sephora. When I got my second bottle online and it was not the real product. It was 98% ineffective compared to what I originally purchased. I would not trust buying products from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I had a wedding coming up but I do not like tanning beds. I heard about Faux through a friends and I love it.  The first time I tried it I had a few streaks but the next day I just applied more and took my time. It came out perfect!! I do wish I would have purchased the brush because it does stain your hands if you dont wash immediatly after. I just used dawn with bleach and a scrubber and it came right off but save the time and get the brush. After applying a little each day for about a 4 days you couldnt tell the difference between the girls that had been tanning for weeks and myself! Also, I didnt purchase the face tanner I just used the regular on my face very carefully.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive at first when I bought this. $26 for a self tanner? I was convinced that it was going to turn me orange like the rest of the self tanners on this planet. Previously I had used St. Tropez and was really displeased with the bronze look after it dried on my skin, and worried that Faux Tan Body would do the same. I have yellow undertones, so the whole &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; look isn&#x27;t something I can pull off without it turning orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on nicely. And it dried quickly. Maybe 5 to 8 minutes and I was able to put my clothes on and go about my day. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t look orange on my skin. At all. A nice natural looking tan, and I&#x27;m convinced my skin looks like it&#x27;s glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s brown in color so you can see where it&#x27;s going, and like  all self tanning lotion, it WILL be streaky if you don&#x27;t apply enough or apply it well. But that&#x27;s not the lotions&#x27; fault. And I would definitely suggest getting a mitt to put it on. It soaks into the skin quickly, and will darken your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the best self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used yet, and for the price, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased. I highly suggest this self tanner!</li>
    <li> This seemed either old or fake.. I&#x27;ve used Bare Mineral Faux Tan before and this just doesn&#x27;t go on easily.. It&#x27;s very hard to blend, even with the bare minerals tan brush . it does tan you.. But it rubs off fairly easy and it was so hard to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several self-tanners after swearing off tanning beds this year, finding many great options for my body, but none for my face. I staked out Ulta for about 3 weeks after hearing such great reviews from the staff and other customers. A month later, I gave up and finally ordered it online. The other products I&#x27;ve used include every drugstore self tanner along with Million Dollar Tan (my go-to for body) and Clinique. Both of these caused breakouts and looked unnatural on my face, but were great for body applications. Faux Tan gives such an amazing color, looks natural, blends and fades evenly. I like to exfoliate a lot, so I use one pump of this nightly and don&#x27;t mind the frequent use at all. Others may not have liked the dark amber color guard, but I find it to be much more useful than others and helps to blend, especially along the hairline. I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals everything for the longest time and will add this to my stash forever.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Bare Minerals faux tan for years. It is the absolute best.It is dark when it come out and blends perfectly. I even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 7 minutes to apply because I have it down to a science. I recommend this to anyone wanting to look tan and have some color&lt;br /&gt;without turning orange. It actually turns brown.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this tanner except that it is the best.</li>
    <li> It really works well!</li>
    <li> I thought last year I would try this after I had read all the reviews.  WONDERFUL!!  Goes on very easy and dries fairly quickly.  If you want a really dark tan this is not for you.  I just wanted to have a nice tan that looked natural for my medium fair skin and this did it.  I applied it about twice a week and that seems to do it.  Mine lasts quite a long time but I always keep an extra bottle.  I remember last year when it seems everyone ran out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST I HAVE FOUND FOR ME!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  I have used many similar products, this is the best.  No streaking or freckling like some products do.</li>
    <li> I hated it. It dried streaky and had a strong scent. I was expecting better from bare Minerals as I love most of their natural products.</li>
    <li> Great but not from this supplier...the tan doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as when I purchased it from QVC/Sephora</li>
    <li> The color is good for me, but any kind of fake tan is a lot of work. I used it for most of the summer and plan to use it again next year.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described. Does not have a smell like some sunless tanning lotions. The color lasts for a few days also.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  However, I bought a 2 pack for a reasonable price and the tanner was not quite right.  It should work immediately and last for a few days.  This specific tanner purchased from this company was off. The tanner did not smell right nor did it work.  It was not the real stuff. So disappointed!!!! Will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product, compared to most sunless tanners.  Also, because it&#x27;s pigmented, you can see if you&#x27;re applying evenly.  Only drawback is that I have to wear latex gloves to apply because it stains the palms of my hands if I don&#x27;t.  But this turns out to be a blessing in disguise since the product is a bit pricey, and when wearing gloves, it doesn&#x27;t get wasted by absorbing into your palms.</li>
    <li> I like that it lasts , does not smell horrible (smells a bit at first but the smell goes away), washes off of my hands after application, does  not rub off onto clothes, looks natural, not orange.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunless tanner!  I&#x27;ve tried many in the past, plus I also go to tanning beds (I know, I know, totally not healthy, but it is my vice).  This tanner looks totally natural.  It has bronzers in it which will wash off in the shower, leaving the self-tan behind.  It will stain your hands. You can not wash it off quickly enough for it not to stain.  What I do is squirt some on a washcloth and use the cloth to apply it.  This seems to work really well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It has excellent coverage and very little smell.</li>
    <li> We are big fans of Faux Tan.  We use it as a base coat for dance competitions (and then put pro tan on top).  However, this faux tan body is not near as good.  It is not dark enough to really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are really pale and just looking to add a bit of color, it is probably fine.  But if you actually want to look &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t waste your time.  Or get this stuff which is the original formula:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B8NZ38/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A1HG1CCLM3B5ZP</li>
    <li> I like this self-tanner a lot- but there are better formulas out there.  This Bare Minerals product is nice because you achieve some color right after application and the color appears pretty dark with only one application.  The smell is nice, nothing strong or offensive to me.  The lotion-like consistency is okay, I prefer a mousse for easier, less-sticky application.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about this tanner is that when it fades, sometimes it fades splotchy depending on how dry your skin is.  As for the color, it is nice but there are better ones that I have tried.  I prefer olive-based tanners like St. Tropez (my favorite).  The color has more of a red-brown tone to it, but it is still very nice!  All in all, I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again just because I like St. Tropez SO much better.</li>
    <li> I have used this for three years and it&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> a bit hard to get off of skin on hands, but it is a very natural looking tan and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is so natural and easy to apply.  Will immediately show any streaks so you can blend them out.  The color is natural and not orangey -  Thanks Bare Minerals for this fabulous product</li>
    <li> I was extreamly excited to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;It got really good reviews so I figured it would defiantly be worth giving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;For starters, it&#x27;s not unsented like the rest of the reviews make it out to be. It smells very stongly of baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s streaky. It makes you look like you have a desease after you shower.&lt;br /&gt;I did everything possible to try to rub it in evenly- reapplied, ect.&lt;br /&gt;I still wouldnt be caught dead leaving the house looking like this.&lt;br /&gt;I READ REVIEWS SAYING PERHAPS THIS IS A FAKE PRODUCT AND NOT REAL BARE MINERALS....&lt;br /&gt;That would make sense, seeing this poor quality prodcut along side its stellar reviews.</li>
    <li> Truly looks &#x27;better than real&#x27;. Tan deepens each time you reapply. Does tend to stain palms faster than can be washed off. Be sure to apply evenly.</li>
    <li> It works only ok.. You really need the brush to be able to get it looking good and streak free. but I didn&#x27;t get to buy the brush so I haven&#x27;t got to see it streak free yet. :/</li>
    <li> I have tried many sunless tanning products.  This is my new favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, has a nice smell and gives a good color.  Nothing orange about this sunless tanner, a huge plus.  As with any sunless tanner shave your legs the day before you use your tanning product.  Also exfoliate the day of use and wear gloves when applying.  On days I want a more subtle glow I use three pumps of Faux Tan Body and one pump ofregular lotion, mix them together, then apply.  This method is beautiful every time with no streaks.  Faux Tan Body also sheds well with the least amount of patchiness of any tanner I have used thus far.  I think it is the moisture factor.  Really a great sunless tan!</li>
    <li> Okay lets be honest, during the summer everyone wants to be tan.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m waaaaaaaay too lazy to lay outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several tanners. Last year was St. Tropez. Expensive and it turned me orange. Which was 100% wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year I tried Faux Tan by Bare Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m. In. Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as expensive as most of the top shelf self tanners. Which I love. I bought the face version and the body and still didn&#x27;t spend what I did on a bottle of St. Tropez. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it actually makes me look like I have a natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is weird...yellow undertones...so most tanners make me look orange. This one? Not at all. I&#x27;ve had several comments from strangers out and about asking me how the heck I got blessed with easily tanned skin...they&#x27;re wrong. It takes me FOREVER to develop color the older I get...and in one application of this stuff, I was 100% pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is a self tanner lotion, it&#x27;s not perfect. NO SELF TANNER IS. Every single one streaks, sometimes darker in spots...it&#x27;s a never-ending battle that I gave up trying to win a long time ago. It&#x27;s a gradual color developing lotion; so it&#x27;ll get darker over a few hours. You can&#x27;t put it on and expect to be wow-ed right away. Not a miracle worker. But it dries fairly quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait 10 minutes to put clothes on. It&#x27;s tinted, so you can get a general idea of where you&#x27;re putting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great product that I&#x27;m going to keep using, and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good color, no oder, long lasting</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only thing as far as home sunless tanners that i will put on my face.  It has a greenish tint to it, which sounds weird, but it is the best idea ever because it eliminates that orange tone completely.  What it is is just a little brown with one application, and a little more tan with two.  Believe me I have tried all of the most expensive ones, including LaMer and Le&#x27; Prarie, and this is the best most natural product out there.  Finally somebody got it right!  No orange, Ever!  No bizarre bronze  face.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;orange hue&amp;#34; that everyone is concerned with.  And smell isn&#x27;t as bad as so many of the sunless tanners. I frequently get compliments on my tan and when I say it&#x27;s fake, everyone asks what product I use. I recommend this one. But I must admit that I exfoliate first, then put on regular lotion, THEN I apply this product.  This method works really well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is so natural, no streaks, and no dangerous sun tan.</li>
    <li> Still can show up as orange in places if you don&#x27;t scrub and moisturize your body REALLY well before applying. But it still serves its purpose if you follow the directions perfectly.</li>
    <li> Having given up outdoor tanning years ago, I have tried several brands of self-tanner. This one is the one I always come back to because nothing else compares. I have tried others for lower price as well as accessibility as this brand is best found online for me. I love this brand of self tanner for ease of application, provides the most natural tan (I have olive skin tones normally), lasts several days, and most importantly DOES NOT SMELL. I cannot stand the smells of most self-tanners, including those that smell like coconuts or beach-y smells. I&#x27;m not at the beach so I don&#x27;t care to smell like a Brazilian cocktail.  I would recommend this hands down as the best on the market. If you don&#x27;t want your the palms of your hands darkened, use a brush; always apply sparingly on knees, elbows, ankles, and toes.  Last tidbit is that if you are accustomed to the white bottle of this brand, this is a bit different. The price point is much better and it&#x27;s a bit creamier and easier to apply. The original formula which is quite pricey I always added a drop of oil to help blend it. I don&#x27;t need to do that with this one. Enjoy your happy and healthy tanning!</li>
    <li> Best fake tan cream, looks like chocolate pudding so you can see where it is not rubbed in</li>
    <li> great stuff if you want a instant tan this is the stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the texture being dark and gel like consistency. I hate that it doesn&#x27;t get you that deep tan that will last for 3-4 days; however, this will not make you orange and is perfect if you are where you at with tan or self tan and just want a little brown punch of color!</li>
    <li> I like this product but I really liked their old one the best.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t. While the color is very natural, it is impossible to apply without being streaky and blotchy. I think it is because the formula is too thick. If anyone has pointers on how to apply without streaking I would really appreciate it. I&#x27;ve used many other self tanners with much better results. I&#x27;m going back to those.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Easy on, looks natural, and lasts a few days. I was even asked is I had been on a vacation!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I doesn&#x27;t come off on the sheets, it doesn&#x27;t get all weird looking after a couple of weeks and it lasts for a week.  Just be careful to use gloves when applying.</li>
    <li> You can wear this during the day, it doesn&#x27;t smell and gives a great brown color.</li>
    <li> I love the face Faux Tan much better. But anytime I wear this, people think I have stalkings on.  That perfect tan even color!</li>
    <li> Love my faux tan!!!!!!!</li>
