      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>The clips are my favorite!</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot!!!!!</li>
      <li>The clips are great for even hairstyles, the timer is great for cleaning up a room if you need inspiration, or reminding yourself of the time, the bowl is great for your wax strips instead of getting wax on your counters, and also useful for your razor while you are bathing, instead of setting it directly on the edge of the tub.</li>
      <li>Great set and much cheaper than their website!</li>
      <li>The timer was handy and worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>The bowl is cute, but no measurement marks.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>but i wouldn&#x27;t want to pay more.</li>
      <li>I love this set of useful tools!</li>
      <li>Clips have a strong grip and do not snag on your hair.</li>
      <li>It all came in a nice little cardboard box that works great for storage too :)</li>
      <li>The clips held my hair in place and the bowl and brush easily rinsed clean.  </li>
      <li>It is really high quality and really nice though.  </li>
      <li>Clips are worth the price by itself!</li>
      <li>The bowl was just the right size.  </li>
      <li>Loved the whole set, the price on Amazon was fantastic, even less than eSalon&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>I do not use this for the intended purpose, but you certainly could!</li>
      <li>The brush is super small but the rest of the items are good.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was hoping it would be Thankyou</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers said, it would be nice if the container had measurements.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Comes with 15$ off your purchase on the esalon.com, ordered a shampoo for free and paid only delivery, score.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really need the clips but they are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The bowl has a little brush scraper on one side, which I found really nice, and the little brush is the perfect size for my small hands.</li>
      <li>Wish the supplied brush were less bendy and not so long bristled as it doesn&#x27;t help getting to the scalp, but everything else is good</li>
      <li>I used it the other day, and it was very helpful to have the clips, bowl and brush instead of using the cheap accessories they give in the drugstore coloring kits.  </li>
      <li>The clips and timer were truly the only useful items.</li>
      <li>The clips are fantastic, they hold tight and are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Just got it today and the packaging was very nice and everything was accounted for and Nothing was broken!</li>
      <li>This was such a nice little kit for the price.  </li>
      <li>I had to go to Sally and buy normal size brush, which is, actually, twice wider as the one in the kit</li>
      <li>The brush is quite small, it was worth the $6.00 I paid</li>

<li> Timer, bowl and brush are like any other.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair at home for over 10 years, and I&#x27;ve gone through plenty of bowls brushes and clips (due to forgetting to wash them...)</li>
<li> The little timer works well, and even came with a battery.</li>
<li> It was a shallow bowl but had a wide bottom for stability.</li>
<li> I am just an amateur and have never done this from scratch at home before.</li>
<li> brush is a bit small, tho.</li>
<li> The brush and mixing bowl are so tiny they are almost useless.</li>
<li> The brush is tiny and, therefore,  was useless for me as well.</li>
<li> Otherwise, it is useless.</li>
<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a brush, hair clips, a mixing bowl and a timer!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything to complain about this product even if I tried.  Even the packaging it came in looked nice! The bowl was just the right size.  I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it being too tall that it might fall over.  It was a shallow bowl but had a wide bottom for stability. The bottom has a rubberized edging to prevent it from slipping and sliding across the counter.  The clips held my hair in place and the bowl and brush easily rinsed clean.  The timer was handy and worked just fine.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Could have saved my money.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need this whenever you dye your hair! You can&#x27;t go wrong with a brush, hair clips, a mixing bowl and a timer!</li>
    <li> Great product and packaging ! This is exactly what I was hoping it would be Thankyou</li>
    <li> JUNK! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Clips have a strong grip and do not snag on your hair. Timer, bowl and brush are like any other. All items are reusable time and time again.</li>
    <li> Loved the whole set, the price on Amazon was fantastic, even less than eSalon&#x27;s website.  Very happy with product.  Like other reviewers said, it would be nice if the container had measurements.</li>
    <li> If you need clips, then You might consider to buy this kit. Otherwise, it is useless. The bowl is cute, but no measurement marks. If you color your hair DIY, you must buy a mesuring beaker in addition. The brush is tiny and, therefore,  was useless for me as well. I had to go to Sally and buy normal size brush, which is, actually, twice wider as the one in the kit There is also included ancient looking timer and a battery. I did not use it, I have an app for timing.</li>
    <li> The brush is quite small, it was worth the $6.00 I paid but i wouldn&#x27;t want to pay more. i got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> The brush is super small but the rest of the items are good. I didn&#x27;t really need the clips but they are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This was such a nice little kit for the price.  I used it the other day, and it was very helpful to have the clips, bowl and brush instead of using the cheap accessories they give in the drugstore coloring kits.  I even used the timer which was quite handy!</li>

    <li> I like ur service and ur products. Thanks a lot!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very Nice And Appropriate Product!</li>
    <li> Great to use, figure out, and everything you need. I am just an amateur and have never done this from scratch at home before. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love this set of useful tools! The clips are great for even hairstyles, the timer is great for cleaning up a room if you need inspiration, or reminding yourself of the time, the bowl is great for your wax strips instead of getting wax on your counters, and also useful for your razor while you are bathing, instead of setting it directly on the edge of the tub. I am going to get another set at this price. I do not use this for the intended purpose, but you certainly could!</li>
    <li> The clips are my favorite!</li>
    <li> great products for the price! you wont regret buying this</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT package of tools. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair at home for over 10 years, and I&#x27;ve gone through plenty of bowls brushes and clips (due to forgetting to wash them...) and I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of this kit for the price. The clips are fantastic, they hold tight and are very sturdy. The little timer works well, and even came with a battery. The bowl has a little brush scraper on one side, which I found really nice, and the little brush is the perfect size for my small hands. The bowl does not have measurement lines inside of it though, just in case anyone was wondering.  It all came in a nice little cardboard box that works great for storage too :)</li>
    <li> Great set and much cheaper than their website!</li>
    <li> I probably didn&#x27;t need these items and should have thought twice before I bought them.  They are great for my kids to pretend though.  If you dye your hair and use gloves and a bottle, you probably don&#x27;t need it either.  It is really high quality and really nice though.  So I would recommend this product if you are in need of the items.</li>
    <li> Great deal!! Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Oh my, clips are great! Comes with 15$ off your purchase on the esalon.com, ordered a shampoo for free and paid only delivery, score. brush is a bit small, tho.</li>
    <li> I love this. Just got it today and the packaging was very nice and everything was accounted for and Nothing was broken! Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> The clips and timer were truly the only useful items. The brush and mixing bowl are so tiny they are almost useless. Would not buy again</li>
