      <li>It was very comforting and got rid of the pain.</li>
      <li>Much to our surprise it really does help.  </li>
      <li>so I cannot really describe how it is working.  </li>
      <li>Many of the mainstream studies indicate that much of the IR benefits are due to the heat generated, so</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very grateful to have something someone invented that actually helps when you need relief.</li>
      <li>I was travelling and they allowed two days to complete the print out.</li>
      <li>- then it stopped working completely.  </li>
      <li>directions included but really not needed as it is common sense how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The large pad is a logical add on as most people will have areas larger than the original small pad area that they want treated.</li>
      <li>Half of the lights on the pad do not light and it effectively, does not work as it is intended.</li>
      <li>I was initially skeptical of this product due to the many mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m now quite pleased with it having had it for several weeks now.</li>
      <li>I bought mine back in &#x27;05 for fibro pain and frequent loss of use of one arm.</li>
      <li>I am a retired physical therapy professional</li>
      <li>for long periods of time, but for normal people it&#x27;s just not workable.</li>
      <li>This particular set also comes with a much larger pad, but I&#x27;ve only used the smaller blue pad that is about the size of a paperback book but a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cord is not long enough.  </li>
      <li>I have some joint pain and this little machine really helps to relief it.</li>

<li> Not sure how this works</li>

<li> VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, The product is defective and the company selling it is incompetent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve heard the company itself is difficult to deal with if you get a malfunctioning device</li>
<li> This product is too complicated for him</li>
<li> However, there seems to be nothing that relieves my wife&#x27;s painful degenerative disks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought mine back in &#x27;05 for fibro pain and frequent loss of use of one arm. This device really helps me, I start up on my shoulder and work down a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wires are a mite lightweight so be easy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not order the oversize pad at first, I am doing that today.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical of this product due to the many mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m now quite pleased with it having had it for several weeks now. I think that the many folks who&#x27;ve given it bad reviews are doing so because they don&#x27;t know what infrared (IR) is used for and so have unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding. Also, different wavelengths of infrared are used for different things, and unfortunately this device does not indicate what nm wavelengths this device is emitting. Many of the mainstream studies indicate that much of the IR benefits are due to the heat generated, so if you don&#x27;t have the heat enabled, you may not get the relief you are seeking for whatever issue you might be using this for. The predominant effect is that it increases blood flow/circulation. If you have neuropathy you likely won&#x27;t have any benefit from this as that is nerve pain not related to circulation. Conditions with an inflammatory aspect, such as arthritis, are more likely to benefit from this type of therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was specifically intending to use this to increase lymphatic flow and decrease associated pain from lymphatic congestion. For this purpose this worked quite well.  I applied two sessions (the device is set to about 15 minutes sessions then turns off) with heat to each axillary (armpit) area and upper arm. you can take the blue pad off the white plastic part you see in the picture, and doing so the blue pad is then somewhat flexible and can be curved or bent to some extent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend folding it in half or even close to that, but I think having it bend into a C type shape seems fine without causing any damage. This particular set also comes with a much larger pad, but I&#x27;ve only used the smaller blue pad that is about the size of a paperback book but a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you have the type of pain that feels better with heat, you will most likely feel better with this.</li>
    <li> An interesting concept for relieving pain, which it did. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> The cord is not long enough.  It is awkward to connect and disconnect the large pad purchased with the device to cover large areas.</li>
    <li> I read all the good reviews before purchasing. I have arthritis and pain/neck pain. I found after daily use that my pain was lessened. You do need to order the larger pad for the back.</li>
    <li> I received a defective product. Half of the lights on the pad do not light and it effectively, does not work as it is intended. I paid extra money for the pad because, where my pain is located it is difficult to just use the hand held device. For weeks now I have been trying to get a return label from this company and they offered a label that I had to print out. I was travelling and they allowed two days to complete the print out. I like many people no longer use a printer. In any case I do not see why I should have to spend any money to send their defective product back, (this includes the expense of printing out a label). The company has sent many e-mails to me all addressed to the wrong person. I am nervous about sending the product back. Who will get the credit? The person named in the e-mail or, myself. I was very excited about receiving this product because I know that it works. Unfortunately, The product is defective and the company selling it is incompetent. This is the second time I have ordered this type of product and it is the second time it has been defective. Both products were made in China. Beware here !!</li>
    <li> Unit is good for my back problems. I found one connection need adjusted, and it now appears O.K............How long is the Warranty, and how would I return the Light Relif under warranty?.......Rich</li>
    <li> bought 2 x this unit and TWICE NEW UNITS BROKE AND COMPANY WILL NOT REPLACE It&lt;br /&gt;called to customer service and they DO ANYTHING NOT TO REPLACE the units&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st they pretanded they can not hear me well&lt;br /&gt;2nd time after spending 10 mins with CS Rep he started saying again I can not hear you well hallo hallo he said I will hang up&lt;br /&gt;3rd time called they said they system is down..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW...speaking about customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews on other amazon reseller site they say same thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO the owner of the company has lucrative business coz he loves not to take defected units back&lt;br /&gt;what a joke</li>
    <li> I never wrote a review before, but I feel I must warn people that this is a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;It worked for 15 minutes - 15MINUTES! - then it stopped working completely.  We tried pressing every button, reset, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Had to give it one star to register a review -  But it should be zero or negative</li>
    <li> feels good not sure if it really heps</li>
    <li> HAVE TO BUY THIS ONE TO REPLACE THE CURRENT ONE THAT BROKE.  WIFE LOVES IT, COMES HOME WITH EXERCISE PAIN AND USE THIS PAIN RELIEF DEVICE.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I got this item for my father who is in a nursing home.  He saw this on TV and he thought he would be able to use it.  This product is too complicated for him so I had to return it.  I do think though that it may be great for someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> Everything seems to be working fine.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but I think there was a mild amount of relief. The product arrived very well packed, new in sealed packages with everything I needed to use it right away.  It&#x27;s simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy directions included but really not needed as it is common sense how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The large pad is a logical add on as most people will have areas larger than the original small pad area that they want treated.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes the area feel better for a time and I use it twice a day. Don&#x27;t know about it curing anything, but have only had it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Did not find this to help so much.But my hip is and was in pretty bad shape.I think it would be great on pain that did not come from the bone.</li>
    <li> VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !  The two heating devices are awkward (VERY) to use,&lt;br /&gt;you must remain totally still while using, and the program demands that you use the&lt;br /&gt;devices ONLY in 15 minute segments.  That may work for people who have time to sit&lt;br /&gt;still for long periods of time, but for normal people it&#x27;s just not workable.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works but I definitely felt a difference after a couple of uses. Seems I can feel the heat deeper into my body.I ordered the larger pad But I wish there were an even  larger one. My husband needs a larger one for his entire back. I also would recommend a wrap type pad for wrists and hands</li>
    <li> This light relief really works!  Love the larger pad also! Handy travel bag makes it convenient for weekends away from home!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift so I cannot really describe how it is working.  The person I gave it to seems to like it&lt;br /&gt;and says it works for them when they use it.</li>
    <li> Relieved pain in several spots on the feet for me.  One area was from stubbed toe and related joint swelling that went away in a day or two after using the device.</li>
    <li> Much to our surprise it really does help.  My husband has had nine back surgeries, ankle surgery, many aches and pains and gets relief from the Light Relief Infrared Device.  I have low back pain and I too get relief from using the device. It&#x27;s great we both benefit from it. Thank you</li>
    <li> This works very well on my sever osteoarthritis in my knees the large pad is perfect have also use on low back siatic joint and my shoulder.  I am a retired physical therapy professional so I have high expectations ewen it comes to pain relief . I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> Disappointed to say that I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in pain when used on a knee and lower back.  Also, this thing needs to ding or something to let you know when it&#x27;s ended the cycle.  Otherwise you&#x27;re laying there and accomplishing nothing.  I get way better results with my ultrasound machine.  That thing rocks!</li>
    <li> Light Relief works great on my sore muscles after a day of overworking my back while gardening and other strenuous activities.  However, there seems to be nothing that relieves my wife&#x27;s painful degenerative disks and my daughters torn tendons short of surgery.  I however feel great immediately after one or two 10 min. treatments, like I hadn&#x27;t just struggled in the door and collapsed on the couch a 1/2 hr. ago.</li>
    <li> love this item helps reduce back ache the heat is so soothing and relaxing.  Recommend it for everyone that has back problems.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product I use the light relief daily to help with my osteoarthritis.  It helps to ease the pain and stiffness associated with the daily pain from my arthritis. Once applied I can move with so much more ease and tends to give me all day relief.  I love the convenience of the battery operated feature and  the way the silicone base is removable to apply to any where you may need it.  I also purchased the larger pad which work great on larger areas.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs relief from muscle aches and pain.  Soooo glad I purchased it !!!</li>
    <li> It really works for me!</li>
    <li> It has helped a great deal to take the pain from my fractured vertebrae and give me a little peace. Thank You! I&#x27;m very grateful to have something someone invented that actually helps when you need relief.</li>
    <li> I have some joint pain and this little machine really helps to relief it. I also used it when I got some ear ache. It was very comforting and got rid of the pain.</li>
    <li> I would never have believed it, but this crazy-sounding gadget helped my DH recover from 3+ months of daily debilitating migraine headaches.  I don&#x27;t understand how it works, but it does!  I&#x27;ve heard the company itself is difficult to deal with if you get a malfunctioning device so I ordered through Amazon - Amazon is easy to deal with.</li>
    <li> It works great !  I  use it every day and love it. I also purchased the large pad which is great for my back.</li>
    <li> great for painrelief, no need for medication</li>
    <li> I never figured out how this is supposed to work.</li>
