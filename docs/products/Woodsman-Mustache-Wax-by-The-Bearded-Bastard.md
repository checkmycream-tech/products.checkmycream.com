      <li>Great hold, makes eating a lot easier, when product is applied moustache still looks natural.</li>
      <li>It has a fairly good hold to it, I had to use a bit more than might be normal because of my hair being rebellious.</li>
      <li>not an easy application</li>
      <li>I own a few waxes and wanted to try to see what would be ideal for me.  </li>

      <li>It also has a nice hold throughout my normal day.  </li>
      <li>the wax is great but does not hold my mustache hairs for long.</li>
      <li>The hold was significantly better and looked more natural.  </li>
      <li>This wax has great hold and a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the packaging, the Woodsman logo is affixed with glue and looks a little cheap, but the stuff on the inside is what you&#x27;re really after, and after using it for a few weeks I am happy to report that it allows me to shape my mustache quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at receiving it, as I did not expect a nicely wooded tin.</li>
      <li>Not bad stuff</li>

      <li>The wax itself is very viscous and smells strongly of cedar.</li>
      <li>I could tell you how much fun I&#x27;ve had styling my mustache, &amp; about all the compliments I get from both men &amp; women whenever I use it.</li>
      <li>This wax is well worth the money and the manufacturer provides plenty in the size of the tin for the cost.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After working the wax in, it has an outstanding aroma; one that reminds you often that this world is primarily wooded and lush, not covered in concrete and asphalt.  </li>
      <li>I could give you a long detailed account of how badass the guy who make this is, &amp; how much I love this wax.</li>
      <li>Its held its own in some desert heat and long nights of working.</li>
      <li>I like this wax a little better than Firehouse, mostly because of the cedar smell.</li>
      <li>The masculine cedar, pine, and sandalwood smoky scent lasts for hours and the hold is strong.</li>
      <li>The wax itself is very solid, which I did expect, and upon using thumbnails to adze off the appropriate amount, I got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Jeremy!</li>
      <li>The first wax I have used that does the job.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I live in a warm and humid environment and sweat is constantly an issue, but this stuff holds up well in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I might not be putting enough in, but I have oddly strong mustache hair so this may not be a issue for a lot of people.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m curling my first mustache and just picked one that got decent reviews.  </li>
      <li>Everything from the tin itself, to the smell, to the ease of use is just fantastic, second to none.</li>
      <li>If you like VERY woodsy smelling stuff and something made for heat and humidity, get this.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>My handlebars are not yet ready for competition, but I&#x27;m using this to train the stache.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>I did not reapply in between, the wax held that whole time.</li>
      <li>If going the entire full day it sometimes needs a touch up, but I&#x27;m talking over 10 hours.</li>
      <li>Your ol lady may get jealous with all the attention your new stache is getting !</li>
      <li>mustache is a wide, 4 color brute and like his big brother (The Beard), he has a mind and temperament of his own.  </li>
      <li>Last year I ran a half marathon, before I left for the start line I curled my mustache, &amp; let me tell you my mustache was still curled &amp; looking great hours after the race when I met friends for drinks.</li>
      <li>I had tried several other brands before this, some went on too chunky and I was left with clumps, others went on great but simply had no hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All natural, no petroleum products!</li>
      <li>I have had several containers and they have all proven to be consistent.</li>
      <li>But it holds just right and holds for a long time.</li>
      <li>The Woodsman looks slightly greasy and isn&#x27;t very comfortable in the middle hairs of my stache.  </li>
      <li>Smells epic.</li>
      <li>It was thick and didn&#x27;t want to soften enough to effectively spread throughout my beard.</li>
      <li>I might go back and review this product in a few months to see how it does when my mustache is a bit more massive.</li>
      <li>Unique and actually adds a little traction when opening.  </li>
      <li>the sad truth is I kind of get that description.</li>
      <li>Can You Handlebar mustache wax (go for the double which includes Primary and Secondary wax)  over Bearded Bastard.  </li>
      <li>it smells very &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; with a slightly chemical fragrence - like you&#x27;re in a lumber yard with treated wood.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Smells amazing and easily workable. Holds my stache all day. The first wax I have used that does the job. I will probably only be buying Woodsman Wax from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into mustache culture and showing off your manliness, please, please, please buy a tin of this wax!!!!</li>
    <li> Great hold that loosens up as the day goes on - it smells very &amp;#34;Woodsy&amp;#34; with a slightly chemical fragrence - like you&#x27;re in a lumber yard with treated wood. That is my only complaint of the product - my girlfriends initial reaction was it smells like &#x27;a funereal home&#x27; and the sad truth is I kind of get that description. Needless to say it does its job well and I cant fault it as the smell might appeal to some just not really to me and my lady friend.</li>
    <li> Best hold of the waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great wax, medium-strong hold. Doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly if you&#x27;re eating or drinking. Smells pleasant. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I had tried several other brands before this, some went on too chunky and I was left with clumps, others went on great but simply had no hold.&lt;br /&gt;The Woodman goes on easy and maintains its hold on my handlebar, and I have even been able to swim in the product without having to reapply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has also noted that she loves the scent, which is an obvious bonus.</li>
    <li> Smells like Paul Bunyan feels.  The perfect consistency--not too waxy or creamy.  Holds my hybrid fu manchu / horseshoe with five inch tails all day long.</li>
    <li> Had to think about what I wanted to put in this review. I could give you a long detailed account of how badass the guy who make this is, &amp; how much I love this wax. Everything from the tin itself, to the smell, to the ease of use is just fantastic, second to none. I could tell you how much fun I&#x27;ve had styling my mustache, &amp; about all the compliments I get from both men &amp; women whenever I use it. But instead I&#x27;m going to tell you why I&#x27;ll never use anything but The Bearded Bastard&#x27;s wax. Last year I ran a half marathon, before I left for the start line I curled my mustache, &amp; let me tell you my mustache was still curled &amp; looking great hours after the race when I met friends for drinks. I did not reapply in between, the wax held that whole time. So whether you&#x27;re looking to make crazy shapes with your mustache, or just keep it out of your lunch, do yourself &amp; your mustache a favor &amp; pick up some Woodsman mustache wax from The Bearded Bastard.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Works perfectly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on several different brands, and &amp;#34; Woodsman &amp;#34; stood out from the rest. An excellent choice for a medium hold, everyday stache.  My handlebars are not yet ready for competition, but I&#x27;m using this to train the stache.  Goes on good, no build up,  smells Awesome,  and styles great. Which means no more eating my stache, and out of my beer. There are a lot of different brands out there, and if you&#x27;re not sure which one is for you?  I recommend the Woodsman.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  All natural, no petroleum products! Your ol lady may get jealous with all the attention your new stache is getting ! ;)</li>
    <li> This wax has great hold and a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the packaging, the Woodsman logo is affixed with glue and looks a little cheap, but the stuff on the inside is what you&#x27;re really after, and after using it for a few weeks I am happy to report that it allows me to shape my mustache quickly and easily. It spreads easily, but once it is in has great hold. I live in a warm and humid environment and sweat is constantly an issue, but this stuff holds up well in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, but fades after the first hour. The smell is woody with a hint of campfire and it goes on well after a morning shave. In my opinion this stuff has better hold than Fisticuffs, although Fisticuffs is quite good as well and if you can afford it I&#x27;d pick up a tin of that too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and it always smells nice.  It also has a nice hold throughout my normal day.  I have had several containers and they have all proven to be consistent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love and recommend this product. It keeps my mustache well-behaved and the scent is fantastic--it smells like I&#x27;ve been splitting wood all day! The masculine cedar, pine, and sandalwood smoky scent lasts for hours and the hold is strong. A great product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it felt good but I found it difficult to apply.  It was thick and didn&#x27;t want to soften enough to effectively spread throughout my beard.</li>
    <li> Great smell, good hold</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;ve used Clubman. I bought Firehouse to try wax and I like the fact that you can reshape it, which you can&#x27;t with Clubman. I like this wax a little better than Firehouse, mostly because of the cedar smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff rules. Smells great, goes on nice and easy and has s firm hold even in Florida humidity.</li>
    <li> Great hold, makes eating a lot easier, when product is applied moustache still looks natural.</li>
    <li> Awesome hold!  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Not that great. gave baby a rash. Hubby can&#x27;t even wear it without  her getting hives from it. seems to work alright though. Def note ordering again.</li>
    <li> Good mustache wax, pretty hard but keeps shape excellently. Nice scent to boot.</li>
    <li> A great hold. I work in kitchens the will get up to 100+ degrees and it will still hold by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve stopped testing other waxes since this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff works and smells fantastic</li>
    <li> Get the Fisticuffs. The woodsman smells pretty damn good but seems a bit greasy and donsent take hold like you would expect.</li>
    <li> I just ordered 3 more.  I am in love with the stuff!  This wax holds my beard in place like a champ!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m curling my first mustache and just picked one that got decent reviews.  I do love the smell of this wax a lot but I have to re-apply several times a day.  Not bad stuff</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the packaging. It just does not provide enough hold for my very thick, straight, course mustache hair.</li>
    <li> good workable wax. great smell. not too tough</li>
    <li> This mustache was is a great product. The tin the wax comes in has a wooden finish on either side and wreaks of testosterone. The wax itself is very viscous and smells strongly of cedar. A smell that I love to put into my beard. Here is why I have it four stars...the wax is great but does not hold my mustache hairs for long. I put it on and less than an hour later the hold is no more and I have hair tickles my lip and my handlebar mustache is sad and droopy. I might not be putting enough in, but I have oddly strong mustache hair so this may not be a issue for a lot of people.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product really wanting to like it but was left slightly disappointed.  I own a few waxes and wanted to try to see what would be ideal for me.  First of all, I was quite happy with the ingredients with Woodsman Mustache Wax.  I prefer my wax to be natural and this fit the bill perfectly.  The wax wasn&#x27;t too hard to scrape out, but I am not happy with the look or hold it provides.  The Woodsman looks slightly greasy and isn&#x27;t very comfortable in the middle hairs of my stache.  I also found it slightly difficult at keeping the hairs at the end of my handlebar together which resulted in an undesirable look that was reminiscent of a cats whiskers.  I would recommend  Can You Handlebar mustache wax (go for the double which includes Primary and Secondary wax)  over Bearded Bastard.  The hold was significantly better and looked more natural.  I might go back and review this product in a few months to see how it does when my mustache is a bit more massive.</li>
    <li> Dear powers that be, this stuff smells woodsy! It has a fairly good hold to it, I had to use a bit more than might be normal because of my hair being rebellious. But it holds just right and holds for a long time. If you like VERY woodsy smelling stuff and something made for heat and humidity, get this.</li>
    <li> My mustache likes to put in the fight.  In doing so, I need to engage in fisticuffs with it on a daily basis.  I have failed in earlier attempts, using inferior waxes, and I must admit that the Woodsman was going to be my last ditch effort.  If the Woodsman couldn&#x27;t do it, no wax could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at receiving it, as I did not expect a nicely wooded tin. Unique and actually adds a little traction when opening.  The wax itself is very solid, which I did expect, and upon using thumbnails to adze off the appropriate amount, I got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mustache is a wide, 4 color brute and like his big brother (The Beard), he has a mind and temperament of his own.  With the wax being as solid as it is, it took some time to work it in.  The use of a comb helped a bit to make sure the application was evened out.  Please keep in mind, this product is not for the meek and timid and when you work it in, you WILL lose a few strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After working the wax in, it has an outstanding aroma; one that reminds you often that this world is primarily wooded and lush, not covered in concrete and asphalt.  It has an all-day attitude with only needing occasional reminders from you that should your mustache have a curl.  This wax is well worth the money and the manufacturer provides plenty in the size of the tin for the cost.  I know I will be using this for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
    <li> not an easy application but once done holds up great</li>
    <li> I love this Wax. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and can&#x27;t complain. Its held its own in some desert heat and long nights of working. I would buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday. Good smell, good hold. If going the entire full day it sometimes needs a touch up, but I&#x27;m talking over 10 hours. It&#x27;s great wax.</li>
    <li> Love the hold but I&#x27;m not as crazy about the scent as I thought I&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stick with this product line and try the Barbershop scent wax next.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. Don&#x27;t use too much. It is a very hard wax so you don&#x27;t need much. Offers great control. Thanks Jeremy!</li>
    <li> Great hold and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells epic. A must for really long mustaches.</li>
