      <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
      <li>Lightly elegant scent-</li>
      <li>My skin is silky smooth and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just too easy to order it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>but it is a tad strong.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I liked the bath salts in the same line, but I have to say that the scent on this is nice</li>
      <li>For lack of a better term, all I can say about this lotion is that it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh clean scent of this fragrance; I&#x27;d originally purchased it at the Winstar Casino gift shop</li>
      <li>When you first apply it to your skin, the scent is strong.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t pump at all at first - had to take the pump apart and clean it out to get it to work.  </li>

      <li>I found this brand at a very upscale restaurant in my city.</li>
      <li>But it is also high quality lotion that lasts quite a while</li>
      <li>The lotion itself seems high quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I went looking for it but couldn&#x27;t find it near where I live.</li>
      <li>This product has a long lasting smooth aroma and leaves you feeling soft.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is appreciated by anyone I allow close enough to smell it.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this goes on and stays on with no irritation to my skin.</li>
      <li>Great lotion - would have probably given it five stars if not for the fact that the pump doesn&#x27;t work well, and it is very difficult to get lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I find wearing the lotion alone carries the fragrance just enough, especially for work where you want something more subtle.</li>
      <li>and I live in a very dry climate.</li>
      <li>However, after a little while it blends in really well.</li>

    <li> wife was very pleased and the scent was great.</li>
    <li> I found this brand at a very upscale restaurant in my city. My friends and I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling our hands after we washed them in the bathroom. I had to ask the hostess about the brand. She wrote it down for me. I went looking for it but couldn&#x27;t find it near where I live. Amazon to the rescue! This product is amazing. My skin is silky smooth and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. When you first apply it to your skin, the scent is strong. However, after a little while it blends in really well. I don&#x27;t really use perfume anymore since I started using this lotion. The texture and quality of this lotion is amazing. For lack of a better term, all I can say about this lotion is that it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> I love that it came within the same week of ordering it. This product has a long lasting smooth aroma and leaves you feeling soft.</li>

    <li> I love the Jean Baptiste fragrance and this lotion is loaded with scent. But it is also high quality lotion that lasts quite a while and I live in a very dry climate.

    <li> Great product and great consumer support line!</li>
