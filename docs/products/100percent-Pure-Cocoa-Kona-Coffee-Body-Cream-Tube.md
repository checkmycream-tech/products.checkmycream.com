      <li>Moisturizes fine.</li>
      <li>This one has a nice not too intense coffee like smell.</li>

      <li>I just love 100% pure products.</li>
      <li>Its a good moisturizer if you have dry skin.</li>
      <li>look very closely you will see!!</li>
      <li>a  have them fresh.</li>
      <li>So if you want the smell of chocolate and/or a freshly brewed cup of coffee, keep searching for another lotion.</li>

      <li>I use it a lot at work and everyone wants to steal it!</li>
      <li>Left me smelling like a lovely cafe</li>
      <li>Just to be sure, I asked for a second opinion (completely free of my bias) and the answer was the same:  </li>
      <li>This is the first decent priced coffee body cream.</li>
      <li>and it really is a stack of chocolate--</li>
      <li>I always go for the most natural products, but will fall back if the product does not preform well.  </li>
      <li>Imagine our surprise to see part of the label was scribbled out with a black magic marker</li>
      <li>Not as thick as I would have liked but still very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>What a shame for a great product to get such a bad review because someone can&#x27;t tell the difference between magic marker marks and a picture on the label.</li>
      <li>love the smell but doesn&#x27;t last long and for the price</li>
      <li>I use it on my face too and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my very sensitive</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to dr. Bronner lotion which left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It sinks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
      <li>I too initially thought that someone used a black magic marker on the label but LOOK CLOSELY</li>
      <li>This particular shipment was sealed and listed as new, but had no definite coffee or cocoa scent to it.</li>
      <li>I suggest looking elsewhere for a natural body lotion.</li>
      <li>When I found this product, it was a gift, because, it had no chemicals, and all the ingredients are natural.</li>
      <li>Body Shop used to sell a coffee body butter but stopped and the last coffee butter was like $8 for a small drop 15ml and this baby is 8 ounces and is like that old ad for Chock Full of Nuts is the heavenly coffee.</li>
      <li>It really does look like what the other reviewer said, but I noticed the same thing on my package of scrub--same</li>
      <li>I been looking for all natural lotion for a long time.</li>

    <li> 100% Pure lotion is the best! Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry instead you will be obsessed;)</li>
    <li> This is the first decent priced coffee body cream. Body Shop used to sell a coffee body butter but stopped and the last coffee butter was like $8 for a small drop 15ml and this baby is 8 ounces and is like that old ad for Chock Full of Nuts is the heavenly coffee. This is well worth it, smells great and the texture is wonderful too. I love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  I love the fragrance b/c its subtle but not refreshing.  You only need a small amount of this lotion to go a long way!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> While this product contains quality ingredients, it smells like peanut butter and not chocolate or coffee, as I was hoping it would.  (But if you like the smell of peanut butter on your skin, then this product might be the one you want.)  Just to be sure, I asked for a second opinion (completely free of my bias) and the answer was the same:  It smells like peanut butter.  So if you want the smell of chocolate and/or a freshly brewed cup of coffee, keep searching for another lotion. One other thing, the moisturizing potential of this product is good, but Mineral Fusion is better. And the cost of Mineral Fusion is less than this one (no, I don&#x27;t sell Mineral Fusion products, nor am I paid to promote their products). Because it smells like peanuts and it doesn&#x27;t surpass Mineral Fusion in terms of moisture, I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I just love 100% pure products. I use a lot of their creams and body lotions. This one has a nice not too intense coffee like smell. It&#x27;s quite pleasant and discrete. I would totally recommend it. I&#x27;ve also tried other aromas and I like them all so far!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The smell is delicious and not too strong.  The ingredients are truly 100% pure - no parabens or anything else fake.  It sinks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  The best part is how soft and healthy my skin feels!  Amazing!  I use it on my face too and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No packaging blunder! - there is a graphic of stacked chocolate bars that kinda looks like marker marks, not actual marker marks.  All the ingredient, etc. information is there.  What a shame for a great product to get such a bad review because someone can&#x27;t tell the difference between magic marker marks and a picture on the label.</li>
    <li> My new favorite product!  My husband loves the smell and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I use it a lot at work and everyone wants to steal it!</li>
    <li> Has a strong smell which is ok, but the price is high so it is only getting three stars. Seems like you could whip these ingredients in your blender for $3 a  have them fresh.</li>
    <li> love the smell but doesn&#x27;t last long and for the price it&#x27;s not worth it to me</li>
    <li> Great hand cream an nice scent</li>
    <li> So good but, alas, I cannot eat it.</li>
    <li> We ordered this item as a gift.  Imagine our surprise to see part of the label was scribbled out with a black magic marker - what are they hiding?  A \\&quot;Use by date\\&quot;?  A price other than what we paid?  Something written by another customer?  This was tampering with a manufacturer&#x27;s packaging.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as I would have liked but still very moisturizing. Left me smelling like a lovely cafe mocha lol</li>
    <li> This is a review of the product, NOT the seller.  I&#x27;ve been using this body cream for over two years and I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with the texture and scent.  This particular shipment was sealed and listed as new, but had no definite coffee or cocoa scent to it.</li>
    <li> This line is one of the best body products I have ever tried.  The smell is divine!  I fell in love with the body scrub and now added the lotion to my routine.  I want to correct the notion that the label is scribbled out.  I too initially thought that someone used a black magic marker on the label but LOOK CLOSELY you will see that it is not something scribbled out but rather, a photo of a stack of chocolate pieces sitting on coffee beans.  It really does look like what the other reviewer said, but I noticed the same thing on my package of scrub--same photo-- and it really is a stack of chocolate--look very closely you will see!!</li>
    <li> I should work for 100% pure because I&#x27;ve bought so many of their products! I could seriously spend all of my money trying everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is outstanding. It has a coffee/chocolate scent. It&#x27;s a rainy evening and using this lotion after showering is like heaven. It reminds me of warm cupcakes in the oven. It is an extremely pleasant smell without being overpowering or sickening. I&#x27;m not one who loves smelling sweet things all night long, but this is excellent. I can&#x27;t describe the smell well enough but I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s delicious.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  The smell is so delicious.  The lotion is a really nice whipped blend that goes on easily, absorbs great into the skin and just feels smooth and hydrating.  I always go for the most natural products, but will fall back if the product does not preform well.  This is a winner!  PS. The brand has many different lotion blends/smells, so you will surely find a favorite.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes fine. I use it for my hands when the coconut oil alone is not enough. Smells like coffee. I too thought someone had scribbled on the tube like some reviewers have pointed out. Too expensive to buy regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - this also is one where you have to get used to the smell.  If you are a coffee lover, this might keep you up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and creamy and good on your footsies too!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice although made me break out very badly on the shoulders. Wont buy again.  Its a good moisturizer if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this body cream! The scent is great and I love how smooth my skins feels after putting it on!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this body cream!! The scent is intoxicatingly chocolatey, and it moisturizes wonderfully! I only wish they made a larger size! An added bonus of this product is that it contains caffeine, which is a WONDERFUL skin cancer preventative.</li>
    <li> works as it should, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I been looking for all natural lotion for a long time. I used to use dr. Bronner lotions but they were pricy and I was wary of drying effects, due to alcohol content.. When I found this product, it was a gift, because, it had no chemicals, and all the ingredients are natural. This cream is also made as butter, so you only need a little bit of lotion to cover your whole body, which makes this 8 oz tube last a long time. It also smells heavenly and I like that it mixes cocoa and coffee because, I heard that the antioxidant properties are good for the skin for anti-aging and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 22nd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awful, I tried to give it a chance due to the natural ingredients but it ended up leaving a film on my skin and making my skin very greasy. This greasy residue will last for the whole day and can cause your skin to feel nasty all day. I feel like I have to use extra body wash to get this crap off my skin.
