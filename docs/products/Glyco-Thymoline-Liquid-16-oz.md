      <li>and I love the feeling in my mouth after I use it...</li>
      <li>In effort to make my body more alkaline, I bought this mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m really not all that impressed.</li>
      <li>Wow your breath smells great</li>
      <li>After a dental infection, I was happy to use it to rinse my mouth regularly.</li>

      <li>has such great ingredients</li>
      <li>It has been used for a number of health ailments--from sitz baths to fever blisters to sinus problems to douches and many many more---and it really does help.</li>
      <li>This one makes my mouth feel very fresh and clean, it taste just fine and no asthma attack.</li>
      <li>So when you spit it out if any splashes you will own a new stain.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a great deal of success using Glyco-Thymoline in various ways.  </li>
      <li>Leaves clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Glyco got rid of them quickly.  </li>
      <li>Many products seem to help, but actually create more problems.  </li>
      <li>I have used Glyco for years to put a stop to colds, sore throats, bronchitis, etc. -- gargle it 3-4 times a day a the very first symptom.</li>
      <li>Thank you for very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>When I can catch it right away, I apply it full strength on a bandage.  </li>
      <li>An old product, works fabulously!</li>
      <li>My original bottle lasted years; so, I recently had to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>Better than any other breath/mouth refreshing gargle product I have ever tried,  and it lasts way longer.  </li>
      <li>I also put a few drops in a glass of water to help lower my body&#x27;s acidity and make it bit more alkaline to maintain better health.  </li>
      <li>The new formula tastes like a drastically diluted version of the original.</li>
      <li>Was made aware of Glyco-thymoline  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>The cap is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has worked very well for me!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more effective for me than other, vastly cheaper options when it comes to gum swelling or &amp;#34;mucosity,&amp;#34; as they describe it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for the old-school style labeling shows in the image but the actual product comes with a more modern look.</li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth not only fresh but totally clean.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t get any burn or sensation that its really doing anything.</li>
      <li>Very grateful.</li>
      <li>It really helps with sinus drainage, sore throat, or dryness</li>
      <li>Now I have not tested it to see how much I can consume</li>
      <li>My daughter calls Glyco-Thymoline, the \\&quot;magic pink stuff\\&quot;.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves your breath fresh for much longer than regular mouthwash. I don&#x27;t have bad breath issues, but using this I often get remarks Wow your breath smells great, what do you use?  Also, I have allergies and a gargle with this will get rid of early morning throat mucus. I also had infection in my ears due to allergies and carefully used a q tip soaked in glyco and swabbed out my ears before bed. All pain and stuffiness was gone when I woke up.</li>
    <li> Edgar Cayce recommended adding 2 drops of Glyco-Thymoline to a half glass of water and drinking it before going to bed at night.  This will alkalize the system and help prevent colds and flu.  It has worked very well for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a great deal of success using Glyco-Thymoline in various ways.  Here&#x27;s two examples:    Three times per day, I put three drops of Glyco into eight ounces of water.  It seems to give me enough protection against colds and whatever might be floating around the office.  I never seem to get sick, even when my husband brings home a little something extra from his office.      Glyco also works for me with minor burns, like with an iron.  When I can catch it right away, I apply it full strength on a bandage.  When I&#x27;ve done this, the burn is gone by the time I remove the bandage.  Once, I put the bandage on half of the burn just to see if it was really the Glyco at work.  The result was that the portion with the Glyco was just like normal skin -- no pain, redness, or discomfort.  The untreated portion looked like a minor burn, which in this case, was a small, sensitive welt.      More info can be found on here: [...]</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast shipping, five stars...</li>
    <li> Glyco-Thymoline is a great product,  and has many uses and the taste is refreshing!</li>
    <li> goood for my oral health! I will place my second order soon :)</li>
    <li> I think it is better than mouthwashes that are currently on the market.  It tastes better and it&#x27;s more therapeutic for the gums.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  I use a Q-Tip and rub it on my dog&#x27;s gums as well.  I think it helps based on their response to its application.</li>
    <li> So, I just got my first bottle of Glyco-Thymoline in the mail recently and let me just say this s*** is changing my life. Now I have not tested it to see how much I can consume but I currently probably drink about 1/2 half teaspoon per day added to my water throughout the day. I bought it to help heal my psoriasis which it seems to be helping but here are some other ways I have used it:&lt;br /&gt;- Healing my sore throat. I had had a terrible sore throat on and off for about two weeks that was really annoying me. I add some glyco thymoline to a couple cups of water and now the sore throat is gone.&lt;br /&gt;- Dabbing on psoriatic lesions. This is so soothing and calming my skin loves it. The lesions gets soft and moist and stop flaking. Due to other efforts most of my psoriasis is already gone but I feel like this a final kicker to show psoriasis who the real boss of my body is.&lt;br /&gt;- I have not used it for mouthwash. It just seems like a waste to use this miracle fluid on something as trivial as a mouthwash but it is such a low price that maybe I should. A couple drops splashed on the counter today and I literally dabbed that up and applied it to my skin it before it could evaporate or get wiped up. Waste not, want not. Anyways...I love this stuff</li>
    <li> My mother (85) was raised with Glyo-Thymoline being used to treat minor wounds and sun burns; so of coarse our mother raised us with the same treatment.  My four sisters and I have used this product for years, with good success.  It is no longer sold in our local stores, so I had to search the internet to find some.  It lasts a long time; just soak a cotton ball with glyco and gently apply where needed.  Just keep in mind it is not a sterile product and not for use on open wounds or serious blistered sun burns.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing! Such a fresh, clean feeling after using it, not strong or astringent. Have not tried the other uses for it listed on the box, but we will be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> A little bit does reduce make my pH more alkaline. It kinda tastes like nutrisweet/ other non sugar sweeteners which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this pricey, well-rated mouthwash. Sadly, I&#x27;m disappointed on just about every level. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more effective for me than other, vastly cheaper options when it comes to gum swelling or &amp;#34;mucosity,&amp;#34; as they describe it. As far as controlling bad breath, I find that it does a far worse job than just about everything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker for me is the taste. While in the process of swishing and gargling, it doesn&#x27;t taste terrible, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it pleasant. Then comes the aftertaste. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but I get an aftertaste that I can only describe as a fish in a cedar tree. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mouthwashes (Botot, Closys, TheraBreath, Periowash, and all of the standard pharmacy varieties), and none of them have ever had me reaching for a different mouthwash just to get the taste out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pass for me.</li>
    <li> I had a senior citizen tell me about this \\&quot;mouthwash\\&quot;.  It has been used for a number of health ailments--from sitz baths to fever blisters to sinus problems to douches and many many more---and it really does help.</li>
    <li> This is the best of the best for everything that can cause illness! Use it everyday. I have been using the product for a long time and recently ran out of it. I started getting sore throat problems, congestion and other problems. That is why I reordered through AMAZON and got a great price and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last month looking at some of the reviews. I think this is the best investment i had recently. We have a family member with recurrent sore throat/ strep issues. Its so severe we have been to urgent care several time in last couple of years.  Glyco has been savior in last few weeks no strep throat etc. But during the research i realized sometimes strep and psoriasis flare up go together. With this we have been seeing some reduction psoriasis flareup too.  So we do gargle with 25%-50% Glyco and water before going to bed and its just has amazing effect. Some one has recommended drinking it with lot of water will try that in future.</li>
    <li> The Edgar Cayce spiritual source advised the use of this mouthwash many decades ago, and I even add a few drops to my toothpaste whenever I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Was made aware of Glyco-thymoline  By reading Edgar Casey, and the many uses of this wash. Unfortunately, used on a regular bases it is expensive. It s the best freshening solution I have ever used.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic for a fresh-mouth feel you won&#x27;t get from regular, commercial mouthwashes.  And it&#x27;s healthy !</li>
    <li> This product leaves your breath smelling clean and fresh and I drink a half glass of water with a couple of drops everyday for acidity. My husband says it smells like medicine breath but I like it. LOL</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash from the recomendation by Edgar Cayce in his readings. I use this as a mouthwash daily as well as in my water I drink a few drops mixed in to cleanse the body and restore ph balance. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my Naturpathic Dr. and it works wonderful.  My periodontist was amazed at how much better my gum health was.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Edgar Cayce recommended this as a feminine douche. After a dental infection, I was happy to use it to rinse my mouth regularly. A pleasant effect both ways.</li>
    <li> An old product, works fabulously! Used this for many purposes that aren&#x27;t on the label. Soothing to the throat&lt;br /&gt;and clears up cough, dry throat and helps get rid of a cold very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product was taped shut with shippers tape.  It tastes like somebody made it in their basement.  It is awefull.  This is not a Kress &amp; Owen product.</li>
    <li> My daughter calls Glyco-Thymoline, the \\&quot;magic pink stuff\\&quot;.  :o)  It heals sore throats in just a few hours after gargling.  It is amazingly wonderful.  :o)  :o)</li>
    <li> As a Glyco-Thymoline advocate since my first exposure in the 1970&#x27;s, I am really disappointed. A holistic mainstay has met it&#x27;s demise.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and delivered on time. The shipping price was a bit high.</li>
    <li> Terrific product but am now getting the clear without the red coloring.  Great to prevent canker sores and all gum issues</li>
    <li> This mouthwash doubles as an alkaline based antiseptic. It does as good job of both and helps neutralize our otherwise acidic body chemistry. It can stain fabrics and surfaces red so wash it off anything it gets on quickly.</li>
    <li> Say aaah...this medicine smelly mouthwash is just what the doctor ordered...reminds me of Lavoris when I was a kid without the biting cinnamon.</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband because he has excessive saliva and this mouthwash was supposed to help.  well, it does when he remembers to use it</li>
    <li> Whenever I feel like I might be getting sick, I start gargling/rinsing with this 1-2 times a day. It really helps with sinus drainage, sore throat, or dryness and I swear it shortens or delays the cold as well. The taste isn&#x27;t terrible and leaves your breath fresh. I couldn&#x27;t find this at my local health food store so was very happy to see it on Amazon for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I had read that the traditional mouthwash could cause high blood pressure so I switched to this one and I was amazed.  I wear Dentures and have had problems with tiny ulcerations around them.  Glyco got rid of them quickly.  I almost never have a problem with it anymore and an extra dose of Glyco takes care of the problem.  Last week my Son and I had a vaca planned and he bean having problems with an area that was irritated on his gum.  HE WENT TO THE Dentist and she said he needed to see a specialist about a possible root canal because of it.  I suggested he borrow my Glyco and that took care of the problem for good in a couple of days.  Now he uses it daily.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is amazing!  So I had a 3rd degree burn from scalding myself.  I went to Kaiser, they gave me a messy and disgusting salve to put on the wound.  After 36 hours of using the drug and seeing no improvement at all, not to mention the mess, I dumped the prescription drug and just started using compresses of Glycothymoline on the burned area.  Within 24 hours of Glyco, there was noticeable improvement in the wound.  It was healed, completely, about 4 days later.  AND, I do not have any scar from the burn.  I use this, not for a mouthwash, but for wound care for anything - open blisters, cuts, scrapes, kanker sores, chapped skin - it is a miraculous product.  I swear by this stuff.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I use this mouthwash whenever I get any sore spots in my mouth.  It changes the pH of your mouth and germs (fungi, viruses and bacteria) have a hard time thriving.  I usually get healing in 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth not only fresh but totally clean. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Kress &amp; Owen product for over 4 years and I can definitely attest to the fact that the company has changed the formula. the new formula is far less potent than the old one. I still had an old bottle with a little left and the smell and taste test comparison between the old and new versions really surprised and disappointed me. The new formula tastes like a drastically diluted version of the original. I will complain to the company and hope others who notice a difference do the same. Also, if anyone knows of another company producing the correct formula, please let me know, as I will not order from Kress &amp; Owen again unless they revert back to their old formula.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has helped greatly to remove calculus from my teeth.  I alternate between this and lysterine which I believe is what Edgar Cayce mentioned in one of his readings.  However some people mention drinking this stuff.  I drank Glyco once about 5-10 drops to 16 ounces of water and my stomach hated it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. Much more than a mouthwash.. Perfect transaction also</li>
    <li> I love this.  I mostly use it as a mouthwash and just started adding a few drops to my water as an alkalizer. My original bottle lasted years; so, I recently had to purchase more.  i have not opened the new bottle yet; so, I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to test the alleged new formula mentioned in other posts.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mouth rinse and has been a staple in many homes for many years. I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed. it smells the same to me now as it did when I was five. Someone asked about diluting. I think 1 capful per small glass is sufficient. The cap is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only aggravation is not about the product but about shipping fee. I think only one vendor sells Glyco and their shipping fee was o u t r a g e o u s. Just be aware this item likely isn&#x27;t Prime eligible if you order. For the fee paid I expected a male stripper to pop out of the box.</li>
    <li> It is an interesting taste.  I like that it is natural.  Thank you for very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I recently attend the Wellness Spa at Edgar Cayce&#x27;s Foundation and learned of this product.</li>
    <li> very good mouthwash. i use it for sinus stuffiness. dip it on a swab and put in each nostril. dries up mucous.</li>
    <li> This is the old fashioned, inexpensive mouthwash that really freshens and does not burn</li>
    <li> I used it for a whole 2 weeks and it was gone.  My gums started swelling like I wasn&#x27;t using anything.</li>
    <li> Finally. I have asthma and other mouthwash products were so strong I would have an asthma attack using them. Not sure if it was the alcohol or mint content or both. This one makes my mouth feel very fresh and clean, it taste just fine and no asthma attack. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The best product ever!! Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the old-school style labeling shows in the image but the actual product comes with a more modern look. I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot but I&#x27;m really not all that impressed. I guess it does its job but I really don&#x27;t get any burn or sensation that its really doing anything. The taste isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Great stuff referenced in the Edgar Cayce materials.</li>
    <li> This item wound up costing me $15 by the time I paid shipping and handling. It is recommended in some of the Cayce info I&#x27;ve collected for the repair of an irritated throat and coughing....first of all, it&#x27;s the worst tasting stuff you&#x27;ve had in a while...however, we&#x27;ll live with the taste if it works...still waiting to see positive results.</li>
    <li> interesting taste.  think it does the job.</li>
    <li> if you like the vintage style bottle, don&#x27;t order this because it doesn&#x27;t come in a bottle that looks like the one in the picture!!!! it comes in a really ugly new bottle with a horrible design. i ordered this for a visual project and was really really disappointed.  they need to update the picture to show what the bottle actually looks like because it looks NOTHING like that picture.  i&#x27;m returning it asap.</li>
    <li> will stain a shirt if you get it on it. So when you spit it out if any splashes you will own a new stain.</li>
    <li> I have bad gums and I am using this for gingivitis it seems to be working , really after 50 everyone needs to gargle as well as brush your teeth</li>
    <li> In effort to make my body more alkaline, I bought this mouthwash.  It is good but when I use it too much I get a canker sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is interesting....  I had an allergy shot years ago and sometimes my arm swells in that spot.  When it does, I apply Glyco and it clears up within 30 minutes.  Before Glyco I would have to suffer the whole night itching and watching the spot swell.</li>
    <li> My box said,, follow instructions in the box,, no instuctions were in the box.. I did try the mouth rinse, but do not know what to dilute it to,, so I guessed,,, I really do like product,,but I would really like the instructions,,</li>
    <li> Works better than any other mouthwash</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and I feel safer using it in my mouth than all the new chemical-laden products.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the service and prompt delivery. I will order from the company again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Discovered it while reading Edgar Cayce&#x27;s works.  I love it!</li>
    <li> A high quality, well priced product made by a small but strong company in business for over 100 years, right here in the USA, and you don&#x27;t have to go any farther for it than your mail box? How do you beat that? No, I don&#x27;t own stock in the company. I wish I did!</li>
    <li> I found this stuff in an Edgar casey health manual, so I had high expectations.  It did not let me down!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> The taste of his mouthwash was terrible. It was a bad mix of cough syrup and chemical mint. I couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth all morning! Plus, the bright pink color was hard to get out of my sink.</li>
    <li> Who could go wrong with this product??? Been around for years and holds up to its name and you know you can always count on it....has such great ingredients and I love the feeling in my mouth after I use it...I have bleeding gums and not one to rush to the dentist so I feel I am doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; to help combat this issue....yes, I know I should sit in a dentist chair from time to time, and I will, but in the meantime I will freshen my mouth with this product and know it is riding the body of a lot of nasty  germs and giving me better health...</li>
    <li> Glyco Thymoline is one of those old time products that&#x27;s been around for over a century and just plain works.  It&#x27;s perfect for a mouthwash and keeps your gums healthy and really helps a sore throat too.  I also like that it&#x27;s very low in alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your mouth.  I also put a few drops in a glass of water to help lower my body&#x27;s acidity and make it bit more alkaline to maintain better health.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores so I mail order it as I find it a necessity in my house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 30 years and it has always worked better than any other product for soothing a sore throat or sinus congestion.  Many products seem to help, but actually create more problems.  Glyco Thymoline is free of irritants that make that happen.  I would recommend this to anyone frustrated with other mouth washes..</li>
    <li> I have used Glyco for years to put a stop to colds, sore throats, bronchitis, etc. -- gargle it 3-4 times a day a the very first symptom. This is, I believe, an Edgar Cayce formula and it has stood the test of time for natural healing.</li>
    <li> Better than any other breath/mouth refreshing gargle product I have ever tried,  and it lasts way longer.  It even clenas up your tonge better than other products.  Totally awesome!</li>
    <li> Like it! Leaves clean feeling. Wish it was easier to purchase locally.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.</li>
    <li> It is what was expected, I&#x27;ve used it before.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d learned about this years ago!  It is the ONLY thing that works for my husbands eczema, and believe me we&#x27;ve tried it all.  Instant relief from the intense itching and began healing the skin right away, when even prescription drugs did not work.</li>
    <li> The product arrived a little late, but none the less, in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This is an Edgar Cayce cure.  I use it as a mouthwash, dilute with water and use as eye wash.  If I get a chest cold I soak a cloth in 1/2 water and 1/2 glycothymoline, wring it out and put on my chest and alternate hot and cold packs.  Glycothymoline gets things moving.</li>
    <li> When I feel that I am more acidic than usually i gargle and rinse my mouth with this product. I feel confident that it does what it says it does. Also, if I feel a sore throat coming on I gargle with it. So far I have been lucky in not obtaining a worse case sore throat.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mouthwash and gargle even good for your sore throught I love it, good taste and healthy choise!</li>
    <li> I have been using \\&quot;Glyco\\&quot; for about 25 years and it&#x27;s the best thing for colds/sore throats as well as skin irritations, dental health, etc.  I just got a new order of it and noticed the packaging has been redesigned but it also appears that the formula has been changed.  The alcohol content has been reduced slightly and fir needle oil has replaced the pine oil.  In the context of the Edgar Cayce readings this is a big red flag, as the formulas given in the readings were precise and even a slight deviation would result in them not working or even making things worse.  I&#x27;ve e-mailed Kress and Owen asking about the formula change and am awaiting their reply.  Perhaps if others did the same (admin@glyco-thymoline.net) we might get some clarity on this.</li>
    <li> I do not like the taste of regular mouthwash.  Glyco is much better tasting and has safer ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller fast shipper will recommend and do business with seller any time A+++. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Love this . Very grateful. Thank you. Arrived in a timely manner.  Thank You! LouAnn Singer&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Besides being an excellent mouthwash it has anti viral properties as recommended by Edgar Cayce. Wonderful if you have cold sores in your mouth.</li>
    <li> It has workiled wonders!  I will purchase again!</li>
