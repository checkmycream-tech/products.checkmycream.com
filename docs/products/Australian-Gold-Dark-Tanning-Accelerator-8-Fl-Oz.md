    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see much difference with or without it.  It did keep my skin moist but at a heck of a high price for what you can accomplish with baby oil at a much lower price.  Baby oil greases the bed up but if you clean it good everything is OK.....</li>
    <li> Perfect smelling lotion and leaves my skin soft and smooth. Works good!</li>
    <li> Useless. didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Its perfect for your tang! I love it</li>
    <li> when I used this I keep a real good tan after I used this I tried some other and it didn&#x27;t work so have ordered this again and prob will again it works and smells pleasant</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great and makes your skin soft.</li>
    <li> This tan accelerator is alright. The smell of it throws me off a little bit, it smells like I&#x27;m coating myself in bubble gum. It goes on smoothly but I did notice that every time I use it I get EXTREMELY burnt, as compared to when I don&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m fair skinned so I suppose that is to be expected but man do I get red.</li>
    <li> Trust me I&#x27;ve tried many lotions. For the price, it definitely does the job, any of the &amp;#34;Australian Gold&amp;#34; products.  This tanning accelerator is one I use often, you actually see results. The best price is on amazon...don&#x27;t spend the prices the salon charges :)</li>
    <li> Had bought this at a local store where I live and they discontinued it. Found it on Amazona. I love the way it softens my skin and gives it a glow.</li>
    <li> According to my wife, this stuff is amazing and gives a more natural looking tan. It&#x27;s not for quick dark tanning. Smells good. Does not stain clothes. And cannot be found in drug stores any more.</li>
    <li> Fast ship and much better than spray</li>
    <li> Great product,great price,and fast shipping.Everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in 2 days and within a week I had a tan without any lines. Great lotion and gives a quick tan to areas that usually don&#x27;t get tanned.</li>
    <li> Great lotion to start!  Works great! Smells SOOO GOOD!!!  LOVE Australian Gold!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion as a skin moisturizer.  Smells very nice and feels very nice on the skin.  Have not found a product by Australian Gold that I did not like.  The product shipped from the seller quickly although the item was damaged in transit.  Upon contacting the seller a new bottle was mailed and received.  The seller resolved all of the shipping/damage issues promptly.</li>
    <li> Great product with a good price. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I love this accelerator, I have a beautiful tan all summer, makeup get put away, you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. Never saw this before in a regular store.  Been using it so much this summer I already bought a second bottle.  I&#x27;m hooked for life</li>
    <li> Odor mild and nice. Makes skin very supple. This was my 6th bottle! I will continue to buy. Very natural tan</li>
    <li> Xtra nice tanning lotion .Color true to what It says It does.Have always used Australian Gold and got the color I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this above the others</li>
