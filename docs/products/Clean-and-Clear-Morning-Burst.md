      <li>All it does is turn my face bright red and makes it hurt through out the day.</li>
      <li>makes my face feel cool in the mornings</li>

      <li>Feels so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Nice scrub, not too harsh on face - smells nice.</li>
      <li>I sometimes switch up between the yellow and orange, which to be honest</li>
      <li>I just like the \\&quot;fresh face\\&quot; feeling it gives you when you take it off</li>
      <li>Keeps my face feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>It contains caffein and brings a fresh smell to awake me in the morning.</li>
      <li>I do prefer the orange kind of this facewash, as I found it smelled less strongly.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that breaks out consistenly (though not badly), and most drugstore facial cleansers just don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and clean (no raccoon eyes)!</li>
      <li>The soap is pretty mild - I rub pretty vigorously, taking no care to protect my eyes, and I never have any issues with it burning.</li>
      <li>my face looks normal, but in the morning my face looks so fresh!  </li>
      <li>Also, it really does brighten my skin!  </li>
      <li>Gently exfoliates (sometimes I wish it were more gritty) and feels tingly and fresh after.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with this facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>I definitely feel more awake each time I use this product...</li>
      <li>;)    </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I am obsessed with this, clean and clear has very good products!</li>
      <li>Clean and Clear</li>
      <li>AGAIN, DO NOT BUY CLEAN AND CLEAR PRODUCTS</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but just be careful not to use it everyday an especially in one area alone, such as your face, put on your neck and face or whole body, if not you will look like a light bulb lol</li>
      <li>but it let your skin super soft and smells magnific</li>
      <li>but this one is my new fave!!</li>
      <li>and my face obviously isn&#x27;t ace free already</li>
      <li>This burns and absolutely does nothing for my skin.</li>
      <li>It cleans with a gentle exfoliant.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
      <li>or it doesn&#x27;t cleanse very well at all.  </li>
      <li>In this case this is really helpful.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s strong enough to exfoliate and clear out my pores.   </li>
      <li>cuz i feel sometimes you get a little bit of redness in the top of the cheeks maybe.</li>
      <li>Maybe, but I definitely prefer the Clean and Clear Continuous Control.</li>
      <li>Love it and been using it everyday .</li>
      <li>I started using this, and my skin is almost completely cleared up!</li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst has been part of my daily facial routine for 10 years now.</li>
      <li>I was not able to find much in terms of a cheaper alternative until Clean and Clears Gel line.</li>
      <li>Does it clear up your acne?</li>
      <li>and you have sensitive skin like mine</li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s still too early to say, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any flare ups.</li>
      <li>Does it make your skin soft?</li>
      <li>: Yes, really soft.    </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I guess this is because i have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is due to the placebo effect and how much is actually from the scrub, but it I still love this product!  </li>
      <li>and I do mean bright side, the formula seemed to fade my scarring a little bit.</li>
      <li>Both works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
      <li>I put a medicated facial lotion after I apply facial scrub and the results are promising</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t scrub on my face really hard and is light on my eyes too just in case it goes</li>
      <li>For someone with not very oily skin, it is very drying.</li>
      <li>I had this product last year and it works to clear your skin, meaning it will make your complexion a whole other shade brighter.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine except the tube was half empty!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Kept my skin looking ckean and clear I will always use this product clean and clear have the best products</li>
    <li> This burns and absolutely does nothing for my skin. All it does is turn my face bright red and makes it hurt through out the day. The redness doesn&#x27;t go away and I look like I&#x27;ve been sun burnt. Not a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product if it works for you but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This product works for me especially after shaving   I put a medicated facial lotion after I apply facial scrub and the results are promising</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to make this short and to the point.    Consistency: Watery/gel-like.  Smell: FANTASTIC. A mixture of citrusy and sweet.    Does it brighten your skin?: Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference.    Does it make your skin soft?: Yes, really soft.    Does it clear up your acne?: It&#x27;s still too early to say, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any flare ups. Clean and Clear never lets me down though. ;)    And finally, will I buy this again?: Maybe, but I definitely prefer the Clean and Clear Continuous Control. I just like the \\&quot;fresh face\\&quot; feeling it gives you when you take it off, this one doesn&#x27;t do that.    **AGAIN, DO NOT BUY CLEAN AND CLEAR PRODUCTS IF YOU HAVE REALLY DRY OR SENSITIVE SKIN, YOUR SKIN WILL HATE YOU FOR IT. Look for something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> So effective for the money</li>
    <li> I may have to put this on auto reorder. It cleans with a gentle exfoliant. It has a wonderful citrusy scnet that is a nice eye-opener in the morning. It leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that breaks out consistenly (though not badly), and most drugstore facial cleansers just don&#x27;t cut it.  Either it&#x27;s too harsh and dries out my skin or it doesn&#x27;t cleanse very well at all.  I saw this in target and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially since it claimed to brighten your skin.  Well, I&#x27;ve used this for 3 months now in disgusting humidity, and my skin is better than ever.  I use it in the morning and an exfoliating scrub at night (the beads just don&#x27;t cut it).  Also, it really does brighten my skin!  Not permanently, by mid afternoon my face looks normal, but in the morning my face looks so fresh!  Overall it&#x27;s a great product for the price and my favorite drugstore cleanser.</li>
    <li> Scent is wonderful, didn&#x27;t keep me breakout free though, had to switch back to continuos control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy they finally came out with a face wash that has is lemon based!! The citrus is really helpful!!! I just used this and my face obviously isn&#x27;t ace free already but it does look much better. All the redness is gone ;) I am defiantly sticking with this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Love how it exfoliates my skin! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for any skin. Feels so clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I found Morning Burst, as it&#x27;s the thing that has cleared up my skin. I&#x27;ve been struggling with fairly mild but annoying acne for several years. I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and washes. Some, like St. Ives, were too harsh. I actually found that medicated ones made my skin worse. I started using this, and my skin is almost completely cleared up! The beads aren&#x27;t too harsh and the formula is mild, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. However, it&#x27;s strong enough to exfoliate and clear out my pores.   I have combination skin that is dry but oily in the T-zone. I&#x27;ve also had luck with Aveeno face wash. I do prefer the orange kind of this facewash, as I found it smelled less strongly. This was not an unpleasant scent, I just prefer a lighter one.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this facial scrub.  I definitely feel more awake each time I use this product...I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is due to the placebo effect and how much is actually from the scrub, but it I still love this product!  The smell is very light and refreshing...I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have oily skin and sensitive skin and sometimes i just dont match with all products. In this case this is really helpful. I dont use it all mornings cuz i feel sometimes you get a little bit of redness in the top of the cheeks maybe. I guess this is because i have sensitive skin but it let your skin super soft and smells magnific</li>
    <li> Love it and been using it everyday . This has substituted my generic soap that was used for my face.</li>
    <li> It contains caffein and brings a fresh smell to awake me in the morning. I love the smooth feeling on my skin after using it.</li>
    <li> This is srtictly OK product. I find it fine. yes it cleanses your face but not that good. Smell of the scrubber is nice.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of review about how good this was but honestly once I used a bottle of it I seen no results at and you have sensitive skin like mine then don&#x27;t use because before I used this all my acne was gone but once I started using this my started breaking out and my acne came back I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m dark skin so if your that don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this.</li>
    <li> I use to use a lot of Biotherm and it was definitely more expensive. I like the products due to quality of the product lines, but the price always took me back. I was not able to find much in terms of a cheaper alternative until Clean and Clears Gel line. I use this one and the other blue colored one. Both works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I also use the gel hydration from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleaner does give you a tingly feeling. The PRICE is SO cheap for what it&#x27;s offering. I still use an imported gel sunscreen, so hope they come up with one soon.</li>
    <li> I finished a bottle in 1 week. I didn&#x27;t notice a brightening effect on my skin. But scent was pleasant and citrusy.</li>
    <li> good product, fash shipping, happy customer :)</li>
    <li> makes my face feel cool in the mornings</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from bad acne so I don&#x27;t use anything but this on my face when I wash it, it&#x27;s light so it doesn&#x27;t scrub on my face really hard and is light on my eyes too just in case it goes it goes into my eyes. I love the original morning burst but this one is my new fave!! It leaves my skin soft and clean (no raccoon eyes)!</li>
    <li> I had this product last year and it works to clear your skin, meaning it will make your complexion a whole other shade brighter. It&#x27;s a good product, but just be careful not to use it everyday an especially in one area alone, such as your face, put on your neck and face or whole body, if not you will look like a light bulb lol</li>
    <li> I got this...and it was totally used looking....with half the bottle missing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst has been part of my daily facial routine for 10 years now. I sometimes switch up between the yellow and orange, which to be honest I see no noticeable difference between. I like the beads which really make me feel like my face is getting a good scrub. The soap is pretty mild - I rub pretty vigorously, taking no care to protect my eyes, and I never have any issues with it burning. Follow this up with a nice light day cream and your skin is set to glow for the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> For someone with not very oily skin, it is very drying. I need to later on the moisturizer after, or else my makeup will look cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the brightside, and I do mean bright side, the formula seemed to fade my scarring a little bit. It was probably the lemon beads, since lemon peel is know to even out skin tone. It has a lovely lemon scent, that smells sweet and doesn&#x27;t border on a lysol chemical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go for a medicated acne scrub that will also even the skin tone, while fighting acne at the same time. Not repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine except the tube was half empty!! Very disappointing!!  I have this on re-order, if my 2nd shipment is the same I will be cancelling my subscription.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it would be receiving 5 stars if I had not just received a half-full product. Not sure if that&#x27;s the intent, but I&#x27;m 99% sure that I received less than 5 oz of product, which totally sucks :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 4/5</li>
    <li> Good as a cleanser. Feels like it gets my skin very clean and the smell is wonderful and invigorating. It definitely wakes me up and leaves my skin glowing. The only downside to this product is that it leaves my skin feeling a little dry when I rinse it off but I just use a moisturizer to combat that.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this, clean and clear has very good products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this product and I have purchased this multiple times. Keeps my face feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Comes out like liquid even when I shake it-not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> Feels great and is refreshing on your face. Gently exfoliates (sometimes I wish it were more gritty) and feels tingly and fresh after. I wish it was paraben and sulfate free though.</li>
    <li> Nice scrub, not too harsh on face - smells nice.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. I brought it because of other reviewers that used it to brighten their skin. My skin is gets dull during the winter and I wanted something that would brighten my skin a little so I bought this and it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. It cleanse the skin and it smells good but it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted. It might work for others but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
